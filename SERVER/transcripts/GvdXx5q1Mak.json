  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good enlighting this day is so bright as the first start always the night with family around the nice meal we're making duan i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love in islam we're still discussing the chapter that deals with fasting from the book below and by al-hafiz may allah have mercy on his soul in our program virtues of fasting and we have hadith number 32 the hadith of abu sayyad allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam said no servant of allah fasts on a day merely or for the sake of allah except that allah pushes the hell fire 70 years further away from his face due to fasting on this day and this hadith was agreed upon in this hadith the prophet islam is highlighting to us the importance of fasting and without any doubt that fasting is one of the great deeds that gets a person closer to allah azza and in the hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi told us that all deeds are for the individual himself as in the hadith allah says accept fasting this is for him for for me allah says and i reward upon it now the hadith says that whoever fasts a day any servant of allah and we're all servants of allah of course whether we're muslims or non-muslims we are all servants of allah but allah accepts only from the muslims whoever fasts a day and the word fisabilillah our scholars differed in interpreting it as you've read in the translation the translator translated into for the sake of allah so whoever fast for the sake of allah allah will do such and such for him but this is not the correct translation because if someone fasts for other than the sake of allah allah would not accept that from him let alone reward him by furthering his face 70 years away from hellfire therefore fisabilillah could only be interpreted to in the cause of allah meaning in jihad and jihad is the islamic world a word for struggling and you can use this word for fighting your own whims and desires fighting satan fighting the hypocrites fighting the sinners and fighting the disbelievers and each group has its own weaponry to use while fighting so you don't fight yourself with a cannon or an ak-47 you don't fight satan with rockets you don't fight the hypocrites with weapons but rather you fight them with literature with evidences from the quran with exposing their plots so jihad is a vast word that has a beautiful meanings to it now the prophet is indicating alisosam the virtues of fasting while in bat in the battlefield or while being on your post anticipating the attacks of the enemies of islam if you fast then allah azza would reward you this reward and this is conditional as scholars say because if fasting weakens an individual and would hinder his ability to fight in the cause of allah azza in this case he has to break his fast as this was exactly what had happened with the prophet israel and his companions when he went for the conquest of mecca and that was on the eighth year of al-hijrah in ramadan so he ordered them to break their fast because this is stronger for them and they did and they complied so if it does not hinder your strength and your ability to fight then fasting has this great reward from allah azzawajal and what is this reward allah subhanahu ta'ala would reward an individual by furthering his face 70 years in the hadith 70 autumns and 70 folds this is one of the four seasons of the year which indicates that's 40 um 70 years but is it only his face that would be further away from hellfire dancers definitely not when phase is used then the rest is also meant in the hadith so the whole body would be further away from hellfire the distance of 70 years of traveling which means that allah azza would save that individual from even getting close to hell fire and by far this is one of the greatest rewards of fasting for the cause of allah and it highlights also the importance of fighting in the cause of allah and that it is the peak of islam and it is the peak of the religion of allah azzawajal to fight for the cause of allah not to have blood bloodshed not to kill people but rather to defend the religion of allah and to help spread the word of allah moving on to hadith number 33 this hadith was narrated by isha may allah be pleased with her aisha says that the prophet of allah used to fast until one would say he never breaks his fast that is he never stops fasting and he would abandon fasting at other times until one would say that he never fasts and i never saw the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam fast for a complete month except for the month of ramadan and i never saw him fast in a month more than he did in the month of sha'ban and this hadith was agreed upon in this hadith mother ishmael we please with her is highlighting to us how our prophet allah used to fast voluntary fastings and that would utilize his time so we know that the prophet sallam was consistent and we know that the prophet said alayhi salatu salam that the most preferred and beloved deeds to allah are those that are consistent even if they are little so if you recite one jesus every day and you continue to do this to the rest of your life this is better than reciting for example 10 jews a day for a week and then abandoning reciting the quran altogether so little but consistent is very beloved to allah azza however the prophet allah is unlike us there is so much on his plate sallallahu alaihi sallam because he's a ruler of the islamic state the real islamic state that is and he is the ruler of the congregation so he judges their problems and he gives them verdicts in regards to their cases he also teaches them and he has to read the prayer so there are so many things and tasks he has to do sallallahu alaihi sallam therefore he is not like us and that is that means that he utilizes his time in accordance to the circumstances so for example if he was free and at the same time he had the energy he would fast without end sometimes he may make wasall he continues day and night to fast for two three days without any problem sometimes he fasts for a whole week a couple of weeks until ishmael please with her says we talked among ourselves that he never breaks his fast but when he is busy either by traveling or by work that he has to do or by things that occupy his mind and he does not have the ability to fast he would break fasting until aisha allah pleased with her says that we tell ourselves that he doesn't fast anymore and this is the best thing to do is to try your level best to utilize your time to utilize your energy so it is pointless to sit and recite the quran though you don't feel like reciting the quran oh you're telling us that we shouldn't recite the quran yes if you're not feeling good about it if you're not enthusiastic about it if you don't have the energy to do so don't recite the quran do something else so when we say that do whatever is best for your heart of course within the islamic boundaries this is one of the best statements ever so if i recite the quran and after half an hour i feel sleepy and i start to yawn and i get shaytan's whispers that i'm i want to sleep i want to lie down what to do close the quran do something else start praying if you pray for raka's night prayer for example and then you feel a little bit dull or that you're not so enthusiastic go to the kitchen and prepare some black dark coffee and drink it and then resume doing something read a book of hadith do something that's useful answer some emails that are related to whatever pleases allah do something that you find your heart in rather than forcing yourself to do something though it is a form of worship but you're not finding your heart in it so the issue of balance is quite important and the prophet alaihis salatu used to fast mondays and thursdays as we've discussed this before and he used to fast so many uh voluntary days but always remember that there are certain times that he would not do these things out of the fear that allah would obligate them upon his ummah so he sometimes leaves deeds that he loves as mother aisha and other companions said may allah be pleased with them he would leave and abandon deeds that he loves of course voluntary so that it would not become a burden on his ummah and his followers for example the prophet said ali had i not fear that i would burden my ummah i would have ordered them to perform siwak with every prayer another narration with every wuddle so this is something that is highly recommended that you brush your teeth when you perform mudu when you go to pray to the extent that the prophet was this close to order his ummah to do it as an obligation but he did not want to burden his um and in the hadith mother aisha tells us that the prophet saw did never completed a full month through fasting except ramadan and ramadan is mandatory and the most month of the whole year after ramadan that the prophet used to fast alain salatu was shaban so what's the ruling on fasting shaban the full month scholars differed some said well the prophet didn't do it we shouldn't do it meaning that fast 28 days of shabbat 27 days of shabbat others say no the prophet recommended fasting so we should do this and the most authentic opinion is that one should not fast the whole month of sha ban if it is in voluntary days meaning that he's not fasting an expiation he's not fasting uh an oath or a vow and he's not fast making up for missed days of ramadan he shouldn't fast the whole thing because you remember at the very beginning the prophet said ali and forbade us from preceding ramadan by fasting a day or two before ramadan so this was a prohibition from the prophet except for those who had fixed days to fast such as mondays and thursdays other than that one should not fast the full month of sha ban fast as as many days as possible but not the whole month what about fasting the month of muharram because the prophet used to alice islam encourage us to fast muharram by saying that the best month to fast after ramadan is muharram so which one is better to fast muharram or to fast char scholars differed and the most authentic opinion is that shaban to fast it is better than fasting the days of muharram why because sha'ban is considered and looked at as if it is the sunnah of prayers you know her prayer with ramadan it is similar we have fasting of shaban before it and we have six days of shawwal after it so scholars say that such sunnahs that are related to mandatory and obligatory uh worships are stronger than the general sunnahs that you are requested to pray so when we look at night prayer it's very highly recommended and it is one of the best prayers of the day after the mandatory prayers however which is best night prayers or the turakas of fajr without any doubt the turak has a fajr why because it's related to fajr it's related to a mandatory prayer and you can say this with so many things what is best to fast days of muharram or to fast the day of arafah definitely the day of arafah is better because it is related to it is related to the forms of worship and ritual and hence it has greater reward as well and allah azza knows best moving on to the following hadith hadith number 34 abu dharr may allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam commanded us to fast for three days of every month that is on the day of the full moon the 13th 14th and the 15th of the lunar month in this hadith the prophet salaam as we are told ordered us so usually when we hear the word ordered or when the prophet says assam fast this is an order or pray this is an order means it's an obligation but the consensus of scholars is that this is not an obligation one would say why well it's very simple because allah azza did not mandate allah did not oblige us too fast except ramadan so the these three days are not part of ramadan and hence they are voluntary so the prophet's order here alai is a recommendation he's encouraging us to do so and these three days are known as the white days and they are the 13th the 14th and the 15th of every lunar month and by the way in islam we only depend and rely and use the lunar month why because this is the islamic calendar first of all second of all it is for anyone to detect and know what day we're in and when the month is over and when the month begins unlike the gregorian calendar where no one on earth could do this except a handful of people with special calculations and it's chaos no one going into exile or or being stranded on an island would be able to know which date it is in the gregorian calendar but in the lunar month yes you can tell that the month is over now this is a new month and every month this takes place on and on again so in islam we only depend on the lunar months and why are they called the white days scholars say that on 13th 14th and the 15th you have the full moon and before a couple of hundred years ago there was no electricity so people at night it was dark except on these three nights where you had the full moon and the brightness of the moon would shed light in the night so people could see and that's why they called them the white nights or the the white days albeit now having said that why the prophet assalam used to encourage us to fast them some people say because it's related to the full moon and we have something that happens in the blood streams and the people have some sort of hyperness and activities in them and they can reduce this only through uh fasting but this is not based on islamic justifications so it's just only a speculation that people have why do we do it because the prophet instructed us and he encouraged us to do it this is level 1 that you fast 13th 14th and 15th every month if someone is unable to do this well you have level 2 and that is to fast any three days of the month so if you fast the first day and the 15th day and the 29th day this does the job what job the job that the prophet told us at islam that one deed is rewarded by ten so tenfold so if you fast three days of every month this means as if you fasted the whole month 30 days and if you do this every month at the end of the year you would have fasted the whole year the 11th year with the exception of ramadan so what bigger reward would there be more than you being admitted to jannah through the gate of rayan and we know that there are eight gates for paradise and one of them is specifically for those who fast and it's called ar-rayan so definitely this is a great reward that every one of us should try his level best to attain and moving on to the following hadith hadith number 35 and we will try to wrap it up before the break in sha allah abu huraira may allah be pleased with him said the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam said a woman is not too fast even for one day while her husband is present except with his permission and this hadith was agreed upon in another narration for abu dhabi or another virgin the prophet added unless it is during ramadan then she does not need his permission as it is obligatory fasting and what is between brackets is the translation the translators understanding so what do we understand from this hadith the prophet is putting the ground rules a woman cannot fast voluntary fasting without having the prior permission from her husband why is that well because the husband is the master of the house and that is why allah described him as the master as in surat yusuf when she was trying to seduce yusuf and he ran away to the door and allah says and they found her master at the door that is her husband and this hadith is among tens of hadiths that illustrate the role or the greatness or the importance of the role of the husband in the house and the greatness of the rights of the husband over his wife so the prophet is telling us voluntary fasting as a woman you should not fast without seeking the prior permission from your husband but if it is mandatory fasting such as vows expiations or ramadan making up for ramadan or ramadan itself by default you do not need his permission you may fast because this is allah's obligation upon you but if it is arafa if it is if it is the white days if it is mondays and thursdays if it is every alternate day you must seek his permission prior to that and this shows you how important the role of a husband to his wife and how many of our wives don't know the importance of obeying the husband even in forms of worship to allah azza you must seek his permission the prophet says does this cascade to praying for example night prayer the answer is no this is only for fasting why is that because you will fast for 15 or 17 hours and it might happen that he would require you for intimacy and one would say okay so what can't he wait until sunset the answer is no he is not obliged to wait with all the calamities and fitness and and the desires that are roaming around him on the street in the offices in the malls he has to have this halal source that allah has given him and hence she has to be always ready for him and this also shows us that a husband's status to his wife is far greater than voluntary deeds and if she had the the good intention allah would reward her for pleasing the husband much more than he would reward her for doing voluntary acts so what about if the husband is traveling do i have to call him she says and ask his permission that's just no there's no need for that if he's traveling you can fast as many days as you wish because there's nothing wrong in doing that and you're not preventing him from any of his rights what about if the husband does not give the wife her rights he doesn't support her he doesn't provide for her he leaves her for days without end and he doesn't do his job as a husband is she obliged to ask his permission he says no especially if he sends her to her parents house and without any justification now having said that a lot of the husbands i know give a carte blanche to their wives so they tell their wives you can fast voluntary days without my permission this is my permission for you so is this sufficient and the answer is yes this does the job and every woman every righteous practicing muslima should concentrate a lot on this hadith to know the gravity and seriousness of the mistakes she is doing with her husband and that allah's wrath would fall upon her if she is not doing him justice now i'm not putting the full load on the women but this is a bigger topic to discuss and this is not the time for it we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we'll be right back happiness the forgiveness of your lord and to paradise the width of which is the heavens and the earth prepared for the righteous and pious brothers and sisters in islam especially in the

assalamu alaikum and welcome back it is time to take the questions from you and we have uh aliyah from saudi arabia hi my name is i am nine years old yes i have one question yes it will it will be some it will be same reward if we read with the quran or by reading with the help of ipad okay so alya's question was is the same reward to read the quran from uh the actual paper quran or from a pda computer ipad or mobile phone the answer is yes the quran is the same quran and the reward is the same insha allah the only difference is that you do not require to be in the state of wudu when you are reciting it from your ipad or from any electronic or digital means aisha from saudi arabia say i have one of my friends ramadan i thought when the time at that time he called up the call of fighters i said i see him drinking i asked how why did he do he said he says drinking if you had another call for five years you can drink what's happening so now i want to know that it's authentic or not okay i will answer inshallah aisha's question was that is it sunnah to drink while the adhan is being called no it is not a sunnah per se in the sense the hadith in muslim is being called and one of you has a cup in his hand he should not put it down until he finishes what he desires of it so as long as you have the cup and that is being cold you can finish it even if it takes you a couple of minutes no problem but when the van is cold and you know that is being called for fajr and you run to the fridge and you go ahead and pour water if you know that it is the adana fajr and it's on time then this is not permissible for you to do shaheen from uh oman uh to you and all the viewers of the tv thank you since i haven't memorized long suburas so uh to prolong uh kanyam in land can i recite more than one small surah and if yes then how many surahs can i recite my second question is what is the proper way of asking dua i mean during the mars after namaste after gnawaffin or at any other time thank you you're welcome sir we have um from saudi arabia i want to ask you when we read and share when imam recite surah so should we say i mean um in dua and without the when he recite the quran what should we say some people say sometimes and people say i mean so and another question then you're referring you're referring to the sometime in guru then sometime other restoration in after uh okay okay in both ways i want to ask and the other thing is that when we go first so should we have to cover our head and the same way we go in sallah okay or is there any dua for that or whatever okay i will answer inshallah thank you you're quite welcome um iman i heard one of the scholars from pakistan he said that it's only to be the or uh odd days that is the 21st july 23rd and so on till 29th that we should only uh of um prince praying and should be on those days but we have been living here and we have been doing this for the last 10 days so what's the right thing that we have to do i will answer you inshallah thank you very much you are quite welcome zahara from saudi um before i ask my question i asked you to make dua for this married couple their six month year old baby just passed away so i asked them not to give them patience and many more children may allah grant them many healthy and righteous and practicing children and make this calamity of theirs go away um sheikh i want to ask for the eight prayer a woman in their menses do they have to pray okay any more questions no i will answer inshallah and we have um saudi arabia for voluntary fasting just now he was explaining one hadith that it is compulsory to ask permission of husband for the voluntary prayers for voluntary prayers yeah yeah i'm sorry sorry not the prayers for fasting okay and one more thing whoever speak is speech that is for bad language for uh one time a particular person will be for 70 years he will be in the hell fire is it true if he says bad speech yeah ill speech yeah bad language okay i will answer inshallah okay and we have um asia from nigeria my question is um last week you said when one is fastened and forget he if one is fasting and he forgets he drinks or eats something that means his fasting is still correct right yes okay what about is it does that only apply in the month of ramadan or every other you know first thing i will answer inshallah all right you're welcome from nigeria joining the shoulder and the legs okay you're in prayer okay yeah is it composing or not and i also like to say allah make it easy for muslim brothers and sisters all over the world i will answer your question okay aisha from saudi arabia she says that what is the ruling on drinking while uh i think we've answered this what what's wrong with me i don't know getting old shaheen from uh rahman says says that she doesn't recite the quran or she doesn't memorize the quran a lot so is it permissible for her to repeat the small surahs that she has and the answer is definitely yes repeat them as many times as you wish all what you memorize repeat it and this is the word of allah so if i say then i repeat it 10 15 20 times because this is what i know there's no problem in that insha allah and she says what is the best dua in salah well the best time to make dua is before offering salam so after the salutation to the prophet haslam the last raqqa then you offer dua as much as you wish also during the sujud the prophet told us haslam the closest a person or a slave is to allah is when doing the sujud musa from nigeria hello now hello yes musa do you have a question yes i am well i think we've lost musa we have um muhammad from saudi arabia the one of my sister in islam she asked that whether she can give the zakat money to someone who is going to perform umrah who cannot afford it and whether she can give the zakat money to people taking the masjid they give food for during start time for that she can spare the money and um i think these are the questions okay i will answer it if she can uh spend it for uh this because this also maybe this is coming under are you spending an allah does this come under that category i will ask you inshallah i have two questions here yes first question is what should be the level for cash and my second question is if we have less than 85 gram gold it should be converted into level of silver or not okay i will answer inshallah and we have aliyah from saudi arabia sheikha i forgot to ask a second question to you it will cost you 10 reals but no problem no problem what's your question a sheikh as you you told that you you are teaching in masjid please mention that name so that we can benefit benefit okay inshallah i will do that inshallah so we have um for khan's question uh regarding the saying in taraweeh after the imam says of course this is part of the sunnah in all prayers that are allowed you have to say mean and regarding that i mean in dua when the imam is saying allahu mahdi you say amin but you don't raise your voice with that we have uh muhammad from the emirates you get more ajar if you pray at home rather than in masjid now for kaya mull i understand that is nafil so should we pay in the praying the masjid is there more raja praying in the masjid with the imam in the congregation or at home okay i will answer and the second question was uh zakat amount here if i have cash more than the nissan should i pay 2.5 on the full amount or only on the amount which is excess okay okay thank you so much you're welcome and we have amber from saudi amber from saudi arabia uh are you sir i'm fine for asking okay um uh sheikh i have uh three questions to ask okay uh the first one is um when we um you know go to offer friday prayer um and it's only uh two first in the mosque so i want to ask you like uh what do we do with the sunnah's before and after the prayer we pray at home or we pray in the mosque you know both for men and women i like to know or should we just pray over the two further with imam in the masjid okay second question second question is like uh we were doing kamalal and uh the imam was reciting from quran and uh just to follow him better i was holding the muscles uh is it okay to do that or should i just uh not hold the muscle um just listen to the sad question and the third question is like for a poor person um they have no under no obligation to uh perform hajj but suppose they want to um should we um help them perform hajj or should we help them marry their daughters or uh you know um uh help them in their living or should we uh tell them okay that uh i mean uh sponsored their uh uh umrah okay i will answer your question inshaallah okay um i think i was not able to describe you correctly i was asking the surah when you read after there are so many ayah so sometimes for janna bashara often this time at that time what should we say or should we just keep quite silent and listen that and also in the when the humd is the imam is saying after that he starts so at that time what should we say okay i will answer inshallah no problem okay we have uh um question that when the imam reads a lot of long surahs and there is mentioning of jannah and and and hell he doesn't of course say i mean and you don't say i mean but is it okay to say oh allah i ask you from your grace oh allah protect us from your wrath there is no problem in doing that in sha allah and her second question was such that quran there is a prostration for recitation or for showing your gratitude do we need to cover our head for sisters and do we need to be on the state of purity answer is no because it is not a prayer you're required to wear the full attire when you are praying and you're required to be in the state of when you are praying but if you're not then you can do it even if in other than the direction of the qibla najaf from saudi arabia yeah please i have a question yes if a married woman had an intercourse um and she didn't had a good soldier after the fragile pre is her fasting there okay thank you you are quite welcome two questions question one that if anyone is praying like in the hospital and one lady she was praying actually i have seen that she was praying on the wrong side the qibla was the other side and when she finished i told her and she got angry that why you didn't inform me before i said because you already started the prayer i want the ruling there to ask the ruling that should we stop the person in between or we can we can ask them to break the prayer or we can turn them what is the ruling about that okay and my second question you told that the people from jeddah and taif and makkah they don't shorten their prayer when they go to these cities so for hoover and jabel is this ruling for those two cities also and what was the reason i forgot uh because i listened from you but i forgot what was the reason to not to shorten the prayer in these three cities so what about the hoover and jabel i will answer your question okay i think we will stop taking uh calls until we finish uh the backlog om imam from saudi arabia she says that in pakistan they tell them the scholars that you only make in the odd numbers of nights so the even numbers of nights you don't do it the night of 20 the night of uh 22 etc and this is baseless this has no foundation none whatsoever the prophet salaam says whenever the ten nights are due the prophet assam would wake up his wives and he would revive his night and he would uh tighten his apron so that he would spend the whole night prayer and and and supplicate to allah azzawajal so this is baseless you should uh try your level best throughout the whole ten nights without an exception zahara from saudi arabia she says that a woman in her menses does she pray definitely not prayer is not permissible for a woman in her menses but the hadith tells us that the women and the menses used to be instructed to go and attend the congregation of eight and avoid prayer so they would be there with the congregation and they would witness the supplication and vacation of allah azzawajal to goodness and they would get their part of that so this is a sunnah she's saying that do we does she need the permission of the husband to fast voluntary fasting yes we said this and if you watch the beginning of this program or the rerun i don't know when that is because one of the sisters asked me a few days ago when are the reruns i don't have an idea but maybe you'll find it on their website so yes the answer is you must get the permission from your husband before you fast voluntary fasting and she says that what about the ill speech and the bad language does it throw the person 70 years in hell no but what does is a word that is considered to be blasphemous the prophet said allah that a man would say a word that he doesn't give any weight to it he thinks it's an easy thing and this particular word or phrase or sentence throws him in hell 70 years going down the dungeons of hell without stopping he falls for 70 years and allah knows how deep hell is so this shows us that a word that most likely is blasphemous something that is of a major sin that would count like this but foul language and bad language may not reach that uh level as from nigeria she says that is it the same if someone eats forgetting while fasting whether it's fault or voluntary fasting it's the same the answer is the same so if you're fasting mondays and you eat by mistake or drink by mistake continue and your fasting is valid abdi kareem from nigeria says that what is the ruling on uh tightening the rose in the sense that not leaving gaps and sticking my shoulder to my brother's shoulder and my foot to his foot this is part of the sunnah that was abandoned or that is abandoned nowadays people if you get close to them this close they run away from you maybe they would scold you or shout at you not knowing that the companions used to stick their shoulders to those next to them even their knees and feet would be so tight there is no gap for shaytan to come in and to try to put enmity in their hearts so this is a sunnah but it is mandatory well it depends if those next to you are ignorant and arrogant and would scold you or give you a dirty look if you follow the sunnah stay away from them just keep your distance make it as narrow as possible don't stick your foot to their foot to their feet and and and be safe other than that if they are practicing brothers and you know that they're following the sunnah then you should do it and it's not mandatory at the end of the day muhammad from saudi arabia she says can we give someone who wants to go for umrah zakat the answer is no it's not mandatory upon him you give zakat to the one who was poor or needy to pay a bill to buy food to do something that is essential of it for his life zakat and uh for umrah is not a right to be given and can we give zakat to breaking the fast of those who are fasting in the masjids and etc and says no zakat is only permissible to be given to the poor and needy and if you go to any masjid and you see these long uh uh tables for with food given to those worshipers which is a very positive sign you will find that maybe 40 or 30 of them are not poor but they want to enjoy the congregation with the muslims and they feel the unity and the eat with them but they're not poor so if you buy food for them and these people who are not poor eat from it means that your zakat was not given uh in the right place and you should give zakat money in cash to the poor or to the needy and they do with it what they wish aisha says what is the nisab for uh money is it gold or silver it's an issue of dispute the scholars say that nisab of 85 grams of gold may reach up to twenty thousand reals and ris nisab of silver which is approximately fifteen hundred to two thousand reals so if we only say to the people with the gold you are the ones who to pay the cat the amount of people paying the cut is very negligible because not everybody has this amount of savings but when we tell people that anyone who has 1500 or more of cash in his pocket or in savings and a full year passes then you have to pay the cat this means that the poor would benefit more because there are a lot of people who has this amount and hence they will pay zakat for it and if someone has less than 85 grams of gold does he convert this to silver the answer is no you do not each has its own islam so if you have 84 grams of gold there is no zakat none whatsoever and yeah she says what's my the name of the masjid i preached and it's called jaffar tayar it is south uh west of aziz mall just across the street but my lectures are all in arabic so i don't think you will benefit a lot from it muhammad from the emirates says that we know that praying voluntary prayers in the in the house is far greater than praying it elsewhere that this is completely true with the exception of taraweeh why because it was the prophet hassam who prayed it in the masjid and it was the companions after him who continued this ritual in the masjid so this is what you should do his second question was nisab is 85 grams so if i have 100 grams of gold do i give 2.5 percent over the 15 grams extra or over the whole 100 grams dash it is over the whole hundred grams amber from saudi arabia says that if a woman prays in the masjid and jummah so what is the ruling on the four rakha before rohr and turaka so if you pray in the masjid whether you or a male pray in the masjid there isn't any sunnah before juma there is a sunnah after jummah so if you pray in the masjid the sunnah you pray for raka's two by two but if you go out of the masjid and reach home you pray only to raka's and this is the son of the prophet she says that is it permissible for me to pray behind the imam and hold the the quran in my hand this is not recommended why because you abandon a number of sunnahs one of them is putting that right on the left when you hold the mushaf you cannot do this the second one is that you are deprived from looking at the place of prostration in salah because you're following the third is that you are bothering the one next to you when turning the pages or doing this or doing that so you're distracting them and it is not recommended and the issue of helping a poor person to go for hajj we've answered this the issue of helping him in getting his wife uh his wife that would be fun to getting his daughter married or to send his children to school give him from the zakat if he's poor or needy this is permissible um from saudi arabia she says well we answered her question except with when the imam praises allah so what do we say you don't say anything some people say subhanak some people say adlan all of these are baseless subhanak you're praising allah and saying that allah is a glorified and when you're praising allah you don't say such a thing you just listen to that najib says that if a woman has intercourse and does not take bath until the adana fajr is her fasting intact the answer is yes we had uh an episode a couple of days ago on the same topic mother aisha both of them told us that the prophet used to do this sallallahu alaihi wasallam without any problem nadia from saudi arabia she says whoever prays to the direction other than the qibla can we correct them while they're praying the answer is yes when the ayah that was revealed from changing the qibla from uh uh baital mercodes uh to the kaaba it was 180 degrees difference so a man passed by the people of cuba while they were praying fajr and they did not know about the changing of the qibla so he told them that was revealed and it's changed 180 degrees as they were praying the imam who was in the front came to be in the back and the congregation came to be in the front and they continued their prayer so yes you should tell them and they should not break the prayer they should simply change the direction she says that i spoke about the people of makkah and jeddah that they do not shorten their prayer i didn't say that i said that people of mecca do not shorten prayer when they go to jeddah or when they go to taif because it is so close and they are considered to be from the same uh suburbs but people from jeddah would shorten if they go to taif because it's far away from their place and it's travel traveling but when they go to makkah it's a different story because make is in the middle now for the people of jubail and al-hubbar they are considered to be an hour or less drive and a lot of the people commute daily from jubail to hobart and from hobart to jabal to work therefore they should not shorten their prayers as well this is all the time we have until we meet next time tomorrow while watching the new siding it felt like a good enlightening this day is so bright as the first time always the night with family around the nice meal we're making do one how nice it is to be so neat to those i love whenever we think of ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
