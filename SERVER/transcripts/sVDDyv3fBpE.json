  "title": "Getting Medical Seat by Paying Donation In India",
  "transcript": "says he has a doctor a son who is a doctor and they have to pay a lot of money in order to qualify for a special certificate that he studies and I asked her do you pay university fees she says this is three times more but it is with the knowledge of the government with the approval of the government and the University and they have to give this story of donation I have my doubts regarding such donations because if it is a donation given to the government by the government and no hands exchange it in this case it's Halid because it is imposed by the government you cannot get this certificate without giving such so-called donations but if it is taken and given under the table and the head of the university and the mayor of the city take chunks of it this is a bribe and it is not permissible unless there is no other way you can attain this position or get the certificate which Muslim need and you need to progress in your career in this case as long as everybody is doing it and they're preventing you from your god-given right in this case it might be permissible in Charlotte"
