  "transcript": "zadeed from bangladesh they say in bangladesh that the salafis are a factor of dividing the ummah and they came with things that would divide the ummah and they should unite and they should cooperate on what muslims agree upon etc all of this is nonsense why i'll tell you why before salafis ever existed in or or before they have been vocal as they are today tell me about bangladesh now or pakistan or india or some countries in the arab world like syria et cetera where there are strict hanafis how was their relationship with the shafires a different school of thought it was horrible a chef a woman marrying a hanafi man they would end up in divorce she believes that whenever he touches her herodo is invalid she he she believes that his prayer is invalid he doesn't recite the fatih he believes that she's doing this she and they have so many differences so did following a different school other than hanafi divide the ummah or not to them yes indeed so it's not salafi it is following anything other than the hanover school of thought the salafiya which is not a party there's no one going around saying i'm a salafi or myself no no i'm a muslim yeah what kind of muslim what do you mean what kind of muslim acdc a muslim i follow the quran and the sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations do you have a problem with this oh so you're not one of the four schools of thought no i'm following the prophet salam tabirin tabir what else do you want me to do and this is the methodology that the prophet hassam ordered us to do yeah but this divides the people this divides the people who do not want or wish to follow the sunnah they want to follow their imams their scholars their traditional books even if it goes against the quran and sunnah they could care less yes you're true this is true we divide those who do not want to follow the quran sunnah but those who are followers of the prophet isam they're more than welcome to join in and nobody has a problem with that except the blind followers of schools of thought so don't listen to them and ignore them"
