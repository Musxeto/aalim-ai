  "title": "When can a woman in labor pains stop praying and can she combine prayers? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister asks is it permissible for a woman in labor who is not having bleeding yet but she has severe contractions can she combine prayers accordingly like valoran acid and Maori Benicia without shortening them and if she cannot then does she have to repeat prayers after getting pure if the contractions are accompanied by bleeding is prayer still fought on her sister said regarding to combining the salat when she has contractions and pains combining the salat is permissible whenever there is a necessity so being in the state of pregnancy having contractions if it is painful for you it is really hard you find it difficult to perform model and it is way way convenient for you to combine rather to pray each prayer on its separate times and this is really hard for you this is permissible no problem in that of course without shortening the prayers now if you have an issue with prayer in the sense that when does a pregnant woman skip and stop praying if she breaks her water does she stop praying dances no she must continue to pray but if she has these signs of breaking the water she has bleeding and she has the contractions two or three days before giving labor in this case this is a sign that this bleeding is the postnatal bleeding and she stops praying without any problem because Halasz she is in the period of NEFAs but if she is like in seven months pregnant or six months pregnant she has spotting or bleeding this does not make her void or skip her salat she has to pray on time"
