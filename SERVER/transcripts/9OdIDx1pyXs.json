  "title": "Praying Witr in congregation outside Ramadan? Praying it with wife, others? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is it permissible to pray Witter in congregation in normal days not Ramadan like if the husband and wife or the whole family praying it together every day taking this as a regular action every day is not from the Sunnah with the exception of a man and his wife as it was reported in theah that the prophet Alam used to wake up his wives to pray with him witer when he wants to conclude the night prayer so this is fine praying a man with his wife on regular basis is a highly recommended Sunnah the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that when a man wakes up his wife and they pray two raas they will be written with Allah among those who remember Allah a lot among the males and females doing it occasionally that is praying Witter or night prayer every now and then is is fine the prophet sallai wasallam prayed night prayer sometimes withb Abbas uh hu um Abdullah masud and the likes of the companions who prayed with him but on rare occasions not on regular regular basis so therefore if this is done every now and then there is no problem in that but to take it as a confirmed sunah to be offered regularly that is not recommended and to do it in the Masjid in other than Ramadan that would be an innovation to continue to do this and Allah know best"
