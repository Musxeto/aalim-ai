  "transcript": "dear brothers and sisters in Islam no one Among Us except has this need and desire to enter J however Jenna has one key without it you would never be admitted to Jenna and this goes without any doubt no one without this key would be admitted to J and this key is is a word that instills tranquility and peace only in the hearts of the Believers and we are all believers alhamdulillah so when you hear the worded you feel comforted by it you have this sense of tranquility and peace unfortunately a lot of the Muslims may be ignorant of the meaning of the word a lot of the Muslims May have enmity and resentment against the word ofed this is due to their lack of knowledge due to their ignorance and some of them may fight it because it's not found in the Quran imagine how ignorant people can be some of the Muslims say I don't promote because it's not in the Quran and this shows you that some of us have not read the Quran to begin with is found in the do you reject the deal because he's not in the Quran the prophet said thisat I have been I have been given the Quran and similar to it with it referring to what you're still asleep did not have breakfast I understand I understand so please bear with me it's going to be a long day I have been given the Quran and similar to it with it referring to what hadiah so the prophet was given the Sunnah without the Sunnah you can never understand the Quran without the Sunnah your Islam is never complete they go side by side yet people reject the concept ofed and who rejects toed only the dev Cults and sects that consider themselves to be part of Islam the people of innovation the people of those who follow their whims and desires they reject the word ofed such as examples such as Grave worshippers when you say they start to shiver and Shake Allah says in the Quran and when Allah is mentioned alone the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter shrink with aversion but when those worshiped other than him are mentioned immediately the they Rejoice some even come and with audacity say was only founded by IB tamya and you love I Tam you have nothing to believe except in IB tamya and this is false and a lie was mentioned centuries before that the segregation ofed into three parts was mentioned forb at the time of IM and others and the Word was also mentioned in the Quran and in the Sunnah it was mentioned in the Sunnah explicitly but in the Quran in general when you read about it Inari and Muslim which means it's the highest level of authenticity the prophet when he sent mub to Yemen he said to him you are going to people from among the people of the book so let the first thing to which you call them be believe in Allah alone the prophet said this what is this is the prophet using the word himself and also the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam as per Muslim he said Islam is built on Five Pillars belief that Allah is one so is synonymous to every single Messenger as mentioned in the Quran was sent with a message ofed Allah says in many places in the Quran worship Allah you have no deity other than him and Allah created us not to mate not to eat or drink not to enjoy life rather for the sole purpose of worshiping him and I did not create the gin and Mankind except to worship [Music] me and this is the soul right of Allah the prophet saidat to again may Allah be pleased with him do you know what Allah's right upon his servants and what are his servants right upon Allah said Allah and his messenger know best so the prophet saidat Allah's right upon his servants that they worship him and not associate others with him and if they were to do this the servant rights upon Allah is that he does not torment them he does not admit them to Hellfire this is the first right the first mandation and obligation upon all of us not to doubt like some deviant sex say the first wag is to doubt is there Allah or no not to search and investigate no the first thing as the prophet said to Mu may Allah be pleased with him the prophet saidat let the first thing you call them to is to believe in the Oneness of Allah now how many types ofed are there three there are three types ofed mentioned in one Ayah in the Quran what are these three types of [Music] lordship of worship and the of Allah's beautiful names and attributes all of these three types were mentioned in one Ayah of the Quran listen to it Allah says this is lordship this is worship and this is translates to Lord of the heavens and the Earth and all that is between them so worship him alone and be constant and patient in his worship do you know of any who is similar to him so what are these three types ofed of course you all know them alhamdulillah you've all studied them at a very early age but it is important that we remind one another of it to refresh our memory because through time we get lazy we take things for granted we pray Sal lot and we finish and we don't know what we've read so many times we pray prayer and I asked the brothers beside me the students andum I just want to check how they in Salat and concentration and I say what did the IM read in the first ra and you see like the internet and five minutes later they say I wasn't concentrating she of course you were not concentration it was L people sometimes I don't know how they think so we need to refresh our memories with this so that when we worship Allah we worship it fresh first is it is to worship Allah through his actions subhanahu wa taal so to believe in the Oneness of Allah that he's the Creator how many creators do you know other than Allah this is the obvious thing and I don't know how stupid people could get ask anyone atheist as Christians as Jews as Hindus Buddhists do you know anyone who ever claimed to be the Creator can there be anyone claiming yes I created no one ever Dar to say I am the Creator ever some may say I give life and take life some may say I give Prov Vision some say I control this or that no one ever claimed to be the Creator so we worship Allah through his actions he's the Creator he is subhah the disposer of Affairs he is the one who has the sovereignty of this universe he is the one who gives life and who takes life and he who provides us with risk subhanahu wa taala so these are related to Allah's rub his actions that nobody usually disputes upon nobody disagrees all those people approve of it Allah says in the Quran [Music] say who provides for you from the sky and from the earth or who owns hearing and sight and who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the Dead from the living and who disposes the Affairs they will say Allah say will you not then be afraid of Allah's punishment this is deep down everybody knows this and everybody acknowledges this even children they know that only Allah this is something that in embedded in our DNA to believe in Allah and his Oneness subhanahu waala then we go to of worship and this is to devote all acts of worship both Inward and outward in r and inde deeds to devote all of this to Allah and not to worship anything or anyone other than him no matter who he is this is and this is to believe in the Oneness of Allah through our actions not through Allah's actions through our actions and what we do Allah says in the Quran Allah and your lord has decreed that you worship not accept him this is where the fights took place this is why there were fights between truth and falsehood between and shik between the messengers and those who opposed them this is where the error took place and for it for for the of worship Allah sent the messengers and the books and scriptures were revealed and for it Allah created this universe and Allah subhah wa ta'ala made these laws sh and this is why the fight took place between the messengers and Prophets and those who opposed them so those who followed them were saved and admitted to Jenna and those who opposed them were in loss and were admitted to Hell Fire Allah says in the Quran and we did not send any messenger before you Muhammad but we inspired him we revealed to him saying none has the right to be worshiped but I Allah so worship me alone and none else and also Allah says in the Quran that is because Allah he is the truth and that which they invoke besides him is Al that is falsehood Satan and all other false deities and that Allah he is the most high and the most great so whoever acknowledges whoever acknowledges that Allah is one the Creator The Giver of life and death the facilitator the provider but he devotes worship to other than him he is a mushrik and among the Muslims there are plenty there are many we are two billions but the vast majority of them do not worship Allah sincerely and according to the Quran and to the Sunnah and this is why in you will find a huge diversion from the Muslims Islam protects this even small words that we don't pay attention to the prophet prohibits to say whatever Allah wishes in you the prophet said have you made me a partner to Allah what did I say oh prophet of Allah whatever Allah chooses in you no say whatever Allah chooses Alone full stop don't compare others with Allah or even combine between Allah and them in words the prophet prohibited praying in the cemetery in the graveyard imagine I'm in the graveyard burying someone and it's time for ass can I pray ass prayer prohibited and the prayer is invalid why I'm praying to Allah because this may lead you to worship some of the Dead me come on sh who's going to worship people who are dead is that a legitimate question go to all or most of the Muslim world and you will find Graves built on them masjids and people go to the graves and sayani and they call them and they call them Hussein so Islam protects this Islam protects even if you want to pray to Allah Asel when the sun is rising or the Sun is setting you're prohibited from praying come on sheh I'm praying for Allah I'm praying Sunnah said Haram you can't pray any voluntary prayer without any legitimate reason when the sun is rising or when the Sun is setting it is prohibited to prostrate to other than Allah though I'm not worshiping I'm just revering I'm just showing my respect bowing and prostrating to other than Allah it is prohibited so many times I shake hands of the people and what are you doing said no no just respect she this is not permissible stand up high with your head up high and shake hands you do not bow except to Allah you are not allowed to bow or to prostrate except to Allah this is cultural there is no culture in Islam if it goes against the Quran and the sunah we abide by the Quran and the Sunnah this is our constitution so we follow this to the letter Allah Asel prohibited drawing and making of sculptures though it is fine arts but because it may make some people worship it as happened in the times of n peace be upon Him Allah prohibits making sculptures and how many houses do we enter and we find statues we find find drawings and the angels do not enter this house as the prophet saidat oh I was in Thailand and I bought this Buddha it's it's just art you crazy it's their God they worship it yes but I don't it's it's beautiful art and you have elephants and you have pharaohs and you have Dolphins made of crystals and usually you ask the brother his beard do here what is this I know it's Haram but the wife you know the wife yes she is the Minister of interior I'm the Minister of Foreign Affairs I she will turn my life into hell well it's best to be turned into hell here than to turn into hell up there take it from me I went both ways may Allah protect us so move it out of your home protect your the prophet prohibit exaggeration even for him when they used to come and praise the prophet you are sayuna and the son of sayuna he said don't go into extreme don't take my grave as a you come frequently and visit may Allah fight the Jews and the Christians for taking their prophets graves as a Masjid and this is why the prophet prohibited raising the graves in Islam we can't raise the grave or build on it except this high from the ground and you don't build on it you don't put cements on it you don't put any structure on it all of this to protect you forgot I can't hear you [Music] of worship and it's not only actions it's all also the work of the hearts invocate invoca other than Allah Dua to other on Allah even the Prophet this takes you out of the Islam oh prophet of Allah don't you see what's happening to us oh prophet of Allah find us a way out out you can't invoke other than Allah and the prophet prohibited this people fearing other than Allah hoping other than Allah relying other than Allah the humbleness the repentance seeking of help taking of Refuge calling for assistance slaughtering vowing making ta seeking Baraka all of this is going against as for the third type of and this is the most honorable and Noble of all types of knowledge of beautiful names and attributes this is where we have a deficiency as Muslims most our problems come because we don't know the beautiful names of Allah and to know how important this branch of science is it depends on what this science studies so if I say what is more important the science of medicine or the science of calcul ation science of medicine because it helps people it cures people medicine is good for the money but it's a lower part of Med of of science so what is the most noble and honorable Sciences of all the answer is the science of the beautiful names and attributes because it studies Allah and there is nothing more important than Allah and the sad thing if you ask Muslims how many names does Allah have the Hadith says Allah has 99 names not limited to 99 it's much more but these 99 names as the prophet saidat whoever calculates them memorizes them understands their meanings and Implement them will enter Jenna ask the vast majority of Muslims how many names of Allah do you memorize the best of us would say 30 the best of us the majority would say between five and 10 she that's a reality unfortunately but if you ask them okay between these five and 10 names that you memorize how many do you know the meaning of the names in they same one or two then how is it possible for you to say [Music] allahar and have yes most of us don't move don't blink looking down but our head is where in the market thinking about dinner last night shrimps was good thinking about this thinking about that but not on Salah because you don't know who you're talking to you don't know his names when I say Al what does it mean I don't know I asked a brother yesterday I asked him this name more than 90 times in the Quran what does it mean he said I don't know so what are you worshiping this is extremely important but we are so ignorant in it it is to worship Allah by acknowledging his beautiful names and attributes so we believe that Allah has no comparison to anything else in his names and attributes so you believe in whatever Allah described himself and the prophet Muhammad described his Lord with without no Distortion you don't come to the name and you distort the meaning without no twisting or misinterpreting without without denying in the reality and without without asking how is this attribute and this is based on two main pillars the first one is affirmation and the second one is denying an exemption affirmation is when you affirm the name Allah is Sam Allah is all hearing Allah Allah is allseeing so you affirm this and then you go to which is denial or exemption and this is denying that Allah has any faults or denying that Allah has any shortcomings so thinking that Allah believing that Allah is the perfect and none of his names can have any faults or flaws or shortcomings and this is what Allah mentioned in the Quran when he said there is nothing like onto him this is denying nothing like unto him and he is the he all hearing the allseeing and this is affirmation now is extremely important and because it's important Allah informed us that he only created us to worship him so whoever worships Allah and fulfills Allah will reward him but does Allah need our worship is Allah in need of us to worship ship him Allah says oh mankind you are those in need of Allah while Allah is the free of need the praiseworthy Allah doesn't need us subhah wa ta'ala he created us and he created Jenna for us and he doesn't need us if he wanted subhah wa tala he could toss the whole universe first in hell can you complain can you object to no why this is not fair you can't no one can object to Allah asael and this is why we feel that we are in need of his mercy and that we are expressing our poverty and humility and humbleness to Himel because he's Fair he's just he's knowledgeable he possesses everything in this universe this this is why without you are nothing like your prayer your prayer is nothing without wo if you pray without wo your prayer is rejected Allah says and we will regard what they have done of good deeds and make them as dust dispersed why because they were committing shik Allah would erase all of their good deeds and fored Allah revealed these scriptures to his Messengers and sent them with it Allah says and we sent not before you any messenger except that we revealed to him that there is no deity except me so worship me the prophets of Allah suffered a lot and if we were to list their suffering with their people this would take us to F inshallah but alhamdulillah we prayed FJ today so we don't know if we're going to live another day so as an example Prophet sh who was he sent to let me hear huh Medan the tribe of Medan and they are the descendant of prophet ibraim and he was sent to those who worshiped the tree and in three positions of the Quran Allah mentions sh to be the brother of Medan but when it came to he did not mention that he was a Brethren to them why this is what some Scholars said andan were two different people and was sent to both and this is why he said to Medan he was their Brethren but to the worshippers of the tree AA means tree the big tree with branches and with uh uh things he did not mention that they he was their Brethren so they said they were two different tribes and this is not the most authentic opinion the most authentic opinion that they were One Tribe but in three locations in the Quran he was the Brethren of Medan because he was from the tribe but when it was mentioned in the Quran Allah was mentioning that they were worshiping the tree so it was not befitting to mention him as their brethren because he was not worshiping it with them so he excluded mentioning he was their Brethren he was sent to them they used to disbelieve in Allah and in in addition to that they were defrauders when they weigh things to people they take 100 grams and when they buy things they add 100 GRS so they miscalculate in intentionally when it's for their favor and they reduce when it's in the people's favor so he called them to Allah multiple times and they kept on rejecting and rejecting and rejecting until Allah sent his wrath and Punishment what was their punishment in the beginning it was very hot they could not stay in their homes so they had to flee right run away from their homes until one of them found a cloud where they can take shade under so he called everybody come come there is good breeze so they all gathered Under This Cloud not knowing that there is fire that will descend upon them and burn them and simultaneously the Earth Shook and trembled and Allah sent upon them the loud Cry The Scream they died with these four types of punishment and this is the fate of all those who reject theed and falsify what their prophets and Messengers had brought them history does not recall people who say that we have attributes of Allah in other than two or three among them is anud and who is anud and namrud is the king at the time of prophet ibraim you know what prophet ibraim did Allah described him as an as an IM of his own he went and destroyed the idols and he went to his father and invited him to his Islam he invited his people to Islam and they rejected him they built a big huge fire they threw him in it and Allah saved him when he was saved from this huge fire everybody was talking so the king summoned him let me see what what does this man have so when he came and he gave a presentation abouted the king said oh this is is your lord he gives life and takes takes it I give life and take it I am God he claimed and how was that possible he brought two men from prison he executed one and set one free so he said I gave life to this one I set free and the one I executed I gave him death ibraim could have argued with him and said come come come no no no no life is to give life from the dead from nothing immediately he took another example he says okay if your God my God brings the Sun from the East so now you bring it from the west and he could not do anything and he was helpless acknowledging that he was wrong the second one was Pharaoh Pharaoh came to the people of Egypt and said I am your lord the high and they believed him they worshiped him and he believed himself how can you be the Lord the high if you need to eat and drink you can't be and if you eat and drink what will happen after two hours depending if you have a diarrhea maybe five minutes you will go to the toilet what God is this what God is the one who sleeps Allah doesn't sleep subhah wa taala but this is how ignorant these people are and his followers believed him so MSA was sent to him and he showed him sign after sign after sign and Miracle after Miracle 10 Miracles were given to him and he would not adhere to it and what did happen to him he was drowned in the river in the sea and when he felt death coming he said okay time's up I believe in the Lord that Ms and his followers believe inas I I give it I give up too late in the authentic Hadith jel said to Prophet Muhammad Alat he said oh Muhammad if you saw me when Pharaoh was drowning and he wanted to say the shahada I with my wing I take the mud from the seabed and I put it in his mouth so that he would not be able to say the shahada fearing that Allah would accept it jel said I don't want Allah to accept his repentance this want him to roast in Hell of course we know that Allah did not accept his repentance and he is in the lowest lowest lowest level of hell now I think this is all the time we have buted is a very important topic and it is not a theoretical aspect that you learn okay and go on it's a life style it's something in your heart when you have real it's a decision you take when you are at the fork of the road in life oh if I do this life is going to be hard but if I cross some boundaries and do some Haram inshallah I will repent and ask Allah for forgiveness no here is where your taul your dependence your Reliance on Allah appears here is where you believe that Allah is the only one who is not the people the one who gives you the provision the paycheck is not your boss it is Allah subhah wa tala so it should not stop you from saying the word of Truth is a way of living it's not only isolated in Salat in in zakat and that's it it's something that is with you 24 hours seven days a week and I pray to Allah subhanahu waala that he makes me and you live upon and die upon listen to this beautiful Hadith whoever his last words of this dun is he will be admitted to Jenna and he will be forbidden from from entering her fire this is the power ofed a single phrase you are capable of saying it at the bed at the death bed will save you for eternity but who Among Us can guarantee that he would say it raise your hand in French they say s this is life no one can guarantee why because this is the acid test you live on it I guarantee you you will die on it w i will guarantee you you will say it live on it live on embrace it believe in it and you will come on your deathbed people say say you will say but if you live on Netflix if you live on Haram music if you skip prayer after prayer after prayer thinking that Allah Kim Allah is most forgiving most merciful if you deal in RBA if you cheat if you steal if you lie if you abuse your wife or your husband okay if this happens how will you be able to say there is a possibility but it is very very unlikely"
