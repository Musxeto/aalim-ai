  "title": "Can we sit or pray on mattress which has dry urine? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Anisa says when my infant son urinates on bed I changed the bed cover and wiped the place of the mattress does my body or clothes become impure if I sleep on that mattress and can I read the Koran sitting on that bed I heard that when the urine dries out it becomes okay to read a lot in that cloth is this true no the answer is not this is not true urine is impure it's neji's so human urine is nudges if it hits your clothes you have to wash that area if it hits the floor you have to pour a considerable amount of water until it mixes with it and it's diluted in it and it disappears the traces of urine if it's on a table you just wipe the table until there is there are no traces of it so what happens with a male child a male boy who is dependent on his mother's milk he does not feed for the male boy child who is dependent on his mother mother's milk this is less severe than normal urine in the sense that sprinkling water on it or just pouring water on it is sufficient you don't have to wash it squeeze it and wash it again you just sprinkle water on it and this suffices the job and the Prophet did this is a lot of cinema let's assume that the child is older than that and the child eats he eats a normal food in this case the area is neji's it's impure you changed the bed cover or the sheets then that's this is good what about the mattress the matter still has stained and in a big place you have to wash this thoroughly in order to remove it if you don't want to do this no problem let it dry and then put a cover another sheet on it and you can sleep you can pray you can read the Quran on it because there is something that is a partition between the impurity and your body and yourself and Allah so gel knows best"
