  "title": "Am I sinful if I watch UFC or MMA while fasting? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so fatima from saudi arabia saying what is the ruling on watching UFC I think it's called Ultimate Fighting Championship or something like this while fasting so it is MMA as well mixed martial arts whether you fasting or not this is beside the point fasting has a status that must must be honored when you're not fasting more so if I'm fasting I may refrain from things that I wouldn't normally refrain from while I'm not fasting so fasting should be more valuable to us than normal days and this is why the Prophet told us are some that fasting helps us to curb our sexual desires and to lower our gaze because I know that I'm fasting I'm observing Allah Azza WA JAL and I'm lowering my gaze now UFC is a violent sport that is dependent on choke choking locking breaking the joints and hitting the face so the intention is to subdue and to harm your opponent in any way you can and this is totally prohibited in Islam striking the face in Islam is totally Haram don't pay any attention to famous Muslim boxers or famous MMA fighters hitting the face is something that our Prophet as I said I'm totally prohibited end of story . so whether he's a Muslim he's famous he's doing la ilaha illaallah when he fights and hits people this is beside the point he's not a companion he's not a tabby he's not even a scholar to be followed he's just a fighter being paid for what he's doing and what he's doing is against Islam end of story so whether you fighting you you are fasting or not it doesn't make any difference what makes a difference is it's even worse for a female to watch such fights men who are almost not wearing any clothes and enjoying what you seeing this is not at all permissible or normal"
