  "title": "If a muslim is verbally or physically harassed in public, should he defend himself? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i want to ask a question regarding what a muslim should do when someone harasses them verbally or physically in public should the muslim play the nice guy and not defend themselves or should they react in the same fashion well this is dependent on a number of factors acting like a nice person does not work all the time and it depends on the situation and depends on your own personal strength and ability to defend yourself it depends on the consequences of whatever you're going to do whether on you personally or on islam so there are many factors that governs this generally speaking when a dog barks should i fall on my hands and knees and bark back of course not ignore and move out the dog will remain to be a dog and will continue to bark leave him so again it depends sometimes i'm capable of belittling this person exposing him and putting a stop for his bullying while prevailing and coming on top and everybody says you did the right thing then i have to do that but generally speaking people who bully you only are interested in depressing you saddening you and extracting a negative response and reaction from you that would incriminate you if you turn the tables on their heads by smiling and not defending yourself and not arguing with them rather ignoring them as if they were a fly that came and you just did this and it went away nothing happened this would kill them softly more likely and it would make you come on top and allah knows best"
