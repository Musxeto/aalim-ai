  "title": "Take the good & leave the evil:Should we cooperate with people of innovation & Shirk Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says please shed some light on cooperating with the people of innovation in religion some very famous contemporary students of knowledge say we must work together and not divide ourselves and they say take the good and leave the bad but now or but how would a layman know this isn't this compromising the religion to please people of innovation and shirk but we have to be fair those who follow a very strict methodology are wrong and those who follow a very lenient methodology are wrong and the best of ways are the middle path meaning there are people who are among the salafi manhattan that would not even re reply for the salam if given to them by the people of innovation remember the people of innovation is not one shade there are fifty shades not necessarily of gray but there are different number of shades of them so there are people of innovation that are apostates that are disbelievers that commit blasphemy yes those you don't reply to people that leave the fold of islam people that claim that the prophet isam is not the last messenger for example that there are messengers after him this is totally unacceptable and blasphemous these are not considered to be muslims people who curse abu bakr um and they slander mother aisha these are not muslims don't even pay any attention to them but there are people of innovation that have good akhida yet they believe in the mawlid not that they believe that the prophet haslam is like they say how their nather knows everything in the universe like he sees the palm of his hand no no this is blasphemous whoever claims this this is kufr or believes that the prophet hassam was created from allah's noor no we're talking about someone who believes in mawlid he celebrates it every 12th of rabbi that's it or he has some he says after the salat or believes in salat or believes in going out for three days or 10 days or 40 days with the jama'ah and staying in masjid these are innovations but they're not as severe as the super sufis or those who go beyond the fault of islam with their innovations so we have to make the balance now on the other hand those who are so lenient and soft to the extent that they share the same platforms with them they attend conferences and allow them to speak and they speak and they may invite others to their innovation and you are a selfie scholar sitting there saying nothing and just giving smiles and being cordial and maybe exchanging gifts this is too much this is not permissible you have to hold your grounds remain steadfast and not allow innovation or sins that go against the religion to be manifested in such a way you can't take part of it so it you have to strike the right balance in the sense that yes i may go and visit people of innovation whose innovation is not that serious i may visit them in their centers speak to them be kind to them not endorse them not advertise for them not say that oh i've met this great sheikh he's a great scholar he's this what are you doing this is a man of innovation you cannot polish him like this but at the same time you do not treat him as a kafir you do not treat him that you don't reply to his salam the guy comes in front of people and and extend his hand to shake and you say you look the other way what is this he's not a kafir he's among the little innovation or to mild innovation i'm not endorsing his innovation but i'm treating him as a muslim so i greet him i i speak to him etc but i don't share with him platforms of dawa and if i hear him say something that goes against my religion or my conviction i would commend and i would forbid evil but to sit in the same platform with people of innovation and they would say things that are wrong in my uh religion in my aqid of jamaa yet i say hmm it's best not to comment i should not speak it's fall or fall for for the good and the laymen are watching is oh sheikh so-and-so is with them this means that they're good and they may follow them no this is totally uh not permissible and one has to make a stand but again be balanced you have to weigh the pros and cons of what you do it's not always shun them and stay away from them and bycot them and don't even give salam to them and it's not always they are most welcomed and they're invited to come and attend our conferences and lectures etc and to preach in in our messages no this is not the right approach allah knows best we"
