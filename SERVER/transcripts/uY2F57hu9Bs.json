  "title": "Is it sinful to cut ✂️  or trim beard upto fist length? Ibn Umar Abu Hurairah did so assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she I have a question is a person sinful if he cuts his beard up to a fist length like Omar may Allah be pleased with him this is an issue of dispute and I would not say that he would be sinful but I would say he would not be following the Sunnah because only IB Omar and maybe Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with them were reported to have have this understanding that the beard can be shortened if you do this and you cut whatever exceeds a fist length so whoa I have a lot I can I can I have credit I can do that why don't you do it she it looks nicer yeah it can look nicer but as there is an issue of dispute and there are two opinions and both have Grounds For What they're saying so and my whole uh uh posy of of Scholars that I follow say it's not permissible why because the prophet had never done itam all the instructions were to keep it and honor it and let it be and the companions in majority never did it okay I respect this I follow this the other opinion which is is reported by IB Omar Abu Hur and a third companion I forgot his name only used to have this understanding of the permissibility of doing that so we have two strong opinions now if I come on the day of judgment not taking anything from my beard would Allah Asel blame me for that nope okay but if I come on the day of judgment shortening my beard to a fist length would it be a probability that Allah would blame me for that yep so what is the safest to leave it and this is what I'm doing and this is what I'm inclined to say but I wouldn't say it's sinful and Allah Knows Best"
