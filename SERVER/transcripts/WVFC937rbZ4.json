  "title": "Father wants me to shorten my beard & wear Pants below the ankles, must I obey him - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother afzal says his father says that his beard is too long and it makes him look old and he wants him to shorten it shorten it what is the ruling on that the ruling from the hadith of the prophet is that the prophet himself had a big beard and he never ever touched it or shortened it the companions were asked by the taberine did the prophet sallam recite quran in silent prayers and they said yes so the taberine said how do you know if it's silent the companion said that we used to see his beard from behind him because we were behind him trembling which means that his jaw is moving and the beard moves when he speaks so this is an authentic hadith that the prophet's beard was big now the scholars differed some say and this is the most authentic opinion that you must not touch your beard at all so even if it's this long it you should not touch it unless it becomes harmful in the sense that your your bead is like a meter long so when you walk you trip on it or when you eat you eat your own beard or it flies and covers your hair uh your your face when you're driving and this might be hazardous then this is an extreme case we're not addressing the second opinion is that it is permissible to shorten your beard providing it exceeds a fist so you can cut this unfortunately nowadays people misunderstand this and they cut what exceeds the fist from on top not on the bottom and where did they get get this from they got this from the action and the doing of abdullah may because he interpreted the ayah in sura where allah says you shall enter with the grace of allah azzawajal the masjid al-haram shaving and shortening allah did not say the beard so ibn omar understood that shaving is for the head after hajj and shortening is for the beard as well but he's the only one who understood the ayah in this way the vast majority understood the ayah as shaving your head or shortening your hair if you don't want to shave so the most authentic opinion is that it is not permissible for you to um cut short your beard to please your father focus on pleasing allah azzawajal now as for the garment your trousers your garment your whatever you're wearing on your waist wrapper the prophet said whatever goes down the ankles this is in hellfire this is a punishment for those who do such a thing without any arrogance but if there is arrogance accompanying this sin then there are four punishments that allah does not look at them does not purify them does not uh have mercy on them and would torment them in hell severely so the sunnah of the prophet sallallahu sallam was as described in the authentic hadith a man saw the prophet when the prophet asked him and ordered him uplift your garment so the man looked at the prophet islam and said oh prophet of allah my garment is torn and old and dirty i'm not doing this out of arrogance the prophet said don't i represent a role model for you am i not a role model for you the man looked at the prophet sam and he says that his garment was to the middle of his leg in another hadith he saw a companion and he told him uplift your garment and then the prophet physically went to the man and hit four fingers underneath the knee so this is four fingers he said this is the garment and if you refuse he added another four fingers below the knee so that's eight fingers says here is the sunnah and the garment cannot must not be below the ankles so covering the ankles is prohibited if you draw your trousers or garment just above the ankles without covering it there's no problem with that insha allah and allah azza knows best"
