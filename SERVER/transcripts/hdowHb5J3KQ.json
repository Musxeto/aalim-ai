  "transcript": "yeah I have two questions one only the first is about uh Sports I used to play in a football team and I heard that is Haram to play competitions H where you like earn trophies or something like that and that you can't play if you are playing with people that doesn't cover his and the other question is that one question only ABD Nas only one question so in uh response to your first question playing sports and competing in it is halal providing that you do not Gamble and part of gambling is when a team pays an entry fee and The Winner Takes all or takes everything so while competing you are risking losing all or gaining much more than what you had input it's like insurance it's like buying a lottery ticket you lose one Euro but you may gain a 100,000 if you win but if you don't you lose one1 Euro it's okay no this is gambling if you're competing and the club is not paying entry fee and the club is giving you salary there's no problem in that if the prizes are given from the sponsors or from a third party that is not participating there's no problem in that as for the we've stated before that it's an issue of dispute whether the thigh is or not the most authentic opinion is that it is however the vast majority of footballers nowadays wear their shorts and underneath them they wear a sort of leggings that covers the thighs to the knees and if this is the case inshallah this is permissible and Allah Knows Best"
