  "transcript": "the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam used to love and used to consume meat so the prophet wasn't following today's Trend being a vegetarian oh I'm vegan Mah you me I'm I'm vegan so M I'm Saudi welcome what do you mean vegan I don't eat meat why so no meat is not good I'm not a a beast I'm not a lion yes but you're not a cow why do you eat only vegetables this is crazy yeah I understand you don't like to eat a lot of meat this is up to you but to say any meat product or eggs or fish is Haram or you don't come near it you're crazy our religion every the is to slaughter your sacrifice and the first thing to eat from is your liver not your own liver of course some people will understand wrongly what I say so and you have to be careful of what you say you have to always be careful not to be misunderstood and I told you this before they suspended my Twitter account for about three months and I had a fight with them why someone asks me she is it permissible to eat in Europe from KFC in McDonald's and I said yes the slaughtering of the Jews and the Christians is permissible what do you expect happen they suspended my account they said remove this uh post said why said you said the slaughtering of the Jews as a Christian yeah look at the question the question is clearly and I explained it in the comments everybody understood it but for them as disbelievers and kafer I agree the post by itself is an encouragement for you to go and Slaughter any Jew or Christian I meant the animals slaughtered by the Jew and the Christians are permissible so sometimes your wordings are very important and I always tell people it is a blessing from Allah to have a small u in front of you when you speak there is small sitting in front of me so whenever I speak he tells me hey oops you did wrong correct it or don't say these things likewise when you write an email always have a small U reading that email before you send it because the word in your mouth is like a lion in a cage if I'm outside the cage can the lion hurt me no I the lion is in captivity he cannot do anything the moment the word comes out the lion is out he's going to eat everyone and me included so when you write an email in response to someone's comment at work or a friend or a relative and you're angry let it marinate and come the following day read it again and you will find that you will edit 60% of it reward it don't send it come after 2 hours read it again you will edit another 15% then you may send it and it would have the best impact and people say you're wise but if you're impulsive if you say say and then apologize the prophet saidat wasam do not say what you have to apologize of or from meaning that it's best to refrain from talking so that you don't apologize but if every time I say something and then I have to apologize no no I did not mean this no I was wrong this is not befitting at all"
