  "title": "The reward of walking vs riding or driving to the Masjid - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says that we know that walking to the Masjid each step Allah writes for you a good deed he raises a bad deed elevates you one level in Jannah so he says what happens if I ride a bike would I get the same reward answer's no any type of riding whether you ride a bike a motorcycle a mule a horse a car it does not have or share the same reward because walking is something that has been prescribed and there are so many benefits of it contemplating taking your time beside it's healthy but you make a lot of Vicker when walking and you see a lot of people and you take your time and it has a lot of benefits beside the benefits that the Prophet had told us as some in regards of rewards so riding a bicycle does not count"
