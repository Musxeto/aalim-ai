  "title": "Did Allah say travel the earth, explore, enjoy life? So should she postpone marriage assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay first of all the issue of Allah says in the Quran go and explore and enjoy yourself did not say that Allah azzawajal says that when you walk the world when you walk the earth you Ponder and see the magnificence of Allah's creation not to take days off and go hitchhiking and mountain climbing and scuba diving Allah did not say this so don't think that Allah is inviting you to take one month every year and travel to the Maldives and go these places Allah did not say this number one number two each one of us has priorities for a woman I'll give you the quote the Surah the verse of the Quran I am not Zakir Naik a Allah says in 33 33. [Music] Ayah number 33 the Surah is 33 the is 33 nobody can forget this that's why I remember it Allah is addressing the women by saying and remain in your homes and do not Adorn yourselves like the pre-islamic era now I was noticing when the sister was speaking everybody was looking him was her picture there huh and your guys are looking at her what what is this where Allah says lower your gaze and everybody what are you looking at so this is one of the Islamic rulings that nobody applies in Indonesia it's okay to look at women and women look no it's not okay it's in the Quran and say to the Believers to lower from their gauges I had the instructions from Allah in the Quran and then we say yes we love the Quran Sweden is burning the Quran let's demonstrate he apply the Quran in your heart first and then go demonstrate we're not applying the Quran we are not applying the Sunnah it's all blah blah blah blah so coming back to your question traveling is not instructed in the Quran enjoying life is permissible we all enjoy our lives I enjoy my life alhamdulillah and I have no problem but not by sinning yes by eating grapes when I go home I enjoy life I lie I like grapes so you can enjoy your life regardless of your age but should I postpone manage never why because the demand is much less than the supply supply of women are a lot the demand of men wanting to get married are little why because men die faster this is my experience I know and I don't have to give examples but I mean for example my father died 50 years ago and my mother outlived him 50 years so my aunts their husband died and they outlived them so we always find women outliving men this is why men are allowed to marry one two three four it will make them die faster therefore if you get a good proposal catch it not any proposal a good proposal that checks all boxes mashallah he prays on time he doesn't do any Haram he is a real man he has a good job and he's not a mummy's boy then Bismillah go and marry him because a good proposal is difficult to get nowadays if you say no no I'll wait until I finish my bachelor degree and then I'll take my masters and do my MBA and then inshallah finish my PhD and then get 10 years of experience in that case you will get insha Allah proposals but not for a wife for a nurse you will get someone like me in his 60s wanting someone to take care of him to give him the medication you know to put him in bed because he can barely walk nobody in your age will propose to you so the more you're young the better your chances are every time you get older your chances are lesser and lesser this is my advice as a father of 13 girls no boys that is why I always tell my daughters and some of my daughters don't listen I have a shelf in the house we'll put you on them no problem it's my house my house is open for all of my daughters I will not send you away it's my house but you will suffer and you will regret I have only advice to give I cannot force you I cannot push you but if you are stubborn call us"
