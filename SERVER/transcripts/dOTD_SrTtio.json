  "transcript": "foreign [Music] when our Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam migrated from Mecca to Medina he did not carry with him gold or silver he did not carry furniture he carried with him principles Akida beliefs that would transform the whole world into what we see today and the first thing that the prophet did wasallam when he reached Medina the first thing he did was to build a Masjid so he put the founding Stone Allah says and Masjid founded on the righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand in what was the Masjid made of it was not made of steel it was not made of concrete it was made of mud play leaves and Trunks of palm trees but if you compare that Masjid with our massage you will find a huge difference and big gap their masjids graduated Heroes our Masjid is graduating midgets and why is that because of the productivity the prophet says whoever builds a Masjid for the sake of Allah even if it is like the nest of a small bird Allah will build for him a house in Paradise building masjids in Islam is one of the greatest Deeds Allah says in the Quran that the mosques of Allah are only to be maintained by those who believe in Allah and the last day so maintaining the Masjid Allah maintaining the Masjid can be physically by building it or by inhabiting it praying in it cleaning it worshiping Allah in it the default in Islam that we do not spend a lot of money on building masjids because this is extravagance in his reported that may Allah be pleased with him when he ordered his people to rebuild the message of the Prophet Muhammad the most important message in Medina when he ordered his people to rebuild it he said to them make a structure that would protect people from rain and do not use colorful paint red or yellow so that you would not distract the people subhanallah is telling them not to paint using yellow or red why so you would not distract the people the people come to pray but when you come to our messages and I'm talking about my country in the Middle East in my country and in the Middle East when you go to the Masjid you will be shocked very huge masjids very beautiful air conditioning chandeliers that are so expensive and people are distracted they're praying Allah and they are not focusing on the prayer they are focusing on the material the beauty of the Masjid and this is not what masjids are made for at the time of the Prophet Allah the Masjid was a place of joining And discussing the Affairs of the ummah the Masjid can be a place for taking care of those who were sick like the prophet took care of some of the companions such as may Allah be peace with him the Masjid was a university where the scholars of the companions used to sit teaching up leader teaching teaching Hadith teaching so the people benefited from this Masjid unfortunately now the masjids have been sidelined meaning that people try to make the masjids only for Salat and this is not what Allah made the messages for Salat you can pray anywhere you can pray outside you can pray in the street you can pray in the farm you can pray in the market the prophet says and the Earth has been made for me by Allah to be a place of worship anywhere in the world in the mall in the airport you pray and means of purification I can make with this Earth these massages are for Allah they are not for political gains they are not for commercial gains selling and buying so do not invoke with Allah anyone these masajids are for Dua or for worshiping Allah alone for having Allah for having us not for a prophet not for awliyah not for anyone only for the sake of Allah imagine cleaning the Masjid is one of the greatest ibada there was a black woman and a Masjid has etiquates that we have to protect we have to clean the Masjid perfume the Masjid the companions say to us that there was a black woman in the time of the Prophet Allah and her role was to clean and brush the Masjid nobody knows her nobody knows her name she's just a black woman cleaning the Masjid one that one day she died at night so the companions buried her in the morning or before Fajr they told the prophet Allah that the woman the black woman the woman that we don't know died the prophet was angry why didn't you tell me why didn't you wake me up who is she a black woman nobody knows no the prophet knows he said take me to the graveyard he went to the graveyard where is her grave this is her grave he offered Salah to janaza himself for a woman that nobody knows because she used to clean the Masjid foreign prohibited us from raising our voices in the Masjid you must not shout in the Masjid once a man came and he started to ask the worshipers did you see my camel did you see my camel because he lost his camel so the prophet Allah said to the companions say to him may Allah not return your camel because you're raising your voice in the Masjid another one the prophet said when you hear someone selling and buying who's going to buy this from me I'm gonna sell it for this much this much in the Masjid the prophet said make Dua for him in front of him may Allah make your trade losing and may Allah make you lose your money why because he's disrespecting the Masjid in the Masjid we respect one another to the extent that even when you read the Quran you don't raise your voice we come in jumura and we sit and the brother next to me and the brother next to me what are you doing he's reciting the Quran I cannot recite the Quran I cannot concentrate you reciting I want to recital bakara you're confusing me in Islam this is Haram the prophet said do not raise your voice with the Quran so that you do not annoy and distract the Muslims next to you this is how important keeping your voice down with the Quran in the Masjid and also the prophet Salah to assalam prohibited raising your voice with Dua because if you make Dua and you shout Ya Allah forgive me who are you calling someone deaf Allah is not deaf someone far Allah is not far so you have to be respectful in the Masjid when we go to Makkah in Haram and we see groups of people making arumrah and they have a leader they shout Allah everybody says and they make Dua in congregation loudly this is Haram you are disrespecting the Masjid few days ago I was giving a lecture in a Masjid in Indonesia and every time I say Allah there was a group of people here they looked strange and they started shouting Allah wait wait come down maybe he's sick maybe he has problem give him antidepressants give him some medication what is happening is not natural what are they doing they're raising their voices in the Masjid by shouting and this is not permissible so now what should we do in the Masjid we have to maintain the Masjid by praying in it encouraging our children to pray five times every single day in the Masjid so many Muslims in Indonesia don't pray in them as they pray home some of them pray at the end of the day the last five prayers they combine it all after Asia oh they pray at nine o'clock at night and this is halam this is not acceptable we have to revive the Masjid by praying in it by taking care of it by making classes every day in it teaching people tafsir teaching people Hadith teaching people FIP so that they would learn their religion properly and finally when we want to evaluate a person how do I know he's a good person or a bad person by judging him if he comes to the Masjid if I know that this Imam doesn't pray Fajr every day every day he misses Salat he doesn't take care of salad I know that this man is a bad man but if I see the mess the the person the individual praying in the Masjid in the first row honoring the Masjid loving and caring for the Masjid I know inshallah that he is a good person Muhammad"
