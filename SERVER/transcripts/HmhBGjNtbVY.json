  "title": "Can we add dua of protection from shirk 2 our morning & evening adhkar (dhikr during allocated time",
  "transcript": "since my question was that you are for protection from um can we add uh or include that to uh in our morning and evening so that we don't forget it i did not understand the first part what do you want to add to your car the authentic drive for protection from sikh protection from from shirk the dua which is prescribed is not to be associated with the athkar of the morning and the evening it is to be recited generally so to allocate it with the athkar of the morning and the evening would be an innovation it's exactly like saying that surat al-mulk tabarak is prescribed to be recited before going to bed in order to save you from the torment of the grave so one says okay i'd like to always recite it after fajr and maghrib that car of morning in the evening we say no this is an innovation because you're allocating it to a specific time thinking that this is closer to allah azzawajal which is not the case and i hope this answers your question"
