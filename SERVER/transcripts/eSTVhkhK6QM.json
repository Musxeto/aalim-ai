  "title": "Masjid 45 min walk from home Must I pray all 5 daily prayers there What about Friday assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I have a question about uh attending the Masjid as a man uh my question is uh the closest mid to my house is a 45-minute walk away and by car it's a 7-minute drive the approximate distance is 3.5 kilm so my question is is it compulsory for me to attend the Masjid five times a day uh except the Friday prayer the answer is no this distance is to far for the aan once being called from the top of the Masjid without loudspeakers or microphones to reach you and hence this is how we measure whether it's obligatory for you to attend or not whether the the voice of the MU would reach in normal circumstances or not and with this distance definitely it would not reach so you're not obliged to go five times a day you're obliged to go every Friday now living in a cafir country it depends if you feel that you're being detached from your religion your heart is being hardened due to a lot of fitas and temptations around you you feel that you need to energize just to maintain your identity and your Islamic uh commitment I would highly recommend that you drive 7 minutes because 7 minutes is nothing by car to attend as many prayers as possible but is it mandatory the answer is no and Allah Asel Knows Best"
