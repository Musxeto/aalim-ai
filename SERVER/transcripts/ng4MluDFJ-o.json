  "transcript": "the title of today's lecture or talk is the mercy of allah azza wajal and this is a very wide topic and one cannot get enough from addressing this beautiful topic we look forward for it we can not not exist on earth without it yet as muslims the best way to learn knowledge is from the Quran and from the authentic hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and it is the focal point that each one of us must always rely and depend upon so whenever we address an issue whenever we speak about an issue our cornerstone should be verses from the Quran or authentic hadith from the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam so I'll introduce to you my topic with this beautiful hadith it was narrated by abu huraira may allah be pleased with him that the Prophet said alayhi salatu wa salam and the hadith is in sahih bukhari and elsewhere so it is the highest grade of authenticity Allah when he created the creation he wrote in his book that is placed on the throne with him and he prescribed upon himself subhanAllah all these things as an introduction Allah wrote himself did he write by himself or did he order the pen to write an issue of dispute among scholars which is all by the authentic hadith narrated by or reported by a Timothy that Allah Himself wrote this secondly he prescribed it upon himself and no one else did and we will come to know what this thing is thirdly he placed that book beside him on the throne though we know that the preserved tablet or Allah Helmuth is under the throne which highlights the importance of this book the importance of its content so what was it that Allah had written and prescribed upon himself what is of so much great importance the Prophet says allahís alot was salam verily my mercy has overcome my anger la ilaha illa Allah Azza WA JAL does all of these things to highlight that his mercy overcomes overwhelms his anger from this hadith we can elaborate and speak endlessly until fagioli but father was a few hours ago ok until sunset that's a long time so we will try to summarize and take you in a journey of faith just so that you can know who you are worshipping and what are his beautiful attributes Allah Azza WA JAL described himself to be merciful and he also described himself to get angry yet mercy is one of his beauty attributes that is always with allah azza wajal even before he created the creation Allah was merciful there was Allah and there was nothing with him and nothing before him Subhanahu WA Ta'ala as we mentioned yesterday as for anger Allah Azza WA JAL is not described by saying Allah is angry songs and that's it no anger is one of the attributes of action so Allah becomes angry when he wishes not that he's always angry while when it comes to mercy Allah is always merciful Subhanahu WA Ta'ala ar-rahman rahim allah azza wajal prescribed upon himself to be merciful and this is mentioned clearly in the Quran where Allah says your Lord has decreed upon himself mercy so Allah Azza WA JAL is merciful because he decreed upon himself to be merciful and when we look at mercy overwhelming anger what do you mean sure we have earthquakes we have volcanoes we have tornadoes we have floodings we have diseases epidemics illnesses this shows how bad and negative you are all the time sisters call for counseling brothers call for counseling they always mention the worst thing in their spouse so for half an hour my husband did this my husband did that for half an hour my wife is so bad she's nagging she's rude she's disrespectful she is so so and so and I listen because it's paid and I listen after they finish and I say okay does your spouse have any good at all an immediately you see the shift of course my husband is generous my husband is kind my husband is a loving father my husband takes care of me my husband visits my family and says good things about him my husband is this and this then what's wrong but he has this thing chef I don't like and I'm thinking of divorces and Allah and likewise with the boys with the with the brothers the boys at the end of the day this is know they're big boys but they still children boys so we have a problem in our negativity we only see the bad things yet if we just sit and contemplate upon Allah's mercy wallah he we will be overwhelmed Allah's mercy is far greater than his wrath and anger all's mercy is given to those who deserve it and those who don't while Allah sloth only comes to those who deserve it look at the children look at the infant's look at the disbelievers look at the enemies of allah allah azza wajal is merciful to them he gives them food and who forces a lot to be merciful no one imagined if you have a servant imagine if you have subordinates in your own company it's my business it's my money and someone is disrespectful to you or it doesn't talk to you property properly if you fire him would anybody object can anybody object no Subhan Allah Allah has the highest example he created you from nothing he made you what you are you came from the belly of your mom the wombs of your mothers knowing nothing can't speak can't see can't hear and he gave you the hearing and the seeing and the intellect so that now you are who you are PhD master's degree bachelor's degree authority high position wealth who gave all of this to you allah azza wajal do you deserve it by Allah not no I don't deserve it he gave it to me because he's merciful and he's testing us because of that so praise be to allah azza wajal who gave us his mercy without deserving it and prevented us from so many calamities and torment in this life while we deserve it now the attribute of mercy usually is associated with weakness as humans when we're merciful this means that we're weak sometimes it's good but sometimes it's weak when you're unable to take the necessary measures with your children in upbringing them well in reprimanding them for doing bad if you have this mercy this is weakness and not mercy the Prophet said alehissalaam Salam order your children through pray when there are seven and beat them when they are ten if they refuse to pray if you come and say I'm not going to beat my child because I have mercy upon him this is not mercy this is weakness allah azza wajal mercy is not weakness be careful a large mercy is self-imposed he prescribed it upon himself though he owns you he created you and if he wishes he can make you into dust and no one can object and no one can reject so Allah's mercy is an attribute of perfection showing people that he is the only worthy one of being worshipped in Sahih Imam Muslim the Prophet says allahís alot was salam allah has 100 parts of his mercy of which he sent down one part between the jinn mankind the animals and the insects by means of which they are compassionate and merciful to one another and by means of which wild animals are kind to their offspring and Allah has kept with him back 99 parts of mercy with which to be merciful to his slaves on the day of resurrection ilaha illallah all what you see of mercy on this earth is one part an Allah has held back 99 parts so that he would have mercy upon us on the day of judgment now one would say sure you just said that mercy is one of Allah's attributes and now you're saying mercy is a hundred part as in the hadith but we know that unless attributes are not created they cannot be created they are as I was just describing Allah and part of allah subhanahu wata'ala so how is this possible well when you associate something with allah azza wajal this is either an attribute of allah like a las hearing a las seeing a Las speech these are attributes of allah azza wajal are not created or they are things that are honored by Allah and hence Allah associate his name with them so when we say na Cotulla he the camel of Allah when we say beta logic the house of Allah these are at these are associated with Allah's name to honor them but they are his creation and likewise Alma's mercy is an attribute and there is a Las mercy which is his actions subhanahu wa'ta'ala in the authentic hadith the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam tells us that heaven and hell and Jenna to Anam they argued and disputed to Allah and the Jannah said only the weak and the poor enter me and hell objected and said only the arrogant and the tyrant entered me so allah said to the jannah you are my mercy i admit into you whomever I wish Jenna is a creation of Allah of course so when Allah says you are my mercy this indicates that the actions of allah azza wajal such mercy is created and Allah also says in the Quran who sends the winds as good tiding before his mercy what is meant by mercy here scholars say it is rain so before rain falls there is wind coming Allah described the rain to be his mercy so this is all part of Allah mercy that he bestowed upon us in this life which includes being merciful to those who associate others with him being merciful to those who say that he has a son being merciful to those who had burnt his servants and slaves and dug the ditches for them and threw them the fire allah azza wajal is merciful to all of those because his mercy overwhelmed his anger to the extent that he's merciful to them so that they can come to Islam so that they can repent don't you ask yourself i've been sinning for so many years why didn't allah send a thunderbolt and killed me why didn't allah azza wajal gave me a disease or poverty why is Allah giving me so much of his favours and blessings because his mercy overwhelmed and overcome his anger but don't be in safety and security because soon the wrath of Allah will come to you if you do not repent if you read the Quran just to highlight to you how important the issue of Mercy is you will find that in the Quran the name ar-rahman was mentioned 57 times and the name ar-rahim was mentioned a hundred and fourteen times subhanAllah what does this tell you that Allah wants you to love him that Allah wants you to look up for His mercy and to seek it his mercy and to seek His forgiveness but a believer who is flying in a vessel of worship of a Budhia of submission this aircraft has two wings one is the hope in allah smurfs e and the other is the fear of allah sloth if there is an imbalance between the two what will happen to the airplane it will fall so if your fear is far greater than your hope in Allah's mercy you will become despair and if your hope in Allah Smurfs II is far greater than your fear you will continue to make sin because every time you make sin and someone tells you fear Allah this is sinful you say Allah is more merciful and this is the imbalance that most of us Muslims fall under we need to have the balance and this balance between fear and the hope in Allah's mercy will drive you straight to Jannah may Allah make Jenna my adorn yours the prophet salallahu alaihe wa you seldom once visited a young man on his dying bed so he asked him how do you feel how do you find yourself the man is dying so the man said o prophet of allah i have hope in allah but I am afraid because of my sins the balance I have hope but I'm afraid so the Prophet said RA his salatu wassalam these two feelings the fear in the hope do not coexist in a person's heart in this situation while dying but Allah will give him what he hopes for and keeps him safe from what he fears Allah Akbar this is the feeling that we should have when on your dying bed fearful of your sins but positively thinking of Allah and hopeful in his vast mercy the Prophet also said alayhi salatu wassalam showing us the balance that we all have to have if the disbeliever knew of all that is with Allah of mercy he would never despair of paradise a disbeliever and if a believer knew of all that is with Allah of punishment and wrath he would never feel safe from hellfire this is the balance we have to attain and Allah loves us to look up and to look forward for any glad-tidings the prophet alayhi salat wa salam used to hate bad omens and never believed in them and he told us that whoever believes in bad omens he has committed an act of silk so if you're going out in the morning for an interview and you see a dead dog in front of your house is it I'm not going and you go back this is because you thought you your thoughts that this that dog has an impact on your destiny and this is thinking bad and negative of Allah while good omens are highly appreciated in Islam so when the Prophet used to travel a day his salat WA Salam and he hears someone calling his friend yah energy yeah fella and these names means success he becomes happy he said insha'Allah who is successful in our journey today thinking positive of Allah when in res what and soul hudaibiya the treaty of hudaibiya the man who came to negotiate was a disbeliever was a mushrik but his name was Sohail even Amma who later on accepted Islam may Allah be pleased with him when he heard that his name was Suhail meaning to be easy he said alhamdulillah today our affairs are easy so this kind of looking forward for others glad tidings is something that Allah loves your positivity is what Allah loves and if you have negative feelings this is something that Allah abhors the Prophet Allah solution once came out of his home and so his companions chatting talking and laughing so he addressed them as their elder brother and father and advised them and said by Allah if you know what I know you would laugh little and you would weep a lot and he went back to his home his companions heard this what did they do continue they started weeping and broke into tears this is how the Companions were so close to Allah so sensitive then Allah revealed to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and said muhammad why did you make my slaves despair so the Prophet acknowledged and went out to them again and said sallallahu alayhi wa he wa sallim he said try to be near perfection said did you work or abou and accept and receive the good and glad tidings that you will be rewarded so he gave them hope again laughing is not prohibited in Islam chit-chatting and having a good time is not prohibited in Islam as long as you do not cross the line when you worship allah azza wajal always remember that Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala extends his hand to those who committed sins at night Allah extends his hands in the morning so that they repent and he extends his hand in the evening for those who sinned during the morning and he has opened a door for repentance that is never closed until the Sun rises from the West Allah the Almighty says to his servants say o My servants who have transgressed against themselves do not despair of the mercy of Allah indeed Allah forgives all sins indeed it is he who is the forgiving and merciful all types of deeds that Allah forgives all types of sins that Allah forgives but I have done so many state sins in my life I have done since that I am ashamed even just to think of them allah azza wajal is most forgiving most merciful if you come to him he will never reject you if you go to him he will never close his doors in front of your face but you have to make the first step Abu al Shabab al masud or album dude he came to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam in another hadith of Homburg nambus and allah be pleased with him and with other companions narrating the same hadith a man so old that his eyebrows are covering his eyes and barely can walk came to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and said o prophet of allah what do you think if a man has committed all kinds of sins and has not left out any of them and he did not omit any minor or major sin but he did it can he repent so many of us have done heinous things in their lives things that they are ashamed of this man says I have not left any single sin on earth that I did not commit can I repent the Prophet said neither his salat WA Salam have you become a Muslim the man said ashhadu an la ilaha illaallah and you are the prophet of allah yes I am a Muslim he did the Shahada so the Prophet said alayhi salat wa salam do good deeds and abstain from bad deeds and Allah will make them all good deeds for you la ilaha illa Allah Allah will transform our sins if we repent into good deeds into hasanat so the man said even my betrayals and my immoral acts he said sallallaahu asylum yes then the man walked away saying Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar what more glad tidings are you waiting for all these hideous sins that you've committed Allah will make them good deeds if you make the choice and make the first step a man who killed a hundred souls with his bare hands goes to a scholar and says I've killed a hundred person can Allah forgive me if he comes to me I would say you're doomed in hell because I'm ignorant I do not know the mercy of Allah scholars know so the scholar said and who stays between you and Allah's repentance you kill the hundred that's a heinous crime but the city you're living in is an evil city and your company is an evil company go to the city of so and so there are righteous people they are committed people there are people of religion and worship Allah with them and this highlights to you the importance of good company it highlights you the importance of such gatherings where you come and listen to others religion learn and implement in yourself so the man walked immediately did not say okay I'll wait until June July when schools are out no he went to that town repenting to Allah xoauth on the way death approaches so ham Allah he's going to repent and death comes to him in the middle of nowhere when he sensed death was coming he did like the 100-meter sprinters when they come to the end of the line he did this meaning that he was trying to push himself to the limit until the last breath towards the the righteous town and he fell dead allah azza wajal sent down the Angels the angels of wrath and punishment and the angels of forgiveness and mercy they disputed the angels of wrath said he's ours he never done one single good thing in his life and the angels of mercy said he's ours he came repenting in seeking Allah's forgiveness and they disputed which means that the Angels have their own will and this is a different topic so Allah sent to them an angel as a judge but he gave him the form of a human being to highlight the status of humans to allah azza wajal and this angel told them measured the distance between the spot of his death to each town and whomever his closer to the angels will take him so they started measuring allah azza wajal ordered the righteous town to come closer and ordered the evil town to go further so the angels of mercy found that he belongs to them and he was admitted to Jana when you speak about Allah's mercy you will not find that there is a single sin that can overcome a Las mercy even if you worship idols even if you do even if you do the he is sins of all on if you repent before you die Allah will forgive you everything even if I repeat it even if you repeat it in an authentic hadith the Prophet says other his salat WA Salam when a servant of Allah sins and he says o Allah I have sinned please forgive me Allah replies to him and says all my slave my slave has known that he has a Lord who forgives sins and punishes for it I therefore have forgiven my slave his sins and after a while the slave does the sin again and he says the same thing and Allah replies in the same thing and after a while he does it for the third time and Allah the Almighty says my slave has known that he has Lord who forgives sins and punishes for it I therefore have forgiven my slave his sins he can do whatever he likes sin but you have to repent and this does not mean you have carte blanche to go ahead and sin forever what are we doing here share let's go and part in have good time and then ask Allah for forgiveness known as sure this man said yesterday in the break down session that falling into sin is a human weakness this is part of all of us the Prophet said Ali salatu salam all mankind are sinful Allah is so merciful that he made one door for his help for his punishment for his torment and that is sinning but he opened hundreds and thousands of doors for forgiveness for pardoning and for mercy so Allah says my mercy encompasses all things so I will decree it especially for those who fear me gives the cat and those who believe in our verses do you fear Allah do you fear Allah do you believe in his verses do you give zakat and this is one of the means of attaining a loss mercy also if you want Alma's mercy be merciful to all mankind the Prophet said alayhi salaatu Sam whoever is not merciful to the people Allah will not have mercy on him so you have to be merciful to the people all kinds of people Muslims kafirs all types of people you have to be merciful to them but specifically your children the Prophet was once al Islam in his gathering with his grandson Al Hasan or al Husseini and he was carrying the boy the child and kissing him and there was one of the nomads al Akram no hobbies and he was a tough man and he said to the Prophet al it's awesome you do this you kiss children I have ten boys of my own never ever had kissed one of them in my life bubala the Prophet said to him it's not my fault that Allah Azza WA JAL made you among those who are not merciful and made your heart as hard as stone he who does not have mercy is not having unless mercy so what you have ensure your compassion to your children when you hug them when you kiss them a lot of us men fail to show their feelings and affection kiss your child or should I kiss your child so what I'd rather he become a man so I play with him by boxing him and fighting him before going to bed no you should kiss him before he goes to bed you should hug your your your girl your child your daughter show them affection instead of showing them drought in feelings and famine in compassion specifically if they are girls the Prophet said that is awesome who ever is blessed with girls as daughters and he takes care of them they will be his visor from Hellfire you will not go to hell fire because of your daughters if you take care of them but if you do not take care of them you do not bring them according to Islam you do not care about their hijab and she says daddy I'm going with my boyfriend for Yandy the night out and you say ok take care of yourself what is this said ah I believe in freedom I believe in women's right I believe in me to movement this is what the Muslims now are facing the challenges when they are far away from Islam yes women have rights we have to give them their rights according to Quran and Sunnah not according to UN resolutions only according to the Quran and Sunnah or change your religion go we have 1.7 billion we don't need you you're not like Islam my Salam go so we need quality not quantity you want to have a less mercy have mercy even on animals in Lahore afyon your hip or if officiai equally allah azza wajal has prescribed that we are to be kind even when slaughtering an animal you have to be merciful yes yes I'm killing the animal what do you mean you have to do it in a merciful way sharpen your blade don't let the animal see with you coming to him with that with the knife and make it quick and Swift and don't slaughter an animal in front another animal in it in hedge I get shocked by the butchers who come and put 30 or 40 sheep with Malala but miss Malala but in all the sheep you can see them terrified watching us what is this I want to pray I want to go leave me because of the lack of mercy you want mercy the Prophet told us that a woman who is a prostitute was admitted to Jenna because she gave a drink of water to a dog this is a Las mercy that he's so forgiving he wants you to do something and he will forgive you no matter how small that thing is the happiest people on earth with Allah's mercy are those who conceal their sins if you do sins publicly Allah will not forgive you Allah the prophet says Allah sort of some cool Oh Oh Mattie Martha all of my followers my Ummah they will be forgiven and pardoned on the day of judgement except those who do sins publicly and this is why we advise our brothers and sisters in Bollywood in Nollywood in Hollywood in afterward I don't know what else they will be doing what is with the wood that is associated with movies I don't know but we advise them to fear allah azza wajal a las mercy is there you have to make a step and seek his forgiveness don't sing publicly because anyone following your footsteps you will be accredited with his sins and it will throw you in Hellfire on the day of judgement the Prophet says and the hadith was narrated in Bukhari and Muslim Allah will bring the believer close on the day of judgment and will shelter him with his scheme so Allah will cover me from all of humanity on the day of judgment and he will say do you remember such and such a sin do you remember such a sin and the servant of Allah will say yes o lord until allah azza wajal chose him all of his sins and makes him confess of them until the servant of Allah thinks that he is doomed when Allah shows you your sins what are you expecting definitely you are doomed then Allah will say I concealed it for you in the world and I forgive it and I forgive you for it today if Allah blessed you and conceived your sin in this dunya Allah would not hold you accountable on the day of judgment but you have to conceal it don't go to your friends and say well I yesterday I saw a movie la ilaha illallah you should go and see it well la yesterday I tried this bottle of scotch it was excellent brand go and try it wallahi i stole money from the tragedy and nobody figured it out i'll show you the way well I I found porn sites that are beautiful here it is www and the brothers are yes we're waiting Cher no you can seal these things and let them between you and allah azza wajal and finally be careful not to overlook the fact that Allah though he is most merciful yet he is severe in punishment look at the nations before you the people of the mood the people of had the people of knew the people of Pharaoh the people of loot all of these people were doomed and destroyed and thousands and hundreds of thousands were killed because they did not take their precautions away from Allah's wrath Allah says in the quran and thus is the seizure of your Lord when he sees the cities while they are committing wrong indeed his seizure is painful and severe indeed in that is a sign for those who fear the punishment of the hereafter that is the day for which the people will be collected and that is the day which will be witnessed i pray to allah azza wajal that he bestows upon us in this beautiful gathering his mercy to the fullest i pray to allah azzawajal that he makes me and you among the happiest to gain his mercy Allah whom allah fear allah noir Hamner Mojave Nawaf wanna watch I will deny periodical at arena was allahumma salli wa barik ala sayyidina muhammad wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in [Music]"
