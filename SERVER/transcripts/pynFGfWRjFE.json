  "transcript": "a brother says I hear narrations of the Sahaba and the Salaf praying tiem the whole night when did they sleep and how did they get the energy to pray all night and still be awake during the day first of all they did not pray all night they prayed most of the night we know that the way the Prophet used to pray is awesome he used to sleep 1/3 of the night then pray half of the night then again sleep 1/6 of the night this is the way he used to pray so there is an hour or two or maybe three to sleep during the night which is more than sufficient again the Prophet used to say pillu take your siesta because Devils do not take this yesterday so this 15 minutes or half an hour of your siesta during the day time this gives you a boost a boost that is energizing the people"
