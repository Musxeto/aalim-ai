  "transcript": "no Allah says it is permissible to fast or make an Umbra if we want any halal wish of our of ours fulfilled this is not part of the Sunnah don't go for agra for this reason go for Umbra because it's a blessed form of worship it's a blessed place it's a blessed time and while you are at it make dua this is totally legit but to simply fast not to worship allah rather to get your dua fulfilled or answer this is not permissible if someone does a form of worship for the sake of allah anticipating worldly reward from that there is no problem in that insha'Allah"
