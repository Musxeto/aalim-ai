  "transcript": "an anonymous questioner says I get lots of wish wasps about kufur I think many things are kufur that probably are Haram or maybe Hallett if I do one of these things do I say the Shahada again what happens if I don't to tell you the truth I get hundreds literally hundreds of similar questions every week there is a big problem with a lot of the Muslims and I get questions like my brother was speaking so I admonished him in a tone similar to my elder brother and I was imitating my elder brother when talking is this go for Subhan Allah where is Cooper someone says and another question I saw a man holding a hot piece of iron with three fingers and it was so hot he dropped it so I smiled and then I remembered that the Prophet Adam used to eat with three fingers so did I commit Cooper what is the relation between dropping a hot piece of metal that he was holding with three fingers with the Prophet eating with three fingers were you smiling so at the end of the day you come to a conclusion that there is a portion of Muslims who have allowed Satan to overcome their thoughts and their thinking process to the extent that he plays with them like children play with a football everything around them is doubtful and they don't know is it Cofer or not I heard someone calling the Adhan and I smiled I don't know if I should say the Shahada or not and they keep on going and going aji and auntie my brother and my sister my son and my daughter you have to save yourselves before it's too late knowledge is your beacon in life knowledge is the light that disperses all darkness around you when you do not have this knowledge this is when Shaitaan comes the Prophet said Ali salat wa salam that the virtue of a scholar is far greater than seventy worshipper because seventy worshippers are not immuned from the devil's playing with their minds on the contrary they can easily fall into his traps while a scholar with the grace of Allah and after that with the knowledge that Allah has bestowed upon him he can tell what's right and what's wrong and this is why when you keep on thinking does this nullify my Islam or not this means that you have issues you have a problem and this would not end here it would cascade down until it ruins your entire life and you have to be careful you don't want to end up like this so what do I do number one make a lot of a lot of drama the well-known dua when you stand up for night prayer allahumma rabba ji brillo is Rafaela omeka elevators immortal or the animal Rabia Shahada and kuma beta e by DK femur can you see here telephone ad mean so you're asking Allah for guidance with this beautiful dry which I don't have time to translate check it out and Fortress of the Muslim make a lot of door and your salute that Allah guides you enlightens you educates you secondly you have to learn your heart either you have to learn the basis of your religion so first of all you have to learn a lot of utiful names and attributes you have to recite the Quran with contemplation knowing that the seer you have to read the Sunnah of the Prophet is awesome so that you can learn what consists of covering what does not and you have to read the books of al-qaeda such as Gita Bhutto he'd cache for subbu had also to learn what actually nullifies your Islam like Noah Caudill Islam the things that nullify Islam the ten which share how many Margeaux have come compiled and others once you have a chopper or a helicopter view over these things you'll be inshallah safe and sound"
