  "title": "With the Prophet ﷺ‎ Episode 11(The Prophetﷺ‎ with People with Special Needs)- Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome to another edition of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman our beer a host for today's episode our subject deals with those who have special needs the disabled of course our focus is on how the Prophet peace be upon him interacted with these members of society we look forward to a fruitful conversation informative and fruitful conversation with our guest who's visiting us from Saudi Arabia a sheikh awesome al Hakim assalamualaikum welcome yt from Saddam what a lawyer or a cat to hundreds a from Allah her for having me it's our pleasure to have you we would like to continue as promised looking at and and both of us this is a reminder we have to be careful with our language we want to be politically correct we used to say some things but we have since redefined the terms that we use for people with disabilities who are hearing impaired sight impaired so on and so forth so this population no doubt requires special needs that's why we call them special needs persons Islamically how do we define and determine legally who is a should be viewed as a special needs person human hand allah saw was truly learn who are you know sorry he were many today who they're I'm a bad and as you've stated earlier in an introduction that the terminology itself is quite recent okay so in the past they might have used different words yeah so like handicap and all of these things that nowadays are considered to be insulted yes right in Islam it addresses the issue of disability such as someone who's lame who limps okay he walks someone who's blind someone who's paralyzed someone with an illness that cripples him all of these are considered to be disabled but if you look at the general definition then it has to do with a person who faces difficulties when it comes to education okay or physical difficulties or mental so difficulties an indication means that he has problems in learning I see so now we're moving into not so much physical but the psychiatric the mental yes he like those who with down syndromes and yes and the like then you have something to do with the physical disability he's unable to walk he's unable to see he's he's deaf he cannot speak etc so all of these are considered to be disabled yes and they have certain rulings when it comes to Islam and there are those who and this is a gray area nowadays who are mentally challenged yeah and the reason for there's a profit motive behind it yet the pharmaceutical companies benefit by having people diagnosed with all these things and the psychiatrists and the strings and the whole nine yards they all make money out of it now the Islamic point of view is you're either sane or insane so if you are insane you're not accountable the Prophet aerosol sallam told us that the bit the pen is uplifted meaning Allah would not hold a person accountable if he is saying until he regains his sanity mm-hmm okay so but nowadays we have different categories of mental illnesses and they tend to tell you what that this guy has depression I don't know what how do you pronounce it sighs you for any color yes get a friend yes anything I know I have problems with pronouncing this and m'lip because we do not get encountered with and in this likes so they justify their sin they're misbehaviors by this psychiatric illness so is it a sanity or insane my my IFRIC was some of my friends in Africa they joke with me and tell me that you know you Western people have diseases that we don't that don't exist for us correct this is C and this is why islamically we have to look into it analyze it and then we can come if someone has an OCD okay is it justifiable for him what he does hmm he or is he accountable in front of the law and in front of Sharia some countries may say that okay he killed someone but he was not in his right state of mind in Islam he's a murderer so is he sane or insane if he's insane and proven to be insane in this case he's not accountable so we have to look at all of these combined when we come in contact with physically challenged or disabled at disability or the like you know it's well-known fact that in pre-islamic times Arab society if you were born a girl we know about the custom it was not uncommon for the girls to be murdered at birth unfortunately also special needs persons were not dealt with in a in a dissimilar way oftentimes they would find themselves murdered there were there was a lack of and there's a reason that what I want to get to as a reason the thinking the beliefs that in the views that people had at that time about disabled persons that it was their fault the father or the grandfather committed sins it was some spiritual thing it was they were disgusting they needed to be gotten rid of that we were joking about them openly and humiliating them how did you slum change all that okay first of all it was not the Arabs the Arabs shortcomings before Islam was that the were disgusted of anyone with a physical disability or who was challenged and they considered them to be something evil to stay away from yeah but they never kill them this was prevalent in Europe and the likes where they used to think that they were possessed with demons okay so anyone with a strange way of looking with a hunchback with a disability they would either execute them kill them because they were possessed they had jinn in them or they would leave them to die not take care of them because they're not productive they cannot work in the factory they cannot fight in wars they cannot bring money even even as recently as 60 years ago the Nazis were killing such persons yeah well the doubts these are different because they claim they look for the supreme race so anyone who is not from their race they used to kill and among them Institute of course in the gas chambers and what the heinous things they had done to them but this is not the case in the previous centuries in Europe for example and in the states till recently they used to take them into the circus and make fun of them they used to display them look at the Elephant Man look at this shortest person in the world the tallest person in the world and they would take them as freaks now Islam when it came it changed all of this and it gave them their true humanity their dignity and their respect there is a great need for us to look into how such people with special needs are being treated it's not a one in a million it's more than that it is reported according to the w-h-o the World Health Organization that IMF the International Monetary Fund that there is about a billion people with special needs that's an eighth of the human population fifteen percent to be exact and this is a lot so now if you can not just simply ignore or neglect this huge category you have to deal with them and you have to deal with them properly as we can learn this from the way of the Prophet Harry sighs so one thing that we can point to that differed you know we do we do have one at least one perhaps more u.s. presidents who have served who were disabled the most famous yes most famously him Roosevelt who was abound into a wheelchair he had it he was not the only there were others I can't call them all but that was a very that's the highest office in the US government but fourteen centuries prior to that we have the example of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him elevating disabled persons to high positions and having great responsibilities I'd like to open up the discussion of these examples citing some examples one of them has served us is it abdullah bin un khatoun um Mac - Mac - yes okay Abelardo Maktoum is known to be the blind man and whenever a blind man is mentioned he comes to mind because in the Quran there is a chapter talking about him when Allah says I pass away to Allah and jam that the Prophet s llem frowned and turned his back when the blind man came to him the incident was that the Prophet as was giving was calling the dignitaries of Korus the idol worshipers so imagine someone who is in their position in their wealth and social status the Prophet is giving them dower when someone comes who is not among them who is poor who is with special needs blind and insists that you teach him who would you take care of so the Prophet as Salaam did not reprimand this blind man he did not shout at him he did not say anything to him what did he do he just frowned the prophet only frowned okay did the blind man see that of course not yet Allah revealed a surah teaching the Prophet a lesser son not to do this this man wants the truth these dignitaries you trying to sell them the truth and they're not buying because they are disbelievers so Allah is telling the Prophet as Salam go with the person who's interested now everyone knows among the Muslims it is will he talk about the surah that it is evening o mimic - it is this is the blind man now this blind man was mentioned in the Quran because he was highly interested in learning and he was a learned man in the sense that though he was disabled the prophet alayhi salatu salam made him the ruler of medina deputizing him twice in his lifetime okay now if the Prophet Allah saw some goes on an expedition goes to war that blind man cannot see so it wouldn't be really wise to have him with you fight yes I I would like to you're touching on something I'd like to get into after our break these special were concessions or permissions to the disabled we'd like to take a short break and come back to continue our conversation assalamu alaikum welcome back to with a profit we're continuing our conversation looking at a special need persons were the disabled who lived around the Prophet peace be upon him and looking for examples to follow in so that we can apply in our lives as we live with the Prophet Sheikh before the break we you had talked about this blind man who had been appointed twice as the ruler of Medina and you were just getting into I don't know if you'd like to finish up on this but also move into this issue of I mean obviously someone who is not able to walk should be granted an excuse and exemption of permission not to have to go and fight in wars can you talk more about the these kinds of is that the Arabic word Lucas yes well the concessions are there see Allah Azza WA JAL that does not burden us with what we cannot bear so allah doesn't tell us to fly we don't have wings if we're sick and are unable to fast allah tells us don't fast make it up when you become well again and when there is the need to fight for jihad allah doesn't tell you if you are challenged if you have special needs to go and fight and kill yourself and these are some of the concessions for example okay we know and that it is one of the pillars of islam to perform hajj however when a person is unable then there is no compulsion there is no forcing him to perform hajj allah awj l stated in the quran that hatch is mandatory upon those who are capable to yes so if you're physically unable in the in the hadith in the side of bahar Ian and others a woman came with her father father unable to sit on the saddle and she said o prophet of Allah my father is old and he's unable to settle on a saddle he cannot sit and remain on the saddle hmm so can I perform Hajj on his behalf okay so the Prophet said yes this is a concession okay which means that because of your so so it's not just permission like an excuse or an exemption a waiver no it's that it can be transferred to you by the actions or of another person the action part has nothing to do with a disability I can perform Hajj on behalf of my deceased father mm-hmm okay so this is okay this is called Hajj Bethel the point is that the man just because he's unable to sit on the saddle he was exempted from performing Hajj now if he's able financially to appoint someone yeah to deputize someone to perform it on his behalf it's a must and this is what what the girl was asking for I see Allah mentioned this in the Quran when Allah says in two places in the Quran that there is no burden there's no sin upon the blind upon the lame who is unable to walk properly and upon the ill allah Sojin has uplifted any type of burden or sin when they're unable to fight or to act now this illness is a blind lame or ill illness is not influenza or a common cold this is something you know more serious than that definitely this is something that hinders a person from executing or fulfilling 'unless commands if someone has a cut in his pinky it definitely says oh I cannot fast and I cannot go for Hajj and I cannot go for jihad this is nonsense it's something that is crippling ya something that is making you unable to do these such persons probably more likely not able to even do their day-to-day activities yes and and also even those who had excuses we're not happy with it at the time of the prophetess I'm Robin in Jammu for example may Allah be pleased with him he had four grown-up adult sons who were like lions real big and tough strong fighters and they came with their father to the to the Prophet as Salam they were complaining and he was complaining I'm said and he had a severe injury in his leg that made him lame he limps you know in the battlefield you have to run you have to a charge and and do things and move right and left if you don't you gonna be killed so I'm came to the Prophet that I saw to sir with his sons his sons are saying o prophet of Allah our Father is insisting to go out to battle with you and we tell him we are four of your offspring right right we're four fighters will take charge and we will do what is needed to be done enough mmm and I'm says o prophet of Allah they are preventing me from dying in the cause of Allah as a martyr and with this limp and I have with this leg I am hopeful that I will walk with it in paradise so the Prophet told him as Salam and this is what what we brought this story for the Prophet told him hammer allah has exempted you from fighting you have the concession you don't have to you permitted not to fight okay and and this shows you how islam deals and treats with those who have special needs you have to admire his his attitude though yeah and then the Prophet looked at his sons and he told them if he wants to die in the cause of Allah hmm it's his wish why deprive them from it so he insisted and he went to the hall okay good and he died as a martyr and he is he shot a Loki yeah well it's a great story and it the way he wanted it to I'd like to ask you about the Prophet we talked about servants in one of our in our previous episodes his he was a very special man peace be upon him the Prophet was he was a very loving merciful man and it of course extended to those special needs persons around him in terms of visiting them providing for them caring for them what kinds of stories do we get in this regard there are so many yeah see you and I if we were approached by someone who is mentally challenged would we spend time talking to them or we have so many more important things to do I'm not gonna waste my time with this or this guy who is not intellectually in my level mmm the Prophet Allah saw Salam in an authentic hadith a woman who was mentally challenged meaning that she was not her age she had mental problems came to him and she said I want to speak to you now she's not talking to a manager of a company or a supervisor in the department she's talking to the head of the state who has tons on his plate yet the Prophet alehissallaam said choose the time and I will sit and talk to you so she took the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they walked in the streets of medina telling him about her needs and you can expect it was something that is so silly and trivial to anyone but the Prophet as Salaam gave her the due respect mm-hmm and showed her that she is a human being and that she is like any other of these companions have she has the right to come and ask of him whatever she wanted mm-hmm okay good example we touched earlier in our discussion of Rochas about how there could be concessions made if of course the Hajj as you said is obligatory if you can are able and basically and financial financially okay what about other acts of worship our prayer fasting so on and so forth we expect this to be extended to other forms of connect of worship as well correct this is totally correct that whenever you are unable allah azza uplifts any problem from not being able to do it so it all revolves around the ability and we have two hadith well-known in the serie and in the sunnah one of its Bandar bin Malik mm-hmm who was old blind and he came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he said to him or prophet of allah i live far away from your masjid and between us there's a Valley so floodwater may and come and cross and so many times I'm unable to come and pray so can you come to my house and offer prayer so that I and my people would use that place as a Masjid a mosque to pray and now come again if someone asks me or you to do this we would have a hundred of excuses of time I'm busy I've commitments and not the profit is awesome he immediately and humbly said to this man with special needs I will come and he came to him the following day with Abu Bakr with OMA mm-hmm the whole entourage and he said to him what do you want me to pray for you and the man pointed out and the Prophet prayed and led them in prayer there and he left and they took this place as a machine the other famous story which was reported by Imam Muslim in in the sahi and others with ebony o mimic to whom we mentioned earlier the blind man yes he came to the Prophet as sermon he said o prophet of Allah my far my house is far and medina at night is scary a lot of reptiles and so on and I don't have someone to lead me to the Masjid so can I pray home the Prophet said yes and the man walked out of the message and then the Prophet said bring him back and he was brought back and the Prophet said repeat your question again so the man repeated it then the Prophet said to him I assume do you hear the Adhan and the man said yes meaning that he is within the vicinity of the master of the message then the Prophet told him say is awesome no I have no concession for you you must attend the prayer so both men were blind yet its ban was far away from the Masjid with a flood coming in between while even though my Maktoum was close by to the Masjid and within a walking distance it could have managed to do this so the if all of it revolves around the issue of availability mmm got it we will have to conclude our discussion right here and we pray that Allah accept our efforts thank you so much but like Al Ahly and thank you for being with us we will conclude today's episode right here and inshallah continue with the show with a profit our upcoming subject deals with the elderly until then assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahu apricot"
