  "transcript": "in alhamdulillah [Music] sh for it was reported in IM Muslim that abdah may Allah be pleased with him man with his father narrated that the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam said none of you should die but believing well in Allah but believing positiv in [Music] Allah the Hadith on the surface is an instruction and an order from the prophet Alat wasam not to die but it is not as it appears because you have to read the whole thing so the prophet is telling you do not die except in a state that you think positively that you think well of Allah and to die on a state on a particular state is not in our hands Allah only knows how we will die whether we will die doing well whether we will die on sin may Allah protect us all from that and that is why the prophet is telling us do your level best that when death comes you think positively of Allah you think well of Allah and if you do your best Allah is going to fulfill what you hope and wish for and that is why the scholars say that you have to think well of Allah Asel especially at the time of death or when you are on your death bed and they used to love they used to recommend that when someone is on his dying bed that he is reminded of his Good Deeds of his beautiful virtues so that he would face Allah thinking well of him and this is done by reminding him of the verses in the Hadith of Allah's forgiveness of Allah's mercy of Allah's kindness so while he's on his dying bed or his death bed he is thinking positively of Allah an Malik may Allah be pleased with him narrates that the prophet visited a young man on his dying bed and he said to that dying man how are you how do you feel the Arabic translation of the word how do you find yourself and the man said oh prophet of Allah I am hopeful and Wishful in Allah Asel but I fear my sins look at this beautiful balance that we must have it in our lives if we would like to gain Allah's pleasure the prophet saidat wasam by Allah they are not joined in a position such as yours except that Allah would give you what you wish for and Allah would protect you from what you fear this balance of being hopeful and Wishful but at the same time feeding your sins and thinking well of Allah is not only limited on your dying bed it is a concept that must be with us 24/7 this is how we should think of Allah all the time so a Believer his conviction is that Allah if you seek his forgiveness he would forgive you if you supplicate to him he would answer you and if you need him he will suffice you this is what the conviction of a Believer should be unlike most of the Muslims nowadays I have people coming to me and saying she if I wish for something I know Allah is not going to make it I know that Allah is not going to do it that's why I don't think of this I don't plan for the future because I know Allah will not do this for me this is definitely not what Allah instructed us to do and that is why the prophet saysat wasam Allah the almighty says in the I am as my servant or as my slave thinks of me so you think Allah Asel would forgive you Allah will forgive you but if you think that Allah asael would not fulfill your wishes Allah will not fulfill your wishes and you will be sinful beside that and that is why part of thinking positively of Allah Asel is to have your full Trust and dependence on him this is what we call and says that it is unimaginable that a person thinks well of Allah and then he does not trust him and he does not depend on him and he does not rely entirely on him because this is a byproduct of thinking well of Allah that you trust Allah subhanahu waa Muslims are two extremes and a middle path as usual in everything and this also applies on trusting Allah so on one extreme you have a lot of us claiming to believe well in Allah but if you look at their actions you will find that they are in indulged in sin and that they are in sin up to their necks and they are neglectful they are ignorant they seem to forget that Allah asael punishes those who sin and Allah has created and prepared great torment for those who go out of the straight path and on the second extreme you find people working hard trying to follow all the necessary means in this life in this dun however they think negatively of Allah asael they think badly of Allah asael and the majority of mankind they think that they are being treated un unjustly may Allah give us forgiveness all they think that they are being treated unjustly and you've heard this so many times life is unfair Subhan Allah life does not give or take away it is Allah that gives and the one who takes away [Laughter] subhah oh Allah Lord of all Dominion you give dominion to whomever you please and you take it from whomever you please and you exalt and you honor whomever you please and you humilate whomever you please subhah wa tala so it is Allah that gives and takes away it's not life yet people always have this negative concept Allah they don't say they do they not say but they say life is unfair everyone sees that he's not getting what he deserves everyone when he looks at others he is unfortunate everyone gets what they want and look at me and if you search a little bit deeper you will find among the Muslims a lot of them who blame their Destiny who blame their faith and they say it shouldn't have been like this this is wrong I shouldn't have lost my job I shouldn't have lost my wealth this should not have hap had happened to me so they are blaming Allah's Destiny and this leads us to the second point which is part and a great sign of you thinking well of Allah that you submit your will to Allah that you submit to Allah's destiny and you accept whatever Allah decrees upon you because if you don't if you reject if you object then there is something wrong in your Iman and the worst of those who think badly and negatively about Allah Those who commit sin because look at that person who earns his income from Haram why are you doing this he said this is the only way to live in this country or in in other country why are you giving bribes he said without the bribing people I cannot make a successful deal and I need to make an income so do you think that your income comes from Haram or your income comes from Allah Asel who is your provider who is your Giver who is the one that puts the bread on the table is it you is it your own work who gives you the paycheck at the end of the month is it your boss or is it Allah who provides for you so they think and believe negatively and badly about Allah look at that sister who is not abiding by the hijab who is not going in accordance to what the Quran and the Sunnah State why are you doing this she says if I don't this my if I do not do this my husband would divorce me my in-laws would not accept me I live in a joint family and I cannot live with my brother-in-law or brothers-in-law wearing the hijab wearing theab so if I don't do this my husband might hate me he might divorce me so who do you want to please you want to please Allah or you want to is your husband look at that person who thinks negatively about Allah by not paying zakat on its time Brothers come to me and say I postponed paying zakat for two or three years why said well I was investing my money and I thought that I might need this it would increase my profit so I said Allah is Kim Allah is generous Allah is most forgiving two three years and they don't pay the zakat the brother why don't you give sodak we need money to help our brothers in Syria in bourma in Burma and anywhere we need money to expand the Masjid we need money to feed a poor family we need this and that why aren't you giving sodaka he says well I'm afraid if I give sodaka this would affect my financial status Subhan Allah who is the provider it is Allah the almighty and that is why those who thought negatively of Allah Allah made them on their own and he did not support them and he did not give them tul proper on Allah subhanahu wa there's a very thin line between thinking well of Allah and deception and being deceived and to imagine how can a a person be deceived or not and to understand thoroughly the meaning of thinking well of Allah there's no one to explain this better than the prophet Alat and his companions may Allah be pleased with them this is the balance that we miss in our lives so many aspects of our lives are not governed by balance in general and by balance in thinking well of Allah in particular the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam and his companions they were the best of humanity they were the cream of the society they did a lot of good deeds they prayed night prayer they fasted voluntary fasting they did Jihad they gave all their wealth for the cause of Allah and they did not sin and they avoided sin as much as possible to the extent that we sometimes think are they Angels or humans they kept away from sin to the extent that even if some of them sinned it would not be 01 of what we do so they did a lot of good deeds but at the same time they did not do any sin or it was negligible yet they thought well well of Allah and their fear of their sins did not go against thinking well of Allah subhana tala so how can we compare us how can we compare ourselves to them alassan Al basri may Allah have mercy on his soul he says that the believer thought well of Allah Asel and this was interpreted in his actions so he did well as well while the hypocrite thought negative about Allah and this was portrayed and displayed in his actions and that's why he did bad actions and he sinned and that is why AB may Allah have mercy on his soul says that whoever claims to believe well in Allah yet at the same time he does not fear Allah then he is delusioned he is deceived whenever you think well of Allah yet you don't feel your sins then let it be known that you are being deceived and Shan is deceiving you the majority of Muslims are like this they are so up in their sins up to the next they are so into disobeying Allah yet they grab on to evidences from the Quran and Sunnah about Allah's Mercy about Allah's forgiveness and about Allah's kindness and this is good and they claim that we think well of Allah but at the same time if you're doing sins and you are depending on Allah's forgiveness without offering anything without showing Repentance deep remorse to Allah and asking for forgiveness then you are deceived and if you add to that that they do not submit their will to Allah's decrees they do not accept and they're not satisfied but whatever Allah decrees upon them though they know theoretically that whatever Allah decrees is good they know this theoretically but when it comes to practice rarely you will find people accepting this fact if you look at all of this and you ask them how are you they start to give you a long list of complaints I can't pay the rent I have so much debt on me the misses ran away the kids are abusing drugs I my landlord is this and that my neighbors are this and that but at the end of the day alhamdulillah what kind of alhamdulillah are you giving after all this long list of complaints these people did not give Allah's worth they do not estimate Allah as he's supposed to be subhanahu wa taala they only only look at Allah's forgiveness kindness and mercy and they neglect that Allah has ordered us to cut off the hand of a robber to flog someone who consumes intoxicants to Stone an adulterer who decreed this they forget that with all the sins they have that Allah will definitely forgive our sins even if we do not repent even if we do not ask Allah for forgiveness didn't you read in theah that the prophet told us that Allah admitted a woman to hell because she kept a kitten a cat in her house until it died she neither fed it nor let it out to eat Allah admitted a woman to hell because of a cat what about your wife that you abuse what about your children that you do not care about what about the income of Haram money and the deception and the lies you give and say so that you keep your job or you get benefits from here or from there so how are you in security thinking that Allah would forgive your sins if you are like this therefore we should think well of Allah Asel and fear our sins and we should be like the prophet Alat whom Allah forgave all of his previous sins and coming sins as well yet he kept on praying until his feet were swollen and when he was asked he said shouldn't I be a a thankful and an obedient servant of Allah therefore let us fear Allah subhana wa taala let's think well of him and let's start regretting and fearing our sins and by that we would be fulfilling the instruction of the Prophet Alam none of you should die except thinking well of Allah oh Allah forgive our sins oh Allah make us steadfast on the straight path oh Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala Grant Victory to our impoverished Muslim Brothers in Syria and in Burma and in Palestine in every place where the Muslims are being attacked and abused Ya Allah oh Allah get us back to the straight path and grant us to hold fast to the Quran and to the Sunnah grant us the will and the power to follow the Sunnah of the prophet and to make it our guides to your Paradise"
