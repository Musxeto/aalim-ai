  "transcript": "he says that a sibling has a Haram companion or a partner and they the family are forcing him to speak to her usually a girlfriend so is this permissible the answer is definitely not even if she's your father's girlfriend if your father is doing Haram relationships and he has a girlfriend and he wants you to speak to her or to treat her in a cordal way this is totally prohibited it is not permissible to compromise your religion this is the only thing that we're proud of our religion and it's the same when people in Europe or in the west say that Islam ideology has to be changed and it must not be promoted blah blah blah what Islam are you talking about they say the Islamic ideology political Islam uh this and that they put categorizations and can you tell us what Islam is accepted to you so that we can check with our Quran and Sunnah if this version is permissible or not they would not give you something that complies with the Quran and Sunnah so in essence they want you to change your religion those around you who fall into sin they want you to change your religion they're not happy with your Chastity they're not happy happy with you following the Quran Sunnah they want you to be indulged in the same filth they in so if you take a girlfriend you're the man and if you oppose them taking girlfriends and normalizing relationships like this this is normal everybody's doing it then you're extremist and you're going to be a fanatic Subhan Allah when I follow my religion I'm a fanatic and extremist when a woman wears the nikab she becomes an extremist but when she wears a bikini or a thong she's a good modern civilized woman what kind of nonsense is this inam abide by your religion remain steadfast and don't look around to what these ignorant imbeciles say and ignore it totally Hamza"
