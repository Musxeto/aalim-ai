  "transcript": "as from india he says what's your ruling on watching movies and skipping the haram part are you serious no one can skip the haram parts you're watching a movie all of a sudden a woman in a bikini comes up what are you going to do fast forward fast forward no it's not still there still there if i ask you what's the measurement of that woman you have given it to me so you are actually watching sin the music is there and no matter how careful you are no matter how a big sheikh or an imam you are give it a couple of weeks and you will be as rotten as everybody else this is how shaytan works shaytan doesn't come to me and say why don't you fall in adultery why don't you have a relationship you're crazy but he will come to you with a video clip with a short song with some music in the background until you let your guard down and think that this is i can watch these things and then he raises the bar bit by bit by bit till the inevitable happens watching movies is one of the closest ways to take you to hell and this is a dire warning to the people especially those who do not have knowledge i could spend for hours about this because i've met people i've sat with people and i know the impact that such movies have netflix or programs or stand-up comedies or talk shows or it's all steps of shaytan you ask yourself would this get you closer to allah or further away from it from him definitely it will get you further away from him ask yourself how many jews of the quran have i memorized how many do i recite every day how am i with the athkar what knowledge do i have about my religion zlich nothing and this is how shaitaan penetrates your defense lines so this is not permissible at all it's how"
