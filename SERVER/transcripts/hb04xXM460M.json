  "title": "Can woman travel without male mahram if journey is less than 1 day or 3 days (Hadith Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um she there are female relatives of mine who are my M they plan to go to marania our country of origin and unfortunately they want to travel there without a adult male Mah who reach the age of puberty and um I try to explain that that it's not permissible but they are but one of my female relative Tred to justify it by using the Hadith where said it is not per for a woman who beli in Allah and the last day to tr to travel for one day and night except with a M so she tried to she tried to explain that she can travel below 24 hours but traveling in the past not like today today with a plane you can take much distance short SP of time so I try to explain that it's about the distance 24 hours but she does not accept this explanation of my soul what should I do okay first of all uh CI it is an issue of dispute among Scholars when it comes in regards of traveling the vast majority of schools of thought say that is prohibited according to the Hadith and small amount of Scholars say that it is prohibited except for Hajj and they give their explanations but for General travel the vast majority of them say it's prohibited why because there is a Hadith they counter that by saying there are other hadiths which state that it is not permissible for a woman that believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel the distance of three days and the distance of a male that is m a i l that it takes M and some say that in another Hadith the distance of a day and a night so she or they as your relative argues is an is a clear evidence that as long as it's within this time frame it is permissible this is the problem when people don't have knowledge and they don't refer to the people of knowledge if you ask the people of knowledge the scholars the real Scholars they'll clarify this for you because now there are hadiths 3 days two days a day and a night and the distance of male traveler uh uh the postman or indefinite so is there a contradiction in the religion definitely not then where is the contradiction it's in your head Scholars say that the prophet said these hadiths according to the person who questioned him oh prophet of Allah can a woman travel the distance of 3 days 2 days one day and he would say it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah in the day of judgment to travel the distance of 3 days according to your question two days according to your question one day according to your question but then he said and in it's an authentic Hadith without any shred of doubt it is not not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah in the day of judgment to travel without a male Mah so the word to travel is it's General there's nothing to specify it there's nothing to limit it so any type of travel and the Arabs know that travel means to go out of the boundaries and the borders of your own City but with in the city this commuting this is not traveling you can go from point A to point Z in your own City without a m Maham on your own maybe driving your own car but to travel from City a to City B which everybody acknowledges to be traveling this is prohibited because then if you want to use your relatives logic there is no restriction for a woman to travel anywhere on this planet because no area would take more than 3 days to travel by plane or two days maybe or even one day some people can go around the world in 24 hours so this does this mean that a woman can just pack her bags and go to the malds of course not it is not permissible for them to travel Mah and this is the teaching of the prophet and Allah Knows Best"
