  "title": "Pulling someone back from the complete row to avoid praying alone",
  "transcript": "[Music] the first question is from Muhammad and Muhammad says that if I come to a Masjid and the prayer the congregation has already uh started and the row the last row it's completely full and there's no one with me and I know that the prophet saidat that there is no prayer acceptable or valid for an individual behind the row so is it permissible for me to tap someone on his shoulder or pull someone from the row in front of me so that we could be two and form our own row and the answer is it's an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion is that it is not permissible for you to tap someone and to pull him so that he would go backwards and stand with you in the role because first of all you'll interrupt his concentration of prayer now imagine someone pulls you while you are in the midst of the prayer you're contemplating on the verses of the you're hearing and you are in a state of and all of a sudden this guy pulls you uh backwards you will completely be distracted throughout the whole prayer secondly the prophet says whoever connects a row Allah will connect him and whoever interrupts a row Allah would cut him or civer him or whatever this may uh be as a punishment from Allah and therefore it's not permissible for you to do this and and if you come and there is no possibility for you to join the last row sometimes a lot of the brothers seem to be relaxed when they stand in a row so they spread their legs and they keep gaps so many times if you go to the right or to the left and you just tap the four or five last uh men standing in the row together you will find a place for a man or two to join in but hypothetically speaking if it's completely full and everyone in the last row Mah is on the Sunnah they're shoulder Tosh shoulder foot to foot they are not leaving a single Gap and you are unable to join them in this case ISL may Allah have mercy and his soul said that it is permissible for you to pray on your own as an individual though the Hadith states that this is not valid because Allah says which means that fear Allah to the best of your ability and this is the best of your ability you can't pray in the dra so you have to pray and the Hadith Scholars say that this Hadith is referring to a person who comes out of ignorance or arrogance and looks and he doesn't want to uh uh stand in the row in the Gap here or there so he says I'm going to pray behind the Imam and form my own role someone will come this person's prayer is invalid"
