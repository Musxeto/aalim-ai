  "transcript": "uhh smellorama rahim al hamdulillah mo salatu was-salam ala rasoolillah he was early he was happy what many said we had ye was 10 the vicinity elio me Dean assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuhu and welcome to lessons in fib we're still in the chapter that deals with the manners of answering the call of nature and hadith number 83 it will be read by brother Mohammad and read it by Abu Qatada may Allah be pleased with him Allah's messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said no one should touch his penis with his right hand when urinating nor clean himself fortification or urine using his right hand nor breathe in the utensil he he is drinking from of course this hadith has lots of manners that we should apply after learning them for example what is the ruling on touching the private parts using the right hand of course we mentioned in previous programs that the right hand is only to be used for honorable things such as eating drinking calming perfuming it's the beginning to wear your clothings taking things from others handing things to others you should always use the right hand in these things as for the left hand it's used for the honorable things things that are filthy or dirty when removing dirt when removing filth when cleaning yourself from impurities from the jihad you should use your left hand so in this hadith of Matata may Allah be pleased with him the Prophet says do not touch your private parts with your right hand so this is clear now touching the private parts with the right hand this depends on when you are asking the call of nature but if you're not answering the call of nature it is a normal thing to do nevertheless earth man the third caliph in Islam and the son of law twice of the prophet alayhi salaatu son as man married to of the prophet's daughters the first one died he married the second one may allah be pleased with him earth man says that after I made baya after I gave the agreement and the oath to the Prophet SAW Selim to follow him as a prophet and messenger of allah azza wajal I have never ever touched my private parts with my right hand why because he shook hands with the messenger with his right hand so this right hand only is you is only used for honorable things having said that one does not think that we should tie our right hands behind their backs whenever we go to answer the call of nature you may use your right hand but you have to use your right hand not directly by holding it by holding your private parts and not directly by cleaning and wiping the private parts you can use your right hand when you are washing yourself by pouring the water with the right hand but cleaning yourself with the left hand also another manner that was mentioned here in this hadith patada says that the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam said that one should not breathe in the utensils he's drinking from and why is that the Prophet tells us something we follow without asking why but it is logical so the criteria here is that we do not ask why if the order comes from Allah or it comes from the Prophet array sort of Salaam you do not have the right to ask why you just follow because if you ask then you are not a servant anymore you become a master only masters ask each other why servants comply and follow and that is it nevertheless the wisdom and the justification is logical now the Prophet tells us do not breathe while drinking from a Tinsel's from a cup from a glass and why is that because by breathing something may fall down and what you're drinking by breathing people may drink after you would feel this gust by what you've done so one you would most likely wouldn't drink after someone that did this before you you won't you don't like people to breathe in the same glass that you're gonna drink from so the Prophet tells us do not do this and why should someone else use my glass to drink well this used to happen at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam in one instant Abu Hurairah tells us may Allah be pleased with him that 80-plus companions drank from a small glass of milk and this is one of the miracles of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam 83 or plus person grown-up adults drank from this small glass or cup or bowl of milk and they all had enough of it so people do drink after each other and this is normally you may drink of a cup of water and then someone finishes it off after you therefore one of the behaviors and manners of Islam that you do not breathe in the glass that you're drinking from and again it tells us how islam tells us to care for others feelings you don't live alone on this planet so you have to care for the feelings of others you have to care for them and for their feelings try not to pollute the environment try not to answer the call of nature under the shades or on their ways or even in stagnant water it's forbidden for a Muslim to urinate or to answer the call of nature in stagnant water water that is not moving why because this pool or this lake is gonna be used by people either for drinking or for washing and by you answering the call of nature by urinating in it or doing something similar to that you are making it filthy and unusable the following hadith is to be read by spindler of Munro him narrated by Salman wrote a loved one who Allah's messenger saw quarrei was salam forbade us to phrase the Qibla when defecating or urinating or to clean our salvus using the right hand or to clean ourselves with less than three stones or to clean ourselves with dung or a bone this hadith was reported by him a Muslim so it's regarded as the highest of all it's authentic hadith now Salman what what would Sandman does anybody know the name of the father of Salman sir well we don't know the name of the father you know that his title is a Pharisee the persian salman the persian from persia from Persia and Salman we don't know his father's name we don't know his brother's name we don't know anything about him except that he was the son of a big priest in Persia where they used to worship fire and his father wanted him to be a priest too and subhanAllah Salman had it in him that this was not natural fire is not a creator to be worshipped so he left he set out on a journey for finding truth and he went to many countries and he stayed with a group of Christians here and there priests serving them some were honest and were dishonest until they told him to go to Mecca to Medina because it is time for a messenger the final messenger seal of the prophets to come out and he will come out in this village in Medina and they gave him the description as found in the Torah and the gospel that the Bible the New Testament so he went there he was kidnapped and sold as a slave to a group of Jews and he worked there until the Prophet SAW Salah migrated from Mecca to Medina and then he came to the prophet and he gave the prophet a couple of tests just to know if he's the one if he's the chosen one if he's The Messenger of Allah so gel and once it was proven to him that he was indeed a messenger of allah sallallahu seldom he embraced the Prophet SAW said Allah and he declared this LOM and the prophets are Salam from there on took him as one of his closest companions and whenever any of the Companions would say what's your family tree he would say that my father is Islam I have no father but him he never said that I am the son of so-and-so or the king so-and-so he is the son of Islam salman al-farisi was a great companion of the Prophet and so Salam this hadith originally is found in Sahih Muslim and it has a story it's it's a nice story but it's a story that we should learn from the hadith says that a group of Jews came to Salman and they were complaining and they said Sandman your messenger sallallaahu a value seldom taught you every single thing even how to defecate give me a break is this logical this possible the Prophet your messenger teaching you every single thing even how to defecate because they're trying to mock of our religion if you look in other religions you would find general things and that details that is why you have interpretations of men and that is why you have laws regulations that can change from one time to the other Islam is not like this Islam has been here for the past 15 centuries and it's here to stay as we believe as Muslim we believe that this religion of Allah will prevail and will dominate the whole earth and if you look at it you would find the powers and strength of it because it is suitable for every time generation and for every location people in the u.s. cannot say well this doesn't apply to us we can't do this people and he says Asia cannot say that well this is difficult is Lama is practical for all humankind so when they asked Salman your prophet has taught you everything even if ocation he said yes he did he taught us and he said the hadith that you've just heard from Noor he said he told us not to do so and so and so and so he listed the manners that one should follow through the process of answering the call of nature and the catch here is that our religion is perfect and no one could come and say that well Allah has forgotten this he should have did this my cameraman says that we have to break now so insha'Allah stay tuned and we will be right back let's go so this is something that you have to point out to the to them in the Bible something which is I think very rarely needed by the youth which is staying firm and the truth this is just one of the greatest examples for me of how to control your anger within the framework of being the cleanest religion the clearest jurisprudence and in the meantime the kindest religion to animals watch let's talk with Helene eminent as he interviews guests and discusses a variety of topics everything from youth issues to religious issues join us here on TV salam aliekum wa rahamtullah and welcome back brother nor can you please read the hadith again okay narrated by Salman radiyallahu anhu Allah's messenger sallallahu alehiwassallaam forbade us to face the Qibla when defecating or urinating or to clean ourselves using the right hand or to clean ourselves with less than three stones or to clean ourselves with dung or a bone okay so let's go on trying to study the manners advancing the call of nature in this hadith the first instruction is that the Prophet forbade us to face the Hitler when defecating or urinating and this is similar to the following hadith of ABI Ayub and who is to read this hadith abideth please go ahead brother Zakir one who almost Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam see neither face north turn your back to the Qibla while defecating or urinating but turn towards the east or the ways okay so I think it's appropriate more appropriate to go on to hadith about you as it's the first part of hadith Salman which is facing the Qibla now in the hadith that brother Zakir has just read booble Ansari may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallaahu alayhi wa heard he was seldom neither face nor turn your back to the Qiblah while urinating or defecating so this is about a EWP's version of not doing this and there are seven approximately seven different opinions for scholars regarding this issue the first of course opinion of all is it's forbidden completely to face or to give you back to the Qibla when your innate or defecating whether you are in the open or whether you are concealed within indoors in a bathroom or in a toilet it's completely forbidden there and then they go on by saying well it's okay in buildings but it's not okay in the open and then another opinion say it's okay when you are difficult but it's not okay when you're urinating and the other one says it's okay to give your back to it it's not okay to face it and and go and so on and so on until you reach an opinion a weird opinion that says that you may not even face or give you back to the Sun or the moon when you are urinating or defecating and then what what should i do then I'm surrounded I can't go east west north south or whatever I'm surrounded from all directions well this is completely unacceptable and authentic the last one the Sun and the moon has nothing to do with your urinating and defecating while table a dance and qibla as you know is the direction Muslims face when they're praying so it's the black big black building in Mecca which is called al kaba and all Muslims all over the world know the whole 1.5 billion of them and still counting face every single day five times a day when they are praying and this by large by far this is the greatest sign of unity they face the same direction they say the same words Allahu Akbar Allah is great or greater and they recite the same verses of the Quran they do the same movement as a sign of their obedience and worship of Allah the Almighty so the Qibla has a special place in our hearts it's a place that we face when we are praying that is why Salman says that the Prophet says Allah seldom that the Prophet forbade us to face the Qibla now he did not say to give our back to the Qibla a boy you've said that we may not face nor give our backs to dr. bloure as in this hadith now so what's the authentic opinion of all is it okay or is it okay as I said that there are different opinions of scholars Sheikh al-islam Tamiya and even his student even if I am may Allah have mercy on them all say that it is not permissible to face or to give your back to the Qibla while urinating or defecating whether you are indoors or outdoors it's completely forbidden and the hadith that backs this up is about you bodies the one that brothers like he just has just read because the longer version says that after a boy you've said this he said and when we went to sham region sham is a name that is we call the countries of Palestine Jordan Syria and Lebanon the whole area is called sham a sham so what you've says that when we went to a sham we found that the toilets are in the direction of al kaba or our Qibla so we used to take sides so if we're facing the table like this he says we used to divert and ask Allah for forgiveness Yani if it was if it were okay to face the Qibla in doors he wouldn't have diverted he wouldn't have taken sight but though they were in doors facing a wall and a building and so on yet he still considered that facing it is forbidden as the Prophet SAW sallam said and this is the most authentic verdict of all nowadays it's almost impossible to do this with modern toilets because if it's built on the side on the direction of the Qibla there isn't any possible way of diverting special because of the nature of how it's built but if it's a must and you don't have any other choice or solution then you may answer the call of nature in that direction ask a large social for forgiveness if you're building a house it's completely forbidden for you to build it to make your toilets and bathrooms in the direction of Alta Beulah I think I may ask you a question Fatih now what do you understand by saying turn towards the east or west is this political does the Prophet say that whenever you want to difficut face the east and west because politically speaking of course not at the downrod prophet they didn't have the Eastern powers and the Western superpowers I think he means just to deviate from like being facing the public just a different side okay so what happens if you are in let's say East Asia if I'm gonna follow this hadith I'm gonna face east or west then I'm gonna face Mecca I'm gonna face table so how can I apply this no like if you're always facing north towards the cobbler then just go east or west of it not okay then Medina people of Medina where is their Qiblah then you have to study geography to know this but you have to study so it's just to the south Mecca is to the south of Medina so if you are facing south then you are facing the Qibla if you're facing north you're giving your back to the Qibla so the Prophet says turn your face east or west do not face or give you back to the Qibla but in the in case that you are already in the east of the Qibla or the west of the Qibla then you should turn your face south or north so don't take it literally that you should do this manner no you should try to understand what the hadith says and implies going back to salman al-farisi hadith the Prophet forbid us from facing or giving her back to the tabla and he forbid us from using the right hand to clean ourselves after answering the call of nature and we've already gone through this and he also forbade us from using less than three stones and this is understandable if you're not going to use water so the minimum acceptable is using three wipes whether it's three stones or one stone that has different sizes that allows you to wipe three times without getting yourself or hand dirty but if you are using water than one wipe to wipe 3 wives regardless is it would do the job because you're following that with water and this is acceptable and the last and final thing that the prophets of Salim forbid us from cleaning ourselves with dunk so you may not use dunk as the droppings of animals are as we mentioned in a previous hadith this is the food for the animals of jinn and the bones are the food for our burdens from the jinn the bones Allah Azza WA JAL has gave the jinn these bones to be full of meat for them and this is something that we do not see and we may not be able to imagine but as Muslims we believe it and not everything that we do not see we not believe there are so many things that we do not see yet we believe in them such as Souls every and each one of us has a soul but do we see it know if a person dies his soul comes out do we see what came out no we do not but yet we believe in it everyone claims to have a have brains do we see our brains no unless somebody rips our heads off and then our woops something's missing well it's not necessarily to see to believe we believe that it exists and then and and and this is how we should comply with it these are some of the manners that the prophets Allah sallam taught us and the Companions have followed it to the letter and we ourselves should also follow it to the letter because this is a sign of our acceptance to Islam and and of our obedience to Allah the Almighty and again remember the Jews did not like us following every single step of the teachings of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam yet we do this because by doing it insha allah allah azza wajal will make us accompany the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam in paradise I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program and until we meet next time fear Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
