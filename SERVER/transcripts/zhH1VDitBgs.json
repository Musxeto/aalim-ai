  "transcript": "peace of Allah and blessings of Allah beond peace of Allah and blessings of Allah Beyond a prophet beond and bless of dear brothers and sisters in Islam yesterday we discussed with you an introdu uction to the battle of the trench and we spoke about the fuel of this battle those who ignited its spark and who usually contribute in igniting similar Sparks for chaos mayab turmoil and all C and all kinds and different types of Wars worldwide throughout history and these are are the Jews the prophet Alat wasam when he first came to Medina he was keen on coexisting he could have sallallahu alaihi wasallam rampaged all of the Jews at once and kicked them out but he did not do that sallallahu alaihi wasallam because he was always positive in his thinking he was always positive in his actions and he was hopeful that Allah May guide them the books of his history tell us that the prophet Alat wasam when he arrived to Medina the first thing he did was to meet with the different tribes of the Jews and to sign covenants and treaties with them so that they can work and Coexist on a mutual platform and one of these treaties was a treaty that was signed by the prophet Alam and the Jews of B and it stated on a number of issues among them that the Jews of B are a nation of their own with the Muslims they have their own religion and the Muslims have their own religion so we do not interfere with one another the Jews are responsible for their own financial matters and so are the Muslims so they are not interl each one has their own budget upon the point of agreement that each one should give Victory should assist in war anyone who fights the people who signed this treaty so if someone attacks the Muslims the Jews should stand with them and if someone attacks the Jews the Muslims would defend them number four that they have the right of mutual advice and being sincere as long as it is in goodness and avoiding evil and number five that that no one takes the burden after his allies so if the Jews were allied with another tribe and this tribe did something against the Muslims the Jews are not held accountable and likewise if an ally of the Muslims did something to the Jews the Muslims are not held accountable they have to avenge the oppressed and this is number six number seven if the Jews were to be attacked they have to provide financial assistance to the Muslims in order for them to be able to defend them and that the boundaries of Medina and what's inside Medina is totally prohibited for those who signed this treaty and Covenant so they don't attack one another inside and whenever there is a dispute then they should refer it back to the Quran and to the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam and that none of the two parties would stand with or next to the idol worshippers of Mecca because they are the blatant enemies of Islam and of the Muslims and so on so this was one of the treaties signed with this tribe there were similar treaties with the other tribes of the Jews but it all illustrates to us the keenness and the sincerity of the Prophet Alat wasam to coexist with the Jews to the extent that he so often used to visit them wherever they are give them da socialize with them try his level best to attract him to Islam we know that the Muslims coexisted as we will soon hear when women used to go and buy from the Jews from their markets the Muslims used to mix with the Jews and buy from them and sell to them in the marketsan may Allah be pleased with him bought The Well of Ruma a water well that the Muslims needed to drink from and the Jew would not let them soan bought it and gave it and made it open to all Muslims to drink from the prophet himself had a Jew servant and in theah when when this young boy fell sick the prophet Alat visited him and he was terminally ill he was seriously ill and the prophet visited this young Jew boy though he was a Jew and the prophet stood next to his headat and he called him to Islam and the boy looked at his father and his father said to the to his son obey abim obey the prophet Muhammad Alam so the boy embraced Islam accepted Islam and he died the prophet came outat with happiness apparent on his face saying praise be to Allah whom saved him from Hellfire through me so there were there were good relationships from the Muslim side to the Jews they were trying to coexist and by the way this is the case until today all over the world not to the Jews but to all other ethnicities and religions the Muslims are always the peaceful ones they are the one who stretch their hands and don't be fooled and don't be brainwashed with what the media portray in a very small minut minority worldwide whether it is in Iraq Afghanistan Somalia Nigeria Yemen wherever they are not even a zero a 0000001 of the population of the Muslims they don't represent Islam they only appeared 20 years ago maybe 25 years ago due to the oppression and the aggression of the Crusaders against the Muslims so they came up being driven by the Western intelligence until today they fuel them they pay for that for it and they support them from behind curtains and this is why when you find a moderate person scholar wanting to go to Europe to UK to the US to call people to the Real Islam hurdles and obstacles are put in front of him and most likely he would not get a Visa but if he's a fundamentalist he if he's an extremist if he's fanatic and every Muslim knows that this this guy is not representing Islam they had give him a Visa why because through him they can attack the Muslims on their soil they can bombard their Islamic centers their masjids they can interfere into their subjects that they teach at school in their Quran schools in their Elementary or high school they can lay their hands on that because of that extremist terrorist whom they opened the door for whom they had given money and support to spread his ideas and also if he was an extreme Sufi and he has nothing to do with the Quran and the Sunnah except to tranquil to to give uh people tranquilizers and to sedate them in a sense with his beautiful talk that is not related to the Quran and Sunnah it all deals with the heart and how connected you are to Allah Etc they would also accommodate him because then they can manipulate the Muslims and westernize them and make them as they wish this is the norm so the prophet was trying to to coexist but it was the Jews that refused that they refused that through their continuous attack not only on the Muslims even on Allah which is shocking and alarming because nothing in the life of Muslims is more important than Allah than the Quran and the than the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam so the Jews started saying bad things about Allah and they used to say this at the time of Moses at the time of Isa Jesus so this is nothing new and they said that Allah is poor and we are rich Allah has heard what these people say that Allah is poor and we are rich they even used to attack the prophet Alat and abuse him verbally as in the whenever they came to greet the prophet they used to say the Islamic greeting is with an L which means peace be upon you but the Jews used to manipulate and change and alter the the word so it is aam and Sam in Arabic means death so whenever they greeted the prophet they used to say death be upon you but they say it in a way that it is ambiguous it's misleading and the prophet Alam would always reply to them by saying he would not say peace also be upon you and the mercy of Allah no whatever a non-muslim says to you you say may Allah be pleased with her once heard this and could not tolerate so she said May the death and curse and anger of Allah be upon you you Jews and the prophet reprimanded her by saying meaning refrain of what you're saying what is this what you're doing she said oh prophet of Allah don't you hear what they are saying they're hoping and wishing wishing for death for you the prophet Alam with his big heart said don't you hear what I say to them back I say and upon you Allah would answer my supplication against them meaning that the death would be upon them and he would not answer their supplication against me the believer the prophet goes on to sayam the believer is not abusive and does not use use profanity or vulgar language and he doesn't curse so they used to do bad things to the prophet Alat wasam and he used to tolerate them he used to deal with them nicely hoping that they may change hoping that something would click and that they would behave in a sense we know that the Battle of bad took place on the second year of Hijra so after the prophet had won and the army of Allah was Victorious the Jews did not swallow this well it didn't go down the throat well so every time they met the prophet Alat wasam and he used to call them and he used to remind them to abide by the points mentioned in the treaties signed with them they would mock him and say don't feel so boastful you met your people on the battlefield and they have no experience in fighting if you were to meet us we would show you what real fighting is so they were trying to provoke the prophet Alam but the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam preached the Muslim and the whole world how to honor your covenants how to honor your contracts and words and if you read the Quran you would find this in many places oh you who believe fulfill your covenants and contracts the first Ayah in chapter five Allah tells us to fulfill our covenants and our cont RS and our obligations with the others beautiful Surah and it shows you that Islam is built on that you never break a treaty you never go back on your word you never break a promise in our religion this is part of our religion it's a sign of hypocrisy to break a promise and the prophet whenever he dispatched an expedition or an army he would always advise him do not break the Covenant of Allah Asel if you give your word if you give your commitment to disbelievers to non-muslims abide by it because whatever would happen would go and backfire against Islam and the commitment of the Muslims to their religion so the prophet Alam was the best to portray such commitment yet the Jews kept on provoking him now the first tribe that broke the treaty with the prophet Alam was these were the ones who you used to after the battle of bad say such irresponsible phrases and and and statements to the prophet Alat wasam your people are not brave enough if you were to fight us you will find people standing in your face and giving you hell sort of to speak after the battle of Badr they went crazy because of the victory of the is the Muslims and of Islam so they started behaving in a way that was not in accordance to the treaty till that day that they made the cardinal sin they made the mistake that cost them a lot and this was when a woman went to buy and sell some of her gold a Muslim woman and this shows you how the Muslims were trying to coexist that a a woman would go alone to the market of these disbelievers to buy and sell because the signs and the indications that everything is fine you have no problem with that they we have a treaty with them you can go and deal with them so she went there and a number of the Jews in that market started to abuse her physically and that is started to abuse her verbally and some of them even tried to force her to unveil to take off her face Veil and she refused so one of them with his slight movement of the hand managed to tie something of her clothes to her back so the minute she stood up her backside was exposed so not only her face but her whole body was exposed through this treacherous trick of that Jew and they started laughing and the woman shouted out of Shame and out of disgrace due to what this or these group of Jews did to her so a Muslim man was passing by when we saw this he jumped at the person who did it and he killed him the Muslim was Hot Blooded for such an atrocity that man deserved to be killed so the Jews collaborated and killed the Muslim and when this came to the prophet Alat wasam then they have breached the Covenant and they have broke the treaty that was with the prophet alai wasam so the prophet came to them to negotiate with them to talk to them but they closed all their doors and they took refuge in their fortresses and they had big castle like and fortresses that was not easy to penetrate so the prophet Alat wasam besieged their tribe for eight days to 15 days and then Allah threw fear in their hearts and this is one of the beautiful Specialties given from Allah to our prophet Al the prophet said in an authentic Hadith that Allah has given me five things over all prophets and Messengers that I am the only one who was given this among them was I was made Victorious by Awe by fear and this would be the distance of a whole month so before I reach an area a month before that Allah would throw o and fear in their hearts from me and this is apparent and this is up till today armies that fight real Muslims they are scared terrified though they are the Muslims that is below them in arms and weaponry and man power but Subhan Allah it is Allah who gives Victory to whomever he wishes so when the Muslims are real and they are sincere Allah would throw fear and awe in the hearts of their enemies so the prophet alisat wasam tried his level best but they refused it was one of their men or one of the Jews who used to say poetry criticizing and ridiculing the Muslims and provoking the idol worshippers and reminding them of their dead people of their loved one loved ones who died in the Battle of Badr so that they would have the urge to come and fight again and to annihilate Islam and the Muslims the prophet Alat wasam surrounded them besieged their Villages may Allah be pleased with him who was one of their allies he gave their Pledge of Allegiance back to them and he said I'm not their Ally anymore when they decided to surrender the head of the Hypocrites who was another Ally of them Abdullah Sal interceded and said oh prophet of Allah don't punish them let them free for me and he kept on insisting and insisting and persisting until the prophet alhat wasam gave them to him and they were extradited they were kicked out of Medina to the borders of the 11 countries to Asam now this was one incident that took place Inu if the prophet Alam would have killed them all that was wouldn't have been a big thing because they collaborated on fighting the Muslims they were the first to attack and instead of delivering the one who did this attack they all defended him so they needed to be collaterally punished and this is what the prophet didat after the battle of and this was a year later on the third year of Hijra another tribe started doing the same but this time it was more devilish this time it was more evil the tribe of b or this tribe there are two stories one says that the prophet came to them seeking a Financial loan so that he would pay the blood money of two killed by mistake by a Muslim so the prophet wanted to give the blood money to the tribes of these two people who were killed by mistake and they promised the prophet Alam that they will give him or and help him with this Blood Money and asked him to wait and then they collaborated together and said you will never find a better situation to assassinate him than this so order one of your men to go on top of the building and take a big rock and drop it on his head and then he will be dead and it would be all over it will be finished the second story was that they sent to the prophet Alat wasam asking him to come and talk to them about Islam so they said send come in 30 people of your companions to meet 30 of our uh uh Jews and Scholars so the prophet was happy and decided to go but then they sent him another message saying that if you come with 30 we will not be able to communicate because there are so many people talking at the same time better more you come with only three and we will send only three and the three they had sent they had knives and swords hidden so that the minute they see the prophet they would ex they would assassinate him and those with him now in both cases Allah Asel revealed to his messenger that this is what they're planning for so he immediately went back to Medina and gathered his his uh uh soldiers G gathered his army and besieged bad and they were shocked they tried their level best to wait to be firm and steadfast and not to surrender because they had huge fortresses and strong but again Allah Asel threw oh and fear in their hearts how did this all end this is what we will talk inshallah about either after the break or on uh uh Saturday when we meet again so uh um the story is long and it it has to be looked into in a very uh um tactical fashion the prophet never broke his covenants Alam it was always the Jews so whatever you hear from the media about how the prophet dealt with the Jews go back to the books of history and look at the full picture and you will find that he never treated them unfairly sallallahu alaihi wasallam we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back asalamu alaykum and welcome back uh we have Osama from Kuwait hello yes Osama uh first I wanted to thank you for all your good work and your program because it's very good and we benefit from it and then I wanted to say people call you and give you a hard time a you know Y and such you should answer them and tell them they are rafes there should be killed because they are not Muslims they're infidels and Saudi Arabia has the right to kill them and their children and their women because they are not Muslims they're smearing our world they should be killed and killing them makes us go to heaven and this is the best way to do what we're supposed to do we should kill the children and women so they wouldn't be any next generation of Ries like yenes and such I'm telling you if they call you you should answer them and okay okay I got your message and I will answer inshallah U what you had said brother Usama from Kuwait is saying that the people that call and saying about the atrocities so claimed and about the killing of the Innocents in Yemen Etc and the Coalition Air Raids and he's saying that we should answer them and say to them that this is justifiable and not not only that we should annihilate all of the hthis all of the rafas kill their children kill their women burn their land to the ground and this is extremely wrong brother Usama I know you have good intention but a what difference would that make us from them what do we rely on what drives Us in this world the Quran and the Sunnah what did the prophet say about killing the women and children he was outraged when he saw a woman killed and he said who killed her this did not have any right to be killed it was unlawful so in Islam we cannot kill a child we cannot kill a woman we cannot kill an elder we cannot kill a priest or a man of religion this is what Abu Bakr used to send and dispatch uh his armies uh accordingly this was the advice of the prophet and the instruction of the Prophet Alam so we should not go overboard and we should not go to extreme we have a legitimate cause and reason to fight the hthis because they are ra because they are the aggressors they are they are killing the sunnis and especially the salafis and they have no boundaries they have done atrocities and it's all visible and available but this does not give us the right to go overboard and say they are cfir and hence anyone related to them we can kill we can blow them up we can do this no this is extremely uh extreme and not in accordance to the sunah of the Prophet Allah mentioned in the Quran if there were two factions among the Believers were to fight then you have to reconcile and arbitrate between them not that one of them is cfir so this doesn't mean that we don't say that the houthis don't have wrong ideas if the beliefs Andis similar to the beliefs of the of IM which state clearly in the books and they believe in it that the Quran is distorted that their uh aah uh and imams are below the messengers but above the prophets of Allah Etc all of this is kufur this is blatant kufur their slandering of may Allah be pleased with her and cursing of abak Omar andman and the rest of the companions all of this is kufur it's it's clear you don't doubt that these are kafer however we don't give uh we don't brush them paint them all with the same brush we don't give them a label to all each we say that the group is but each individual has to be looked uh uh specifically and individually before judging so what you have said a I do not accept at all we cannot kill their children we cannot kill their women we cannot uh discriminately kill innocent people the bombardments and and the bombing campaign and the air strikes are uh I don't know uh surgically um made I think this is the terminology the they used and it's precise and it avoids civilians it's only to be uh uh pointed at the army of the enemy the houthis and those with them from the Hypocrites but we do not give uh uh an open check for otherwise we would be like them we have uh Bas from Saudi please I need to make a clarification yes back in my country when we you know a Muslim Child by their name Muslim name but when I come here and I ask people like people from Pakistan Indian what is your child name they tell me their local name and I said what is the Islamic name they say no the local name has beautiful meaning so there's no need for an Islamic name so I want to clarify is it true that when you have local names everybody has local name that have beautiful meaning doesn't necessary for you to ask Islamic name or Arabic name to it do you understand that yes any question yes can I make umra for my dad is he alive no he's not okay and if the answer is yes how is he after making mine I will make e or you can please explain if it is yes okay all right thank you very much you're welcome we have Muhammad from Saudi hello alaykum do we get 24 hour protection after eating seven AA dates or is it valid till sunset and how long do we have to refrain from drinking water after eating AA to get this protection and how can we get this protection in Ramadan since morning food intake is restricted while fasting okay I will answer you inshallah thank you uh Bas from Saudi Arabia said that when she came to this country um people said that you have to have an Islamic name so is it correct if I have a normal name that has a beautiful meaning but it is not Arabic and it's not sort of Islamic is this permissible the answer is yes there's no problem none whatsoever if a woman's name uh in her country Susan or Janette or whatever and she accepts Islam does she have to CH change her name into hint or into suaya ETA no as long as the meaning is not Haram there's nothing wrong in keeping your name as it is we have shamim from Saudi in one of your episodes you mentioned the treatment of evil ey by throwing the woo water on the person if the person is known who has given the evil eye yes but but if the person is unknown who has given the evil eye what is the treatment for it okay that all thank you very much you're quite welcome Bas says that is it permissible for me to perform om on behalf of my deceased father yes definitely she says what's the format should I do it first for myself and then no as long as you performed om once in a lifetime for yourself there is no problem uh uh in that to perform om on behalf of deceased there's nothing wrong in that inshallah but if you did not perform omah on behalf of uh yourself ever in your life this cannot be so if you want to go and perform om now on behalf of your deceased father you say I giving t on behalf of my father and just go and it is accepted inshallah uh Jabar from Kuwait alikum uh you know um for Muslims Ramadan is in fact the month of peace with God and I would like to talk about peace uh you know that Saudi Coalition okay the same Jabar apparently he calls from Afghanistan and from Kuwait mashallah again Saudi Coalition again and again it's waste of time you can see the and get the answer f is from Saudi I wanted to ask uh in Surah M the last ver I want to ask about the brief explanation of Allah says to give a goodly loan to him to ask to know a brief meaning of about about that and uh second question is uh the use of beads I used to hear some is saying that it is the practice of the Jews so it is not good to use it to make okay uh the first question I I did not understand in Surah M okay the last was that is Allah says to lend a goodly loan to him ah okay yeah to know brief understanding about it okay I will answer you inshallah and uh thirdly my brother wanted to know he travels uh from uh he lives in Ju so he travels to work up and down 400 kilomet a day okay so can he shorten the prayers or he should pray full how many kilometers he travels uh one way 200 kilometers from juel to where okay I will answer you inshah okay we have Rana from Saudi to and all the Muslims all around the world I have two questions she uh first one is my sister is about to get married she is a doctor and there is a guy who is a doctor also and handsome but he's not so religious and one boy is extremely religious but the girl says I don't like his looks so we are preferring the girl to marry the highly religious one but she tells she doesn't like his face so what to do in this case and my second question is this talal bad Alena the song we say that Prophet sallam when he went to Madina small girls they were singing it is it authentic or not okay um Muhammad from Saudi Arabia says about the seven dates AA there's a Hadith where the Prophet says whoever eats early in the morning seven dates from AA date of Medina then Allah would protect him from um sorcery from Magic from a spell and from Poison and we believe that the Hadith is authentic and Scholars differed is this specifically a feature of AA dates of Medina or can it be any AA from anywhere or can it be any date from anywhere there a difference of opinion among Scholars I personally believe that it is only specifically uh related to AWA of Medina now he says that uh um uh is it a 24-hour protection the answer is yes the prophet said it is in the to be taken in the morning so this is a 24-hour protection and how long can we not drink water afterwards you can drink water afterwards immediately without any problem and how to do it in Ramadan it seems that you have to do it before you do your imak so before the Adan of you take it and this does the job with the grace of Allah inshallah uh mayor from uh the emiratesal alikum she I have a question if we do Wu uh for how long uh if we wear socks after doing the Wu for how long we can the Wu can sustain after wearing the socks I mean people say that you just have to do Masa over the socks so that your vuzu is there for 24 hours so uh I just want to reconfirm from you uh what is Sharia ruling okay I will answer you in Mrs from Pakistan she have two questions I ask them yes the first is that do we have to uh say salutations after using the word he and his for Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him do you have to say what for example I say that he or his so do I have to put sallallahu alaihi wasallam after he and his also or only after Prophet Muhammad peace upon Him name okay okay and second okay and the second question is about uh the ruling of uh about price bonds price bonds what is that a price bond that you get a ticket and you have a number on it and and if the number is announced that you are having then you get a prize money for that how did you get the ticket uh you can get it from the market or someplace like that and you buy it yeah you buy it and then you're supposed to see if your number is the same number that is being announ so this is this is Lottery yeah kind of like Lottery Why why is it kind of why isn't it Lottery uh I think because I don't know I I would like you okay I I I will answer inshallah yeah because I'm not clear about it so yeah I will answer inshah okay abdah from alers um and to you as well thank you um I would like to ask about a program on on Huda TV it's called Ramadan Queens um some schols say that um maybe this particular contest maybe may involve gambling I would like to hear your opinion about about this matter insh what is the the program called radan quiz Ramadan quiz okay what is wrong with it I would like I would like to to find out and um some people say that participating in particular contests where you you you you may call in or you buy a ticket or something like to get a price may may may be considered as as gambling so does this okay is it on TV it's on H TV yes okay I I have no idea but I will answer you inshallah don't worry shamim said that I mentioned uh couple of days ago that the medicine for and the cure for evil eye if someone looks at me looks at me and says wow look at his um health and I fell sick what's the best remedy the best remedy if I know that individual who said this and this happened with sah may Allah be pleased with him in the Hadith where one of the companions saw him taking a a shower and he looked at his skin of course not from the because he was covered but he looked at his shoulder said wow I didn't see such skin not even on a virgin because so soft and tender and the man immediately fell on the ground and people started visiting him so the prophet said do you suspect do you accuse anyone they said yes we accuse him so the prophet was very angry with him and he said why when you saw something you liked you did not say may Allah bless it and he ordered him to perform woodo and he ordered him to wash the inside of his waist wrapper or apron or or isar and then he ordered this water to collect it and then to pour it on top of the man's head and he was cured instantly on the spot now the question is if I do not know who gave me the evil eye in this case you have to do R and the best R and I have practiced this and I have seen people practicing it and it works that you bring them some water you recite Al Fat three times five times seven times what odd numbers and you blow after each time you recite aat the last two ay of Surah Al bak and the last three chapters of the Quran the same number number of times and you blow and then you drink a lot of it you wash yourself you wash the affected area and inshallah this would cure it Ahmed from Afghanistan Alum it's good to talk to you again I called yesterday you said something about Isis and wahabism and and Al salafism can I ask a couple of questions yes thank you so much uh all right yes uh actually uh I've done many different searches uh around and I've read a couple of books and search some uh networks and I found out that that Isis has actually the uh idea of wahabism and salafism and the strict ideologies of them U you know you you I know that may people are going to be shy here in this but they have a strict ideologies in wahabism and salafism they have literal interpretations of I got I got the message Ahmed I got the message if you have a specific question that's good but yeah to put your point this is a Q&A question it's not a debate um session so I will answer your question inshallah if there is time om Ahmed from Saudi we can perform um alone and if my husband is busy I can go for alone where are you from from Makkah you're from mekah yeah okay I will answer you inshallah he's busy he don't have time so just I want to go alone any more questions okay thank you you're welcome uh f is from Saudi Arabia says that the last Ayah ofah Al where Allah says that uh you give a loan to Allah subhanahu wa taala the last verse of Surah and what kind of loan is this this is in referring to giving charity so whoever gives charity and spends in the cause of Allah it is Allah subhanahu wa taala who accepts it and who magnifies it for him um um zah from Nigeria please I have two questions here yes make it quick please I have a question of sud while reading Quran do you have to say sub in the recitation prostration yes okay and the second question is about masturb is a man allowed to masturbate while having you have he has a wife but he must all the time okay alone or with with the wife no I not okay I will answer you inshallah than you're quite welcome uh so F's question uh number two he heard that using the prayer beads is from the uh Jews and that it is not permissible to use it this is wrong it is permissible to use it but it is not recommended there were uh narrations that the companions used to count their t on the dates uh uh seeds Etc and some small stones so this is permissible but it's not recommended because the prophet ordered us to make this with our fingers and he told us that they will speak on the day of judgment uh his third question that was his brother travels from ju 200 kilometers each way so this is a total of 400 kilometers can he shorten the prayer usually such a distance is a traveling distance in the sense that if you ask people in juel a person traveling to that area would he be traveling they said yeah definitely this is not a picnic so yes he can shorten and combine the prayers Rana from Saudi Arabia says that her sister uh two proposed to her one is a a pra a doctor who is handsome but not practicing and one who is practicing and religious but not handsome so uh who should she choose definitely she must not choose the not practicing person because he would turn her life into hell uh um now he looks handsome she may enjoy it but in religious aspects he will she will deteriorate and she will go away from the line on from the straight path therefore I do not advise her as for uh the person who's not handsome maybe she she should reconsider because uh the beauty is within and so many people we take a look at them at first and we don't like them but if you take another look you would find that there is something in them that attracts you so maybe she should reconsider Allah knows best is the chant authentic the answer is no because even in the wordings of the chant they're mentioning is to the North and the prophet migrated from the south so even the wordings are wrongar says um the issue of um wiping over the socks and when does it start it starts after you wipe so if I make M and I put on my socks I'm I'm legible to wipe over it but I don't break my woodo and I go on and pray and and and with the same W of hypothetically speaking and then I go to bed when I wake up the following morning and my socks are still on I can make woodoo and wipe and from that moment I count 24 hours so this might take too long but the wiping actually starts you have to after 24 hours stop wiping and Allah knows best Mrs Assam says um do we have to say Allah Muhammad when we use the pronouns like he went to Medina sallallahu alaihi wasallam or should we say the prophet went to Medina and then say the solitation no it is not a must but yeah are we that stingy that we don't want to say sallallahu alaihi wasallam whenever we say his name or a pronoun we one should say this uh Lottery is totally prohibited and this is when you buy a ticket and you enter a draw and you may lose the $1 you spent on the ticket and you may gain a million dollars a prize this is Haram but if one buys something from a shop unintentionally and they give him uh a ticket for the draw and he did not intend to get it this is halal inshallah because he didn't buy it and he didn't pay for it Abu Abdullah from algers he says that um there's a program on Huda called Ramadan quiz and there is gambling in it I don't know I've never heard of this program and I very much doubt that there is gambling see if they just call and answer questions and they get a prize this is a gift unless the number they're calling at is an 800 number or a 700 number where the company charges a lot of uh U money for the call duration now this is gambling because you're spending more than a normal call would cost you and you're spending this much because you're hoping to win something but I very much doubt that um Huda does this uh Ahmed
