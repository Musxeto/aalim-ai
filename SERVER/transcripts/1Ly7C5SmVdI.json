  "transcript": "so I have like a YouTube channel that I want to I want to use to spread knowledge and like I don't show myself but there is like a character of course drawn in a Halal way that have my voice is this Halal a woman's voice according to the most authentic opinion of Scholars is not there are Scholars who said that no a woman's voice must be concealed she must not speak but this is not correct or authentic women used to address the prophet Alat wasam whenever they needed to do so they used to communicate with other nonaham men in the market when there ever there's a necessity so they used to communicate with one another while abiding abiding by Shar rules and regulations when it comes to preaching this is unheard of and uncalled for mother AA may Allah be pleased with her and with all of our mothers she was the mother of the Believers none of the Muslims could have married her after the prophet Alat wasam as this was prohibited in the Quran nevertheless she never addressed the Muslims in the Masjid though she was their mother though she was the most knowledgeable of most of them if not all she had more knowledge than the vast majority of companions male and females yet she never addressed them nor did um Sal or Z bin j or safia or umh or haa none of the mothers of the B Believers had ever come forward to preach or call others to Islam publicly so coming into your channel you must not have your voice heard like this even if it's a voice over a cartoon character because this was not done by the Sala this was not done by the right predecessors of ours and hence you should not do this because you never know when there is FNA and when there would be someone with illness in his heart who would be tempted by your voice and Allah Knows Best"
