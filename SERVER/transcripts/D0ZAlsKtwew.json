  "transcript": "that is when they object when they complain when they cry saying that how would we be able to taste the forms of worship we're offering to allah azza wajal how would it be a comfort to our souls and hearts how can we reach the level that whenever we have a calamity whenever we have a problem we find our comfort in these forms of worship didn't the prophet alayhi salatu salam say that allah had made my satisfaction in prayer didn't belong say the prophet used to say are they salatu salam comfort us bilal with prayer meaning call for the prayer and did it has a may allah be pleased with her that the Prophet is awesome whenever he had a calamity whenever he had something that was bothering him he would go and rush to pray so people complain how can we attain the submissiveness how can we get this level of contemplation and of having the heart standing in front of allah azza wajal well the prophet alayhi salatu salam has showed us the way and among the things that he had showed us is this beautiful hadith indeed if a person was blessed by Allah Azza WA JAL to have these qualities in him indeed he is blessed by Allah so Allah the prophet said alehissalaam salam there are three qualities for which whoever is characterized by them will relish the sweetness of faith to love Allah and His Messenger more than anything else that's number one to love someone only for the sake of Allah that's number two and to abhor returning to apostasy after Allah has rescued him from it as he abhors being cast into hell three qualities and each one is more beautiful than the other the first one is to love allah and the prophet alayhi salat wa salam more than anything else and one would claim that we all have this in us but we don't find the taste of the sweetness of Eman well let's go back to finding the sweetness of Eman all or relishing the sweetness of faith is this metaphoric or is it actual taste of sweetness that you find scholars differed but the most authentic opinion is that this is an actual real taste of faith the sweetness of Eman and that is exactly as people find the sweetness of honey that sweetness of sugar or dates when they eat them likewise those who believe in allah azzawajal and those who love the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam more than anything else would find the sweetness of the belief in their heart to the extent that nothing harms them no calamities no abuse no torture no poverty no illness nothing affects their Eman it was reported once that a man passed by a crippled person who had no arms and no legs and he was just a body without any limbs and he heard him say o Allah praise be to you you have blessed me with things much more greater than what you have blessed a lot of the people and the man came up to him and said I could not get what you were saying what blessing are you talking about you have no legs and no hands what blessings do you think that Allah has given to you and favored you with more than a lot of the most a lot of the people in general and the men said poor person speaking to me I feel sorry for you don't you realize the favor of Allah upon me that he had given me a thankful heart and a grateful tongue this is one of the greatest gifts of Allah to an individual to feel always that he's favored by allah azza wajal while on the other hand you'd find a lot of rich people people who have everything health wealth they have power they have everything anyone could hope and wish for yet they're always miserable there oh they are always ungrateful whenever you see someone and you say how are you how's life to you he starts listing a whole bunch of things that he's complaining of inflation is too high things are too expensive the kids are driving me crazy the missus is buying everything I'm wasting my won my money on things that are worthless I've lost my money in the stock market I did this I did that and after he complains about the electricity the water the infrastructure about everything the climate the weather the color of his skin after all of that then he says but alhamdulillah I am favored and blessed by Allah what kind of favor and blessing are you talking about see the people are unable to find the sweetness of faith because they favor everything over Allah and his messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and the believers the true believers you would find them tasting their prayers not actually putting it in their mouths and tasting it but when they pray and conclude their prayer they feel that they've been in heaven when they fast while it's hot and they're thirsty and hungry yet when they break their fast they feel the reward of allah azza wajal when they give money for charity though their credit is a little bit lower than before yet they know that at the side of Allah it is far far greater and higher than it was before so whatever they do they find - these forms of worship a better taste than the taste of honey sugar or dates this sweetness is actual when they listen to the Quran they are enjoying listening to the Quran when they listen to the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam you find tears in their eyes but they are not crying out of pain or misery they are crying out of happiness when they hear a lecture reminding them of Allah making them get closer to Allah the Almighty you find them actually tasting the sweetness of Eman and they are in more joy and happiness than those who are listening to things that Allah does not approve of for example if you look at the people of sin what do they enjoy most they enjoy a concert they enjoy a play in a theater they enjoy a movie they enjoy a song an album music they like fornicating they like consuming intoxicants and getting wasted all of these things do not come even close to the sweetness of the believers when they taste the sweetness of Iman wallah when they listen to the Quran they find the tranquility and calmness of the whole universe in their hearts but on the contrary when they hear something that is related to sin when they hear some music you find them finding the bitterness which is the opposite of sweetness in their hearts why is that don't they enjoy music don't they enjoy songs don't they enjoy movies no they don't simply because they tasted the sweetness of faith in that that made everything else so bitter in their hearts it is like when someone finds it difficult to pray he struggles to pray but after a while once he got gets to know his prayer by Allah he finds himself driven to prayer and he enjoys it more than anything else a beautiful hadith the believers found the taste of Eman not only in forms of worship but also in different kinds of good deeds in teaching people when you hear about what the scholars did for the sake of Allah when you hear about the books that shaykh al-islam even taymiyah may Allah have mercy on his soul wrote not in his house but in prison when he did not have means to write on he did not have pens he did not have paper he could beg the guards for a piece of coal so that he could write whatever he can on pieces of papers and nobody is asking him or forcing him to do so but he found the sweetness of faith in recording this great knowledge of his so that it would stay after his death and we would benefit from it unfortunately everyone claims of us that he loves the prophet alayhi salatu salam more than anything else every one of us claims that he loves Allah more than anything else but this claim needs verification you have to verify this how can I increase my email well this is not something that I could prescribe a pill for you or an injection and then mashallah it would boost your Eman it's a way of life to increase your Eman as Allison a belief you have to offer good deeds and you have to say and refrain from bad deeds and it would happen by itself the minute you pray on time the minute you pray where you're supposed to pray in the masjid not on one prayer but the five daily prayers on time in the masjid as allah has prescribed the minute you obey your parents and you respect them and you're kind to them the minute you connect to your next of kin those who are related to you from your father or from your mother site even if they are bad and rude to you even if they sever the kinship even if they don't return your calls even if they don't answer your invitations you still go and connect them the minute you do this the minute you fast Rama bond without sinning the minute you offer night prayers the minute you fast voluntary prayers Monday Thursday's the white three days of every month our our alpha etc the minute you give charity to the needy and the poor the minute you help those who need your help the minute you meet people with a big smile though they might not share this kindness with you but you still do it for the sake of Allah the minute you do all of this for the sake of Allah you will find that your Eman is increasing a lot and also if you were to stay away from sin you will find that Allah Azza WA JAL is increasing your Eman greatly why because you're doing what you're supposed to do and Allah rewards those who do what they're supposed to do the terminology itself they're similar and close hidaya and Arabic means guidance and though fayek in arabic means that Allah would help you do something Allah would make him successful in doing something so they are similar but they're separate guidance is from Allah Azza WA JAL and guide this as we know is divided into two types guidance that only Allah has which is to make people worship Him and to make people do good things but there are or there is a different type of guidance and that is that is given to us as individuals such as the guidance given to the prophet alayhi salaatu son Allah says when a karate ID in a sirat al-mustaqim and early that you guide to a straight path now the guidance of the Prophet alisov Salam is showing you the direction showing you the road whether you take it or not this is not up to him allah his salat wa sallam it's up to allah if you take it then this is the guidance from allah so the Prophet merely guides you to the direction if you take it this is guidance from Allah and that is why when it came to his uncle Abu Talib who died as a non-muslim the Prophet was sad about this so Allah told him in the Quran in a collateral demon but you do not guide those whom you love meaning that you showed them the way but you cannot do more than that and the guidance is at the hands of Allah the Almighty if you look at the proof that proves that you love Allah and the Prophet as Salam more than anything else you'd find that it's a very difficult way or thing to prove Allah the Almighty says that the Jews claim that they are the sons of Allah and his beloved one and also allah azza wajal to us a verse in the Quran that examines the authentic of our love where Allah says soprano tell if say if you love allah azza wajal then follow me and Allah Azza WA JAL would love you so you have to prove your love to Allah Azza WA JAL by following the prophet alayhi salatu salam and everyone claims that he loves the Prophet Ali salatu salam yet when you come to look at their actions you'd find them far away from the prophet's instructions when you come to them and say listen the prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam said that one of you would not truly believes until i'm more beloved to him than his child his father and all of the people are you like this well Omar may Allah be pleased with him said to the Prophet Aries of Salaam o prophet of Allah you are more beloved to me than my child done my father then all the people except myself and the Prophet told him RA salat wa salam normal you will not attain the true degree and sweetness of faith until you love me more than even your soul and no more contemplated a bit and thought of it and said yes I would easily give my soul away I would sacrifice myself for the sake of the Prophet that I saw some and to protect him so he came to the prophet and said o prophet of allah by allah i love you more than anything else even my soul and up the prophet said that is Sam now Omar you have attained the true belief so let's look at ourselves through this hadith do we love the Prophet Allister more than we love ourselves more than we love our children and our fathers well is a claim that needs proof when we find that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam instructed us and said trim your mustache and let your beard grow this is an order from the Prophet s to Sam do you believe that he had said it he says yes I do is a hadith authentic I said definitely it's in Bukhari and Muslim so do you love the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he says yes I do then the question is asked why don't you grow your beard and this is one aspect if you look at the women why aren't you veiling why aren't you covering your faces why are you mixing with men if you look at youngsters why aren't you praying federer in the Masjid as the Prophet erestrum instructed you to do and told you that those who don't they have characteristics of hypocrites if you look at merchants and traders why are you dealing in RIBA why are you taking interests why are you taking loans and paying interests when you know that this is one of the major sins of Islam you have a lot and a lot of things that indicate that you are not a true person in your love to the Prophet sallallaahu Salim or to Allah the Almighty"
