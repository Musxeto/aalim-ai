  "title": "Can she speak with her male teacher for clarification of her studies #islam #islamic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "So I'm currently not attending school and I do not have like a teacher but I will be taking my A levels exam this year starting this month and I really need support. Um a professor has kindly reviewed some of my texts and it would be very helpful if I could speak with him. Would it be all right if I joined like a call with him possibly with a friend like present to listen as well? I've asked a lot of sisters as well but no one qualified really was willing to help. No problem inshallah in contacting your male professor for the need of clarification of something in your studies as long as there is no softening of the voice or socializing or flirting or any inappropriate stuff. It's just like you calling the hospital and calling a receptionist to book an appointment or a hotel or to ask anything in the government from a man. There's no problem in that inshallah."
