  "title": "These 10 people have rights on every individual muslim #islam #islamic #quran #hijab assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "one of the ayas in the Quran one that gathers these rights and it would take us hours to explain but I'll just go through them briefly Allah says worship Allah and Associate nothing with him and to parents do good and to relatives orphans the needy the near neighbor the neighbor farther away the companion at your side the traveler and Those whom your right hands possess 10 Allah is giving telling us to give them their rights now these rights can be mandatory upon individuals some of the rights are a communial obligation if I do it you're not sinful if I don't do it and you don't do it we're all sinful like for example washing a decease someone's dead Muslims yeah Allah okay what are we going to do not my job not my business we leave him to rot what will happen we will be punished in Hell one of us says no no no this is not Islamic I will wash him shroud him pray for feral prayer and bury him we Exempted from the punishment communial obligation sometimes these rights are recommended Sunnah something that's good alhamdulillah so we have to segregate and know and this is what seeking knowledge gives you when you know hm is this sinful if I don't do it or not I have to know how to know to go and check it from the Quran from the Sunnah from what the scholars say so the greatest right of all is [Music] huh worship the right of Allah you guys sleep H Friday after big Biryani with some and have to wake up a little bit because this is rapid fire four hours Sal and I we don't have time we have so much information we cannot share it with you we have to make it short and concise so you guys have to be on the edge of your seats so the most important right is the right of Allah imagine the prophet saysat do you know what is Allah's right among upon his servants and his servants right upon Allah there are mutual rights obligations and rights so I said I don't know Allah and his messenger MERS know s alhi wasallam he said Allah's right upon his servants to worship him and not to associate others with him this is the most important right what is the reward if we do this the servants right upon Allah if they do this that he will get them admitted to J this is what we're doing here what are you doing in this world I'm working she I'm doing business she I'm getting mared Mar and having children she this is not your job this is temporarily soon you will be terminated from this job what will you do either heaven or hell so this is your priority your objective your target is I want to go to Jenna how to do that don't get married this is difficult she no you get married and go to Jenna with your wife oh that's nice so many things in life are like this you enjoy and have fun and it takes you to Jenna the smartest those who have knowledge because they can utilize their Investments and use little and gain a lot so worship Allah among the rights upon us the right of the Prophet Muhammad Alat wasam to obey him whenever he orders us to refrain from whatever he tells us not to to believe whatever he tells us to not worship Allah except by what he has commanded us this is a huge right among others of course we could speak for ours the right of the companions of the Prophet Alam they have rights over us to honor them to love them to defend them the right of the mothers of the Believers his wives they are our mothers what have you done then we come according to the Ayah to the right of the parents and the right of the parents Sal will inshallah speak about if we give him 6 hours it's not enough seriously this is only from the Quran and the Sunnah we're not talking about storytelling because there is so [Music] much Hadith and verses of the Quran highlighting the importance of your parents Allah ordained that you worship no one with him and to be dutiful and kind to your parents look what Allah Asel is doing comparing or associating the instruction not to worship others with him alongside with being beautiful to your parents this is one of the most important things in life when was the last time you were beautiful to your mom when was the last time you time you were obedient to your your father and respectful and then ask yourself do I have a chance I've been rude with them I've been bad with them but I'll leave this to Sheik Sal then you have the right of the relatives what do you mean sh who are my relatives anyone connected to you from your father and your mother you mean uncles and aunts yes cousins yes second cousins third cousins all of these are your relatives how do you call them how do you contact them when do you see them when do you kind to them then we have the rights of the orphans and the orphans can be in your family and they have a priority and they can be in other people's families do you support them do you sponsor them do you are you kind to them then we have the rights of the needy and the poor and we know the had whether they are orphans whether they are uh um widows whether they are stranded people all of these are needy and poor the people around you are in the hundreds of thousands who don't have money to pay rent electricity I get calls on daily basis she there's no electricity for a week we don't have money to pay imagine how you can live without electricity in Saudi is like quit when do you have electricity breakdown sometimes for 15 minutes what happens it's a microwave we live in a microwave you strip from your clothes and and and your spouse is no it's too late it's too late this is what what are we doing it's hot imagine if you have this for a whole week no air conditioning no uh electricity for the food the food rots so they need to pay bills they need to go to the hospital diabetic people can't buy insulin what are you doing it's not my job Sheik these are rights on you you have rights of the near neighbor who's the near neighbor he's someone who is a relative of yours so he's your cousin and your neighbor at the same time then you have the neighbor far he's not your relative but he's a a neighbor still then you have the companion at your side and this is anyone that may accompany you they say it is your travel companion they say it is your wife they say it's any friend of yours so they all have rights over me I'm trying to note this down the notebook is finished what am I going to do these people's rights this is the tip of an iceberg we haven't started yet and this is what you're going to be held accountable on the day of judgment this is what you're going to be questioned about why didn't you do what you were told to do and then is the right of sail the traveler or the wayf farer someone who's traveled then lost means of financing himself to go back maybe he's rich in his country but at the moment he needs a ticket he needs accommodation he needs food give it to him as a lone sheh no as zakat this is his right in Islam so you have also what your hand right hand possesses it's called M they are prisoners of War they are the concubines they are the slaves we don't have them now but they we will have them later because this is an Islamic concept that cannot be abrogated whenever there is war between the Muslims and the non-muslims there have to be prisoners of Wars what do we do take them to Gano no we don't have ganam V we distribute them to Muslim families to serve them and to work for them as slaves but Islam comes and says if you swear by Allah and you break your uh uh oath free a slave if you fight with your wife and say you're Haram like my mom's back free a slave if you have Intimacy in the daytime of Ramadan free a slave free a slave free everything in Islam experation says free a slave if you kill someone by mistake free a slave why because Islam has one source of enslavement and This Is War but it has tens of sources of freeing slav which indicates that this is the only religion that has kindness and mercy in it"
