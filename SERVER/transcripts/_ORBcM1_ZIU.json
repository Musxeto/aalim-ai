  "transcript": "his second question what's the ruling on listening to the rupiah Acharya Rukia is a bundle of verses of the Koran and the hadith of the Prophet as Salam and specific doers where you ask a large Dajjal to heal an illness a depression a possession of jinn an evil eye anything that afflicts a person by reciting it this is called rupiah and the best of Raqqa is the Fatiha then them are with that will who Allah who develop a falafel or bananas ayatul kursi all of these are rupees so he's saying what is ruling on listening to it or reading it listening to it from someone who is reciting it to you this is good but listening to it from a cassette or from a recording does not have the same impact because this is a form of a bada it's a form of worship so it has to be done and performed by someone who's worshiping Allah Azza WA JAL it's like a van it is not permissible as I've seen in some so-called Muslim countries they are calling the van in the whole of the city and sometimes in the whole of the country from one person giving the event and most likely he is it's a recording it's not live no this is not permissible it does not do the job and likewise with look here it has to be performed by you upon yourself or to someone else and Allah knows best"
