  "transcript": "he says here in India Muslim people celebrate the maturity of girl child by family gatherings feasting in other rituals like garland ding the girl and many other absurd rituals is this allowed and if not what is the punishment for such a sin I need to convince my parents for not doing the same first of all Mohammed you have to know that the people in India and in Pakistan in the subcontinent generally had adopted a lot of the Hindu rituals into the customs and traditions and this is why it is essential for Muslims in Arabia for Muslims in North Africa for Muslims in the subcontinent for Muslims from the Malay origin in Indonesia and Malaysia and Singapore and for Muslims in Europe and America it is essential for them to go back to their roots which is the Quran and the Sunnah because Islam is to submit your will to allah azza wajal which means that you have to cross examine everything you do in your life as a Muslim and check whether this is permissible according to your religion and not according to your culture so if there is a clash between religion and your culture and your country and whatever people call you to do you have to give priority to your religion to Islam and secondly we have to be extremely vigilant in the sense that Shaitaan Satan the devil has great experience in what we think and how we think if you ask me for my resume it would be like couple of pages only maybe three pages if you ask for a CEO of a company it might be ten pages Satan has hundreds and thousands of pages he knows exactly how people think so whenever they are extreme he adds to it until he gets them away from the straight path and if they're too lenient he adds to it so that they would go away from the straight path this issue which is celebrating a girl's reaching the age of puberty Shaitaan has a role in this so in some extreme cases and I have seen this because menstruation is a natural thing that Allah has prescribed upon women so I've get a lot of questions of sisters saying that while we are on our menses our brothers our sons our relatives asks us they ask us why don't you pray why don't you fast so I pretend to be fasting and I pray with them while in menses so that they would not ask me this is extreme and this is haram and this is totally prohibited now on the other side you have this type of question going out of their way exposing something that should be concealed something that goes against the bashfulness of girls they expose her and show the people that she had reached puberty in - now she's menstruating they throw a feast this from a celebration everybody in the family knows about it this is totally prohibited and it's an innovation and it's an imitation of the kuffar and it is punishable by Allah and people should fear Allah and not follow blindly the cultures and the customs of the non-muslims a wish"
