  "transcript": "Sammy from Pakistan South LA my question is what's the ruling regarding giving a gun in the year of a newborn I checked in couple of places in books from Jerusalem it says you should give on Islamic Q&A it says you should give but one share from University Medina University he told me that this is based on the hadith and it's better not to give other on Jenny please share your opinion on this I will in sha Allah he I would any more questions ok brother Sammy from Pakistan is asking about the issue of giving the van in the right ear of a newborn and this was mentioned as a prophetic Sunnah and even Elohim may Allah have mercy on his soul mentioned it in his book about the newborn and a lot of the scholars mentioned it but as you know as Muslims we have foundations to go back to and these foundations are the Quran which is fixed and known and cannot be altered or changed and then there is the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam which completes which explains which elaborates and clarifies a lot of the quran however the soon there is what is authentic and there is what is not authentic and what is not authentic is graded into a number of different categories among them among them is the fabricated Alma door or that is a blatant lie Alma Clube or that it is not at all related to reality such as al Bartle there is by feudin very weak there is belief weak and this is an issue of HT had among scholars of hadith therefore if you come to such an issue as giving the advance in the newborn ear it has to be reported to us through an authentic hadith and when we cross-examine the narrations and the chain of narrators and we look into what the scholars of this science have judged it to be we find that they say it is not authentic and there is also another addition to it where you give a armour in the left ear and also this is not authentic hence when we come to such a conclusion as Muslims we do not depend and rely on what the scholars say if they speak in something that is not their profession so if I know that this share is he is speciality is interfere and his knowledge is so vast and huge interfere but he admits himself that I'm not good in fit so if he gives me a fatwa whether halal or Haram I may refrain and think twice and if he grades a hadith to be authentic or not authentic I also may think twice before accepting his verdict likewise in fact when a scholar is an expert in fact he knows all the different opinions of the scholars and he know how we reach this verdict or ruling where did we stem it from what are the power of appeal k√ºbra what are the rulership applied to it the different schools of thought mashallah is excellent however when it comes to the tafseer of ayah he may not have that knowledge so I made a friend in learning from him in tafseer or when it comes to grading a hadith whether it's authentic or not as we have here in this issue then I also may refrain from that so when we go to the scholars of hadith the specialists in this science they tell us that the is not authentic and this is the correct opinion that this is not a sunnah you should not do it and our religion is based on authentic hadith so there is no need to say that it's not harmful to do it yes it is not harmful to do it but if it was if it were a part of our religion it would have been backed by an authentic hadith and it is not an Allah knows best Heber from Upper"
