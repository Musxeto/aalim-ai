  "transcript": "what's the proper way of doing niihka and what are the requirements like everything I hate these questions that comes and that come and say tell us everything this is not an encyclopedia here this is a Q&A program I cannot devote a lecture for everything you have to be specific so generally speaking what is the proper way of doing niihka the proper way in Islam for marriage nakaya's marriage is that the father of the girl or her guardian if she doesn't have a father than her brother if she doesn't have a brother then her son if she doesn't have a son then her uncle then her cousin paternal all not maternal so they propose that this is known as a there has to be a proposal from the garden he says I give you my daughter in marriage this is the proposal the e job there has to be a response known as Kabul acceptance so the boy says I accept her marriage and this has to be in the presence of two male Muslim witness witnesses or more we don't have to specifically I identify them as ammidon Mohammed if we are in a gathering and everyone is listening this is sufficient though we did not specify who the witnesses are and one of the conditions is that a maha is given a dowry from the boys side to the girl and this is either agreed upon before the marriage contract that usually the boys or his father says listen we're giving twenty thousand thirty thousand riyals is that okay and the girl's father says yeah it's okay or this is no we are interested in fifty thousand for example so it's given take or if they did not disclose an amount then the judge looks at the average that women in that area take as a dowdy and he forces the boy to give it and that's it end of story the marriage took place of course the consent of the boy and the girl is a priority and but this is by default because if the girl does not accept the boy in marriage the marriage is void and the father of the boy cannot just simply propose and his son is unaware of that this also is not valid and I hope this answers your question"
