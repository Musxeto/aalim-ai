  "title": "Scholars who say Mortgage loans are permissible in the land of disbelievers - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sarah from canada she says we have a problem in canada and europe and the u.s when people find that mortgage is a possibility of owning a house so we get people and mortgage by the way is a ripa based loan it's an interest-based loan take taken from a conventional bank or a financial institution you want this property a million dollars you pay is 1.5 what is the 0.5 this is interest and it might be compound so you agree on a 1.5 and it increases due to inflation and interest rate so you end up paying 1.7 maybe 2 million you never know what is the end result so some people scholars quote unquote who justify this and they say the hanafi school of thought say that you can deal with haram in the lands of kufur etc and they give lame excuses and justifications but when a person's heart has it has room for corruption then it is easy to convince if i am a person who is fixed and adamant to get a property i wouldn't care who says it's halal as long as there is someone who says it's halal and look he has a beard and look he has a phd and look he has this halas i'll take his word who is he i don't know who authenticated him i don't know but he looks like a good shaykh this is not halal so to buy a property with mortgage with interest-based loans it's a major sin it's a sin that allah curses the one who gives the interest which is you the one who takes it which is the bank the one who witnesses it and the one who just registers it like the clerks it's a major sin allah waged war against those who deal in riba so definitely this is a no brainer for a muslim to stay away from and even if you pay rent for the rest of your life if you don't have money to buy a property parent i'm almost 60 years of age and i've been paying rent all of my life i don't have a property i don't have a plot i don't have a house but i'm not poor alhamdulillah but i don't have enough money to buy a house so what did that make me a lesser a lesser person no but when people are fixated when they are focused on worldly matters buying a car buying a property taking their kids to private schools so they don't care where they get the money and where they spend it they don't care if this pleases allah or angers allah and this is extremely dangerous you"
