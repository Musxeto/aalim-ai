  "title": "How to call people to Islam? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "I met from Saudi Arabia he says I know a lot of non-muslims how can I call them to Islam Mohammed this is a very wide topic calling people to Islam is not one size that fits all it's not a glove that we can wear each one is different and this is why we have five different fingers so one I can call to Islam through showing him the scientific signs of Islam another is impressed by the legislative system the Sharia law a third is fascinated by the family system in Islam and the role of parents and how we respect and adore them and the kinship solitare ahem etc a fourth is admiring the monetary system of Islam where RIBA is prohibited gambling is prohibited by LRR there are different types of transactions that protect me and you and the whole community so you cannot say how can I ask people to come into Islam or how can I give them dower people differ the most important thing is that you become a real Muslim you cannot call people to Islam when you yourself are not practicing it so you tell people intoxicants and how model and etc whiskey is Haram and you drink you cannot tell them that RIBA is curse in the Quran and you have your money in a time a fixed deposit account you cannot tell them that you must lower your gaze and not look really at the opposite gender the opposite sex while you're watching OSN Rutan mbc 24/7 this contradicts you have to walk the talk so the biggest and the best way of calling people to Islam is through your actions and character once they see you honest do not lie do not abuse you come to work on time you leave on time you fulfill your duties at work you never cheat you never oppress people and you're honest you never lie you never break a promise they attribute this to your religion and you must possess the necessary knowledge you will whenever you make the hour to people and calling them to Islam you'll be faced with it a lot a flood of questions if you don't have the knowledge to back this up then either you will answer it wrongly or you'll keep on saying I don't know I don't know I don't know and you will not give doubt properly when you have knowledge of the Quran and the Sunnah if someone tells you why does this have to be this way and that has to be in that way in this case you can easily answer them through the Quran through the Sunnah and through logic which they understand more analyze Oh JAL knows best"
