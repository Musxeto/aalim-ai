  "title": "Is Mosquito blood impure and does it impact our prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and what about the blood of a mesquito the blood of a mosquito is negligible and it is human blood therefore it is not najis but it's unhygienic so people by default usually would not have this on their clothes without washing it and cleaning it but if they do pray with it it's negligible and it is insha allah not impacting their prayer"
