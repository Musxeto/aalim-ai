  "title": "How to give Dawah to relatives who do not pray - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says that she has relatives that prey on and off or let us say that they prey but sometimes they skip prayer due to some reasons either legitimate or not so she argues with them so she says how to convince them first of all Dawa is an art so when you call people to Islam when you call people to practice something in your religion you have to be an artist and that is why you have to use wisdom and fair preaching order Alessa Belial a big call to the way of your lord with wisdom and fair preaching sometimes it may be best not to talk sometimes it can be by telling a story sometimes you can lead others by example so it depends those you are talking to I'm assuming you have no authority on them such as your children or your younger sisters etc who you have great control over so in this case the only way to call them is to use politics diplomacy being respectful using the best means possible to penetrate their hearts but when you are bossing them when you are always in your ivory tower you have to do this you have to do that Allah will take you to hell if you do this your nobody listens to you if they don't feel that you are sincere and that you love them and that you want to give them a precious gift they will not accept it from you and they may not even if they felt that they may not even accept it except after three four six months so you have to be patient and you have to change your strategies so that before you open your mouth think of the different scenarios that might happen think of the consequences and then evaluate and decide hmm should I speak or should I refrain but to always boss them and say you have to do this you have to do that you don't fear Allah why are you letting the prayer time slip away why aren't you playing the message you're not many nobody accepts this so before talking it might be advisable to look in the mirror and look how you address them and imagine if you were in their shoes would you accept such an advice coming from such a person in such a way or not"
