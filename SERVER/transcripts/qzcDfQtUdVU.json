  "transcript": "isharaq from singapore says when we are in a non-muslim country and we are given some sort of food like cakes breads etc and we don't know what the the origin of such food is what should we do when we talk about general food that are not non-veg in the sense that such food is um bread we're talking about cakes we're talking about candies these things normally don't contain haram ingredients normally so there is no problem in buying cheese buying bread buying cake when we talk about non-veg such as things that have meat in them if you are in a country that is predominantly christian then the food there the meat there is halal for you by default unless proven otherwise unless proven that it is pork or it was not slaughtered in this case totally becomes haram so singapore to my knowledge is not a christian country it's a kafir country there are lots of um what do we call them buddhist maybe hindus i don't know about their culture so this is something different because it's not a christian country and hence if you get gifts that contain turkey or it contains meat or contains things derived from it you should refrain from it until proven that it is halal so as long as the label is there this is halal you"
