  "title": "Children don't pray or not pray on time when mom tells them, is she sinful on day of judgement assim",
  "transcript": "I have a question in regard of my mother she's basically strangling a little bit with my siblings in discipling them to pray on time and uh it's very hard for her because every time she gives this advice either they don't pray or they delay prayer and they are lost in this new phone technology smartphones so what is the advice under ruling is my mother um taken into account in the day of judgment because of that if the children are grown up which are most likely and they are like Teenage or over 20 and she advises them to pray and they don't listen she has done her Duty she there's nothing else she could do and they're accountable they are adults and they will be punished in their graves and also on the day of judgment but if they are children so they are like 10 11 12 years of age she is accountable because she's in charge of them alongside with her husband so she has to do something about it even if she's uh in need of taking her their phone uh phones and smartphones from them depriving them from the uh accessing the internet something that would reprimand them but she has to weigh the pros and cons and do it yeah in a way that she figures out that the consequence would be positive for their sake and Allah Knows Best"
