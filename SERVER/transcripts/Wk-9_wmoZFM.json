  "transcript": "he says can you give me details about the war between ali and allah be pleased with them because we hear a lot of things aki i wasn't there so i cannot give you the details of what had happened between them what i can give you are the following one the prophet alaihis salatu salaam told us that ali is one of the ten heaven bound so he is one of the top four in islam men without a doubt two the prophet told us that there will come a time where two great factions of the ummah would fight and the wrong party would lead ahmad niyasir to be killed and ammar nyaser was with the army of ali so we know that the other side was wrong three we know for certain that muawiyah may allah be pleased with him and with his father was the brother-in-law of the prophet meaning that the prophet was married to his sister um habiba the mother of the believers and that he was one of the scribes of the wahi so whenever the prophet received revelation of the quran was ordered to come and write these verses which is an honor that is not given to any tom dick or harry fourthly we believe that the companions are in jannah and that they are among those whom allah had his pleasure uh be upon them allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with allah azzawajal so it would be illogical for us to go and try to sort out what had happened and talk ill about one part or party and talk good about the other they had a dispute and whatever were the reasons uh were there were among their armies people who did not want peace and he who initiated and ignited the fire of war which caused to what we know does this mean that they are this or that no they are companions of the prophet we must love them and respect them and we believe that they did what they uh had done out of good intention and allah azza is the judge you need not go a further a step after all of that because anything else would lead you to speaking ill about one of the companions and the prophet said told us leave uh my companions leave them aside let them be because if one of you were to give the equivalents of in the cause of allah this would not come close to the mud of one of them nor a half of it so if you spend the weight of mount uh in gold this would not come close to what one of them spends in the palms of his hand or even in one palm of his hand so definitely you should stay away from that and allah knows best"
