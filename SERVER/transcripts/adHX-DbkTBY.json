  "transcript": "can hear you um if we do a sin movie uh if you do a sin and think it's like we're doubtful whether it's a sin but due to our circumstances black should we use that ruling right certainty is not overcome by doubt this is dependent on what you're thinking if someone thinks that drinking green tea with mint in a black mug is sinful but he's doubtful he's he doesn't know we say no this is too much this is ridiculous everything is halal and pure by default until proven otherwise but if there is something that you feel that is rubbing your your chest from inside and you feel I've I don't like this I have a very bad feeling my gut feeling says that this is Haram and this is not whispering of shaytan this is a particular incident that you're more inclined that this is sinful that normal people would not like this then you must refrain from it and abstain until you search and are certain but generally speaking if someone has this feeling that 95 percent of everything around him is Haram and he's doubtful should I do this should I ride on car and drive on the left uh steering wheel in normal countries because this is the left or should I up and get a car in the UK where the steering wheel is on the right this is the Sunnah this is ridiculous so you'd have to look into each scenario and knowing that okay this deals with the opposite gender I have a bad feeling about it stay away the default is that you should not be in touch with the opposite gender who are none Maham to you so there isn't anything to search for at the moment so you stay away until you find an answer to it unlike normal things that using a pad or a pen or a mug or whatever which is normal and Allah Knows Best"
