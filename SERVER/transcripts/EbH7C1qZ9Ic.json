  "transcript": "on the massacre that took uh place four days or 5 days ago in Pakistan in Pisha where a number of terrorist uh rampaged a school killing about 130 plus uh school children and we didn't get such questions so I've been getting emails people asking is this permissible is this part of Islam and I don't even understand how can people ask such a question it is totally prohibited in Islam to kill innocent people it is prohibited by the prophet to kill children or to kill women the prophet Alam saw once a a hen a bird that was terrified because some of the companions took her chicks so he said who frightened this with her chicks return it back to her so frightening an animal a bird like that is prohibited so what's rolling on frightening mothers sisters with their uh own children like what had happened is there any justification W there is no justification none whatsoever this was a barbaric attack done by people with no mercy in their hearts done with people that have no connection to Islam they may claim that they are defending their lands or they're defending their ideology they do not relate to ISL I'm not giving them Tak now be careful takir is a different issue it's a different bowl game but I say what they are doing is not representing Islam like those who appear on Arab Idol or Arab gut Talent OR these corrupt programs they don't represent Islam they don't relate to Islam I'm not giving them t as well but they do not represent Islam this is not our religion they say that killing those children is in reprisal and avenging the children that were killed by the drones attacks and by uh different uh um reasons or for different reasons is this uh uh applicable the answer is no it's not applicable if we have a wrong act this does not justify another wrong act two wrongs do not make a right so if someone rapes your wife if someone if if the cafir for example they rape Muslim women is this a card blanch for Muslim men to go and rape Muslim non-muslim women touche definitely not this is Haram act by itself what kind of a religion they are doing so these children they're innocent they are not to be killed and even more see if a a woman should not be killed but what about if a woman is a fighter uh uh um uh pilot or she's a warrior carrying guns and and coming to kill people Scholars say that without any doubt she has to be killed because she's a fighter in the case of children if they carry a gun and they start fighting if you can abduct them without killing them this is a must why because the these children don't have uh uh uh logic they don't know what's happening it's like an insane person with an AK-47 killing people he doesn't know what's happening so you don't kill him in reprisal and if a mad non-muslim person killed Muslims do we go and kill all the the the crazy people there this is not applicable at all so this barbaric Act is unjustifiable it's totally prohibited and those who have done it are criminals if you know anything about them report them let them spend the rest of their lives in uh uh prisons if not executed as a punishment for what they've done this is the ruling and this is the responsibility of the Muslim uh ruler may Allah give uh uh Mercy to their parents and may Allah Asel um give them something in return that would give their hearts uh uh um coolness and satisfaction KH"
