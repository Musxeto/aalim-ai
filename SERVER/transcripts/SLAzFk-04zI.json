  "transcript": "alhamdulillah all Praises due to Allah we ask Allah to exalt the Manion Grant peace and send his blessings upon the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam the schools of thought the schools of thought in Islam Where Do We Stand we have with us our beloved Dr MD Muhammad welcome do and ABD mthi and we were discussing in a previous episode the issue of fatwa shopping I don't know if you went shopping since but can you elaborate more on fatwa shopping what does shopping have to do with fatwa and how did these two come together in one word so the fet shopping which is the when we say we want the people to explore the danger is that when some people do now is they find the feto shop you mentioned the example last episode of smoking so somebody wants to smoke he's going to try to find even though probably now there's really nobody who says it's Halal even the ones who said it maku at first now they know it causes cancer it kills you they now say it's Haram so you're rarely going to find any modern day scholar who would say it's Mak so he might look for those old fetas when it first came into the Islamic girl that is Mak so he can keep smoking it's not really Haram the funny thing is that you'll find Scholars who would say who smoke themselves and they say listen if it's Haram we're burning it if it's Halal we're smoking it so they'll play with words goe exactly so this is the danger we talk about f with shopping so they people are actually we mean shopping just like when you go shopping you want to buy what you want you go to the grocery store you choose your product you go to buy furniture you choose the couch you want the bedroom set you want so people are looking for the fet way that suits them and obviously there's going to be a lot of things that are not correct when they follow this is the danger of this so what what is the relationship with this to following the or the schools of thought is a lot of people going to say that it's actually better somebody just follows a school of thought and relaxes CU when you open up the door to look for what's more authentic he could actually fall into fall into that which is astray so it's better for him just to follow one of these great imams IM Malik IM abif IM shed isn't it safer well the lesson I guess would be then the sincerity of the believer all everything seems to revolve around the person the of the matter yeah you can go fwa shopping I think in Arabic they call it it's like people always looking for the concession so you know if if he doesn't agree with something say yeah but this IM said it's okay and I need it now so I'll just act upon it but if the person is sincere they fear Allah then I guess they will not be able to to deal with it in this manner yeah and this is something very important that we should develop and raise our kids and the Muslims through do do you want to please please yourself or do you want to please Allah do you want to be sincere for Allah subhana wa tala or you want to please yourself and please your how and to please your NFS and to please the other people if the Muslim is trained on this I think we will have less problems in the future inshallah so I would never go shopping for a fatwa I would ask this SCH I would be very sincere in looking for a person yes to give me the fat that pleases Allah subhana tala not to please myself well I'm still waiting for the evid Ence someone to site an evidence from the Quran as why is it that we you know whenever we have all these people presenting their opinions and there's a there's a conflict there's one individual whom we are supposed to follow blindly can we say that it's true but if I may comment a little bit further on the issue of fatwa shopping the problem is not with the students of knowledge because what who you're talking about with the intention are the students of knowledge the problem is with the majority of the Muslims who are the Layman who do pick what suits them so they go to the four schools of thought and they become selective and they should not because like ABD said If a person does not have the ability to select or to know to verify which is authentic and which is not then it's the safest thing for him is to follow one maab but when that person becomes selective in the sense that he says listen now marriage I know it requires the approval of the Guardian it requires giving ay it requires at least the presence of two witnesses so if he becomes if I meet someone at the University and I like her she likes me and I said listen according to Abu hanifah I don't have to seek your guardian's approval and you can marry yourself and according to one of the mabs of IM Shafi the presence of two Witnesses is not required and according in one saying or opinion in M Malik Dar is not an issue so how about it she says start tonight right yep yep yep right there and and we can tangle so is this okay definitely not this is manipulating this is distorting Allah's religion Allah in the midst of all of these difference of opinions gave us a strict and clear evidence Allah says whenever there's dispute refer back to Allah and his messenger meaning refer back to the Quran and to theah so this is the line that clears all dispute and is the line that we're supposed to follow so it's more like we're supposed to submit to Allah through Islam and it's like some people may want to make Islam submit to their choices true so they they actually twisting around the very the very essence of the religion the four I remember you mentioned before in the previous episode they now my understanding is that the four are primarily dealing with f issues Juris Prudence now how do we understand this in the light of a as in could someone be a blind follower of one of the four yet not have the or once someone follows one of these IMS then by you know default he is upon the AA or is there a variation between these two because I am a student of knowledge I will take it to a higher level to Sheik marcari to answer this question Be Our Guest this question it's very important actually what you mentioned and this is something that always any troubled me I can't believe it when I travel around the Islamic world that you'll find somebody and because these four imams they didn't just go into issues of jurist prudence only they went in depth into the and you see the it's the of these IMs as well that this their belief and there's no any one or two slight differences maybe that they might have had one issue with Abu other than that issue of IM which is a small issue rhetorical it's it's not actually when you come to so there's no really if you look at there's no difference of opinion between them and the belief yet you'll find Muslims who have the audacity today to say I'm a Malik I'm a but they don't follow the they don't follow the belief of these imams which is it sounds kind of crazy when you go to the they're really into it and they won't go away from it I mean I found one guy to the extent that he told me issue we talked about in the first episode about the water and we showed him all of the scholars said these Hadith are not authentic and he said I will follow the methab of Malik even if it goes against the Hadith and I was like wow you know I said this and we clearly showed it to him he a guy who studied Arabic and he studied the and he knew he said I will not leave the but when he came to the issues of he said I'm I'm not on he said I don't follow the of IM Malik so I was like you know who is more knowledgeable in this issue so that's a fwa shopper exactly go back in a sense and then he says my methodology in spiritualism is this or this way of this and that so they follow all it's it's now become like three in one Subhan Allah it's they've made a little Trinity right when when the is there're running away from Trinity but the the reality is there when you I mean who is better IM Malik or somebody else who came after him they're the ones who know the a they're one who the correct a so all of them had the same belief and and is something very troubling how somebody can run away from that belief we want standardized answer for any individual who may push the following of one maab blindly while excluding and ignoring everything else what can we say to any person who says no you must follow the mhab or the opinion of immed or IM sha or Malik or IM Abu hanif what is that one answer that we can say to all of them which if they were sincere would satisfy them simply to go back to the sources to the fundamentals of any proper Muslim ask any individual a who are you following the book of Allah and the sunah of the Prophet or XY Z usually they will come with the argument of okay isn't Imam Ahmed following the Quran Sunnah so I'm following him so no actually you're following his understanding but Allah tells you in black and white in the Quran the question that you'll be asked on the day of judgment what did you respond to the messenger who came to you the prophet Alam you're not going to be asked what did Imam Malik or his students say or what did Imam hanifah and his two students say you will be asked about your response to the prophet Alam and this is the question you're going to be asked in Your Grave what did you do with what you knew what did you do with following the prophet Alam who is your lord who's your prophet and what is your religion but also I see one of the problems here is following the one's own desire and this is that makes people go and buy fat from to the degree that the Quran said something about this that says that so here the people the verse means that some people take their desires and whims and make them their own Gods because they follow their desires instead of following what Allah subhana wa tala said and this is the essence of Islam is to submit your desires to submit yourself to what Allah subhana Islam Islam right as you mentioned it it's not vice versa it's not submitting Islam to your desires so this is this this is a very important concept and I think we need to find a good uh title for it like shipping for fatwas we need to it's not submitting yourself to Allah not submitting the religion to yourself right okay well I guess that will be something we could discuss after the break in fact and uh perhaps we can also deal with the issue of for example we can say to the person that your IM who you're following blindly who was he following and if his OB was to lead you to the prophet but do you say he did it 100% or did he fail sometimes if you agree he wasn't he failed therefore if you find another path you should just go by the path maybe we can elaborate on that after the break inshallah the weather is nice but the discussion is hot we were dealing with the issue of kind of coming up with a slogan or a new expression as to the nature of their slave in Islam what what does he do and what is his role and does he make the religion submit to him or does he submit to the religion and we were going to discuss we said also a standard answer which we can give in regards to those who are overly attached to the one opinion of the IM and so perhaps you can begin brother McCarthy on this issue inshah before we go into that I think we need to discuss a very important issue we it's interesting how many topics come up about this it's very interesting topic about the schools of thought and there's so much to talk about but we need to focus on finding the cure for a problem that we have in the umah today and that is that we have basically two extremes the true true students of knowledge they're always in the middle and the correct path in Islam wherever you look at anything it's always in the middle and we have some Muslims even some who might be students of knowledge who absolutely blind follow the M like we mentioned the guy who said I don't care about the Hadith I'm going to follow what I was taught in my M and they don't care and then you have another which actually has a form of hatred almost if not a serious hatred for the imams yeah I've come across a lot of seen this very strange and they actually look at the person who follows one of the imams as being like a as being who's an innovator in their religion this is serious so we have these two extremes I think we need to talk about these this is because we want to solve this problem we want the um to come to the the middle path on this right this is a very important topic because now when you look at the major Scholars of Islam who studed let's look at for example IM no IM IM did any of them come up not studying aab initially they must have had a maab all of them initially had it so this was the proper methodology and being a student knowledge they studied these mabs all of them you're not going to find IM ABD major Scholars of Islam they studied the maab and he one or different no once they start off studying the maab this was the first step and then they start to study after that obviously more MBS and to see the difference of opinions and they would take that was correct and leave that was not correct like yeah yeah but even the student of knowledge as we mentioned who can filter he can do that but the point is is that all of them took the path of studying the meab so it's nothing wrong we need to make it clear here there's nothing wrong with studying a meab there's nothing wrong with studying what's wrong is the blind following so we don't want to be the extreme you say you can't study meab because it's not the methodology of our Scholars you're going to try to get somewhere without going the proper way all of the scholars went this way so why would we choose another path that's why you find so many students of knowledge who try to go other than that path their knowledge is it's it's all mixed up it's everywhere but the ones who went the path of the scholars they studied the maab and then after they learned it they start to study other mabs as well look here and there that was good for them but we don't want to stay there at the blind following you'll find people who have been studying 20 30 years and they will not leave what their Imam said this is also very dangerous so we need to always follow that middle path in all aspects of Islam I think education solves some of these problems I remember that some people told me that who lived in in Mecca that I think 70 years ago or so they said that at the time of Salat you would hear the aan and one person from Maliki would make the Adan and only the Malik people would pray was that close to that 70 years ago yes approximately almost 70 years just 70 years and you see nowadays I I still remember the Haram 30 years ago nothing like this happened so in a very short time this has changed and this is in Mecca the most yes the most sacred place in the world nobody nobody looks at that you see the difference today changed yes and I think the reason that this changed is the spread of correct knowledge and I think even these two episodes that we have done about this topic will affect many people in the world inshallah and will'll make them try to look for yes and I like what you said that when we are asked in our Graves about the three questions who is your lord what is your religion and who is the prophet who was sent to you your not in that one yeah this is exactly what I wanted to know so here there's no question that will be asked who is your IM what's your M every Muslim should be aware of that you're not going to be asked about this these are only the three questions that you're going to be asked so why worry about the issue of an IM now or a maab now so I should focus on the prophet sallallahu alai other than focusing on other if you allow me yes I do what concerns me most is not the F issues regarding to school of thought so I can understand the difference is there and I respect people who differ with me so for example I see that a woman should cover her face but if I see someone who follows other opinion I'm okay with that because he's following what his conviction applies to him the biggest problem is with the blind followers of imams of Dal imams of the wrong path deviant imams when you find the masses of the Muslims and this brings me to Dr M's point of Education you find educated people PhD holders doctors Engineers blindly following a deviant im an IM that says for example I see the prophet Alat alive 10 times a day what is this he prays in Mecca his 5 Day prayers one of the imams claimed to that to go he went on Hajj and came the same night what is this no no no very recently somebody said that I talked to Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam over the phone this is very recently even more ridiculously one was saying that he saw the prophet and he spoke to him and he cried saying that the people of the country he was in refused to give him a ticket to go back W this this un oh yeah yeah I heard this is pathetic itic and you find people blindly following this person so whether you put your hand on your chest or you don't put your hand in prayer this is nothing this is part of the Sunnah if your prayer is is valid now when it comes to when it comes to your belief and claiming to follow a school of thought or I don't I would not consider this not a school of thought a school of thought it's a school of deviant thought yes this is this is Paradise or hellfires evolves on this one here this is the key is the key issue so this is why we call the Muslims to purify their AKA and to learn their religion not from Tom Dick or Harry to learn their religion from the Quran from the Sunnah and on the understanding of the Companions and the righteous Scholars may Allah be pleased with them right by this you are definitely following the footsteps of the Prophet Alam these things exist so it seems that the schools of thought have went beyond the four schools of thought and now we have all kinds of schools of thought which is not the standard things of the four imams we have all kinds of people so people are going astray in all directions it's not only that see they Bank on the reputation of the four Imam and that is yes they're deviant so they can't say that I'm following this school of thought or that so they claim that I'm following this particular school of thought of the four widely accepted schools of thought and they invest it with their own corrupt ideas and they say their deviant ideology they say okay the the usual answer is but everyone is doing it you guys are are a bunch of extrem not doing it is there an answer is there an answer for those who say everyone like when it comes to numbers majority versus minority do you have anything from the Quran and the Sunnah which addresses the issue of numbers whether they do make a difference I mean I think one of the vers that I recall from the Quran if you follow the majority of the people on the Earth they would have deviated you it's not by the majority so if you follow the majority of the people on the Earth on the planet they will deviate you so majority is not is not a the famous when he said on the day of judgment there will come up a prophet and pay attention to this a prophet who's been chosen by Allah subhana wa tala who will have maybe two people with him have one person and we have nobody with him a prophet so the number games it's a joke it doesn't matter about the numbers it matters about quality the quality I remember one of the scholars of was using very simple techniques to convince those people who would say that I am a shaf or I am H or I am they used to say that I have a simple question for you if you answer it you will know was the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam was the prophet was and the answer all the time is no and no and no so if the prophet Sall wasallam is none of these so why do you want to be a follower of someone and you have the original one that you can follow very easily and if we go back to the to the early history of Islam it was something you have to do if you go astray if you don't follow one of these imams it's back to the issue of is is it w do we have to do it what about the early Muslims before the time of the what about were they all Sinners were they all asay obviously they didn't have it and as mentioned before there was a lot of schools of thought we have had they the same amount of knowledge but the the students they have are the ones who spread it the point is is that and he found his we want to focus on this and these are some of the greatest Scholars of Islam we have to have love as as people sunah for IM abif we have to have love for Imam Malik IM Shafi and Ahmed and we have to have hatred for those who hate them because they were the ones who strove night day to spread the sunah of the Prophet Muhammad and we do have it have the love for all the all of them no no difference we don't and you'll find people and it came to the time not just you mention about the the different Jama the different groups who used to pray in the har even the marriage you remember these stories that you were not allowed to marry if you were H to marry alh these days as you say with education and the more authentic knowledge that is spreading these things are start doubt in this is good that doesn't mean we want to put away the these we need them we're not going to get to understand the Quran without them but also alhamdulillah we need to continue on this path we're going with not blind following them or making it a war between ourselves if you follow a different school of thought than me well I couldn't have said it better and uh therefore that concludes our discussion I hope inshallah there was a benefit in fact I feel that there was a benefit and we addressed the issue pretty objectively by Allah's grace and mercy and so we thank you for tuning in and we'll catch you inshallah in the next episode alum"
