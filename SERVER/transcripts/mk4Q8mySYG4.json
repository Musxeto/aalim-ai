  "transcript": "Bano says is there any significance in people claiming that they found a Las name written on bread that they baked or on an apple or a vegetable or see it on any structure like Iraq or a fish etc how do we explain to such people about it first of all there is no significance none whatsoever of this at all this is a test from allah azzawajal and it also can be part of the whispers of Shaitaan now people say this is a miracle a child was born with the name of Allah those are on his arm I opened our split an apple into two halves and one of the half I found muhammad rasoolullah a photographer took a photo of an orchard or a garden and fees you can see clearly la ilaha illa llah so this is a sign Muslims don't need this it was never displayed at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam where he went and said look guys it's written Allah or it's written Muhammad or whatever because it has no significance what has importance in our lives is the Quran is the Sunnah and that is it imagine to those who claim that this has significance and importance and that it this is a miracle imagine if a Christian opened a watermelon and it was engraved in it Jesus the Son of God what will you say then oh this is from Shaitaan why is this from Shaitaan and this is from a ram and you can't cherry pick like this so we say the same thing this has no significance is from Shaitaan he's messing up with you likewise here it's from Shaitaan he's messing up with you if you see a rock with a rock formation or even a mountain and you see that it there is the name of Allah engraved on it or in a way the wind made it look like this this has no significance in Islam at all as Muslims as believers we don't pay any attention to that and I would advise you to do the same"
