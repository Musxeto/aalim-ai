  "title": "Are vacations and work trips counted as travel to skip fasting? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] those traveling include family vacations work trips etc some people think that the traveling that is permissible for us to break our fast through is when it's for business but it fits for a ledger for a vacation for tourism then it's not Halle know any travel that you offer as long as it is halal travel then it's permissible what do you mean by halal travel well sometimes we travel to sin people travel to other cities to commit sin to fornicate to consume intoxicants to have the intention not to fast ah okay now I understand so someone who's in his home country fasting and he's fed up so come on I've been fasting for two weeks it's too much for me I'm gonna travel to X Y Z City so that I can spend the rest of the month not fasting if this is your intention this is Haram and your sinful and be careful because you may fall in one of the biggest sins possible which require the biggest exploration possible what do you mean someone who's fasting looks at his spouse and desires his wife but it's daytime in Ramadan and he knows that he cannot have any intimacy so he books a plane travels to another city and considers himself to be not fasting causes a traveler and he has intimacy with with his wife what's your ruling he has to fast two consecutive months huh why because he had intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan but he was traveling nope he traveled to have intercourse and this is why he's doing a trick upon Allah as if he's tricking Allah soldier if he had a legitimate business deal he has to travel and he does travel he takes his wife with him both of them have the permission not too fast now they can do whatever hanky-panky didn't want no problem because the origin of their travel is legit but to reverse it and in order to have intimacy he travels and breaks his fast this is a trick and he has to pay for that [Music] you [Applause]"
