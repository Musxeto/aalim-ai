  "title": "Do Angels pray behind us when we pray alone at home? #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is there anything um Hadith or anything that is backing up saying that when we pray alone at home or something that Angels pray behind us this is my question no there is nothing to my knowledge that confirms the fact or the thought the idea that when we pray alone at home Angels pray behind us and take us as inam the only Hadith I know of is when a person stands to pray in the middle of the night and offer his tahajud the Sunnah is to use the misak and to brush your teeth so that you would clean your mouth because once you stand to pray an angel is standing in front of you placing his mouth in front of your mouth so so whatever you recite would go into him honoring the Quran so this is the only Hadith I know of and Allah Knows Best"
