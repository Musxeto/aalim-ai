  "title": "If a man gives divorce to his wife on menses, does it count? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is if a husband in a photo fridge says to his wife I have given you talaq when the wife was having her periods and later he stops his wife from leaving and she stays back then does it count as one talat this is an issue of dispute and issues related to divorce can't be solved over the phone because the Sheikh has to listen to both parties and examine the circumstances and what is the degree of anger and how it was said generally speaking the four schools of thought say that divorce given when a woman was in her menses is sinful but it takes place a minority of Scholars say it does not take place but the four schools of thought the majority of them the majority of Scholars say no it does take place and this is the logical thing because the vast majority of divorce cases happen when a woman is in her Menses or in a state of Purity which included intimacy so this means that 95 or 99 percent of the divorce cases did not take place this would be a game every time the guy is angry said I divorce you say oh are you in your menses she says no oh we had intimacy last night so it doesn't count okay let's go back and he does this 20 30 10 100 times this is not Islam so it not for your case the general tendency is the divorce does take place and it counts as one if it's the first time and he has the right to reconcile or revoke it one down to to go Sam"
