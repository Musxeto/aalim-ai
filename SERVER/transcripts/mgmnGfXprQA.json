  "transcript": "we have what is known in some countries as honor killing there's no honoring killing but whenever they doubt that their daughter spoke to a relative or to a neighbor or thought of getting married to someone from another country the only way to erase such shame is by killing her which means that those culprits would go to hellfire for their major sin and they have nothing to do with islam definitely they have nothing to honor"
