  "transcript": "knows best ibraim from Saudi Arabia he says that he has three children and they have completed their a levels o levels or whatever but in international schools and they have no interest in studying Islam while he wants them to be D and Scholars of Islam a you have made the biggest mistake from the very beginning by putting them in international schools and I know about jida because I'm from jida and I know about Saudi Arabia most AAL schools are so far away from Islam except a handful one or two the majority of so-called international schools the people the parents who take their children to these schools are only interested in English no religion no Quran no etiquette and nothing at all my my granddaughters go to such and my grandson one of them go to such schools and I've spoke to to their parents but to no Veil they want them to speak English as if English is the magical word that takes them from poverty to wealth and richness and from being uh uh so down into uh being prestigious and sophisticated Etc not knowing that this has the worst impact on their religion on their culture on their Arabic language even when they are in grade two or grade three you ask them about prayers they don't know how to pray they don't know what to say in prayer this is pathetic this is something that angers Muslims there isn't any proper monitoring and this is wrong this is the role of the Ministry of Education to enforce teaching Islamic Studies properly in these international schools instead of making and preparing children who would become enemies of the country they will become brainwashed westernized only thinking in English wanting to watch English movies Listening to English music the culture is different the way of life is different so this is our mistake from the very beginning now am I promoting Islamic schools I've been trying my level best to establish Islamic schools with an international curriculum there's nothing wrong in that I've seen Dr Zach's uh uh Islamic schools Islamic International School I think IIs I I've seen it firsthand in mumbay and it was shocking it was astonishing I've met the students who graduated who've never been to Saudi Arabia or who just came to om once every two or three years and they spoke fluent English and they were excellent in their Arabic they were fluent in Arabic and they were excellent in their math in their chemistry in their physics and mashallah they were excellent and they did tawu and good in swimming and if we can mimic and clone such schools worldwide wah this would be one of the biggest achievements of Muslims because you will be planting and infesting Islam values from the own country by their own people instead of getting a DI to travel left and right and center you can get di within Pro providing that you give them the right Islamic curriculum with the right Islamic mentality to deal with their culture Etc so this is your uh U biggest problem you can take a horse to water but you cannot force it to drink how to make them love Islam you have to start from square one you have to make them pray on time take them to the Masjid beautify the Islamic knowledge the Quran the Sunnah to them take them on field trips take them to mecah and Medina let them try to see the beautiful culture that we have the beautiful religion that we have and relate them to Allah maybe then inshallah things would become better ABD Rahman from saudian I apologize"
