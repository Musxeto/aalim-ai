  "transcript": "if I'm in the if I'm in the beach with other brothers and the time for solar comes can we pray together in congregation or do we have to go to the Masjid if it is a normal gathering and you're all dressed up and clean and the message is within the vicinity sometimes you can hear the Adhan and the message is five clicks away no you don't have to pray there but if it is within a mile and a half or a couple of kilometers and you can walk it within ten to 15 minutes in this case you must pray but if you are in the beach swimming playing with the sand covering all over the place asking you to go to the Masjid would not be wise because you're not in the appropriate state to enter a Masjid you'd probably make the place dirty with sand and the worshipers would not feel comfortable with you around in this case Marshall life you are a big Jumeirah in this case play pray where you are and this is one scent very blue moon so you don't have a problem with that it's Allah"
