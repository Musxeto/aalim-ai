  "transcript": "nevermind I'm reliable I mean Hosni Mubarak arrived in he was who I mean the being a wanna and he was so happy he that's me the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam told us to take a visor a barrier if you wish between us and Hellfire and he told us that even if you had to make this visor or barrier by giving in charity half a date not a full date but half a date if not then use a good word and he also told us that a good word is charity so what is meant by a good word see the concept of paying attention to what comes out of your mouth is very important in Islam it can make it or break it the prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam told us that an individual may utter a phrase a word a sentence of the pleasure of allah without paying any attention and it will ascend him to the highest levels of jannah this is a good word and the best of good words is la ilaha illallah this is al karima to PE yet a good word can be manifested in so many different ways a good word is when you make someone happy a good word is when you compliment another a good word can be a word of encouragement imagine what would happen if every single time you meet your parents you say good words though they may abuse you you reply in good sentences though may they may be angry with you and you always try to make them happy how much reward would that be at the side of a larger for you imagine when your wife who had spent three or four hours in the kitchen cooking for you preparing a meal hoping that it would attain your approval and satisfaction and your surprise it was so horrible that you could not eat except three or four bites of it imagine the impact when you say to your wife may Allah reward you for this beautiful meal this is one of the best meals I've ever tasted in my life she knows you're lying but she always she also knows that you love her and that you only say the good things imagine when someone does you a favor and you make dua for them I've done this millions of times whenever someone does me a favor or does anything to me instead of saying thank you I say may Allah forgive you may Allah make your parrot make your parents in paradise may allah azza wajal guide your children subhanAllah on the impact these few words have on that individual the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam always said what was good never ever so la la hora Salam he would harm or hurt people always he came on top so lala haria lives in his companions followed his footsteps the righteous scholars of Islam also did the same nowadays we are in great need not to criticize not to insult not to allow cursing words to come over of our mouths on the contrary we are in great need to say the good word that would win people's hearts and that would convince them that our religion is the true and final religion of Allah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
