  "title": "Can a woman correct the recitation of the imam during salah (Prayer)? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "ayesha says can a woman correct from behind if the Imam makes mistake in recitation of the Quran during Salah what if there are only women praying behind their Muharram Imam in this condition can one of them correct him the general rule is that the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam once was leading the congregational prayer and one of the Companions spoke out of ignorance he did not know that speaking is not allowed and he started saying things so the companions started clapping on their thighs after the prayer was over the Prophet corrected the situation taught the man who needed teaching and then addressed the companions that if anything happens in the salat you should say subhanAllah to draw attention for clapping is for women so if a woman during the salat notices that the imam did not sit for the first two sure hadn't stood up she claps to bring her his attention that you made a mistake why because she's not allowed to talk during salat now this differs when women or a woman pray with a group of moms or one maha so in this case if you are praying in the house with your moms your father your brothers and maybe your sons all of them are there your MA none of them is a nun Muharram if the a man makes a mistake there is no problem none whatsoever for a woman to speak out and correct the mistake of the a map and if he makes a mistake in movements she can say so not clap because the reason for not speaking is that nan Muharram may be affected by her voice how soft it is and Shaitaan could come and mess up with their minds during salat but Muharram brothers fathers uncles sons they all know her voice and they know her there is no problem in her to speak but if there is a single man with them who's a nun Muharram this is a no-go"
