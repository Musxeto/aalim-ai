  "transcript": "flare of mana for him and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu sallim wa barik alaa muhammad al al-amin nabina muhammad in Wadi hero sahbihi ajma'in I'm a bad dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh among the women whom had an impact on the life of our prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam we're two of the first women the Prophet actually had his first encounter with the first one is his mother and her name was Amina bint web been abdomen Afeni Zahra even Oh Caleb if Nomura em no carbonyl ooh I even ooh hard labor and they say that she had only one brother in his name was Yahoo that Nawab the tribe of Zara or Banu Zahra they say that we are the maternal uncles of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam because Amina was from them and we know that the prophets father are in his salat WA Salam his maternal uncle's were from Medina so the Prophet you used to say that my maternal uncles are from Medina now historical resources did not document a lot about the profits mother sallallahu alehiwassallaam due to the fact that it was not a time of documentation and no one knew at the time that she would be the mother of the greatest man ever to walk the earth all what we know about her is that she was a woman of high and prestigious lineage she was an a woman of honor and a great family and this is why most Arabs usually look after the Prophet said alehissalaam salaam a woman is sought after due to her beauty due to her wealth due to her lineage and due to her religious practice so get the one with the religious commitment or may your hand grab on dust meaning that if you choose other than the one with proper religious commitment then as if you have gained nothing therefore Amina was sought after we do not know anything about her private life how beautiful she was but we know that she comes from a very honourable family how did she get to marry of the law even though Abdul Muttalib the stories say that Abdul Mutallab had one son and this son was called al-harith but first of all who is Abdul Muttalib we know that our prophet's name is Sol allah allah muhammad even know Abdullah even Abdul Muttalib even knew Hashem so what is Abdul Muttalib and was there a God that the pagans worshiped by the name of al-muttalib actually al-muttalib is the name of his uncle and the father of of the laws name was Shay Batu Hampton hasha minal Muttalib we're brothers and Hashim married a woman in Medina and she gave birth to Abdullah she gave birth to Alma Talib let me rephrase that so Hashem the grandfather of Abdullah who is the father of Prophet Aslam got married in Medina and he had a son by the name of Shay battle hampt soon after Hashim died so his brother al-muttalib when Shay battle Hamed grew up to be a young man of fourteen years of age traveled from Mecca to Medina to fetch his nephew and bring him back to his country so when they traveled back to Mecca when al-muttalib and his nephew who's a fourteen year old boy by the name of Shay battle Hamed entered Mecca the people of Mecca recognised al-muttalib recognized those who were with him but did not recognize this boy so they thought that this boy was a slave which al-muttalib bought on his journey so they called him avid Elmo Talib and al-muttalib kept on saying no no this is shea butter hammond he's my nephew he's not my slave so the name stuck to him and his name became Abdul Muttalib the slave of al mualim so al-muttalib now grew up to become a very respected honorable man of Mecca he was one of the dignitaries of Mecca and the master of the people of Quraysh the master of Banu Hashim and Banu al-muttalib Abdul Muttalib had a son and he saw in a vision someone coming to him telling him about Piper about Birla about this about different names and then in conclusion told him to dig up them them now we all know the well of Zamzam and the story of Hodja and her son ismail peace be upon him when left long long time ago centuries ago in mecca with there was nothing in how gibreel came and dug the well of Zamzam which kept on giving water to the muslims ever since so he saw the location he got the command in his dream to dig it up so he went to dig it up and it's close to the Haram to the Kaaba so the people started shouting at him you're insane what are you doing and he told him that this is Zam Zam I was told to dig it up they didn't believe him and they ridiculed him so he dug it up once the water started gushing people started saying that we have a share in it he tried to defend it and say no this is mine I was the one who saw the dream and I want I'm the one who did it so I'm the one responsible for it they would not listen to him and he had only one son so he had no protection so he vowed that if Allah were to give him ten sons that he will slaughter one of them as a sacrifice soon after he got married he got children and now he has ten of them so he has to fulfill his vow so he drew the lots to know which one to choose from the ten and it fell on Abdullah the youngest and the most beloved to his heart so he did not know what to do the people advised him to sacrifice ten camels but first draw the Lots between ten camels and Abdullah and Lots came to Abdullah so they said add another ten so he added ten becoming twenty camels again Abdullah thirty fifty ninety one hundred and then the Lots fell on the camels so he sacrificed the one hundred camels joyfully and saved his son from being slaughtered some say that since then the blood money for someone who kills someone by mistake or intentionally is one hundred camels till date and this is in our Islamic Shariah being happy with his son being freed he went and chose to him one of the best of Quraysh women and that was a min a bit Wahab he was for 24 years of age and she was 13 years of age and this was normal for girls to marry at an early age as early as nine or ten he stayed with her for ten days then he left with a caravan to Syria for trade on their way back he fell sick stayed in Medina for a while only to die and to be buried there Amina was two months pregnant with our prophet Alice awesome she heard the news heartbroken she lived on the memory of these ten nights that she had spent with the love of her life the pregnancy was quite easy and not difficult once she gave birth to our Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu wassalam she as many of the women of Quraysh sent her newborn infant to be suckled at the badiya the Bedouins who lived on open land in tents so that their bodies would become strong immune to diseases and the tongue would be fluent in Arabic not corrupt due to the different languages and we will come to the story of how he was given to harima Adia the Prophet had a solid Salam as a child used to be brought every year so that they can take the wages of taking care of him and for him to see his mother and to see his grandfather maybe for a month or two and then go back with his family Halima and his father through suckling when he was 6 years of age the training if you may say was over and now he is back with his mother his mother took him to visit the maternal uncle's of his father they stayed there for a whole month and on their way back Amina fell sick and she died and she was buried at an area called el agua now the prophet alayhi salat Salam did not live long with his mother and you can say that he did not know her that well when she died at the age of 20 and he was about 6 to 7 years of age however we can guarantee and we are certain that she gave him love affection and care that remained with him fifty years later in Saahil imam muslim the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam once traveled and passed by the agua and his companions saw him weeping and they said o prophet of allah tell us what is happening so that we can weep and join you as well he said I requested my Lord to seek forgiveness for my mother and he denied me so I wept and we know that the Prophet Isis and was denied because the Muslims are not permitted to seek forgiveness for someone who died as a non-muslim and we as Muslims would pay anything we possess we would sacrifice our own parents and loved ones just for the mother of the Prophet Isis I am to be accepted as a Muslim but this is not something that we feel and hope for because it's the decree of allah azzawajal and no one can be more merciful than allah almighty and this is religion yes we would have loved that the prophet's mother would be admitted to Paradise and that what he would be granted the permission to seek forgiveness for her but it's not in our hands this is a large law this is the authentic hadith in Swahili I'm a Muslim then the Prophet said alehissalaam I sought permission from Allah to visit her grave and Allah gave me permission to do so you can tell by the amount of sorrow in the prophet's heart a less awesome that made him weep and cry over a mother he had not seen or been with except for a few months yet the amount of love she gave her son still resonated with him even after five or six decades down the line this is how men feel about their mothers how strong emotions they have towards their mothers and this is how Islam honoured the mothers now the other woman is had EEMA and it's an issue of dispute whether she accepted Islam later on or not and insha'Allah she is a Muslim and among the Companions Halima bint ABI - Abe and her father abode Abe's name is Abdullah hymnal Harris she tells us about how she got the profit are in salat wa salam and was honored to be his mother through suckling she said we came to Mecca as we do every year pitching for a newborn that needed to be suckled and raised in the outskirts where the grazing land is where all the herds are this is the habit of the people of Mecca so we all went I she talks about herself had a son and he never let us sleep because I could not give him any milk because we were in drought and famine we went to Mecca on my mule and we had a camel which had no milk in her to feed us at all when we came to Mecca we came late because of how tired the mule and the camel were so everybody went ahead of us and every woman from my tribe that they showed her the Prophet Muhammad they asked where is his father when they were told that he was an orphan they rejected him what would we do with an orphan when we want money from his father and his father is not alive when she arrived late there was no other child to take so she took the Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu wassalam so that no one would say that she came back empty-handed that night the moment she received the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam her breasts were filled with milk the Prophet drank and had his full his brother drank and had his full and went to sleep the first night day had slept in months not only that even the camel the she-camel her husband went and milked it and they all had their meal to the full and he told his wife this boy is a blessed soul take good care of him he went and he was raised there in the open ground in the grazing grounds playing with the children nothing so special but things that made people suspicious once Halima went to look for her son Mohammed and he was not around and it was so hot that the herds and the camels were on the ground resting after some distance she found him with his sister and she said to his elder sister what are you doing in the middle of the day under the hot Sun she said mother I didn't do anything he kept on walking and there was this cloud on top of him whatever he stood it stood and wherever he moved it moved shading him and then she tells us about the miraculous surgery that the Prophet had on the hands of jbeil and is fulfilled peace be upon them just where he was five or so years of age two men came and they made him lie on his back opening his chest to his bellybutton and extracting his guts and washing it in a ball of gold with Zamzam water then extracting his heart and taking something black out of it then replacing everything back and stitching it all as it was Halima and her husband were terrified when they came to the rescue and found the boy they're a little bit pale and they asked him he told them what had happened so they took him back to his mother and his mother told them that this is nothing I know my son will grow to be something else because I saw in my vision this and that and she comforted them they took him back and then when the period or the training was over they brought him back to his mother only to lose his mother when he was again 6 years of age to be taken care of by his untie his grandfather Abdul Muttalib until he was 8 years of age then to die his grant his grandfather's death was also one of the tragedies that the prophetess Alam had undergone only to be taken care of by his uncle Abu Talib and we all know what happened afterwards two great women who took care of our prophet alayhi salatu was-salam who had a print on his life an impact on his upbringing to women around the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam had Allahu Alem when especially Mila he Aslam sallallahu sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad wa salam alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato Asuna my econ 102 law here what occurred to didn't gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader the prophets of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam taught them what to say when stricken with a calamity Allah says what means and we will surely test you with something of fear and hunger and a loss of wealth and lives and fruits but give good tidings to the patient who when disaster strikes them say indeed we belong to Allah and indeed to him we will return those are the ones upon whom are blessings from their Lord and mercy and it is those who are the rightly guided on cinema may Allah be pleased with her said I heard the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam say there is not a Muslim that is afflicted with a calamity who says what Allah ordered him what Allah ordered them to say in earlier he were in alayhi roger hoon Allah whom journey if even he Betty was lovely higher on min ha to Allah we belong and on to him we shall return o Allah grant me reward in my calamity and give me something better in return except that Allah will give him something better in return umm Salama may allah be pleased with her continued when abu cinema died i said which muslim is better than abu Salama the first household to migrate to the messenger of allah then i said that supplication and allah almighty gave me the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam in return reported by Muslim assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh a sister says is the reward for women praying taraweeh at home more than men or women who go and pray in the masjid behind any man the reward of praying the whole night because of the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam who said that the prayer of a woman is better than or better at her home better than even praying in my Masjid now this issue seems to cause a lot of confusion among among women first of all we have a reward that was given to whomever praise in the Masjid behind the imam until he is over during taraweeh of Ramadan the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam in a woman are my enemy hot day on Soloff he who stands in prayer with the imam until he concludes meaning praying with her and giving Salam until he concludes his prayer then Allah would grant him as if he prayed the whole night so now we lazy men think of it in terms of calculation one plus one equals two if I prayed behind the imam for 30 or 40 minutes 11 records of taraweeh then Allah would reward me as if I prayed from Risha till fajar that's one heck of an investment so we usually opt for it now this is for men and women however women are caught between a rock and a hard place so the sister comes to me and says share I want I want reward if I go to the Masjid I'll be rewarded as if I prayed the full night but my confusion is that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said that a woman's prayer in her home is better than her prayer in my Masjid which we know that one prayer in the message of wrapped off of the Prophet as Sam it is equivalent or is better than 1000 prayers prayers elsewhere so now come on how to do the math first of all do you believe that your prayer in your home is better than the prayer in the message of the Prophet Isis I am she says yes so I said to her okay then what do you want she said sure if I pray home I have to pray at least three or four hours to compensate for the full night which I missed in the Masjid and I say okay why don't you pray in the masjid she said because the Prophet said is better to pray home well this is something in Allah's hands what I feel and I know is that if you pray in the masjid this is totally permissible and legit it was the Prophet himself area so Sam who said do not prevent women from attending salat in the Masjid he is the one who said that not only that his own wives used to pray in the masjid whether it was soda whether it was a shisha whether it was Zeynep they all used to pray in the message with the Prophet I so Sam and the Prophet had never told them don't pray in the masjid pray at your homes he's just told him what is best pray at homes if you don't want to it's okay so what do you say she I say that if a woman is so eager for having this reward and at the same time she complains that she doesn't have enough time during the night she has to care for her family for her husband she has to do the shores she has to cook she has to work if she is working in Dawa etc and all of this consumes a lot of her time and if she wanted to pray three or four hours just to get great rewards from allah azza wajal the night is not enough while praying one hour in the message it would compensate for all of that I would say it's up to her let her go to the Masjid but if a woman does not have anything to do and she's staying home without any obligations or commitment in this case I would say to her pray home and the longer you do that the greater of reward Allah who will grant you as long as you anticipate the reward of not praying in the message with the congregational Ahaziah knows best Adi says is it from the Sunnah to ask for forgiveness from everyone before the holy month of Ramadan commences this is a common misconception so before Ramadan begins everybody texts me if I had done anything wrong please forgive me and let there be no grudge or hatred towards me in your heart may Allah accept Ramadan from us all they also do this before they go for Ambra or hajj they keep on calling people ask them for forgiveness and all of this is not from the sooner this is an innovation to think that this is connected to ramadan or to ombres or hajj this is an innovation yes you've done something wrong to someone ask them for forgiveness but not to connect it with Ramadan or to Umrah and Hajj Momina says is it permissible to take a shower on the first day of Ramadan because in my country many people do this as it's as if it's part of welcoming Ramadan taking a shower every day or twice a day it's good it's refreshing it's keeping your body clean and fresh it prevents your odor from harming others if you have one but connecting it to the first night of Ramadan and thinking that it's part of the rituals of Ramadan this makes it an innovation because this was not done by the Prophet Aslam not recommended yes if you take a shower every single day whether it is Ramadan or not there is no problem in that but thinking that I have to offer a rustle for Ramadan this is prohibited and an innovation Muhammad says what is the difference between giving sujood to sell before Salam and after Salam can you please explain in detail first of all this is the first time someone says this is the first time I know that you can offer to do the cell after Salam this is new for me well every day we learn something new the hadith that governs through the sea who are many Abdullah of Nobu Hina may Allah be pleased with him Abu sir Adel hoodie Abu Hurairah of the lovin masud may allah be pleased with them all they all narrated this and different scenarios and in a nutshell because we can't go into details first of all you have to understand that you Judas ah who is offered when you make a mistake in a pillar or a mandatory act in salat this means that any voluntary act you make a mistake or you leave it intentionally or you add it intentionally does not impact your salat to the extent that you have to offer to do the self so someone does not raise his hand so in the beginning I start my salat by saying Allah a kebab I didn't raise my hands my prayer is valid because raising the hands is a Sunnah but if I did not say Allahu Akbar this is a pillar my prayer is not conducted yet I haven't started yet I can't start the prayer without seeing Allah ho Akbar so it has to be a mistake in a pillar or in a mandatory act which means that you have to learn what are the pillars of salat and what are the mandatory acts of salat to know how to do how to act and how to behave secondly scholars say that there are two locations where we pray or offer to cross ranges of forgetfulness before Salam and another two locations or incidence or reasons for offering it after Salam so the first one is when you drop a mandatory act will you forget a mandatory act so let's assume that I am praying Lahore for rakahs in the second raka I do not sit for tisha hood I stand up for the third raka and after I'm fully standing someone says subhana Allah Subhan Allah bringing my attention that I have not sit for the third Rock for the first shot what to do I have to continue my prayer I skipped the first a shout yes but this is mandatory and I skipped it out of forgetfulness continue my prayer as normal after the salutation before concluding my prayer I offer Allahu Akbar - Sudha Hussein - Hannah rubella as normal and then Salam aleykum Selam aleykum la la that's it assuming that I'm a trucker and instead of saying subhanAllah be ravine I made a mistake and I started saying subhan allah by allah subhana Allah subhana Allah send me a law human Hamidah and then it came to my mind that what did I do I missed saying Shahada be loving I have to offer to Judah who before Salam because I've dropped something that is mandatory now if I added something to the salat so for example I stood for the fifth fraca and then realize that this is this is the fifth I immediately sit down I cannot complete anything now I have to sit down because this is a void raka if I added a third says de then I remember that this is the third I stand up immediately or sit down depending on my position but I had already added something what should I do continue my prayer as usual after the salutation is over and the door I say Salam aleikum assalam aleikum o Allah Akbar I offer to prostrations after the Salam so these are two locations one before one after capisci Shalom understood now we come to the third case or the third situation and this is when I am confused I'm in the middle of the prayer and I'm totally unaware of whether this is the third raka or the fourth raka so my confusion is in the fourth raka my confusion is did I prostrate one prostration or this is my second prostration so whenever there is a confusion and I'm I'm totally lost I'm not aware I don't know is it my second raka is it my third raka he's it my fourth raka I'm not aware there is doubt the the Prophet said allahís alot was salam when some of you praised and he's doubtful whether he prayed three or four he should based his assumption on what is confirmed so now I'm doubtful whether I prayed three or four where is the doubt definitely it's in four because three I am certain that I prayed them my doubt is in the fourth so the Prophet says base your assumption on what is confirmed so I neglect that I have prayed for and I consider myself have prayed three and continue accordingly and just before Salam I offer to salute of Sahu then offers enough so when there is no balance no determination whether this or that it's totally equal in this case I base my assumption on the least number I'm Institute is this my first or my second sujood well I don't know then I would assume that this is my first session because this is the confirmed and I get and do the second session and also perform show you the cell before the Salam this is case number three case number four is the same when I'm confused whether I prayed three records or four occurs whether this was my first sujood or second stitute but the difference is that I am inclined to one of the two I'm not totally blinded by confusion not knowing three or four know I'm inclined that yeah yeah this is most likely the third because in the third raka I usually recite could who Allahu Ahad after Fatiha and I just remembered that I did that or I would say no most likely this is the fourth because I did this or I did that or I heard a sound or I had an area so you have a reason to be inclined to one of either you added or deleted or omitted either this or that you have a reason to be inclined to either one in this case after Salaam you offer to sujood of so to recap before Salaam you offer to do the sound in two cases one either you omitted something from your mandatory acts to compensate that you offer to salute before Salaam or you are confused whether you did this or that and you cannot be inclined to any of them you base your assumption on the list the number that is the least and continuous a lot and offer to you the cell before Salaam you perform it after Salaam when you have added something that is not part of the Salah a third to shout a fifth raka something mandatory in other than its place then you offer to sujood after Salam or and this is the fourth when you are confused but you're inclined to whether you added or omitted something from the salat you act upon that and you offer your salute after the Salam when we say after the Salam do we offer also another tesha hood the answer is no you simply offer Salam then immediately to prostrations saying Subhan Allah Allah Allah Allahu Akbar assalamualaikum assalamualaikum warahmatullah so I hope this answers your question Munir says the crescent moon and the star which some people considered to be the Islamic symbol does it actually have any basis in Islam the short answer is no it has no trace or relationship or roots in Islam some people came up with it to match the David the start of David to match the cross which the Christians have and the Muslims at that era said we don't have anything to show as a symbol so they came up with the Crescent and they came up with the star and this has nothing to do with Islam so relating it to Islam considered it to be part of Islam hanging it on man roots or hanging it on flags this has nothing to do with Islam Shamim says if quarantine period lasts the whole of Ramadan what will be or what will we do with our Eid prayer is it obligatory on everyone during this time and can we pray at home and how must we pray it with a jota or without giving a hot ba first of all the issue of praying read prayer alone or when missed in the masala is an issue of dispute the majority of scholars the school of Maliki the school of Shafi the school of Adam Campbell they say that you can pray it if you missed it so those home can pray it without the Hopa with seven takbir in the first five degree area in the second raka the normal Rekha and this is the opinion of the majority of schools of thought however the school of thought of Imam Abu Hanifa they say that this is not permissible this salat was made to be prayed in Congress in an open area in an open plaza and not even in the Masjid let alone in the homes so it is not permissible to be prayed at homes if you missed it with the congregation with the Muslims do not pray it as it's not permissible and this opinion was adopted by Sheikh al-islam even Tamiya and also a sheikh from hammer the Mossad has a mean may Allah have mercy on their souls all of them and I'm inclined to this opinion that it is not permissible to be prayed individually at homes and insha Allah we pray and hope that Allah by then would have uplifted this calamity in this crisis from all the world Sonja says how do I deal with my husband who doesn't want me to wear hijab be diplomatic be respectful but hold your grounds and remain steadfast hijab is not a personal choice it is an obligation from Allah that was mentioned in the Quran and in the prophets Sunnah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam no one has the right to oppose it and there is no obedience to anyone and disobeying Allah the Almighty ELISA says is it authentic to recite surah the stage that before sleeping and what is its reward we do not know what the reward is but we certainly know that the Prophet is awesome used to recite Surat East Asia as well as surat al-mulk before he went to sleep Aisha says I accidentally dropped the core and what is the hidayah or the Hadiya i have to give now so Asia most likely is asking about the expiation for a person who had dropped the most half the or an so a person is holding the whole island reading it then he drops it is there any expiration for that answer is no it's a mistake and so many people have seen them they hold the Koran they they kiss it and some people go to an extra mile when they offer sujood and they call it the - edge just so they kiss it and they prostrate on it what is this said no this is a sign of respect no this is a clear innovation no one had ever said that prostrating on the Koran is a sign of respect so if you drop the Koran there is nothing for you to do except to be more careful Abdul Hameed says there are 30 different books that contains 30 Jews of the Koran so there's Zuzu I'm juju tabarak etc these books do not contain anything except the verses of the Koran must must we treat and respect these books as Quran of course you have to it's not a choice you must respect these chapters because this is part of the Quran the second question is do we have to be in wouldl the answer is most likely yes just to be safe rather than sorry though they it is not the full Quran but it still is considered part of it Sohail says what is the ruling on short selling in stock market is it permissible this is a long issue first of all the stocks that you buy must be halal stocks and they must not finance their projects in RIBA like most of the companies now wherever they have a project they finance it through banks through RIBA and this is prohibited for you to buy because you are a partner then when you give get a share you become a partner and they're dealing with River and you're dealing with River secondly short-selling is actually not buying you it this is gambling you do not buy the stocks with your own money then I would have no problem because if you buy it it's yours if the prices went down you're not forced to sell it if the prices go up you're not forced to sell it but most people would sell it short selling is borrowing someone's else stocks and hoping to sell it at the end of the day and make a profit hoping that the prices would go down so you would be making profit or goes up but you will be in deep trouble if you buy the stocks and five or ten minutes later the price goes eight hundred percent or seven hundred percent how are you going to repay this this is clear gambling and it's totally prohibited and not allowed I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for tonight's episode until we meet tomorrow night same time I leave you fear Manila what Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
