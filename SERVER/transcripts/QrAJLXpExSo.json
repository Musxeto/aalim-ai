  "transcript": "Abbas from Nigeria he says that if I learn if I listen to the Quran from a recorded um tape or a CD or from the internet and I learn from it is it the same reward as learning from a scholar who is one toone teaching me the answer is no the reward while listening and reciting to a scholar is far greater because because when you listen to the Quran being recited and you mimic that with the reciter or you imitate him it's a one-way road so you are simply imitating without knowing if you are pronouncing the letters correctly or not if you're doing the Taj correctly or not you need a third party you need someone sitting with you listening to your recitation in order for him to be able to correct you if this is not possible and you don't have one available to do this then yes recite uh reading listening to the recorded Quran and learning from it would be your only option and it would be the best option available but if there is someone and I believe that nowadays there are so many websites online and so many volunteers worldwide who know the Quran can be with you online and give you onetoone coaching in how to uh fix your recitation and Allah Asel Knows Best"
