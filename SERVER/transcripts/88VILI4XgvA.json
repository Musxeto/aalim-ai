  "title": "Do we follow Salafi masjid or Hanafi masjid maghrib adhan to break the fast? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so at the time of Maghrib other than we do if they are and right after two minutes we have another Adan which according to hanafi's is the right time of Guru so it becomes a conflict as hanafi says that salafis are saying Azan before Guru and salafi says that hanafis are saying Azan late after Guru so which one should we follow just you should follow the first adhan you hear whether it's a hanafi or a salafi or whatever as long as they're Muslims the a van is an indication that the sun has set why would I believe hanafies and not the salafis and why would I believe the self is not the hanafis Allah told me to break my fast the moment the Adan is called which is an indication that the sun has set so this then gives the Adan I trust him and I break my fast I don't have to go to the top of my building and detect whether the sun has set or not the Adan is sufficient and don't listen to these feuds between these ignorant people it is not going to pay off and they just keep on yeah um trying to gain territory and to have authority over people leave it and let it be and just enjoy your dates and water"
