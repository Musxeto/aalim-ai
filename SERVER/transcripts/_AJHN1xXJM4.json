  "title": "Can I take back computer accessories I gifted my brother if I know he uses for haram Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Ian from Belgium yes so my question sir is my brother he plays a lot of video games he plays and the video games are most likely Haram because they have music and they they are the cause of him playing all day and not uh praying Etc so my question is in the past I've given him I've given him a com a computer computer parts of giving him a mouse I've given him a mouse mat so we can play the video games so my question is can I take them back because he is doing Haram with them even though I promised him and I gave them to him as a gift and in the future am I allowed to to give him extra things so he can play the video games on his computer like a headset or a microphone cannot buy it for him even though I know he will most likely use them for Haram and first of all the computer is a knife with two edges so you can use a knife to cut meat and bread and you can use it to injure and harm people so the knife as a knife is a Halal tool how you use it this is what makes it Halal or Haram likewise a mouse or a mouse pad usually people use computers for a number of Halal things as well as Haram so if you gave him these items with the intention to assist him to doing Haram then this is sinful on you now the issue is can I go back in my gift I am inclined to say no because even if you go back on it he will probably buy it and it's trivial it's nothing and why I say it's not Halal because there is a an authentic Hadith where the Prophet said we do not have the worst of examples or the bad examples a person who goes back in his gift is like a dog that vomits then eats back its vomit is giving us the example of a person who goes back in his gift of a dog that vomits and eats back its vomit which is repelling and and disgusting and this is why the prophet used this example as a salaam to stop you from even attempting to do something like this in the future of course you're not permitted to assist him on such Haram things by any means and Allah Knows Best"
