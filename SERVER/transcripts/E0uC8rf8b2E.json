  "transcript": "should I marry Kumar a lot I think you said I went to LA hey I'm allergic Hayden fried shallots and I reckon they're good to have you but a colleague named already ready when you are hey I'm the real enemy was in limine nabina muhammad in water he was a big woman daddy he was the nation that he led me back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and we resume with the grace of allah azza wajal studying this great book salah satu a soul for imam muhammad abdul wahab and we begin i think we spoke about the first assal the first fundamental the first principle which was to know allah azza wajal so you have to first of all in order to get things right you have to understand you have to know you have to acknowledge who Allah is Azza WA JAL and what is Subhanahu WA Ta'ala in our lives in our religion and that he is the creator the owner the provider the sustainer the giver of life and death no one can live or inhale and exhale without his permission not a single drop of blood that runs in your veins without his knowledge and permission nothing happens in this universe without his permission so we have to submit our wills to allah azza wajal and to worship Him we went over that hand Allah and now we will go to the second principle or the second fundamental principle sfe know knowing the religion of Islam based on evidence this is Islam which means submitting to allah by the way of tawheed seventy one's full obedience to him and absolve in one sir from shirk and its people these can be divided into three levels okay this is the second fundamental principle which without your islam would not be valid so it has to be known to everyone that the only way to reach paradise the only way to be accepted as a Muslim is to know to acknowledge the religion of Islam and it's not something that you get a feeling or a gut feeling it's not it's not something that is intuition or something that you get inspired by it is something that you must learn through evidences through proof and this is what defines and separates Islam from other religions you will find many priests monks people of worship claiming that Allah spoke to to them and Allah told them to do so and so many evangelists even the American president said that Allah came to him in a dream and told him to invade their locker to do this to do that now this is something which is between them and Allah so judge whether it was a blatant lie or whether it is the Shaitaan coming to them and confusing them all of this is possible as Muslims we have our faith based on evidence and proof from the Quran and from the Sunnah according to the understanding of the three favorite regions and this is why you find a Muslims conviction so solid and so strong that yo you won't find anything similar to it in other religions so the sources of our religion are available to anyone to see we don't have any secrets we don't have any libraries that are under the ground or in the basements only few of us can look and learn from it and this is why we don't have any monks or priests or men of religion as they call them and they conceal knowledge from the public everything is an open book even non-muslims can read and learn about it so these evidences are the things that separate us from other religions so what do we mean by knowing and acknowledging the knowledge of the religion what is that first of all you have to submit your will to allah azza wajal by acknowledging his oneness and that he's the creator is the owner is a provider he's a sustainer he's the giver of life and taking of it and that no one is worthy of being worshipped other than him so first of all you have to submit your will to Allah Allah through the heat and we've gone through to head many times and maybe we'll talk about it later on again and if we were to submit our will to allah azza wajal this means that we have to follow obey what Allah orders us to do and stay away from what Allah prohibits us from doing and this is known as obedience to follow without any questions asked so if you believe in the oneness of Allah but you refuse to obey Him to abide by his commands then you have a serious problem and thirdly we have to disavow ourselves from and one may find this a bit difficult nowadays especially when we live in this global village so yes I believe in Allah and unfortunately we see some code and code daddies in the US and Europe elsewhere who have been blended in who have been put in a melting pot so they don't have any big distinction between Islam and other religions we're all okay few days back I heard one of the so-called scholars claiming that the Shia and the Muslims the Sunnis are all reverence in Islam and this is a blatant lie yes when we talk about Shia who are laymen who do not commit kufur or shirk indeed they are our brothers in Islam but they are very rare and you would find them in rural areas not knowing anything about true sheer ISM but when you go to people who say that they she and they slander mother Aisha they say she committed adultery and she is not the mother of the believers and she is a kafir and they say that Abu Bakr Umar Uthman and Ali are all kafir they curse them and they curse the majority of the companions and they call the dead so they say yeah I Lee save us from the trouble yeah Hussein bring us food and provisions and uplift the coronavirus and you doubt that these are kafir no scholar of Islam not even a layman or a student of knowledge would say such rubbish and trash but unfortunately there are people who have been dedicated to such lies than treason and as Muslims we have to draw the line we have to say that we believe in Allah and we disbelieve in everything else and this does not mean I disrespect you this does not mean I kill you or heart her harm you or try to hurt you how to be loved but it means that I have to stand up to my beliefs and make a clear distinction between mine and yours this was clearly mentioned in the Quran which a lot of the Muslims don't abide by Allah says immediately after ayatul kursi in suratul baqarah immediately allah says family yuck for the wood were you mean billah the distance AgrAbility loofah lymph Islam Allah whosoever disbelieves in pahud and the definition of the hood anything or anyone who's worshipped besides allah azza wajal this is the hood willingly so this the stones the eye those the the false priests and gods here on earth who either ask people to worship them or people worship them without their consent these are taught from a yak for Bearpaw hoot whoever shall disbelieve in power William in Villa and believes in Allah two conditions to disbelieve and to believe de-stem sacoby Lord what Hill was why he has held strongly to the strong knot of the heat until heat by itself is based on negation and a firm affirmation if the if the noun is correct so negation is la Allah there is no God you have to announce that there is no God worthy of being worshipped then you affirm by saying Allah except Allah Almighty so to disbelief to disavow in shirk and whatever is associated with allah azza wajal is based on the Quran Allah says there has already been for you an excellent pattern in Ibrahim and those with him when they said to their people now these are the believers let's listen to what they say to their people and compare us muslims to them they said to their people indeed we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah we have denied you and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone so this is part of the religion that all Muslims must knowledge it's not enough for you to come become a Muslim and then look at the other side of the world and say yeah well if they want to worship idols this is up to that I'm okay with that no you shouldn't be okay with that so should I go and blow them up of course not nobody's saying that it's all a your heart you have to resent refuse reject such blasphemy such such co4 it's the same thing when you are a a straight man meaning a normal person and you know someone who is not straight and not normal and you say hey this is his personal preference I'm okay to sit with him eat with him talk with him hang out with him or her or it because this is their sexual preference and orientation no I woulda be left Muslims are clear we have a guideline that we must follow now if you choose something else this is your problem is not mine but you cannot expect me to accept it endorse it and bring it in so they say LGBT QRF dwx what is he I don't know how many letters they're gonna add to it LGBTQ then I think this is the latest and that this is a community that this is okay this is your problem it's your country it's allowed in your country you may do whatever you wish you will be held accountable in the day of judgment as Muslims we do not endorse this you can't tell me to accept them in Arma in my life and to take them as friends and to have a normal relationship with them when I know that Allah is angry with them as it is not acceptable for me to befriend someone who's a known rapist and I say well this is his preference he wants to rape people it's okay or a murderer or a terrorist this is his ethical and religious conviction and preference I don't approve of it but if he kills people well this is his problem as long as it doesn't kill me so I'm okay with that no it's not okay you have to draw the line in Islam and this is part of knowing your religion now the goes on to mention the three levels of the Deen and these three levels are known through the hadith of Omaha pop and they are Islam eman and xn so so you know the hadith of Romar when the companions were sitting with the Prophet al-assad Salaam and all of a sudden a man comes in and this man as being described by Omar he has white clothes dark black hair no traces of traveling appears upon him and none of us know him now how can that be there isn't any hotels in Medina so if we don't know the person he must be from outside of Medina but his clothes are clean not dusted his hair is black and clean not dusted and there are no traces of travel on him so where did this guy come from so he came close to Prophet Isis Salam he sat in front of him his knees touching his knees he put his hands on his thighs and he said Mohammed tell me about Islam so the Prophet told him the five pillars tell me about Eman so the Prophet told him about the six pillars tell me about your son so the Prophet told him about worshipping Allah as if you can see him if you cannot see him then acknowledge that he can see you then he asked him about the science of the day of judgment and every time he asks him he says that's true you said the truth and the Companions were shocked this is that's weird he asks a question and then he approves it which means that he knew the answer so what is this so when the man left the Prophet asked them do you know who this was so they said Allahu Allah Allahu Allah Allah and his messengers know best so the Prophet said us and that was Gabriel the Archangel and he came to teach you your religion this great hadith is among the pillars of Islam among the few numbered hadith that Islam revolves around so it sets what Islam is so we will begin but I don't think we will take much time because most of you know these things and we can literally spend lectures on each phrase of them but this defies having a concise book on our tidak and then take like few years to talk about it so we begin insha'Allah by the pillars of Islam and the pillars of Islam are five the testimony that there isn't any died he was the worship that has the right to be wash myself Allah Muhammad let's wait well okay go go ahead for the full thing go ahead for the fourth all right and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah second is establishing the prayer third given the zakah fourth fasting in Ramadan five performing Hajj to Allah Sacred House the proof for the first money of Allah of faith in Allah is the same in certain al-e-imran Allah bears witness that there isn't anybody that has the right to be worshipped except him and so do the angels and those who possess knowledge he is always maintaining his creation with justice none has the right to be worshipped but him okay so this ayah is one of the greatest ayats because Allah Azza WA JAL is testifying himself that there is no God excuse Michelle what do you mean by there is no God there are thousands of gods what does Islam mean when it says there is no God there is booth there is a Krishna there is Ram there are idols there are capitalism there are so many gods so how do you say and claim that there is no God if you had allowed me to continue I would have explained it but this is a problem people must understand what you say and jump to the gun and you've seen on Twitter how often this happens you say something and people who's so ignorant they don't know how to wash themselves after defecating or urinating according to Islam so that they would not sue me they don't have knowledge and they say oh this is this this is that I can wait if you can't wait post a question politely what do you mean shake that there's no God well all scholars say according to the Quran that there are hundreds and thousands of gods Allah mentioned in the Quran that there are other gods but when Allah says la ilaha illa ma this means that there is no God worthy of being worshipped other than Allah so the gods are many show me one who's worthy of being worshipped then the result is zero so the first declaration is chained allahu and no la ilaha illa well mother occurred to me how a man built illa illa illa Allah testifies that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except him and then allah azza seconds with the angels to testify with him and then he made a third category to testify and those are the people of knowledge subhanAllah allah azza wajal combines the angels and the scholars alongside himself in testifying that there is no god but worthy of being worshipped but Allah the Almighty and this is the testimony without testifying this you won't go to paradise you will abide in hell forever this is in our genes this is mixed with our flesh and blood this oath was taken long before Allah created us physically it was taken from the offsprings of Adam and Allah tests made them testify that there is no God worthy of being worshipped but Allah and this is why scholars say in the hadith mam in melodeon illa wa you will adorn alpha for there is no new board that is given birth to accept he is given birth according to the FIFRA to the nature what nature Allah mentioned in the Quran o Allah he let Eva perón s idea the nature that Allah has created and made people upon it what is that to worship him alone so they say if you were to be born and left alone on an island no human intervention no environment attachment on your own with food and water to drink from that person would grow up acknowledging that there is only one God to be worshipped he doesn't speak Arabic he doesn't speak Spanish he doesn't speak Mandarin he doesn't speak any language but he knows inside from his observation being left alone that there's only one God to be worshipped how we don't know he doesn't pray he doesn't fast he doesn't pay zakat definitely but inside the Fatah the nature this is what every single human being including the atheists who deny Allah's existence they have it deep down inside in their hearts Allah says in the Quran Waja hadoo be ha they have falsified it and rejected it what's they cannot have and foster home Bulman World War yet their souls from inside acknowledge acknowledge is it and confesses of it but out of their arrogance and feeling superior they claim to reject it so this is la ilaha illa we can go on forever because this is the essence of our religion so what we have through knowledge and reading books we can speak for hours what we have as part of our own personal experience we can speak for days and months all what we need is to acknowledge Allah soldier and to know how to worship Him so that he's pleased with us so this is the first pillar ok the evidence for the testimony we've gone through it the meaning of this and the meaning of this that is the testimony of faith in the ISM no there is no end that has the right to be worshipped except Allah and lo in la ilaha illa ha negates everything that is worshipped beside Allah while Allah Allah affirms the worship of only Allah free from any partner being mixed in with with washing so so this is this is what we said earlier I will not go through that again that there is a litigation la ilaha if you say this and stop you recover and this is why it has to be said together la era ha in the lot of course if you say it in half you're not a kafir but it's strong and unfortunate when you go to Harlem may allah azza wa jal open it back again and restore our ability to go for Amla and for visiting the holy message it with legal for Umrah we hear the people whether from Nigeria from Indonesia from Egypt from different parts of the Muslim world they do this bid ah of course their intention is to do good they come in clusters so they come in a group of 200 or 300 people they don't know arabic they think that they must say special things around the Tawaf and run the sorry so you find them marching hand in hand especially our brothers from nigeria mon mothma they're like six four mountains in coming in waves and they're coming protecting their women and everybody is intimidated in the harem which is wrong this harem is safe for whomever is in it when you scare people because of your built you have a problem you're a man has a problem not only that they think that each round of the Kaaba I have to say a specific page in the booklet that somebody gave it to me so round one that I finished before I finished it I don't know I have to run faster second page round two and if you skip a page by mistake and you instead of reading round 2 you write the Round four Oh what should I do now I have to ask the share maybe I'll add two three rounds all of this is bitter it's not from Islam what am I supposed to say share nothing and talk ask Allah for anything you want in your own language you don't know Arabic yes ask Allah dhul Jalal Allah guide my wife oh Allah guide my children oh Allah make my cows more so I can get another wife oh Allah grant me this grant me help Allah do this for me do that for me so you ask Allah or native language but when you - the hajjali a mani and hazard us with the corner between the stone the M&E stone and the black stone you say a banana Jennifer Doudna Hassan Hassan okay neither one are repeated until you reach the black stone sky's the limit the people now there they go behind one imam usually they give him money and they call him el Moussa winner orang oh whiff he's the one who's supposed to tell you what to do so he was just black uh uh ah daya or whatever for men and he says allahumma everybody a moon in a 4-1 to help all of WA and they repeat shouting loudly whoa okay this is Allah's house who are you shouting for yes if you're in my house you say sharehouse them can you bring me some water I said what I can't hear you but when you are dealing with Allah I used to be allah azza wajal here's the footsteps of an ant over a stone in the darkness of the night allah azza wajal is not mixed up with the billions of sounds calling him asking him whether from the humans or the birds of the Institute or the the fish or the animals and he responds to each and every one I do shouting in Harlem yeah hey what kind of knowledge do you have and then the problem I apologize for taking my time I'm wasting time I don't know what I'm doing here I should stick to the book but so many things come into mine that the motor with that the leader says what and he says nah aha and everybody says nah Aloha whoa what are you doing la means there's no God in the heart of Tahiti land you see Allah Allah he see it as a well worth the ilaha illaallah yes now this is a testimony so it is a negation but has to be connected with a affirmation confirmation that except Allah is the origin and this is why the exception has to be connected otherwise it is invalid even in transactions so if I say to you I sell you my farm for $1000 and I pause for 3-4 minutes then I say except the North corner this exception is not valid because it was there was a disconnect so you have to have them both together so the confirmation the negation everything is crystal clear isa al-ma we move on to the second no we move on - yeah to the following paragraph that following proof then this is an explanation of this which will clarify it further is found in Allah saying so to love Allah SWA no sense said I remember when Ibrahim said to his father and his people verily I am free from all that you worship except for he who created me and there is no you have to you have to you have to express announce your being free from anything other than Allah it's not enough to say yes I'm a Muslim no you have to declare that I'm a Muslim and I disbelieve in anything other than Allah and then Islam so you just believe in my religion no I just believe in your religion so now I don't have to be aggressive I don't have to come in people's faces and shove it down the throats but at the same time I must not dilute my religion and belief into making people think that yeah yeah yeah I can accept you worshipping idols and committing sins openly blah blah know this is my religion your conviction is yours as long as it does not come across me and what I do it's up to you I don't believe in it I'm a disbeliever in what you believe and what you practice but it's it's your religion you have you can do whatever you want in your own terms not on mine Allah knows best yes nam and verily he will guide me and he made it a settlement that will endure among his offspring that they may turn back to so this al Qaeda of tow heat was cascaded down the offspring of ibraheem he announced it to his people and he delegated it to his children and we know that his children are ismael it's HAP and after his happy are coupe and the the Jews and they delegated it one to the other so that if they were ever to fall in shock they will find some grounds to return to and find their compass yes he nam Allah saying this is the second third area I say o people of the scripture Jews and the Christians composer who's who's addressed by say mama son Lawson ok so the Prophet Isis Aram is ordered by Allah to say to the Jews and the Christians what to say to them come to a word that is just between us and you that we worship none but Allah alone and that we associate no partners with him and that none of us shall take others as lower Allah then if they turn away say bear witness that we are Muslims what more justice do you want Oh people of the book Jews and Christians all what we are asking you to do is to come into terms into a platform that is shared by all of us what is that that we should not worship other at la and that we do not associate others with him in that we do not take one another as Lords beside Allah is there any problem with that no but will they accept it no why because it interferes with their dominance they dominate their people even here all the Byzantine ruler who sent to the Arabs in order to tell him about Mohammed whose helmet the Arabs are no one there insects to us Persians and Byzantines they are considered to be nothing now who's he sending me a letter saying that come to Islam and worship Allah and I shall give you the reward of all those who follow you but if you don't then prepare yourself for Hellfire who is this sending me this letter so he gathered the Arabs at the time in Syria and among them was Abu Sufyan of Muharram the head of Quraysh idol worshippers and he made him stand in front of him and he placed all of his companions behind him and he said to his companions if he were to say a single lie wave for me so he started asking him questions and this is Hari by the way it's very authentic and Abu Sufian said by Allah had I not feared that people would circulate among them that I have lied I would not have said the truth but I couldn't do anything but say the truth so he asked him about him what's his lineage who follows him who rejects his religion whose winning is he this is he that and then he Rockley explained he said I asked you this and this and this and this and only these things can happen to a prophet and by allah azza wajal it won't be long before he reigns and rules where I'm standing at the moment and if I wear there I wish I could be next to his feet to wash them and to drink the water that I've washed his feet with okay he was this close to accepting Islam after the Arabs left the story says that he gathered all his priests and scholars locked the door and he said to them the message that came to me from Muhammad you know that he is the Messenger of Allah that we have been given the glad tidings and our books and scriptures and I've looked into it and I've decided to follow him all of the priests and the monks were outraged and they started wanting to fight wanting to resist when he saw that he acknowledged and he knew that they will never ever obey Him so he said to them haha I was just testing you no no I'm a Christian and I believe I believe in the Son of God and the Prophet said that his thoughts are on bond be Mulkey he'll hadith this person has valued his reign and throne more than anything else he's like a stingy person he doesn't want to give away his power and might so this is what's preventing the Jews and the Christians from following Islam in vain their loss of power in Nigeria I met one of the most famous priests in the 80s and the 90s who was sent to UK he was sent to so many places he was telling me and this was in I think we men's or in can wad of lost track he was telling me that before my congregation were in the hundreds of thousands he said in one mass I managed to gather a million dollars from people in Nigeria I had mentioned I had cars I had servants I could do whatever I want I had my TV programs on national TV I was a minister I was a celebrity he said when I accepted Islam I was stripped from all of this and now I go and give Dawa unassisted nobody's providing for me and life is difficult but I'd have to let that I was guided to Islam he says I know many priests who believe in Islam but don't want to give up the power that they have because to them this is their life they can't beg anymore things come to them in a silver plate so this is what's preventing the Jews and the Christians from I think we've exceeded our time from accepting Islam and I think we will stop at where the Prophet has defined that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah okay yes we will stop here Shama all right let's take a few questions the first question today is is there a Heidi that talks about divorcing your wife tries making the wife unlawful for you unless you marry someone else if not why is that practice if I understand your question correctly divorce is one of the rulings in Islam give me a second let me turn off the AC divorce is one of the rulings in Islam that is clearly governed unlike any other religion Islam is a way of life it's a religion it's a system it is a complete package some religions govern only your relationship with Allah so it's mystic it is spiritual but it's not intangible some religions are actually only laws you do this we poke your eye out you do this we do that for you Islam covers the whole entire package spiritually your connection with your Lord your connection with one another your connection with the other who's not a Muslim your connection and relationship with your own self so it's a full package marriage is something that we have to go through and sometimes people need to be divorced they can't stay married forever either from the woman's side or from the man's side we know that Catholics don't have divorce where they used to I don't know now if they change their religion it's man-made so they can change it as as if they want but if someone is stuck in a marriage you can expect them to be lawful and faithful to the same spouse who they hate ones that other's guts this is not practical so divorce in Islam is governed and cleared allah azza wajal devoted a whole surah a chapter in the Quran by the title of divorce and it begins they UNW in Aleppo to Manisa all your prophet of Allah whenever you divorce women and then it gives the rulings and this was also mentioned in surat al-baqara clearly so divorce can only be done by a man a woman cannot divorce her her husband she can apply for holer and this is a different chapter altogether if a man does not want to continue living with his wife and he wants to divorce her he cannot do that instantly and immediately there are conditions among them is that she has to be in the state of purity so divorcing her in the state of menses is prohibited and an innovation and sinful the divorce takes place but he's sinful for doing that so I'm angry with my wife I want to divorce her and she says I'm in my period okay I'll wait for another six seven days I can only divorce her when she is pure after a period in which this purity I did not have intimacy with so yesterday I we slept together this morning I was agitated angry I wanted to divorce her Islam says stop good what she is not on her menses said yes she's not on her menses but you were intimate with her and you cannot only divorce her in a state of purity after she gets her menses without having intercourse ha this means I have to wait another couple of weeks when she gets to menses and that's another extra week so after 21 days after she performs also and she's pure now and ready I can divorce her okay I'll wait first day I'm going to eat second day I think I'll wait fifth day tell you what I miss my wife come let's kiss and make up what about they divorced they are they will I'm in a ship under budget you so Islam places a lot of restrictions so that when you divorce you divorce by contemplating and making a sound decision I divorced her once I have the right to reconcile with her in their inter period which is three monthly cycles generally speaking so we reconciled we lived again for three four years beautifully then I divorced her again said wait watch out divorce for a man are only three third strike you're gone so second divorce we reconcile and then the inevitable happens and a divorce or for the third time we're regretful we cried we're remorseful we're sorry tough bananas you're separate Alice immediately once you say the third divorce she's a stranger to you you cannot see her you cannot talk to her she has to leave the house immediately so sure what can we do we would like to get back together we have ten children among us mmm not possible sure we will give you some you know a gift an AMG c63 Mercedes two thousand twenty thousand twenty twenty not possible you cannot cry in the religion of Allah so Witcher so what can we do Allah says in the Quran if you divorce her for the third time she's totally prohibited for you until she marries another man and lives with him in a normal marriage without both of them having the intention to get divorced so that she comes comes back to me so she marries another man she lives with him a year - maybe they have children maybe not and then something happens and the man divorces her if the man divorced her and she's out of her head now only I can go and propose and marry her again so these are the conditions and it's a long topic if you care to join me on my Monday and Thursday class every week we are talking about these subjects of transactions of marriage now we're talking about Reba we're talking about selling and buying but it is Sharla in the coming weeks maybe after Ramadan we will enter the chapter that deals with divorce and marriage and the maintenance the time of the lecture is the same as this one so my Nigeria time from 2:30 to 3:30 every Monday and Thursday Saudi time it's 4:30 Mecca time till 5:30 yesterday I took so much time I'll give you a bonus of 15 minutes insha'Allah for questions because it was my mistake wasting your time so in a special shaker you know he's talking about slaw Malika my question is that my reward my wife is that a wife deny her husband to have sex with her due to a critical condition of pregnancy but he still complains too and just still cosa as well logically follow who enough son-in-law was ha ha Allah said at the end of surat al-baqara allah does not burden a soul beyond what it can bear you cannot come to a woman who is pregnant and in a critical condition may be in pain may be fearing that she would lose her pregnancy and you demand intimacy this is totally prohibited because you will be harming her and a woman is not obliged to obey her husband if there is any harm on her but a diplomatic woman can be a bit diplomatic so she can relieve her husband with her hand with different means that he would feel relieved afterwards without any danger on her physically inshallah and I don't need to elaborate more people for married understand this job yes I'm sure I'm into Forex I do not know if it's Haram or halal what I gather of money from me is anything like Islamic Forex Forex to my knowledge is an electronic platform where they would initiate and establish a virtual wallet for you an account and through that account you can buy and sell online now there are margins there are options there are futures things that are used in the interspaced system in the RIBA banking system which deals with stocks and this is totally Haram so we're not talking about this I'm talking about a halal account they take a thousand dollars for me I open my laptop and I see all the shares and stocks and they tell me buy whatever you want so I buy with a thousand dollars only it's my money stocks in Microsoft now is there any hidden agenda meaning you can keep these stocks in your possession only for four days and then we will force you to sell no this is hammer immediately if I buy something I can hold on to it for ten years more whether the prices go down or up it's mine this is the only way to have it Helen now they say no you can buy it and keep it for as long as you want okay this is good secondly the stocks i buy must be halal stocks yes sure Microsoft is Haddad Amazon is holid Google is Helen said mmm I beg to differ because these companies they financed their projects not from their own savings and their own cash rather they keep their savings and cash aside and they always finance their projects through a third party which is a bank that gives them interspace loans and they put their banks in fixed deposit and they get interest based a profit which means that you as a partner are sharing with them this sin of RIBA so first of all you have to making sure you have to ensure that they don't deal in river and that their line of work is hell there's no entertainment there is no music industry there is like Sony for example is Haram to hold shares in that there are no drugs there are no tobacco in toxic assets etc however the vast majority of people who work on forex deal with gold silver and currency and this is totally prohibited to deal online and this is what people would learn when they join our classes on Mondays and Thursdays the prophet alayhi salaatu sarah made conditions when buying gold and silver in that it has to be simultaneous give-and-take likewise if we sell or buy gold and silver buying silver with gold or buying gold with silver or buying gold with currency all of these must be simultaneous I cannot come to a drop and say assalammualaikum a fee how much is this gold bracelet he said this is $100 she said okay here is the hundred dollars I'll come after in the afternoon and I'll pick it up Harlem Reba whoa what do you mean you have to give and take at the same time it has to be simultaneous oh I didn't know that no I'll give you another example which is even worse lots of the Muslims they have an old bracelet so they go to the jeweler's shop and say how much would you buy this for it says ninety dollars and how much would you sell me this one for he weighs it and says $100 so I say okay here's my bracelet and $10 and give me the new one okay Haram this is RIBA I will share this is what we've been dealing with all of our lives welcome to the club this is why you need to learn your religion so 4x because I'm buying and selling gold silver and currency without being able to cash it in immediately but sure it goes to my account yes but you cannot leave your account before 48 hours in average so even if you tell them immediately give me my money is okay they will give it to you after 2 day working days usually this is why I cannot buy through a check I go to a jeweler shop how much is this hundred dollars here's a check for $100 and he gives it to me this is not Haddad because he still has to cash the money and he may lose the check and then needs another check in in return etc so these issues of buying and selling people must learn the religion before they engage in it and Allah knows best now Michelle I shake this will especially Shama Salam I committed shirk by going to Mom's who claim to solve issues going to shake sometimes siliceous I've repeated but I repented what I read that Allah does not forgive sure please does this mean even after repenting I will be punished how do I make Allah forgive me please first of all this is a very common misconception among the Muslims who failed to read the Quran regularly most of us don't read the Quran on daily basis and those who do fail to contemplate and ponder about what Allah is telling us this Quran is for us our guidance is in the Quran yet we fail to read it our hearts so we just simply a little bit and then we meet our brothers a Nasser masha'Allah today's the 15th of Ramadan how many times did you finish the Quran see the finish it three times oh that's all I finished it five times so we're competing on just reading it and showing off with it this is not the right thing to do so if you read the Quran you will find a lot mentioning in two verses in Naha dialogue Furai you shakopee he well film analytically Miasha in certainly in Surat Annisa chapter no.4 in two places so Allah does not forgive people to associate others with him and he may forgive other sins to whom he wishes so sure I committed shirk you're telling me Allah is not gonna forgive me so what to do commit suicide burn myself what is this okay if you read the Quran at the last page of surat al-furqan allah describes the believers a bird or a man and then he goes on and says well Levine Allah Allah well I were to Loon enough silletti Halima in level hawk when I as noon when I filed any can you go after who lied we all do the fee he Mohana a lemon turbo Amelia Mansoor Ali Javed dhillullah who say year to him has a net Allah is talking about three categories of people those who do not worship other do not associate others with Allah do not kill innocent people and do not fornicate and whoever shall do any of these Allah will magnify and multiply his sins and turn on the day of judgment except those who believe repent and do good deeds Allah will transform their sins into good deeds so even those who associate others with Allah if they repent believe and do good deeds Allah who transform their three billion bad deeds into three billion has a knack and critiques so this ayah and the ayah so many ayahs I can any code that for you now but it will take time and it will take effort for me to translate it to English because we I know it in Arabic so Allah as the origin is stating to us by combining all these different ayahs and hadith into the fact those who died in the state of ship will abide in Jahannam for eternity those who accept Islam revert to it repent from shirk Allah would forgive their sins as long as they do it while alive and the biggest example okay you went to Mahalalel a myeloma or whatever these piers and soothsayers malim i think you call it okay and now you're repenting okay compare yourself to the companions who were mushrik idol worshippers and they accepted islam what happened to them they became the best of Allah's creation after the prophets and the messengers so don't be fooled by Shaitaan who's trying to make you give up on allah azzawajal and hold your grounds repent to allah abide by the toe hate worship allah and all of your sins will be transformed into good deeds with the grace of allah as a watcher hada wallah eylem when it's but will merely exilim and until we meet you tomorrow be evening lie as there was at the same time
