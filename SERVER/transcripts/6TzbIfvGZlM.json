  "transcript": "so in a the prophet sallam has said whoever whoever says will have the reward of freeing T slaves and we know if we break an oath we have to other if you're a slave or Fe 10 poor people or clothe them and if you cannot we have to fast 3 days so can I say that AAR to expiate the broken oath the answer is no you cannot do this because there is a difference between a reward and an experation and I'll give you an example if someone pledges and says by Allah I will recite the full Quran if Allah cures my son and my son is cured and I look at the Quran said whoa this is going to take me a week so I hear a Hadith where the Prophet says reciting three times is equivalent to reciting the Quran says okay and I recite it three times and it's sufficient is it sufficient I'll give you a better example maybe this is not clear is your prayer valid without reciting Al Fat the answer is no you have to recite the fa so if I recite three times in every without the F based on if I recite it three times I've read or I have the word of the Quan would be would my prayer be valid of course not I have to recite the faat once another example the prophet said whoever prays F in the Masid and remains in his spot remembering Allah till the sun rises then he prays two this is equivalent to and complete complete complete so if I do this once or even every single day does this exempt me from performing Haj once in a lifetime which is f and one of the pillars of Islam or of course not so there is a difference between something that you're rewarded for but it does not take away from you any responsibility or obligation and there is a difference between something that you're commanded to do and Allah Knows Best"
