  "title": "A young person reverted to Islam, doesn't fast or pray fearing his parents, is it valid Assimalhakee",
  "transcript": "it says a friend was converted to islam alhamdulillah but the but the parents did not know this so he cannot fast or pray because his parents forced him to eat and he cannot pray because they are always watching him is this a valid reason not to fast and not to pray he is only 15. and he's unable to leave his home what if it's a female well alhamdulillah that he guided our brother to islam and this is one of the greatest favors and blessings of allah upon him and upon any of us the blessing of guidance is only given to those whom allah azzawajal loves those whom allah azza does not love he does not guide them because they don't want to be guided whenever an individual seeks guidance searches for it and try his level best to attain it allah azza would help him as allah mentioned this in the last verse of surat al-ankabut the spider now islam is a religion of ease and it's a religion of weighing prose and khans and this is all what islam revolves around whenever the pros outweigh the cons you have to opt for it and whenever the cons outweigh the pros then you have concession and permission to manage it in a different way as muslims we're ordered to fast and pray these are pillars of islam and hence when we are faced with a situation when my prayer and fasting would result in dire consequences and this has to be measured correctly it's not a hunch or a gut feeling it has to be a fact and a reality so if a person like a friend here who's 15 years of age he's totally dependent on his parents and he knows that his parents are vicious and evil if they were to know that he is a muslim they would probably do heinous things to him torture him maybe accuse him falsely maybe kill them especially in the in the case of girls when they accept islam it they they are more vulnerable for such attacks and abuse so if he is afraid genuinely and truly of the consequences if his parents were to know in this case he has to conceal his islam until he's able to find a way to move out or to have an alternative or a source of income or a way to convince them but this has to be in accordance to a true and genuine feeling of threat to his life and well-being most parents would maybe would uh resist in the beginning object but in a couple of days couple of weeks things would go smoothly and normally alhamdulillah especially when they see that you don't have any tendencies of being a terrorist or showing any sort or form of aggression against them so the vast majority of parents accept this embrace it and live with it so we have to look into it and try to analyze and figure out the reaction so that we could base upon it our answer so hypothetically if they are truly aggressive and abusive and you know their hatred to this and that they would torment you for it in this case conceal it you can always try your level best to see when they're preoccupied with the tv or with the things that they do and you go to your room and you can pray in less than five minutes as for fasting you try your level best to give ambiguous answers that i had lunch with a friend i had a meal with a friend meaning yesterday or that i'm going to eat uh out meaning for breakfast etc you have to try your level best and if you were first forced to break your fasting then you could do that in sha allah and make it up later on and realize it will make it easy for you"
