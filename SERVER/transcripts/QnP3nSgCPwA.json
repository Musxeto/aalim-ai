  "transcript": "among the cultural things that we Arabs have and we're rejecting and refusing to fight it is free mixing especially in weddings and I believe that this is prevalent also here you have men and women mixing in weddings the groom comes in front of all the women and the Bride Comes wearing her Haram dress no hijab exposing every hour possible and she sits in front of nonaham men clicking photos enjoying what they're seeing and the poor cow next to her is just smiling and proud yeah this is my wife don't you feel like that you're not a man anymore where is your jealousy let alone where is your Islam such cultural things and Customs expose Us big time because this indicates if I'm a true Muslim following the Quran or the Sunnah or otherwise and we have habits Customs that we call part of our honor and dignity which has nothing related to honor dignity in some Arab countries we have what is known as honor killing so if your sister if your mother if your daughter allegedly is dating someone or talking to someone you feel obliged to kill her thinking that this is part of protecting your honor not knowing that this is part of throwing you in hell big time this is a major sin it has nothing to do with honor but this is what culture does to you when you don't have Islam in your heart and this happens in so many cultures so many parents insist not to give their daughters except to their nephews you're not selling and buying this is marriage if she doesn't have any chemistry with the man proposing even if her if he was her cousin you have no right enforcing her even if you are her father you have no no right enforcing her you're the one who's getting married get married to him she's is the one who's going to live with him 247 under the same roof so fear Allah and abide by Islam and its teachings Allah says in the Quran but no by your lord they will not truly believe until they make you oh Muhammad until they make you judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then find within themselves no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in full willing submission you will never believe until you implement this Ayah in your life and accept Muhammad to be your judge and to be your mentor and to be your leader who would be the only one to lead you to so are you going to follow or are you going to follow your whims and desires your customs and traditions your Clans aspirations this is what you have to decide and the choice is yours"
