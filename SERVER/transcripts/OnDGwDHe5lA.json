  "transcript": "there is a verse that says that some a are does that mean that there are metaphors in the Quran and how can we know which verses are metaphors the issue of metaphor is an issue of dispute among Scholars some Scholars like Tamia and those who followed him such as Muhammad Alin may Allah have mercy on him the compiler ofay and many many salafi scholars say that there are no metaphors in the Quran where a metaphor means something and it refers to something else because Quran is crystal clear it was revealed in an Arabic tongue language which is understood by everyone one so if you claim that there is a metaphor in it we can manipulate the meaning of the Quran to suit our needs we can say that when Allah says this about something no no no he did not mean that they will abide in Hell For Eternity no no these Believers can't go to paradise eventually and we can manipulate so many things including the attributes of Allah Asel so the face does not mean the face the hand of Allah does not mean an actual hand and Allah does not have a hand Allah said he has a hand no no no this is the metaphor and they come to every single thing and they twist it by saying it's a metaphor so these Scholars say we don't have metaphors then when you read the Quran you come to few a very handful phrases where some would argue and said this is a metaphor our Scholars say no this is not a metaphor when Allah says ask the village all Arabs understand that it is not referring to us going to the buildings and asking the the doors and the walls of the village the Arabs know that this is not a metaphor it is meant that the people of the village so this is one way of looking at it which you referred to in contrast to it means that it may refer to something if it was left alone without any other supporting evidences to clarify the meaning for you the people of innovation those who follow their own whims and desires come to a single a and they say of and say this means this and we say to them as yes you're right if there weren't other verses governing how we understand it if there were no other hadiths controlling how we understand it but to come and isolate it from the rest of the text and trying to make your own understanding to with no this is the way of innovation and following your whims and desires and this is what will lead you to being part of the 72 sects you have to return this with which was a bit ambiguous to you to the rest of the Quran and the Hadith so that it can be clarified and this is very crystal clear to Anyone who reads and understands the and Allah Knows Best"
