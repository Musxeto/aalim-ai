  "title": "Was Hajar (mother of Ismail) afraid of Sarah that she had to cover her tracks? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "action face uh there's a Hadith that says that uh Hagar covered her tracks from Sarah or something because she was afraid of Sarah if I'm not mistaken I have no idea I was not there at the time and I do not recall such a Hadith where a hajjar the mother of Ismail was afraid from Sarah the mother of Isaac or his half peace be upon them and to the extent that she used to cover her tracks I don't know this fear of hajjar might be something personal not due to any oppression or aggression from Sarah's part maybe this is what she felt and she hid her tracks because she was afraid not because there was something bad being plotted or done by Sarah and either way the jealousy does exist between the co-wives and we know that so there is a possibility but it's not beneficial for us to go down that lane and discuss things we have no knowledge of providing that the Hadith is authentic I don't know I have not uh looked into the Hadith and Allah Knows Best"
