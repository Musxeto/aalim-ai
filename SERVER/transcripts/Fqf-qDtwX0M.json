  "transcript": "uh is it Sunnah to wear a watch on the right hand just well first of all we have to acknowledge that at the time of the Prophet they had no watches so when we say is it that would be a bit controversial as for wearing your watch in your right or on your left this is up to your preference some say that we like to wear it on the right because of the Hadith of of mother may Allah be pleased with her where she says that the prophet sallallah wasam used to love to begin with his right side whenever he was calming his hair or putting uh on clothes or performing wood and the likes so whenever something is of honor the prophet used to love giving precedence to the right side to the right hand and if someone says no I'm going to wear it on my left because it's more convenient I use my left less than the right so my chances of hitting objects is less and my watch would be intact besides 95% of the population of Earth wear it on the left hand side that's fine it's up to your preference there's no Sunnah in it and Allah Knows Best"
