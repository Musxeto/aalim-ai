  "transcript": "the prophet sallallaahu in salem gave the muslim a strong warning of whom he warned us of the Harwich who is the house where is the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us that do not be fooled by the quantity of their worship focus on the quality and this is extremely important in Islam and I had given the number of topics and lectures on this specific topic which is quality versus quantity and as an example the Prophet told the sunniest Allah to send that when you look at this heritage you will look down upon your own prayer upon your own fasting because you think that this is children's play this is nothing they pray hours without end they fast days without end so that you would feel that you're nothing compared to them however though their quantity is far greater than yours the Prophet said that he saw to sell and that they recite the Quran and it does not go past their throats meaning that they don't benefit from it and he told the son his thoughts and that they are the hounds of hell and that they are the worst people to be killed under the skies why because they have twisted understanding of Islam they killed innocent people they killed discriminately they are giving tack fear to the Muslims they don't believe in the Quran and in the Sunnah as they should but they come to one text misinterpreted and act upon it neglecting everything else they don't have scholars this fits as a glove it fits like a glove"
