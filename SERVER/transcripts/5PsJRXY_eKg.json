  "transcript": "question was about if a child beyond the age of puberty is he allowed to lead the prayer is he allowed to lead his mother his sister in prayer and the answer is children beyond the age of puberty or below the age of puberty I divided into two types and you have the first type is what is known as a Mumma is a child that has the ability to understand the surroundings he's not yet at the age of puberty but he knows what's going on so his decisions in a sense are a little bit sound and closer to the one who's an adult so this is usually at the age of eight nine and the other type is rare aluminous is the one who is still a child he's unable to make sound decisions he may play in prayer he may make takbir and then look around or maybe go out and for a walk etc as for the moment is the person who or the child who is able to distinguish things and to make sound decisions his leading the prayer is permissible not only to his mother or leading his mother and sister but even if he leads adults and grown up and this is based on the authentic hadith where I'm in this element may Allah be pleased with him came as a child of seven years of age six seven years of age and he learned from the Quran Allah saw to sonam a lot of the he learned the Quran from the progress on more than his tribesmen so when they went back they remember that the Prophet said assumed that the one who memorizes most of the Quran should bleed and they found that he was the most among them in memorizing the Quran so they made him his their Imam and he was six or seven years of age so is a clear indication and evidence that it is"
