  "title": "What time is the Friday prayer & What is the opinion of Hanbali school of thought? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what is the timing of Jummah sure that's a weird question I know but we have to ask it so that we learn and this is why we were here the vast majority of scholars the school of Abu Hanifa the school of Malik the school of Mohammed anybody Shafi all agree that the time of human is the time of law this is what we all know the humbly school of thought differ and they say that the time of the  is the same as the time of Reid whoa that's a lot time of Reid it's after sunrise by 15 minutes so do you mean to tell me that I can pray Friday when it is 7:30 a.m. well we have to look at the origin of this first of all the safest is to go with the majority the safest is to pray Gemara exactly at the time of the advance of yesterday's law so if the a de novo is 12:30 every single day on a Juma the Imam gives the hot WA get says my Akuma rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh a 12:30 this is the most convenient opinion because no Muslim would say whoa you've done a mistake even the humbly school of thought who say that you can offer it earlier if you say that I'm going to offer it at the time of others say no problem so where did the humbly get what they say from first of all we have to know that this is an erect object the Sun rises from the east as it rises from the east the shade to the west is decreasing bit by bit it's decreasing a little bit as the Sun goes to the zenith the middle of the sky once it is erect on the erect object we don't have shades this is a time of prohibition the moment the Sun goes a little bit to the west and there is a shade to the east this is called in Islam memorize this write it down l za z a wal of course this is lamb Shamsi and we don't pronounce it when we attach it to the word so say as Z well we don't say L so L as in the word a shemp's we don't say al-shams this is why they call this L a sham SIA in contrast to l a-- maria the one dealing with moon so the L is obvious as in the name of al Hakim so al Hakim the L here is audible you can hear it you can say it and pronounce it so what is as though al Aswad is the time where the begins now why did I bring this up to tell you where the Hanbury school got this idea that Friday is much earlier in sahih muslim from the hadith of Abdullah from the hadith of Jabbar Abdullah Al represen and his father and other scholars companions they all said that we used to attend the Friday prayer the hotbar the Friday prayer duties to speak and leave from the Masjid and the z1 has not started yet this means that the profit offered the hotbar and the prayer at least 20 minutes before the time of the hora and this is why these scholars of the Hannibal schools thought that hmm if we can make it half an hour or an hour before we can make it two hours three hours because this is a time where the prayer of each starts and it's open until lower prayer etc this is how they thought and they came up with this idea however the most authentic opinion is the opinion of following the authentic hadith so Jabbar Nabila isn't Muslim other companions described that they used to pray JAMA and leave and this eval is not there or barely about to begin this is the most authentic opinion which made sure Abdul Aziz ambass jacobina they mean may Allah have mercy on their souls say that you can pray Friday prayer half an hour to maximum an hour before as the one and this is what I actually do throughout the whole year nowadays the her in Jeddah is approximately 1237 so I go to the member to the pulpit and I say assalamualaikum warahmatullah at 12:15 fixed and I've been doing this for the past like 20 years 25 years who's counting and I finished salat and leave the Masjid while everyone around us is still delivering the hot but not the Salah and I chitchat with the worshippers and for 10 minutes I get into my car I Drive home and the salat is still ongoing in the harem of Mecca so you say share but why don't you be safe rather than sorry well simply because I'm following the hadith of the Prophet aerosol as-salaam and I'm safe when I'm with the Prophet aerosol Silla and secondly when I come to the Masjid and I say ass aromatic Muhammad Allah the full the message it is fully packed before I enter the Masjid and the people are standing at the doors because they know that I begin early and finish early which gives them time to go and buy food for their family from restaurants and be the first to be at that restaurant when it opens of course these are in Islamic countries were shops close and hamdulillah if you're in Europe then you won't have this advantage therefore the most authentic opinion is that you have to begin the salat or to begin Juma by half an hour to an hour and that is the most authentic opinion"
