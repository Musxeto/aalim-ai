  "transcript": "the month of Ramadan is the month of the Quran because Allah tells us that the Quran was revealed in the month of Ramadan and this means that it was initiated as we know for the first time to the prophet in the month of Ramadan and other Scholars say that it was lowered from the seventh heaven to the first heaven in Ramadan as a whole and then it came bits and pieces during the 23 years of the prophets Alam prophets Hood not only that the month of Ramadan is the month of divine revelation in the authentic Hadith the prophet sallallah alai wasam tells us that ibim which are the books or if you wish the tablets or uh the papers that were given to our Prophet ibraim peace be upon him these books were given um to him in the first month or in the first uh uh day of Ramadan so even IIM was given to him in the month of Ramadan likewise the prophet tells usat that Torah was given to Moses on the sixth of Ramadan so not only ibraim but also the Torah of Moses and the gospel or the inil or the New Testament not the one we have now but what was actually revealed to Jesus Christ peace be upon him was given to him on the 13th of Ramadan and the zabor was given to David to Prophet D peace be upon him on the 18th of Ramadan while the Quran was revealed on the 24th of Ramadan so all of this indicates to us that Ramadan the one we know the one that should start either on Wednesday or Thursday depending on the sighting of the moon this beautiful month is the month of divine revelation this is the month that Allah chose to reveal his words and his message to His prophets and that is why the prophet Alat wasam used to recite the Quran to jiel revising it with jiel once every single Ramadan and in the Ramadan the prophet fasted he revised it twice with jel because it is the month of Ramadan this month is an opportunity whoever Allah gives him the will and guides him to offer good deeds in it and to refrain from Bad Deeds then he should know that Allah loves him and that Allah has chosen him or her to get closer to him but whomever sees that this month is heavy and it's a burden on our shoulders and he does not find it easy for him to go to prayer or to fast or to do voluntary things such as reciting the Quran giving charity to the poor Etc if he finds himself in in this fashion then he should know that Allah does not love him so we should strive we should do our best to seek Allah's pleasure by offering as good deeds as we can giving charity connecting to our next of kin praying with the IM because this is by itself a cause forgiveness of our our our sins the prophet tells us whoever prays Ramadan that is the whole nights of Ramadan whoever prays Ramadan believing that it is part of the sunah and anticipating the reward of Allah Allah will forgive all of his sins so if you pray from to every single night in the 30 nights of Ramadan Allah will forgive your sins but this is might be a little bit difficult to some and that is why Allah the almighty made it easy and that is why Allah the almighty made it easy upon us and he said whoever prays with the IM on until the Imam concludes his prayer this would be considered as the prayer of a whole night this means that if the Imam after Isa prays for one hour or for half an hour or for an hour and a half and you pray with him until he concludes the wit this means that you have prayed the whole night from till F and if you do this every single night of Ramadan Allah will forgive all of his sins I pray to Allah that he may makes all of this easy upon us and above all that he makes leaving sin in Ramadan easy as well because whoever leaves sin in Ramadan and offer Good Deeds Allah will definitely be pleased with him we pray to him subhanahu wa ta'ala that he makes it easy and that he accepts our fasting"
