  "transcript": "Oh to day or tonight is the 14th of feb 2015 and the first question that we have for today is from Abdul Rahman she says what's the ruling on celebrating Valentine's Day and we could go on talking about the history of Valentine's Day and its origin as a pagan festival then turned into a Christian festival and sufficient for us as Muslims to know that it has nothing to do with Islam and it's called st. Valentine's Day so it's even not related to Islam it's related to other religions but I will not go to that celebrating Valentine's Day whether by giving gifts or receiving them or selling red roses or wearing red clothes or sending postcards all of this is totally prohibited in Islam the Prophet said that is sort of Salaam whoever imitates a people he is considered to be among them with them from them and this is very scary because it shows that if you imitate these people then there's a possibility that you will be with them on the day of judgement and part of them so this is totally prohibited to celebrate by any form or mean the problem is not here the problem is that there are two types of people who celebrate Valentine's Day those who are living among the kafir in kafir countries in non-muslim countries and these people I feel sorry for them because they have what is called as peer pressure so everyone around them is exchanging cards and we know that the rate of divorce in these countries booms rocket high on the 14th of February on Valentine's Day and this is backed by statistics they say that the divorce rate increases why is that because so much infidelity so much cheating over your spouse because you feel under the Pew pressures that this is the time to express my love to someone I'm not allowed to love but at the end of the day you have to express yourself you have to get out of the closet you have to do this and that and then we know what happens Islam totally opposes that the second type of people who celebrate Valentine's Day are those who are living among us among the Muslims in Muslim countries and I feel sorry for them as well because some of them are ignorant since simply they give their wives legitimate love that is they give their wives or the spouses a gift on that day commemorating that they have love among themselves and this is totally prohibited Muslim loves his spouse or her spouse 24/7 the whole year not to express it in one day a per year and pretend that to love one another the other type of people who celebrate this are those who are indulged in Haram relationships so boyfriend girlfriend colleague at school and no matter how many times scholars tell them that this is haram this is against Islam bla bla bla they would not listen because they have this rebellious feeling they inside do not love Islam they want to rebel they want they feel this resentment they have this in free aura tea complex in them feeling that whatever Islam tells them to do makes them second-class so they want to excel so they think so they want to be someone else and the only way to do this is to celebrate Christmas New Year's Halloween imagining in Saudi Arabia in the Arabian countries they some of them celebrate Halloween you find boys and girls walking down the street with a dog what is this is this part of a culture is this part of a religion they could care less because they want to stand out in a crowd and whoever does this ends up in hell as the Prophet tells us as I'm not to wear lobos's Shura not to look to be famous or identified by a certain way of style that you are following so Valentine is totally prohibited and it's not part of Islam and it's a major sin to celebrate it and Allah surgeon knows best"
