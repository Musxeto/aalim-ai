  "transcript": "what is Hope in Islam is when your heart is connected to Allah feeling happy and optimistic of Allah's favors and blessings coming over you feeling the peace and Tranquility feeling your heart because you know who Allah is this is totally the opposite of the fear here you are safe you feel safe and I always give an example and Allah has the highest of all examples subhana when you hold your one-year-old child and you toss him in the air what does a child do put me down put me down does he do this no he laughs and he enjoys it the more you do it the if I were to throw you in the air what would you do you will hang to the chandelier sh you're crazy come down I'm going to pick you up said man you're out of your mind because you don't trust me so those who have hope in Allah feel like a child being tossed in the air they know Allah will catch them they know Allah will forgive them they know Allah will give them Jenna yeah Allah made the Jenna to whom to you and me Allah made the Jenna to whom to you and me all what you have to do is think positively of Allah so what is the difference between hope and being Wishful with ah Wishful is when you sit on your backside and you don't do anything and you say I'll open the door for the prophet of the Jenna from the inside meaning I will enter first and open the door for him this is stupid this is Wishful while being hopeful is when you pray night prayer for two 2 three hours and you do good deeds and you read the Quran once every month at least and you give charity and you are hopeful that Allah will accept this is so how can we attain this level of hopefulness in Allah by looking at Allah's previous favors and blessings upon you did Allah send favors and blessings in the past of course I I'm standing I can see I can speak I can eat I can move around these are all favors from Allah so this makes me hopeful in Allah's continuous gift and blessing in Allah does not turn let us down Allah continues to give us blessings from means you do not anticipate also you remember when you read the Quran and the sunah what Allah has promised you whenever you pass by verses of Jenna and see what's in Jenna your heart flies and says I'll be there I'm one of the inhabitants of Jenna I know that and you wish and you ask Allah and you make Dua also you remember Allah current favors and blessings upon you the houses the children the wives the the wealth that Allah gives to you and most of what you're being given is without asking is everything you have you asked Allah for no all what we ask Allah for is a 2024 model new car that's alhamd I don't want anything but everything else Allah gives you without asking and we never appreciative of that"
