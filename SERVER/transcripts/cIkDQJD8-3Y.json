  "transcript": "alhamd Islam came to purify the hearts of the people the prophet tells usam that I was merely sent to perfect the moral conduct the characteristics of people which means that when the prophet Alat wasam was sent to us there were traces of moral conduct of good behavior of and he was sent to perfect this not to bring something that is new so Islam comes to purify the hearts why because Allah looks at your hearts the prophet says and theith in Muslim Allah does not look at your bodies or your wealth but he looks at at your hearts and your Deeds so if you are of a a a particular nationality has no difference if you're tall or short if you're fat or thin if you're black or white has no difference if your bank account is big or small if you don't have a bank account to begin with has no difference Allah looks at your heart not only that he looks at your Deeds why because so many times people think that they have good Hearts so when you come to a person who works in a place that serves alcohol and he is the bartender and you tell him this is Haram he said yeah my heart is good yes but your Deeds are bad so Allah looks at both your hearts and your deeds and they have to go and coincide together and that is why Allah wants us to purify our hearts through means of protection and through means of Good Deeds that cleanse and wash the hearts this life we're living in is a temporary phase as we stated before we're not here to stay we're not here here forever it's a transitional period and this life is a stage of testing it's a life of trials and tribulations it's a life of calamities why because it's short yet in accordance to what we do in it Allah Asel would either reward us or punish us on the day of judgment and I pray to Allah that he rewards us all Allah Asel says in the Quran it's in black and white you can read it you can understand it and you can know the purpose of your existence Allah says subhanahu wa'ta'ala but as for him who feared standing before his Lord and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts verely Paradise will be his Abode it will be his shelter it will be his house when when you fear standing in front of Allah when you fear your position in front of Allah on the day of judgment and you forbid yourself from the lusts from the desires that dwell into your heart Allah promises you a a paradise not only that in another verse Allah promises you two Paradise as [Music] in and for those or to him who fears the standing before his Lord there will be two gardens so this is your reward this is your bonus if you pass the test if you pass the exam one would say alhamdulillah I have no problem I pray i f Ramadan I even go and make once or twice a year so I've got it made I have passed the test well not fully the prophet tells us that the biggest and most dangerous tribulation on Earth would be any answers women huh time the tongue okay women the tongue the biggest tribulation ever did not come yet it is the however under the deal immediately comes women and the sisters are preparing their tomatoes and the empty bottles to throw on my head you chauvinist male Pig no wait wait wait let me explain these desires are two ways huh so when the prophet tells usam in the Hadith and this Hadith was narrated or reported by bukari and Muslim so it has the highest level of authenticity nothing is more authentic than it except the Quran the prophet says I've have not left behind me any fitna that is Temptation more harmful to men than women and this goes without yeah you don't have to elaborate every man fears this temptation right that is every man who has his hormones level correct if you don't have hormones then you're in the wrong place alhamdulillah every normal person has this in him and not only the umah of Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam also in previous Nations the prophet tells us sallallahu alaih wasallam the first temptation of B is the sons of Israel the first Temptation was in women so this is what Shan works on this is one of his greatest tools and Shan is smart isn't he he's devious he's very smart if someone tells meam can I see your resume I'll give him two to three pages of all the courses is and the position I assumed in private sector in this in that different department when Shan comes and you ask him for his resume it's going to be like million of pages I manag to seduce this and I manag to have this one kill and this one to Rob and this one to make kufur and this one to make shik and he has a lot and it goes back to when since the time of Adam peace be upon him so his experience is not like our you know in 10 years it's in hundreds and thousands of years and he is is also patient he's not rushing things so it doesn't matter for him if you take a life time to fall into sin or you f fall into sin immediately he has all the time and that is why he never comes to me and say for example you love women come on let commit adultery what will I say you're crazy what is this go away he will start by step by step so he will come to me and say how about watching this movie they say it's very nice okay nobody's watching let me watch it and I see beautiful women wow this is gorgeous this is beautiful this is lovely I wish I could have have one like those after a while he goes on making it easy for me to listen to music and then I hear songs that talk about love and I look at my wives and say what is this compare this to this low and I hear songs about love and about emotions and stories I wish I could have those but I'm still away from sin and then people introduce me to this magazine this picture celebrities following the stories of this and that and my heart is hardening and I'm getting a little bit further from Allah I'm still praying I'm still fasting and then I am cornered in a situation where a woman non-muslim extends her hand for me to shake and I'm thinking islamically Haram but I'm doing it for the sake of Allah because then she would hate Islam so how are you how are you feeling and then why don't I invite her for dinner for da only for da don't get me wrong I'm trying to do my work for Allah and then it's dinner and then it Allah knows what and now he's ready for falling into sin this may take few years no problem Shan is waiting he doesn't have any better to do so if you know that these are the steps ofan Allah tells us oh you believe do not follow what the steps of Shan this is how shatan comes to you unfortunately we do not find out we cannot figure it out until it's after it's what after it's too late unless you have someone that Allah sends to you to guide you watch out don't do this this is going to take you into the wrong place that is why Allah wants us to purify the heart how we love women and this may not be the same with women loving men but it is there the passion and the love of men to women is far greater than the love and passion of women to men why because men are a little bit you know lousy their eyes goes left right and Center their heart can accommodate for wife by Islam but a decent woman can only love one man by Nature she cannot love more than one man this is Allah how Allah created them and they're more chased they're more honorable and Men you have their Hanky Panky ways may Allah have mercy on us all and that is why some argue but I'll tell I'll give you an example if you have 20 righteous men or at least people who look to be decent and honest and you put uh uh uh one of the most you know Bombshells in in in the movies the most beautiful woman what will happen to them to the 20 men maybe 18 of them would wow and two say right now turn the tables have 20 women and put the most gorgeous and handsome man in in the world in between of them maybe one or two will look and the rest they won't why because this is the nature of men and women men may Allah have mercy on them women are more protective mallah in in in this terms that is why Islam came to put a barrier between men and sin between women and sin why to to have and protect This Heart of ours if you look at what Allah has made forbidden anything that leads to FNA anything that leads to Temptation Allah had made forbidden Allah says in the Quran what is the meaning of those who know Arabic don't go close one would say and assume I would have expected Allah to say Do not fornicate do not commit adultery no this is the last stage Allah says do not come close to Whatever Gets you close to that major sin so anything that gets you close there Allah made forbidden on the top of the list sending your gaze looking freely the majority of Muslims if not all they consider lower lowering the Gaze to be something that only nerds do we have evolved now we are sophisticated we're educated when I go to the hospital and I speak to the nurse and I look down everybody's looking at me are you sick why are you talking to the nurse and you're looking down is something wrong with your shoes they look at my shoes and I have to lower my gaze she's not beautiful she is 40 years of age she's ugly ugly Subhan Allah so people now do not lower the Gaze Allah instructed both men and women to lower their gaze why because it's the first Arrow of Shan and you don't see Shan and you don't see his arrows but nowadays if if you talk to someone and tell him lower your gaze they'll laugh at you you see and and some of them even justify this by nonsense they say yeah how want you to how do you want me to walk in the street I'm driving there is a woman driving on my in front of me on the right on the left I'm going to have an accident because I'm lowering my yeah you you joking are you serious Allah told you to lower your gaze you have to comply but the prophet told you he told you that the first gaze is yours the second is against you it's a sin so one says okay I watch movies and I do this it's the first gaze I'm not blinking and I can watch the whole thing Allah knows what you're doing who are you fooling Allah and why doesn't Allah want you to look around look at beautiful women why what will happen will anything harm Allah nothing it's only for your sake for my sake I enjoy looking at women I enjoy Beauty I enjoy figures and I enjoy colors and I enjoy everything in a woman how would it harm me yes it would harm you it would corrupt your heart remember my wives who I'm always comparing this is part of the corruption it corrupts my marriage it corrupts how I see things not only that Allah says doesn't Allah know who he had created the only one who knows his creation is Allah so when he tells you don't do this it's for your own sake Allah is not going to lose anything subhana wa tala he he owns everything so he is doing this for your own protection tell the believing men to lower their gaze and tell the believing women to lower their gaze this is an instruction to purify your heart not only that the prophet saidat wasam that whenever a man is in seclusion with a woman who's the third one with them Shan you know this right how many of you went into the elevator and this beautiful woman comes in he's alone with her in the elevator what do you do well I've been there it took me 10 floors to know the H until we reach the ground floor then I thought yeah this is Haram it's good 10 floors alhamdulillah you not in a SK sky scraper or something like this it is not permissible sh we're in a hotel we're in a big building me and her there is cameras Subhan Allah Allah is watching you you're not allowed to be in seclusion with her don't you have Islam she's with me in the car but there are windows all over so this is not seclusion it is seclusion a lot of the the sisters go with the driver alone and they say we are in the street yes but what goes between you and the driver well I've seen this in jida a woman wearing the veil and the man in front is a driver of course not related to her and he is speaking and laughing I can't see the woman's face but I'm assuming that she is replying to his what he's saying and they're laughing Subhan Allah and I was shocked a stranger an UNM exchanger laughter and people say so doesn't a woman have the right to laugh and have humor and socialize we will come to this inshallah later on so you do not look and this is part of honoring the women you do not stay with them in seclusion and you do not touch them because shaking hands with an UNAM woman is forbidden in Islam even if she's my sister-in-law even if she's your sister-in-law even if she is my uncle's wife she's like my mother she's 90 years of age even if she's 90 years of age it's Haram the prophet tells us in the authentic it is best it is better for a a a man to be stabed in his head with an iron nail rather than touching a woman that is not permissible for him to touch and that is why the prophet alhat did not touch a woman when he went to Mecca on the eth year of when he conquered Mecca and the women came to accept Islam and to give the Pledge of Allegiance they said give us your hand so that we can shake hands with you and he's the prophet he has things he has he has exemptions more than we do what did he sayam I Do Not Shake Hands with women now how are we today how are the Muslims today she we don't shake hands but we kiss so yeah the prophet said touching I'm not touching I'm just kissing and she's my sister-in-law so this is Hell huh this is punishment this is something that you should be scared for from and usually people don't think about this is from one side so a brother sent me an email today saying she what is the ruling on having friends of women on Facebook chatting with them sending them and exchanging but they're not Maham I said okay if if you allow this to your wife and sister and daughter it's okay said no I don't allow Subhan Allah why do you allow it to yourself and make it forbidden to others the ruling is one he said yeah yeah but I'm a man masallah you're a man you're allowed to do Haram and because they are your your women your wife your sister is Haram no it's the same thing all together and due to the attraction aspect in women is far greater in the attraction aspect in men Allah made it more difficult and emphasized on the importance of women taking care in how they speak and in how they look and appear Allah addressed the wives of the Prophet Alat wasam and they are our mothers does anyone marry his mother does anyone have ill feelings towards his mother no yet Allah tells them in the Quran if you keep your duty to Allah then be not soft in speech be not soft who he's addressing he is addressing Zab he is addressing H do not be soft in speech why lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire but speak in an honorable manner this address Cascades down to all women of the Muslims so does a woman with soft voice affect men yes does it the majority say yes huh that is why they choose women to be in call centers that is why I get two or three calls every day from marketing agencies I look at my wife and I say I never heard my name so beautiful before I could not use my right eye for 3 days but the fourth day alhamdulillah it started to open after she smacked me on my eye never tell your wife such a joke ever they use this this is what they do because the voice of a man no matter how muscular his voice Isam alayum you'll never find a woman says Ah I love this voice but men are captivated by such beautiful soft nice voices and that is why Allah tells them do not do this do not speak in soft voice when a woman talks to a man she has to be honorable and serious Salam alaykum go to the point don't start you know communicating how are you fine how's the kids yes I'd like to do this or that you go to the markets and you find women negotiating the price bargaining with the uh uh the salesman okay make this for 10 R just for me just for you what are you doing sister and she's wearing the n and the gloves this is UN unacceptable at all she has to speak in an honorable and uh uh good way Allah instructed them not to show their adornment not to show their uh uh uh Zena except to their Maham so a woman must not beautify herself except to her husband or to her mams and so many complaints I get from men saying that we buy dresses for our wives only to see them wearing them when they're going to weddings or to parties but they never wear anything for us and Subhan Allah you find the woman want staying with her husband and does not put anything on her face before she goes she spends two hours in front of the mirror putting makeup and beautifying herself why because people will be impressed with her rather than the husband and the slightest thing that may trigger the Temptation in a man's heart Allah makes it forbidden even while walking imagine Allah says and let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment so if a woman wears something on her leg or on her foot types of jewelry that makes a ringing sound this is forbidden and that is why so many times and you go to malls go to malls and watch the men H don't watch women watch only men and laugh your head off you find people respectable people walking decent people married people and the minute they hear the high heel sound click clck click clck immediately you find heads turning it might be a man wearing a high heel but the sound itself ignites something so Subhan Allah Shan Works in strange ways his job is to tempt you the prophet Alat went further to forbid women from wearing perfume to non mahs even if coming to the Masjid Abu may Allah be pleased with him saw a woman fully dressed in n and mallah nothing and he found a beautiful smell a beautiful scent coming from her Inc and he asked her where are you going the slave of Allah the almighty where are you going to the Masjid she said yes she he said to her go back and have a full shower because the prophet saidat wasam whoever goes out wearing perfume going to the Masjid Allah would not accept her prayer until she goes back and has a full shower because of that perfume and biologist tells us that they've discovered recently that there is a gland in the in the nose of men that provokes uh uh sexual desire not only that the prophet says whoever that is a woman whoever wears perfume and goes out of her house and passes by men so that they can find the perfume smell she is committing an act of fornication or [Music] adultery imagine and the prophet instructed women when they come to the Masjid to come without any sort of perfume to the Masjid How about if they're going to which is what what is the Masjid the prophet the most beloved piece of land to Allah is the Masjid and the worst and most abhor piece of land to Allah is the as the markets and how do our women go to the markets half a bottle of perfume why what are you doing yes I'm a Muslim I have to show people that Islam is beautiful and Islam smells good yeah but you're doing it on the wrong place you should do this but you don't do it to because this has more uh harm than good and immorality in our community is something we cannot bargain with and that is why the prophet protected the community even if you are leaving the community the prophet says it is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel with without a m so full stop where is she going she's going to visit her parents in our home country is she does she have any mam with her no it's Haram it's forbidden she must not her father is dying it's still Haram you go with her I can't take a vacation send someone from her country to come and pick her up I don't have money she sits her father is dead she sits it is not permissible at all for a woman to travel type for Hajj for Haj which is a pillar of Islam if she doesn't have a m she's Exempted she cannot even if she is the richest woman on earth I'd like to know her maybe I have two slots to go no no I'm just joking even if she was the richest woman on earth she cannot travel without a m and this is the beauty of Islam that she has to be accompanied by someone who would take care of her in the Masid we have to protect the community we have to protect the morality of the Muslims the prophet tells us the worst of the rows of the men is the first huh the last and the worst of the women's role is the first why because Allah wants them to stay as far as possible even in places of of worship now I'm shocked when I go to Islamic quote unquote Gatherings and I'm giving a lecture and I find the women intermingling with men I don't enter such places SE segregate them yeah sh it's a non-muslim country yeah but I'm still Muslim and you're Muslim first of all second of all this is is unacceptable in Islamic societies to have this mixing yeah she do you have any problem with the opposite sex yes I do have a problem with the opposite sex I remember I hope they edit this uh from the lecture about 15 years ago I used to teach in a public school in a high school and whenever we are with the other teachers they start to make fun teachers you know colleagues so one of them once made a comment when there were about 20 teachers in the room and he said yeah you m you you know big uh uh uh practicing people those committed to Islam M mean that you have a long bead and a short tho and preferably a big misak so you he says you you love women and I asked him immediately and you do do you love boys and the guy's face was red yellow blue and you can see steam coming from his ears and I said what's wrong with you if you do not love women you have a problem with your hormones you should see a doctor said oh yeah I didn't mean that okay now you learn your lesson he didn't speak after that so this is a problem nowadays the issue of Morality In a Muslim Community nowadays our stands the way we look at these things has changed drastically people are so engaged in these Haram things knowingly or unknowingly and they find a problem because everyone watches movies TVs if you tell someone a lowering the Gaze is a must he laughs at you yeah yeah yeah lowering the Gaze in the street in the in the office but watching TV why is it wrong I cannot touch it what a lot of the brothers say I cannot touch it so what's wrong in that they said okay watch pornography no porography is Haram why is it haram if you cannot touch it said no no no this is okay where is the line showing the th is okay Mal wearing a thong is okay where is the line where we say no this is Haram it is all Haram Allah tells you to lower the Gaze whether on TV or on the street if you look at the Muslims they're shaking hands with non mams they're chatting They're laughing they are uh uh having this affection towards the opposite sex and you if you tell them this is Haram what will they tell you this is honest and pure friendship is there anything honest and pure between a wolf and a sheep when I see a wolf and a sheep walking together and I say that the wolf stay away from the Sheep honest he's my buddy we're going training what do we what do I tell him there isn't anything such as that if you look even at the one of the strongest and most advanced countries in the world the president who had a beautiful wife cheated her with an inan who was half his age working in his office cheated her and a big Scandal was spread yeah this where is the friendship it was a friendship only cigars but again this is Haram and this what happens in all communities expand a little bit everybody has almost everybody not all they have Facebooks they have twitters and if you go to Facebook as as some of the brothers said it's not Facebook it's face hell it is not Facebook it is face hell because you see so many things and I get i i i in the beginning I said it is Haram to use Facebook recently a year maybe a little bit less or more I started my page just to post things that I feel that people would benefit from but sometimes Shan comes you I have aan as well he's he knows how to trick me he he's good but inshallah Allah will protect us all from his Temptations he comes to me and say look at the profile of this person or that person wah you'll be shocked I was I I visited one of my Maham one of my Maham relatives and I visited her uh uh how do you call it page and I went into the um photo gallery I was shocked I was embarrassed and may Allah have forgiveness on all of us of the photos of the premixing of the liquor of the parties the Christmas 2010 New Year one of my mahs of course not living in Saudi Arabia so this happens some of the brothers gives me an advice so he say you've said is wrong and and this is wrong fatwa and it's your opinion so I click the brother's page and I find movies this and this and this and this and this a big list songs and albums actors actresses mallah and nothing and at the end I love Islam and a picture of of mus of a Quran this is showing the people who you are what you are and Allah has concealed this and you are exposing it so they're having this communication this friendship it's pure and honest friendship there isn't anything as pure and honest friendship so if you look at the Muslims the perfumes the fashion the where things they wear if you look at some of the men I've seen youth going in shorts into malls into public places you like your sister to watch men wearing these things on the street don't you have any modesty in you I've seen sisters wearinga or a jilbab but actually it looks like a nightingale is so tight at the waist exposing everything can be exposed this is not permissible as for a Muslim where is your morality where is your Dean where is your mod y okay where is the husband where is the brother why aren't they supervising all of this so now people are in a dilemma she we've been living like this for our entire life what to do you have only one option go back to the Quran and Sunnah then you get people saying well this is too difficult this means I have to compromise 80% of my life no no no we have alhamdulillah a TV set and we have remote controls let's go into the Islamic sites and see one of the shakes and get the fatwa that suit us and this is called fatwa shopping you take your cart and go to supermarket this is a shampoo this is a conditioner this is three in one oh Allah this is good I'm going to take this one you go to the sh fatwa shopping open this Satellite Channel or Internet site sh so and so doctor show and show says it's okay to shake hands with women as long as your heart is pure okay she so and so another one says it's okay to travel as long as you are in the company of trustworthy people are you going to interview those other passengers to know who's trustworthy and who's not no they look okay travel bah Sheik so and so says that watching movies and TV uh programs is permissible because it draws you closer to Allah when you see the rapist is being uh uh put in jail for S years this is justice justice I'm watching the raping and and and the the the things that are not uh permissible for me to watch and I'm getting Shan playing in my mind and you say that's getting me closer to Allah W if the Quran and the Sunnah did not get you closer to Allah nothing will everything else would draw you further away from from Allah so you have you have So-Cal and people that come and make things Halal Halal Halal Halal you'll end up following them into hell only follow the Quran and the Sunnah the authentic Sunnah once you do this you are in safe hand so she now how can we change there are a number of steps the first that always comes as a priority to all of us and very rarely you will find someone doing this it is extremely important for you as a Muslim to know who you are worshiping who are you worshiping Allah do you have doubts no what names and attributes of Allah do you know I'll give you an A4 paper and list down the names of Allah and the [Music] meanings out of names uh Jabar the best you will do is 20 the best you'll do and even if I tell you what's the meaning of you will not know maybe you'll give me the translation but you will not know how to worship Allah through this name if I tell you Jabar you said Almighty that all that is all no also Jabar comes in the meaning of the one who conceals your sins and forgives them it's like when you break a bone you will make for who amends your shortcomings and conceals it if I tell you what's the meaning of a is it the name of Allah matin is it the name of Allah you don't not know Allah and that is why when you pray you don't feel the connection [Music] alhamdulillah what did you do you are not contemplating you're not pondering on the beautiful names of Allah that's why when you sayd this word fills the universe in this life and in the Hereafter when you praise Allah not only that Allah answers you and says my servant has praised me Allah says my servant has complimented [Music] me Allah says my servant has glorified me when you read the Quran when you read the the Salah when you find this communication between you and Allah when you know Allah by his beautiful names and and and attributes only then you will think twice before sinning because I know that he [Music] is the all watching and the all hearing so whenever I want to say something he's going to record itel I'm not going to say it whenever I want to look at something this woman is beautiful I I have to look no you don't because Allah is watching over you okay and so many times our neglect our neglect of Allah's watching over us because we do not know Allah but if someone tells you that's a beautiful woman and you want to look and you see coming what would you do while you're looking down saying I'm taking my chance to look at that beautiful woman why because I don't know Allah we have this ignorance of who Allah subhana wa ta'ala is so I call all of my brothers and sisters study the beautiful names and attributes of Allah even if you do this once a day the maximum you can collect is 99 if not less because the Hadith in tery is not authentic the one you always see on masjids it's not authentic the names but the majority of it is so study it once a day and teach it to your children let them grow knowing who they are worshiping and they would feel the love to Allah not only the fear we teach our children only fear Allah he'll throw you in hell he will punish you he will cut you into pieces he no Allah has beautiful names and attributes that can make you hope and wish and love Allah also you have to uh ward off evil thoughts so to protect your Chastity and to preserve the morality in the community whenever you have bad thoughts don't go to your bed and grab the pillow and start thinking no whenever you have these thoughts Ward them off do something useful do something that would draw you closer to Allah though Allah will not hold you accountable for what goes into your mind but this will corrupt your heart Allah's generosity subhah Allah would not hold us accountable for what we think of only the things that we talk about or act upon other than that Allah has forgiven that those who have a problem with these thoughts should get married as soon as possible and the prophet advised those youngsters to marry and if they're unable to marry they should fast now is it is the problem for men or for youngsters to marry nowadays is it is it difficult the brothers say yes the brothers say no it's an issue of dispute among Scholars alhamdulillah whenever you have a problem you ever ask a question what's your ruling on this say it's an issue of dispute among Scholars and you will always be in right it's it's an issue for youngsters to marry someone who is in their age but if there was a Youngster if there was a a 21 or 22 years years of age who is unable to marry wouldn't he be able to find someone who's 50 years old lady that would marry him will he find someone definitely yes you'll find a lot of women who are over their 40s and wanting to get married and nobody is interested if a woman is 40 years of age who will propose to her 75 80 years of age and this guy's expired date has run out and he has to be recycled so nobody will propose to a 40 or 50 years of age the prophet when he was 25 he married Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her with her and who was older than he was she was 40 45 years of age so there's no problem if you want to protect your chesti don't start putting conditions I'd like my wife to be this high in this color in this uh age and this no no no you want to stay away from Haram marry anyone that is available and Allah will protect you if not then fast among the things that would protect your morality and your Chastity is staying away from Bad Company your friends are the first to draw you to Haram look at your roommate look at your colleagues at work what do they always tell you come on be a man come on make a change just one night stand let's go and do this let's do that and they usually call people to sin stay away from those choose those who always come to the Masjid choose those who always accompany you to uh uh Quran circles or Circles of knowledge because these companionship inshallah will take you to Paradise stay away from places of Temptation in Saudi the youth usually you find them in malls why shopping yes but different type of shopping there are the Wolves looking at the Sheep nowadays even the girls are more yeah dangerous than the boys now the the the Sheep are the boys huh and the girls are the Wolves themselves by the way they dress by the way they look and you know it's intimidating I go into a mall and I see these girls looking at me and I say better wear the hij they have no shame they're so you know upcoming forthcoming that I feel scared so you stay away from these places stay away from websites from the internet if you feel that okay I'm going to answer one email and this drags you to 6 hours of browsing when you open YouTube there is the rable YouTube and you find so many Clips on the side this looks nice and this looks nice and this looks nice and you keep on doing for six 7 hours no there is I think a link for safe Islamic YouTube where you will not find this you can make it in your browser whenever you open a good clip you will not find the things on the side you should use this stay away from TV the worst companion it does brainwash television brainwashes you now we as Muslims we range from China Indonesia up East until the United States of America down West in between if you go to Africa you'll find a black man thinking of a black woman to be the most beautiful thing on earth right if you go to Indonesia or to China or to Malaysia you will find the people there looking at the women in their country to be the most gorgeous and beautiful and if you go to America it's the same thing nowadays with the TV with the media it's all blending now the beauty standards is what you see in movies what you see on models what if you can call them models it's

hair is Curly about the color I'm dark you'll end up with a good list but if you make this dream girl list know that she also is thinking of a night in shining armor try your level best to spend your time in beneficial things this takes Shan away from you this kills shatan when you spend your time doing beneficial things like acquiring knowledge like going through the SE of the Prophet Alat W the more you read the the more your heart is softened and the more closer you get to Allah I ask people when took place did the prophet had something I know and we should go back to reference books you don't know if we ask you about the names of the 10 Heavenly bound to Jenna uh B is not one of them but he's in Jenna yes he's in Jenna but he's not one of the 10 one says AMU what is this this said yeah yeah but they used to nickname [Music] himu You' be shocked but if you tell someone Manchester United who is their goaler Macy or Missi or whatever his name the football everybody tells you everything about him but when it comes to the prophet his companions we don't have any knowledge no go and study and you'll find that your heart is mashallah softened and that you are closer to Allah and finally one of the greatest means of helping you avoid these Temptations is to remember Paradise everything you see is nothing compared to what's in Paradise so if you see someone you admire her beauty what is the beauty of the women in Paradise the prophet says if her head scarf falls on Earth it will fill it up with perfume the whole universe the whole earth imagine that yeah how far can this smell go if I put the best perfume to the end of the Masjid the your woman your wife in Jenna if her head car falls on Earth it will fill the whole earth with perfume if she overlooks the prophet tells us if she just looks at the people of Earth the whole Earth would be lit with light because of her beauty this is one and the sisters are saying okay what about us it's the same thing the men are 100 foot tall men and they're 33 years of age and by the way they don't have beards huh so those who are struggling with beards in Jenna they will not have any beards alhamdulillah what ah finally yeah yeah wait wait wait it's few years and you will reach inshallah and the men will be so strong so beautiful so handsome that we pray to Allah that he admits us to Jenna so whenever you find these Temptations always think of what awaits you in Jenna once you're patient once you're tolerant once you're abiding by the Quran and may Allah make us among those who are admitted to Jenna and may Allah subh preserves our Chastity and morality and helps us to make our community an Islamic community based on the Quran"
