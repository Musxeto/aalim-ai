  "transcript": "she I also follow and believe the opinion that even a woman is fully covered she's not allowed to click or upload photos on social media but I sometimes watch the videos of nikab influencers some videos are beneficial some are normal like their daily blogs what they eat or what they do am I sinful for watching their videos the answer is as long as what you're watching is halal and the content is halal you watching another woman whether she's n or uncovering her face or even not wearing the hijab totally so so there is no sin on you watching another woman because she's from the same gender and there is no exposed that you're supposed to lower your gaze if the content is beneficial this is fine"
