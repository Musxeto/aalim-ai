  "transcript": "symbol says my father died a few days back and there are people who tell my mom that she cannot go to a place where the sky is visible and also cannot use mobile phone as there are men's photos or videos on social media and she cannot watch TV are these restrictions correct the answer is no and we pray for your father forgiveness may Allah forgive his sins and expand his grave and fill it up with fragrances of paradise a widow who is your mom must mourn her husband for four months and 10 days and mourning the deceased husband is by staying in her house which she used to live with her husband in the entire time not Adorn herself not wear perfumes not go out unless it is an a necessity or a huge need is there for such a thing and she remains there for 4 months and 10 days and that's it she could go to the roof and sunbathe if she wants the claim that she has she's not permitted to see the sky or where the sky is visible is totally bogus this is not part of Islam the claim that she's unable she's not allowed to watch TV or see the photos of men is totally unheard of yes she's not allowed to do something Haram to watch movies to listen to music to see in inappropriate photographs yeah this is Haram whether she's mourning her husband or not of course when she's mourning it is even worse but she can watch TV Halal things she can watch lectures of sh and learn her religion she can watch the news she can do things that are normal people do when it is halal as for uh not wearing perfume or adorning herself this is a given and she has to do this part as part of mourning her husband and Allah Asel Knows Best"
