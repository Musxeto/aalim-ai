  "title": "She was forced to get married, she ran away with her boyfriend & married, can she be accused of zina",
  "transcript": "she says that there is this girl in India whom her uncle tried to forcefully get her married and we all know that this is totally prohibited and the marriage is invalid the uncle has no power the brother has no power her son has no power in forcing her to get married to anyone so when everybody in the family stood against her she ran away with her ex-boyfriend or with her current boyfriend I don't know and they got married and now she was she's disowned by the whole family none of them want to see her they're accusing her of Zena and um Ahmed says are they allowed to accuse her of Zena when they don't have any evidence first of all what she had done is wrong running away and marrying someone against the will of her family her guardian is definitely prohibited and the marriage is invalid but due to the fact that they are in India which is a predominantly hanfi School hanfi uh uh country the law there allows a woman to marry against or let me rephrase that it allows a woman to marry without a guardian and if she's a devout hanfi follower and her husband is a devout hanifi follower and they were not involved in Anye premarital sexual intercourse and they got married in an Islamic court or an Islamic Center then the marriage is valid secondly can they accuse her of Zena the answer is no and accusing her of Zena requ four male Witnesses graphically describing what they had seen of a sexual intercourse taking place but if they accuse her of this on the account that they believed that the marriage contract was invalid so their marriage is invalid and they're living in a state of Zena this might be a dubious area that each one has his own uh opinion and view of it she must try her level best to rectify this issue and try to explain to them if she can if she cannot then may Allah make things easy for her"
