  "transcript": "if there was such a Dua our Prophet would have said it and used it the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam lived with his beloved Uncle for almost 50 years he lived with Abu Talib and the only man who stood by the prophet and defended him was Abu Talib but he did not die on Islam he was on his dying bed and the prophet says to him Prophet Uncle please just say one word I will use it on the day of judgment to intercede for you to go to Jannah and his uncle knows he's telling the truth he believes that his nephew is telling the truth and he is the messenger of Allah but he could not say it and he died upon so if there was such a dura the prophet would have used it make Dua by the way you know the great companion his mother was kaffir every time he goes to his mother she insults the prophet Allah says bad things about Islam and he comes to the prophet weeping crying and the prophet says what's wrong he says my mother she's saying bad words and she's not accepting Islam so the prophet makes Dua oh Allah bring her to Islam he goes to his mom and he she he hears his mom saying wait wait don't enter she was taking a shower when he comes in she says she accepted Islam so don't ever give up trust Allah make to our Institute every time you make Salah make Dua and bring my mother to Islam and inshallah I'm confident I will get a call from you soon accepted Islam all right"
