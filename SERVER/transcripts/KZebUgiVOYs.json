  "title": "Handling books in library, might contain kufr or haram books, is my job halal #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um she I wanted to ask um I work in a library and I work as assistant so if someone brings books or returns them I put them back on the shelf and that's my task but the issue is um the books that are returned some of them are kufur contain kufur or shik or they have like improper pictures on them of women uncovered so my question is I try to I don't touch those books and I return only the Halal books and I leave them leave the rest of them for other people to manage them am I right in doing this because I don't know if it's am I sinful for like but this job generally speaking a library contains lots and lots of books maybe 95% of them are Halal and there are a or there is a portion of maybe 5% give or take that it contain Haram so such books that contain Haram ideally you should not deal with them but if there is no one to take care of it other than you in this case I pray to Allah that that would be negligible percentage in the amount of good that you're doing and you would not be sinful for returning them back on the shelves where they're supposed to be because sometimes even kufur books can be a reference for Muslims someone who's doing a thesis on comparative religion is obliged to look into these books to detect The Faults and to make a paper explaining to the masses how false and fabricated such books are so he does need references and these references are the ones that you putting back on the shelves so if there's no one else to do this job you inshallah can do it and Allah Knows Best"
