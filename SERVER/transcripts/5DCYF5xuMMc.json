  "title": "Permissible 2 eat alligator (crocodile) meat? Bags, belts.. made from crocodile skin Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is is it permissible to eat crocodile just like allah you can eat it before it eats you okay so farad says it's permit is it permissible to eat crocodiles or alligators i i think there is a difference biologically between the two one is in in in florida one in africa i don't know anyhow what's the ruling on eating gators meat crocodile alligators it's an issue of dispute those who say it's permissible look at it as a creature of the sea what do we mean by a creature of the sea any creature that lives in water whether it's an ocean or sea or a river or a lake this is a creature of the sea and it is permissible to eat without slaughtering like fish like uh um all types of fish ester causes lobsters etc those who look at it being an amphibious animal that has teeth they consider these teeth to be type of the canines that are prohibited which the prophet islam prohibited us to eat anything that has teeth and claws among the birds but scholars said that the teeth that we are prohibited to eat the animals are referring to land animals not to sea creatures so for us a white shark has teeth and it eats meat but it's 100 halal because it lives in the sea so it's a different it's a difference of opinion among scholars whether it is permissible to eat it or not and therefore i believe personally and i'm inclined personally that it is not permissible to eat just to be on the safe side but it is permissible to use its leather so if there is a shoe made of gator or or a crocodile skin this is permissible if it is tanned because the difference of opinion as for the meat as i said hopefully that it doesn't eat you first"
