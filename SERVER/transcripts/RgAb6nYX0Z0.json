  "transcript": "without the proper environment you're lost and this is why you have Dr Jackal Mr Hyde personality in the midh like the brother and few weeks later it's exactly the same but you have to be consistent and imagine chapter 18 verse 28 surahi verse 28 Allah addressed is the prophet not us he's saying this to Muhammad three commands be patient you yourself with those for the sake of Allah who call Allah in the morning in the evening so number one you have to be patient with them stay with them stick with them hang out with them go to play badminton with them this is what you should choose go to your contact list how many do you have 2,000 in my case how many righteous Muslims among them 1,999 no no this is baloney no maybe one or two why because this is life they're boring when you sit with them fear Allah you will go to Hell Fire Allah says drink with your right don't drink with your left what is this everything they're telling me is to do this and not to do that so I don't tend to go with them I'd like people to come and share with me the latest uh uh Game of Throne on Netflix season number 10 what don't know so this is what I want so number one number two second command do not look elsewhere wanting the adornment and the Glamorous things in dun those practicing Muslims they drive what Patron what's the car called here Patron proton proton proton proton proton Patron is a gas station anyhow yeah you need a gas station to fill up your car so I need people with BMWs with Teslas with Ferraris with Lamborghinis those I want to accompany not those with Hyundai and and and the likes Allah says no stick yourself with them and then the third command do not obey Those whom we made their hearts heedless from our remembrance some people I sit with they don't speak about Quran and Sunnah they speak about Ronaldo Cino they speak about football they speak about sports they speak about movies they speak about shares they speak about stocks they speak about property dun and Miss Universe 2024 what time is it aired this is all what they think about no Allah says don't follow or obey Those whom we made our their hearts heedless from our remembrance and they followed not the Quran the Sunnah their whims and desires their affairs are at loss they don't have blessing in their in Baraka in their time may Allah praise be praised and may Allah bless Dr bil Abu Amina I'm not saying it to his face Allah knows what's in his heart maybe he is worse than us all but but look at the Baraka that Allah put in his life how many books sub this is inshallah in his good scale if he's then it would be very bad for him how many those gu were guided through his university how many University branches he managed to open conferences he attended this is Baraka how much do you have in your life compare Apple to Apple but again this is in Allah's hands I not praising him in he's not you mallah his head is not becoming like a balloon and because him him and I we all know ourselves yeah so even if I praise him and I compliment him from today until F it's not going to matter with him because he knows himself more than all of us but I'm talking about becoming a good Muslim it's not about speaking we all speak very well masallah but it's about walking the talk go to my house and ask my wife I will kill you if you ask her ask my children ask my subordinates my drivers My Maids my neighbors if you see that I check old boxes and I walk the talk maybe this is a good sign but if I'm with you a good speaker mashallah motivator and then in my own privacy I don't do it and I'm alone on my own and I sin this shows you that there is a deficiency there is something wrong so if you want to become a good Muslim you have to check all the boxes and at the end of the day you're fearful may Allah accept and Allah may not so you're always in the balance you remember last lecture I did three four months ago the balance between fear and hope so you fear Allah every step of the way because you don't know what Allah will end your life with is it on as or is it on music and movies and at the same same time I'm hopeful not to enter Jenna I'm hopeful to be with Muhammad so this is the balance manage to do this and inshah you will be safe may Allah make me you mash and all of those attending and listening and hearing among those who will be resurrected with the prophet muhmad"
