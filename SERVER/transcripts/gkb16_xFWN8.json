  "transcript": "um I want to ask that um there are some websites on which people teach online so uh in order to be registered as a teacher on those websites it is a requirement uh for uh like to send the managers of the website a video of yourself like giving uh introduction and like telling how you would teach and uh kind of like an interview so um my question is that if a woman wants to like teach on those websites online so is it permissible if she sends them a video of herself but in proper hijab if she is in proper hijab covering her face and body properly totally and they cannot see anything from her for the purpose of teaching females only this is permissible inshallah but if it's for the purpose of teaching men and women no this is not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
