  "transcript": "and what's the ruling on delaying prayer the word delaying prayer is a little bit vague because for men it is mandatory upon them to pray in the masjid the Prophet told the blind man and the hadith is Ansari Muslim and elsewhere do you hear the Adhan the blind man says yes he said you have to respond there is no excuse for you none whatsoever so men have to pray in the masjid if they skip praying in the message for a legitimate reason then they're not sinful yet they must pray within the parameters of the prayer because each prayer has a specific time for it Allah says in the Salah taken a title meaning kitab on Makuta verily that prayer has been prescribed at for the believers at specific timings so fajar when the break of dawn is seen and observed begins and it ends when the Sun begins to rise if you delay it 15 minutes before the sunrise is 10 minutes before the Sun rises if you complete your prayer before this before the Sun rises such a delay is makrooh but your prayer is valid if you delay it until the Sun begins to rise then your sinful and your prayer is invalid likewise with all the you can from the Adhan until just before the event of a sir of the majority of Muslims not of the hanafis the Hanafi timings of a sir is wrong but the majority of the Muslims are following the Sunnah of the Prophet areso salam and the timing is related to the shade so ask the us of time begins when the shade of an erected object is equal to its length this is the majority of scholars this is what the Prophet as Salam taught us the Hanafy mother says no when it's twice the length and this is wrong so if you delay it a little bit before the a van and prayed before that I've done such a delay is permissible and it is it is not how long for you and you go on with the other prayers of time but if you pray it after the time of the prayer do was over then you are sinful and it is a major sin it's not something to be taken lightly it is a major sin it causes the heart to be hardened and it might be sealed because of such neglect of negligence of Prayer"
