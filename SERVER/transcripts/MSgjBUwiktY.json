  "transcript": "i just want to know like you know the people residing in like um in india and such places they have uh the um like you know they uh worship uh the graves and all they just go go and they ask the people so like you know when we get the knowledge and when we tell them they just tell uh they just so actually my question is how to just uh connect these people and with what the lead is it what and they are writing this is the correct hadees the people are having knowledge and new people are stopping us from doing this like you know so i just want like how to make them understand so that like you know with all the okay i got your question um kamar there is a difference between convincing people about the innovation of the birthday of the prophet assam or maulit as we know it and between going to dhargas and worshiping the graves and sacrificing to them and visiting pir ali or peer baba or whatever their names are and thinking that they can heal the sick and answer prayers the first one is an innovation the maulit is an innovation the other things i mentioned is kuffar and shirk that takes people out of the fold of islam now how to convince them is through knowledge i know that if you go to india or to pakistan the moment you open your mouth and say that this is innovation or haram or kufaru they would point their fingers they will have you ahabi and this is normal for people of ignorance when they don't have the means to respond academically with knowledge through the quran the sunnah through the actions of the companions that they start to slander you or to point fingers at you and and call you names this is normal weak people do this all the time however if you try to give them da'wah you have to number one master your evidences from the quran and the sunnah so you don't go to them and say baz says they will immediately say though these are from saudi arabia we don't listen to them we don't buy what they're selling but when you say to them allah says in surat zumar that we do not worship them except that they would get us closer to allah and allah considered this and called this as a form of shirk they cannot reply to that because they're worshiping these graves and they're calling upon them and this is kufrin shirk as per the quran so either they believe in the quran or they say no this is not true this is not right and then there will be blatant kafir master your evidence is from the sunnah tell them this is what the prophet said allah whoever wears has committed shirk this is what the prophet said look and then they have to choose whether they follow the prophet salaam or to follow piracy his name is this is how you call people to islam and give them dawah and you have to be tolerant you have to be patient the prophet isaiah was patient and tolerant for 13 years in mecca giving them da'wah while they will not accept it so you have to follow suit and may allah make things easy"
