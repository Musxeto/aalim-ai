  "title": "Are men & women equal in Islam? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the concept of equality is also something that we have a lot of the women and the men thinking that this is a prime concept in islam women and men are equal this is totally an islamic this is totally wrong it's not even logical how can they be equal in islam in the quran allah says clearly and a male is not similar to a female they're different but nowadays people who don't have islamic background people who have never touched the quran or finished it in their lives let alone studied it they come and say no no islam promotes equality between the genders this is not right islam promotes and endorses justice and fairness so a woman has a role that a man cannot do and a man has roles that women cannot do if there was equality then my wife would come to me and say listen i have given you so many children next year you become pregnant i'm going to take the year off because there's no equality in this sense she cannot do the things i can do because allah created her physically and mentally different than he created me so to believe that allah is the fairest of all and the most just and whatever allah decrees is the best is the main road to success a woman is in this life a lesser degree and we have to take this as a fact allah described in the quran the husband to be the master of his wife as in surah yusuf they found her master standing at the door and a boat can only sail with one captain and an airplane can only fly with one captain two captains on board would take the plane down one says go left the other one says go right one says go up rather someone says descend it will crash when we say that a man has the higher degree this is mentioned in the quran as well but in worldly matters in matters of management in matters of guardianship but at the site of allah on the day of judgment they are all equal in the sense of being rewarded for their good deeds and being punished for their sins and bad deeds and being lower than a man's status does not mean that a man does not need her or does not consult her we all know that the prophet islam consulted um selema the mother of the believers in al hudayya in the treaty of hodeidah when he ordered their when he ordered the companions to slaughter their sacrifice and shave their heads so that they can get out of their state of haram because they were prevented from going to mecca they could not believe their eyes or ears and they refused not because they rejected the prophet's instruction they were hoping maybe something would be revealed a an improvement would take place another incident would take place when the prophet talked to um selema and he was angry she told him don't speak to any anyone just go out shave your head and slaughter your sacrifice and you'll see what they'll do so the prophet took her advice not saying to himself she is lower in degree than me and i'm more superior than her on the contrary so the degree is in regards of guardianship in regards of supervision and management and who is to be obeyed at the end of the day and this is why we say that a woman's place is in her home this is where she is mostly productive i know this goes against what many working women believe but this is the islamic stance a productive or a working woman can produce a machine or a device in her factory while a practicing productive muslim woman in her home would produce a whole generation from her home"
