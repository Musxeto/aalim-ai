  "transcript": "thank you our Prophet Allah was the perfect human being and part of being a human being is that you have emotions and the more emotions you have the more of a human being you are the prophet Allah was not someone who was emotionless rather he used to be happy and sad pleased and angry and he used to grieve and feel sorrow as we all do unlike what some of us may think that how can you grieve how can you cry how can you not trust Allah subhanallah as if feeling sorry over something defies your trust and dependence on Allah this is not true these are human emotions that as humans we have to go through but when we are in Paradise all of these negative feelings will disappear by default Allah says about the people of paradise and they will say praise be to Allah who has removed from us all sorrow indeed our Lord is forgiving and appreciative the main cause of grief and sorrow in the life of the Prophet Allah you will find it towards Allah azzawajal in the sense that whatever is not positive at the site of Allah the prophet saws used to feel sorry for that above all when he gives dawah when he calls people to Islam and they are defiant they resist and reject his efforts to get them out of Darkness into the light we usually could care less I give Dao to someone he doesn't respond he insists on being an atheist or agnostic or a Christian I did my due diligence I move on I have no problem no worries not our Prophet Allah and this shows you that our dawah is not sincere and perfect as his This Is Why We are failing and getting the same results as he did listen to what Allah had mentioned in many many verses of the Quran Allah says we know that you o Muhammad sallallahu alaihi are saddened by what they say and indeed they do not call you untruthful but it is the verses of Allah that the wrong doers reject so he's saddened by the rejection Allah also says then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them o Muhammad if they do not believe in this message and out of Sorrow which Allah is telling his Prophet Islam take it easy on yourself don't be depressed don't grieve so much over them so that it may kill you and this is an indication that grief and sorrow may cause a person to die and we see this anxiety panic attacks people who grieve over something and they get a heart attack and they die Allah says to his messenger Allah and whoever has disbelieved let not his disbelief grieve you because you've done your due diligence you've done all what is in your effort to get them out of the darkness to the light they don't want to so it shows you how much love the prophet salallahu had for people that he wanted them to share the goodness that Allah has given him and finally the prophet Allah was addressed by Allah in this beautiful Ayah so do not let yourself perish over them in regret take it easy on yourself Muhammad it shows you the huge responsibility that the prophet sallallahu had on his shoulders to the extent that it could have killed him out of grief and Sadness and Sorrow that they did not accept Islam imagine a battle which took place on the third year of hijrah between the Muslims and the idol worshipers the idol worshipers were three or four times the size of the Muslim Army and one-third of the Muslim Army defected led by the head of the hypocrites and they left the prophet Allah on his own in this battle 70 of the prophets companions were martyred and the prophet Allah was injured and was bleeding so one would suspect that this was the most horrific day the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam had ever witnessed this is what mother Aisha asked the prophet Allah was there any day harder on you than the day of the prophet said yes I encountered a day where I suffered a lot when at the end of my period in Mecca your people had harassed me to the extent I had to flee maca and walk all the way to Taif which is approximately an hour drive on top of a mountain it's a resort for the people of Mecca and the people of Jeddah like us in summer we go there because the weather is finer and colder so the prophet walked all the way and he displayed himself to ebene and they were the dignitaries of Taif of takif he displayed himself in the sense that he made his pitch this is who I am I am the Messenger of Allah listen to the Quran listen to my presentation and when they did not accept him not only that they accused him of lying not only that they ordered their slaves and young boys to Stone the prophet Islam with pebbles that made his feet bleed he said I went down the mountain and I was absent-minded I could not recollect anything I was so this depressed and sad because of the way they had treated me I came back to my conscience and I was awakened at carnival imagine walking down for three four hours not remembering anything totally blinded because of this grief and jibril came to me and said to me o Muhammad this is the Angel of the mountains first time to descend by the instruction of Allah and the angel of the mountains said to him o Muhammad Allah azzawajal had heard what your people said to you and had done to you and I am the angel of the mountains so I'm at your command if you wish I could collapse the two big mountains on their heads and annihilate them all in this crucial moment in the midst of this depression and grief and sorrow over how they treated him said no do not do that I am hopeful and Wishful that Allah would extract from their offspring children and Men who would testify that there is no God worthy of being worshiped other than him look at this optimism look at this positivity even in the darkest moments of his life his grief would not make him do irrational decisions or take irrational decisions he always thought of the welfare and the goodness of his people he wanted goodness for all of humanity yet he would still have this human emotion of sorrow and grief imagine his beloved Uncle Abu Talib who took care of him for over 40 years shielded him protected him gave him a safe haven and prevented the idol worshipers from attacking him the prophet relentlessly tried his level best that he accepts Islam but it was Allah's will when he died he was grieved by it Allah the almighty comforted him by saying indeed o Muhammad you do not guide whom you like but Allah guides whom he Wills full stop end of sorrow and grief yes I love my uncle but if this is the will of Allah there is nothing I could do and this is an Ayah we should all Ponder upon you watching me you're Muslim with the grace of Allah the majority of you are Muslims by birth and there are those whom Allah guided them to revert to Islam you are the chosen one Allah has given you this beautiful religion on a plate of gold or silver you should be grateful and show your gratitude and remain steadfast on Islam when you look at those whom Allah did not will to guide the poor atheists agnostics Jews and Christians Idol worshipers Hindus and the likes the Buddhists Allah did not will to guide them and they will end up in Hell Fire they chose they had everything in front of them they had the evidences to prove to them that Islam is the religion of Allah they turn their back they Shrugged their shoulders said not interested not convinced and they will pay dearly with depression in this life and with Hellfire on the here in the hereafter as for you what did you do to show your gratitude to Allah have you prayed Fajr this morning in the Masjid are you observing your fast as Allah wanted you to are you giving in charity are you reciting the Quran are you doing your car are you committed to Islam as Allah wants you to if yes then this is the grace of Allah give over the betrayals of the disbelievers the idol worshipers Anna subnautic says that the tribes of real the Quan and osaya they're all from banil hyan from Jose they asked the prophet Allah to send a convoy with them to teach them about Islam so the prophet sent 70 of the ansar and they were known to be the Quran the reciters of the Quran and they used to recite the Quran and at night they used to study it and pray night prayer and learn and daytime they used to bring water and put it in the Masjid and chopped for a firewood and sell it and buy food and give it to the poor so they were active in their community so the prophet sent to them to these people in the middle of Arabia a H may Allah be pleased with him was the uncle the paternal of the maternal Uncle of Annas of pneumatic and they were all killed and assassinated in an act of betrayal and the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam was not seen grieving in sorrow over an exhibition more than he greeted for them to the extent that he kept making Dua in kunut in the five daily prayers for a whole month against these tribes but after one month the command came from Allah to refrain this is not to you leave it as it is he grieved over the martyrdom of three of his beloved companions in the battle of mutta where three thousand Muslims went to fight over a hundred thousand troops of the byzantians three thousand against a hundred thousand and some say more than that so the three leaders of the army in succession were martyred the son of the Prophet Assam in adoption before it was abolished he was martyred then his cousin appointed after him to be the leader if anything would happen to Zaid Jaffer he's the prophet's cousin and the brother of Ali and he was martyred after two of his arms were amputated during battle and this is why he's seen in Paradise having two wings flying wherever he wants as a martyr after that the third in concession was Abdullah the poet of the Prophet Allah they were all martyred and companions felt that there will be defeated until Khalid may Allah be pleased with them took the flag led the Army and managed to retreat by defeating the army of the enemy thinking that they had reinforcement the prophet was with his companions when all of a sudden his face changed said I could see from the crack of the door when the prophet was with his companions signs of grief and sorrow over his face over the demise of History beloved Companions and this Hadith shows that showing and expressing your grief if a Calamity befolds upon you does not take you out of those who trust and rely on Allah as long as there is content in your heart and finally the prophet also grieved immensely when his uncle Hamza IBN Abdullah the master and leader of Martyrs was martyred in the battle of uhud when the prophet salallahu on the day of passed by women from the tribe of Beni Abdul Asheville weeping and Mourning their Marchers in uh the prophet looked at them with sorrow and said Hamza has no one to weep over him meaning these women are Weeping their dead but my uncle Hamza has no one to weep over him so the women of the ansar heard this and they started weeping over Hamza as a sign of condolence as a sign of sharing the grief with the prophet Islam when the prophet learned about this he told them stop and refrain it is not permissible to mourn and wail rather it is not permissible to wail and weep with a sound over someone who has died after today there are many incidents where the Prophet saws expressed his grief and sorrow if we know that seven of his own offspring free of his sons and three of his daughters died in his lifetime and the seventh daughter Fatima he gave her the Glad Tiding on his deathbed that she will catch up with him after six months what kind of grief you could imagine be in this huge big heart of someone like the prophet Allah with all these calamities with all these problems around him and the challenges if any one of us would have had one percent of what he had suffered wallahi we would have died years and years ago but not the prophet Allah who was content with Allah's decree and who only relied trusted and depended upon Allah alone"
