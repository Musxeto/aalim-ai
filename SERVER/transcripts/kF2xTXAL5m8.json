  "transcript": "al Hamidi says if the imam leads the prayer and he's reading quran in wrong pronunciation will it affect the prayer of the followers wrong reading of quran can still be rewarded what is the Delisle in quran or hadith shukran first of all making a mistake in your recitation this can be rewarded if this is the best of your ability so whoever reads the Quran and finds it difficult because he is not fluent in Arabic and he's doing his best but it's difficult to distinguish between letters and me he may repeat the words three four five times until he pronounces it well and maybe he does not allow would reward him twice once for reciting the Quran and second for doing his best for striving to do it now an imam must not come forward unless he knows how to recite the quran we find many people are so eager to lead for the sake of leading and this is wrong a true Muslim feels the weight of the responsibility and if he's not up to it he does not come forward but what is the ruling on us who already found someone leading the prayer if he makes mistakes in the fatiha itself which is a pillar and such mistakes are avoidable he can avoid them but he doesn't or the meaning changes then the prayer is invalid you cannot pray behind him if someone says surah Levine and I'm to Ally him the ayah says addressing Allah Allah Tala Dina and I'm tapped that you have favored and blessed but if I change it into and I'm to which means I am the one who's favoring and blessing this totally distorts the meaning and the prayer is invalid and if someone is capable of saying levena but out of laziness he says Allah zina then again he has to rectify it or this would invalidate his prayer if the mistakes are elsewhere so the pillory was fine yet there are mistakes in other sewers in this case these mistakes are forgiven yet people of the Masjid the community should appoint someone should insist on having someone who knows how to accept ibly recite the Quran because this is their leader this is their front that they must choose the very best"
