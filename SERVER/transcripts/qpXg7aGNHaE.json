  "transcript": "my question is that I have been missing my f prayer lately a lot and also there are many things that I did which I'm not happy of and I'm remorseful for it so I want to um I know they're doing Sal which is of two ra um can I do it like for example today night uh the third last of the night like ra foring my and also to Raa for something else and TOA for something and so on like that or do I have to wait another day to do the other first of all when a person sins it is recommended for them to pray two ra asking Allah for repentance normal two Ras nothing special to be said not a special format to be offered just random two raas with the intention of seeking Allah's forgiveness and repenting do I have to offer these two rakas for every single sin the answer is no so if you had committed many sins and now you want to repent from them all these two rakas suffice for all of their previous sins you don't have to go into specifying every sin with a specific prayer for repentance and I hope this answers your question inshallah"
