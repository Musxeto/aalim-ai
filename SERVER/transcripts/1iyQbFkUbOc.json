  "transcript": "she loved my neighbor him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen was salatu salam ala rasulillah he was Ali he was happy he won on wada I'm back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith 159 we need someone to read it for us yes brother uma Thea reported the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam came to us when we were bathing his daughter and he told us wash off with water and with the leaves of load three three or five times or more than that if you think fit and you can put camper or some of the camphor in the last washing then inform me when you have finished so when we had finished we informed him and he gave to us his own garment saying put it next to her body Muslim and another narration and in another narration or seven he said begin with her right side and with the place of Voodoo whom athenia said and we played it her hair into three Braves Shakalaka now washing the dead the procedure usually is the same first of all you try your level best to take off the clothes without tearing them why so that we can have someone use the clothes instead of tearing the shirts tearing the trousers tearing everything we can wash them and give them to the poor so they can use it sometimes it is difficult or impossible as in the case of injuries as in the case of burns so you have to have scissors and you cut them off after that while doing this you have to make sure that the aura is covered and the aura the part of the body that is not allowed for people to see for men it's from the navel to the knees and for women it is from below the neck to the knees so women cannot see the breasts of other women they cannot see the bareback of other women this is not permissible in Islam so we cover the hour and then scholars say that we look if the nails are long we clipped them for men if they're mustache is long we trim it and the first thing that usually would be recommended to do is that you make the dead person the corpse sit halfway so you bring him from under his neck make him sit halfway and then gently press over his stomach while pouring a lot of water on the private parts why is that because if the bladder is full if the stomach has some ways that it want to release we won't want it to release it while carrying the funeral to the prayer hall or two the message it or to the burial so we must try our best to purify the body so by gently pressing on the stomach you know that all the muscles are loose so anything that is ready to go it will go and then scholars say it is recommended that you clean the mouse by a piece of cotton the teeth and the nose the nostrils with a piece of cotton while putting water because you cannot make that person turn the water in his mouth it is not advisable to open his mouth and put water because this would go to his stomach directly so it's only with a wet piece of cotton you do this what about the water what kind of water should i use you use room-temperature water so if it is extremely cold then you use some sort of normal water and if stream lee hot then you use middle type of water you don't use too hot nor too cold and the lote tree or the looters it's a green substance from the leaves made and crushed and so on and this is used as follows we put the amount needed with this much of water and we beat it beat it regularly until foam starts to come out and then we increase water while still beating it until we have a big bucket of water with foam on it this is the way of using it with the water now what do I do with the phone I take the foam and I wash his beard and I wash his head as if it's a form of shampoo this is what's the foam used for one would say okay can we use normal soap and says yes but the sooner is better in following it because siddur gives a special treatment to the skin and some say that it has the characteristic or the feature of repelling insects from coming from the smell or I don't know either way we are recommended to follow the Sunnah but if you don't by washing the disease with soap does the job the Prophet instructed amatya to use sidim afterwards the prophet said allah√≠s alot was salaam that you wash her 35 in another narration seven times or even more some scholars say no you have to restrict 27 and the prophets say that is awesome begin with the right hand side and with the places of Voodoo which made some scholars say that the first thing you begin with is offering would give that seized would do and this is similar to our normal what to our normal wasn't the sooner for us is to make wudu then make law so that with the disease is the same thing you offer will do you wash the right hand side and then the wife on the head the face and the whole thing in sequence after that after you wash or you make the will do you watch the entire body now how do I wash the entire body scholars say that you have a piece of cloth that you wrap around your hand and preferably it is your left hand because you're going to clean the private parts but you do this from underneath the cloth that is covering the outer the rest of the body is clear I start by washing the right hand side the shoulders the hips and so on the man is lying on his back so I start with the right hand side and then I put the right leg over the left leg the legs are like this I put his right leg on the left leg why so that when i turn the body it turns quickly because i have to turn the body to the left side so I can wash the back right side of the deceased and if the legs are like this if you try to move him it will not move so that's why you have to bring the leg over the following or the second leg he has only two legs so you'll have to put the leg on the other one and turn him on the left side and then wash the back side the right side to the legs turn them back again put the left and the right and push them over and this is one wash during which I clean from underneath the garment the private parts the front and the back to ensure that it is clean and I put excessive amount of water so that if anything comes out it goes with the water and I don't see it if you use little amounts of water and you see things maybe this would make you feel a little bit disgusted maybe and it is forbidden completely to tell anyone of what you see you're not allowed to go out and say well I so so much filth and so much dirt this guy was thinking stock for law to belay this is something that you have to conceal and if you disclose it Allah will punish you for it and if you conceal it Allah will forgive you how many times 40 times Allah forgive you 40 times so imagine how much reward you are getting and I wash him once I do the same process twice I do the same process three times if I still while washing see something coming out I do what five times again I do seven times some scholars say after the seventh that is it you don't do anything but what to do if there is still some nuh jess has some impurity coming out old scholars used to say that you have to put something that blocks the passage and whether it is mud or it is some form of cement or what some form of plasters that would stop this nowadays we have diapers so scholars always get a diapers ready so if Natasha is still coming out after 7th time of washings and you put a diaper and you seal it tightly and that is it what to do afterwards you dry the body and then you either and this is the most likely way of doing it now we're washing the body on a wooden surface which has holes in it so that it allows the water to it can anything can do nowadays in new places for washing the bodies specially designed for that they have big platforms that are made from marbles with special holdings in it and it looks like a kitchen when you see it it looks as if it's a kitchen but actually it has all the sprays necessary for the water and all the necessary tools available makes it clean makes it easy the drainage is also clean and their special clothes that you put on for hygienic purposes the place is wet we dry the disease with a towel and in another location we spread the three sheets prophet alayhi salam he was himself shrouded and three white sir whole meaning either referring to a city or a village in Yemen where they used to make these types of white cotton clothes or it means to be white and pure and this is his Sunnah so we bring three pieces of clothes now one would say I'm a rich man actually I am on the top 10 of Forbes list of richest men in the world and when you say I hey what are you doing here if you are well hypothetically speaking I am NOT hamdillah and I wish and pray to Allah that I will never be because the more money you have the more sins you gain generally speaking so if I we're on the top list of these 10 richest men can I for example by something that is expensive a designers clothes for example a shroud to be shrouded in no it has to be clean and it has to be normal signs of extravagant while doing this would only add to your sins we have a short break stay tuned inshallah will be assalamu alaikum and welcome back so we put the shroud we carry the deceased and put him in the shrouds any way of shouting him special scholars sake we in Arabia this is what we do we put the first route before we bring the disease and we put a lot of perfume and we put a lot of al-hattal which is a type of perfume that you break and it's a substance and we put different kinds of root of what something that is presentable then we put the other a shroud and would do the same then we put the other third one and we put the same so the full layer three layers are all perfumed you remember that instance we also can do before doing it then we bring the decision we put him and before shouting him we bring a bottle of perfume and we put in a cotton in the places where he used to prostrate on so we put a lot extensive on his palms on his knees on his feet and on his forehead and nose and then we shroud him with the first trout normal one and two and from the top there is a about half a meter from the head and half a meter from the legs why so that we can carry him from it when we put him in the grave we don't hold his feet we hold it from these half a meter long handles if you wish and then we wrap the first layer we wrap the second layer we wrap the third layer and then we put the notch so one at the legs one at the knees one at the waist one at the head one of the arms depending five or six or seven every country differs from the other the most important thing that it is tight that it was not break loose before doing that some scholars if you do not put a diaper you put a big piece of cotton big piece of cotton at the private parts and perfume it as well and you wrap it now for women there is another extra because the profit in this hadith he told them when you finish announce me inform me so they told him and he gave them his azar his lower garment and he told them put it next to her body which means that it makes it now four pieces of shrouds and that is why it's called a say make them Witter and five so one for the waist and they say one is for the head or for the upper body and the other three are your normal three shouts we finished we wrapped the body with the shrouds by this he would be ready for burial now the last we did not mention this the last wash which is the third or the fifth or the seventh we should add to it some comfort we called an Arabic our food and what is this comfort or kafu it is a sort of substance that also gives perfume or sent to the washing and scholars say that it gives the skin and the body stiffness and the stiffness is needed so that it would become easier to carry and so on so we put the perfume and we use these substances as the Prophet sallallahu are you seldom instructed us to do we have some time left I believe but before we going we go to the following hi do we have any questions ok yes brother Salam aleikum Shaikh Salman what if a dead body has a ring in his her hands which we are not able to pull out ring in the head in the hand there is a ring yes and we are not able to pull up well if we are unable to take the ring without harming the body leave it and usually the jurors the Phooka ha refer to a similar incident and they say 'what's the ruling the dead man had teeth made of gold so they say if it is possible to take them if they are removable then you have to take them because this is money and this is part of the inheritance that must be distributed but if it is implanted and removing it would mean that you would have to have a surgery or harm the deceased by doing this you know that the prophet said Alice from breaking the bone of a deceased is like breaking the bone of a living man both are how long so you're not allowed to take this off however scholar said and this is what Shakespeare I mean may Allah have mercy on his soul said on his lectures that you may after six or seven or eight months dig the grave when all the bones and all the flesh has gone and the ring would be loose the teeth the golden teeth would be loose you can collect those and use their money because this is money and it is a waste that it goes to waste so I hope this answers your question yes brother Salam aleikum Salam recently had witnessed a funeral procession and I was witnessing the bureau procedure they before the showering the body they applied some kind of powder and when I go ahead about the same they told me it for the body to decompose as soon as possible so what is the ruling regarding it this is for the body to compose decompose decompose no no no no this is not permissible to apply a substance that would accelerate in decomposing the body this is not permissible you should make it as normal as it is by using the substances that the Prophet told us is awesome to you so this is not permissible check when the body is washed and the aura is still hiding and now we have to move the body from one place to the other on the shroud how do we do that very very simple the process is the piece of cloth covering the outer is wet and it's dirty most likely though we've washed the whole body three five or seven times so what we do is when we finish I told you we dry it with a towel we bring a new fresh towel and we put it on top one man holding it from top and then we take from underneath it the wet piece of cloth so the man now is covered with a towel we take the body with the towel to the first shrouding place the minute we put the first route and the second from underneath we withdraw the towel so now you cannot expose the aura this man is dead but he has his honor and pride and you have to protect this yes brother well the body is being washed what should be the people web array for the funeral should between they should be indulging a seeker redesigning currents what should we drink but well while the body is being washed yes yes while the body is being washed we do not have any prescribed vicar at all so any prescribed ikar would be an innovation so if you are while doing this in yourself say o Allah forgive him a lot it was good but we cannot say to the people before you go you must seek a las forgiveness 50 times and you may say me Allah have mercy on him 21 times we have no prescribed thing to say or to do as such an effort you just wash him without doing any liquor we've stated before that when a man is dying or he dies we should not supplicate except with things that are good because the Angels what do they do they say I mean but as we are washing we do not have any evidence of any supplications or any liquor and of course or any recitation of the Quran and unfortunately a lot of the Muslims believe Eve that reciting the Quran when the people are dying or after the death or in the graveyard it's beneficial and good especially they think that surah yaseen because there is a hadith where it was reported that the Prophet cetera salatu salam a pro an emoticon ya seen the site on those who are dying or on those who had died Surat Yasin but this hadith is not authentic this hadith is weak and those who authenticated they say that it means that when a person is on his dying bed you should recite surah yaseen why because he's alive he's hearing a scene and enya seen there are glad tidings of Jenna Carla a later homie ya allah moon beam Allah for Ali Robbie would you add an amino mukhra mean the man who came to warn his people and ask them to believe the messengers he said I wish that my people know how illogical forgave my sins and gave me reward or etc so when a dying person hears this he has hopes that he will be treated similarly I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah or Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Oh"
