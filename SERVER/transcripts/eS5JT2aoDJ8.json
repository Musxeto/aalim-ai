  "transcript": "schors say that the difference between tud and and night prayer is that has to be preceded by sleeping and this is this appears to be the most authentic opinion having having said that this does not mean if a person offers night prayer before he goes to bed that this is bad the prophet used to do thisam he used to as mother says he used to pray from the beginning of the night in the middle of the night and he ended ended up praying at the end of the night the last third of the night so whatever a Muslim finds it more convenient for him alhamdulillah it is acceptable and Allah knows rest"
