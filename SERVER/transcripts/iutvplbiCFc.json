  "transcript": "foreign do it online going to such tell me why when will you stop compromising your religion if they insist that you come and sing kuffer songs or praise their Idols if they come and say that you have to go into the swimming pool and mix with female students and swim and do this when is it the red line when we say enough is enough this is what you have to address now if your religion is not that strong and you're not steadfast on Islam and everything goes with you that's a different story I'm talking to someone who adheres to Islam's teaching and who would never compromise his religion no matter what I'm talking to someone who would prefer to die rather than compromise his religion this is where you have to make a stand when we start to give in in our religion and compromise this is what leads us to where we are as Muslims in the whole world today when we find that people are willing to sell their lives their beliefs their convictions for few dollars they have no problem in that but when it comes to anything else no we have to stop religion yeah I can say I I can skip prayer for a month no problem inshallah you don't want me to fast Ramadan no problem do you want me to compromise the hijab I'm not a hijabi I'll wear a mini skirt what else so this is where we are because of people's conviction and beliefs but if you are among those who are no wanting to know what to do hold strong to your religion and don't compromise your prayer and Allah Knows Best who do we have next"
