  "transcript": "sayyeda says my question is I heard many times that Allah loves us seventy times more than our mothers Allah holds 70 times more love for us is this true as for the appeal of Allah Sunnah wal Jamaa we believe as mentioned in the Quran and in the authentic Sunna and how Allah described himself that Allah loves so many verses in the Quran that Allah Azza WA JAL loves the righteous loves those who repent loves those who forgive loves so many things Allah loves but Allah Azza WA JAL also hates and abhors disbelief sins acts of transgression shirk and so many things and this is how we worship Allah Azza WA JAL with such a conviction that Allah loves and hates and unless love and hate is different than our love and hate because Allah x' attributes are unlike any of others attributes so Allah's love is different than our love Allah's anger is different than our anger this is something divine this is something that no one shares it with a loss of Hanna wa ta'ala having said that we do not need fabricated hadith to highlight such love and therefore when someone says that Allah loves us seventy times more than a mother loves her child we asked we ask for an authentic hadith the evidence because I can make claims from here till the day of judgement there are baseless but this is not how things work in Islam if I claim something you have all the right to challenge me where'd is where does Allah say that he loves and he hates how do you claim that this is the RP definitional Jamaa no problem we can prove that come and sit with me and I'll show it to you from the books of Allison novel German I'll show it you from the Koran I'll show it to you from the Sunnah it's easy but to come and claim things and simply say Simon Says you have to obey without any proof then this is not how Islam works therefore to my knowledge there is no such hadith of stating that Allah loves us seventy times more than a mother loves her child we know of Allah's mercy in that allah azza wajal created the mercy into a hundred branches or types or levels only one was placed on earth and the 99 was were upheld by allah azza wajal for the day of judgment from this 1% that Allah placed on earth is when a beast uplifts its foot from stepping over its children this is the mercy that we have all over the world it's 1% only so this is as for the mercy of Allah but as for the love I do not know of any authentic hadith"
