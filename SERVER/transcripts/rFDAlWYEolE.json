  "transcript": "[Music] Salar question. He says that uh sometimes I see Muslims who seemingly have nothing to do with Islam or are very far away from the dean. Then I get an a feeling of disgust in my heart against them. Is this considered to be type of arrogance because I'm afraid that in my heart I would think that I am better than them? Yes, you're not supposed to think that you're better than them. But definitely you have to hate and abhore and detest what they're doing these sins. And this is a great thing that a Muslim should balance. The prophet saysam that the tightest knots of Islam or of iman to love in the sake of Allah and to hate in the sake of Allah to have your allegiance for the sake of Allah and to have your enmity in the sake of allahel. This means that if I see a Muslim, I don't 100% go to that Muslim and love him with his uh goods and bads. No, the things that he does in accordance to Islam to the Quran and Sunnah, I love this and I encourage him and I would like to congratulate him for doing this. But his sins when he abandons the Sunnah, I have to hate this. So there can be love and hate in a Muslim in an individual and this balance is a very tricky thing because a lot of the Muslims fail to do this unfortunately they either love all the way even if he is a criminal he's a Muslim he's a relative even if he's a openly sinful person or they hate all the way and even if the guy prays in the first row he does all the good things but because of one single sin that he does we hate him and we ignore him and we backbite him."
