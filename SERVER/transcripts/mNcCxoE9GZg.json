  "transcript": "bismillah r-rahman r-rahim alhamdulillah wa salatu was-salam ala Heidi help Ilana being a muhammad why the early he was happy he remain dear brothers sisters assalamualaikum warahmatullah and welcome to lessons in fill today sha Allah we will begin to study the chapter that deals with hustle and those who are regarded as sexually impure the first hadith has a number of 94 and just as a reminder brother Mustafa can you please tell me what is the name of the book we're studying chapter of hosam well this is a chapter but what about the book session it's the book regarding sexual impurity again what's the title of the book Beluga model no cheating please Islam forbids cheating and if you cheat while acquiring the knowledge then you have a big problem and the prophets allah salem stated that clearly whoever cheats us whoever sheets cheetah's is not among us so Danny don't play with this stuff okay this is a friendly classroom it's a friendly lesson but cheating is unacceptable and it's intolerable we cannot tolerate this because this is our lives this is our community if we cheat in acquiring the knowledge that deals with the Quran and Sunnah then I think we would cheat when we study engineering or medicine and we would cheat when we take an opposer position and we would accept bribes and we would do this and what would cheat on my wife and she was cheating on me and cheating would destroy the community though it's a simple question but again let the brother put the effort and trying to find the answer himself the book is called bu√±uel Moran Fatih who compiled the book and half of the Mahajan osculating up half of even hazier a toss Kalani so the hadith has the number of 94 and a whole read it brother Mohammed go ahead please narrated by abu saeed and hoody a los messenger so allah alayhi wasalam said the water of the hose is due to the water of sexual emission okay that the wording of the arabic text is very nice it says water from water and water could mean fluid that can mean semen can mean the water that we dreamed mean the water that we wash from so it can be understood in in different ways and we have another hadith that follows it hadith number 95 and and brother Muhammad will radiate peace hmm bye may Allah be pleased with him I lost messenger salallahu alaihe salam said if one of you sits between the four parts of omen and has sexual intercourse with with her was above it obligatory muslim added even if he does not ejaculate okay now again the state that a person is in after a sexual intercourse is called janaba janaba and the word janaba is derived from juniper and it means to be a far to mean - it means to be far from and why do we call a person that had this status of sexual impurity Europe because he stays away from certain rituals and forms of worship such as salat such as in some to some scholars holding of the Holy Quran such as entering the mosque and this is the consensus of scholars you may not enter the mosque while you are in the state of sexual impurity unless you are passing through yes prophet o earth right I said this I said Tawaf you may not make a wife perform Tawaf unless you are actually pure but with the sexual impurity you cannot you may not enter the mosque with the state of Juneau it's forbidden is completely and acceptable unless you it's the only way for you to pass by from one area to the other otherwise it's not permissible now the first hadith tells us that water is from water or as read by the brother the water of a soul is due to the water of sexual emission now what does that mean it simply means that if a person has an intercourse with his spouse her or his spouse then there is no whistle there is no obligatory bath obligated on them unless he ejaculates so once he ejaculates once the semen is out then he should perform or take a total bath obligatory hustle so this what we understand from the first hadith if we move on to the second hadith we find it different we find that the Prophet says a lysosome if a person has intercourse with his spouse whether he ejaculates or not he must perform total awesome so what do we do in this case scholars said that this hadith obligated the first one abrogated any NASA ha the first one which means that this hadith tells us if a person does not ejaculate but the intercourse took place then the muscle is obligatory some say that well how did you know that it obligated it as long as it did not have any date in it how do we know that this is abrogating the first one without any dates how would we know that this came before this one or this one came after this one scholars yes is it because I'd be Herrera is like a later Sahabi so he is likely that he had nine rated excellent this is one of the reasons that scholars usually say that depending on the Companions date of reverting to Islam so Tami Madadi for example was one of the very late sahabis to convert to Islam so they usually take his hadith over others but in this case we cannot apply this mustafa simply because abu huraira may allah be pleased with him not every hadith he witnessed himself do I mentioned this a while ago that Abu Huraira reverted to Islam on which year does anybody know which was on the year on the seventh year he diverted Islam on the seventh year on the day of haibach well that's what Kaiba but again when you listen to the hadith that were narrated by even a bass for example who was very young at the time of the Prophet Elisha salam and the hadith of abu huraira you would find that they are relaying hadith of older companions to us so not necessarily when even our best may Allah be pleased with him say says that the Prophet before migrating to Makkah did this and that even a bus was a five year old kid he couldn't have witnessed it so how can he report it simple because he heard it from either Abu Bakr or Omar and instead of saying Abu Bakr said the Prophet did so and so he says it as if he has witnessed it himself because all the companions of the prophet Isaiah our dual are trustworthy so by not mentioning any of the companions names you have no problem the hadith is still intact and authentic but in this case the the scholars say that this hadith came to abrogate the first hadith at the very beginning yes if a person has intercourse and does not ejaculate he should not perform also obligatory bath but later on a later stage it was obligated and it became a must whether he ejaculates or not now there is another way to explain this hadith elma mineral map that water should be the water of a soul is due to the water of sexual emission and this can be imagined without an intercourse how would that be nor how would a person ejaculate without intercourse yeah the normal thing no real things how for example if I feel in my dream yes that's the easiest thing because anything else would be a sin would be forbidden you know masturbating is a sin in Islam this is part or form of aggression as mentioned in the Quran so the only way that one can ejaculate without being sinful is whether he does that does it while sleeping or if he does it with his wife this is permissible now if a person sleeps and wets his bed with a wet dream this is the water that he should perform oh so because of though there is no intercourse so the first hadith hadith a bit outside the cadre does not conflict with the second hadith because this can be followed in the case of no intercourse and the second hadith would be followed in the case of intercourse whether a jug relates or he does not ejaculate okay we have the third hadith in this chapter hadith number 96 spillin ar-rahman rahim narrated by omo Salama may allah be pleased with her o Muslim the wife of abu talha said o Allah's messenger Allah is not ashamed of the truth it's a rousseau meaning path compulsory for women when she has a sexual dream he sallallahu and was salam replied yes if she sees sign of the liquid that is that is a sexual discharge discharges so again this is regarding whistle and I think that if we read the following hadith that would be also appropriate hadith number 97 narrated by anise ginger sort of Lohani wa sallam concerning the mentor of a woman experiencing ejaculation didn't sleep like a man said she should take the goosal the meaning bed and a Muslim edit also an acid does this happen to a woman he saw alone wasallam said yes otherwise we'll just the reason was of a child to his mother come from now we have to Hadees and just to read the Hadees again will probably consume a lot of our time which my Cameron says that we cannot have so I will pause here we will have a short break and inshallah we'll be right back Shawanda straight paths we would like to discuss the new club from an Islamic and social political perspective so sometimes some non-muslims they might not understand the full Islamic pictures anyone can say anything about it yes so when can we who speaks for Islam this is the biggest what who speaks for Islam no they are not sinning they are not sinning but we are talking about now the general rule they are not sinning but they are going against what has been established it is his honesty had at a specific time people would see it as correct a threat exactly mm-hmm how do we how do we explain to them it's not really a threat it's actually good for the country as well but if we don't participate how would we ever reach to our rights can you clarify with us what should be the level of political participation of the Muslims in the West I said I'm Monica rahamtullah and welcome back just before the break we heard two hadith hadith of umm Salama and the hadith of Anna's and they both revolve on women having wet dreams so the first one by a Muslim the wife of Abu Talha and and she preceded her question by saying that Allah is not ashamed of the truth so his social is total bath compulsory for a woman when she has sexual dream so the Prophet SAW Selim said yes if she sees the discharge if she sees the liquid which is the sexual discharge now Anna's hadith again that a woman asked the messages of allah salallahu alaihe wasalam that what does a woman do when she sees in her sleep when a man's see so the Prophet SAW Selim told them that she should perform a total bath obligatory rustle or bath Oh Michelle I'm and the wife of the Prophet Allah saw Salam he was astonished she said she said that does this happen to a woman the women have wet dreams so the Prophet SAW Salim said yes otherwise where does the resemblance of a child to its mother come from now it's very nice how almost with almost relay preceded her question by saying that Allah is that ashamed of the truth because if she bluntly said the question those who were listening would say look at this woman look at the nerve she has she doesn't feel ashamed of asking such questions to a male to a prophet sallallaahu Selim in the presence of others well she is acquiring knowledge and scholars say that there are two types that are not able to acquire knowledge knowledge two types of people that are not able to acquire knowledge those who are shy and those who are arrogant arrogance prevents you from acquiring knowledge why because I would see that if I say if I if I see someone who has more knowledge than I do my arrogance prevents me from going to him and ask him I would say what does he know I know more than he does I shouldn't be talking to him or even reading his writings I know more than he does so this is arrogance and shyness you may be shy in this prevent you from asking if you are learning from a share or in a classroom and you have a question but then you start looking left and right and say well if I ask this question the other students will laugh at me it's a silly question but I don't I don't have the answer to it so you don't ask the question which means that you do not learn almost Elaine didn't buy this she couldn't follow this procedures she said I have to learn my religion so prophet of Allah so and so what's the answer he says yes if she sees the liquid if she sees the sexual discharge then she should perform ablution now we come back to the previous issue which is also obligatory bath is obligatory once a person has intercourse whether he ejaculates or not or if a person ejaculates in his dream without an intercourse now Mostafa I have a scenario a person wakes up in the morning and finds traces in his underwear and it's traces of semen but he does not recall any dreams must he perform obligatory revolution or not you must perform host he must perform obligatory ablution so Mohammed what if a person goes to bed and sees that he is having intercourse and he ejaculates but when he wakes up in the morning he looks in his underwear and it's clean as a whistle no does he have - he does not have he does not have - and evidence behind that is Abu zaid's a cadre that the water is from water he should see the water so it's not the dream that you depend on it's the physical evidence and if a person does not recall dreaming yet finds the evidence of a wet dream then he has to perform obligatory bath what happens this is frequently asked question some people see the traces of a wet dream in a surprise and they did not sleep except in the nighttime so we tell them you have to perform OSA and you have to pray fetcher Lahore and answer again you have to repeat the prayer because you did it while you were on the state of sexual impurity though you did not see a dream and you do not remember seeing one the following hadith hadith number 98 narrated Asha may Allah be pleased with her Allah's messenger sallallahu alayhi wasallam used to take a bath from four things al janaba meaning after sexual intercourse l-jamaa on fridays al hey Jemma after extracting blood from his body and hustling mate meaning after washing a dead person this hadith is not authentic so we don't have to elaborate a lot about it some parts of it is correct and the other is not correct for example when she says that the profits are seldom used to take a bath from after sexual intercourse this the consensus of scholars that it's a must after sexual intercourse you have to have ocean oval janaba you have to have an obligatory or total bath Fridays this is a disputed issue among scholars we will get to it in sha allah after one or two or three who's counting hadith after extracting blood we gave you the word what do we call extracting blood copy it's called copying copying which is sucking or getting extracting the blood from the back of the neck or the shoulders or in certain areas of the body and it is a form of medication it's a very successful one the Prophet did a palace of Salaam and he instructed instructed us to do it and to those who have my green it is it's called my green right it is a very useful medication to that illness hamdulillah and finally after washing a dead person and we said that this was abrogated this was changed and it's not obligatory anymore it is preferable hadith number 99 narrated by abu huraira may allah be pleased with him regarding the story of o Muhammad SAW Mehmet ABI fell summited Noel when he embraced Islam the Prophet SAW wasallam ordered him to take a bath this hadith is the shorter version of a longer one and the story of Samana Thal is is really astonishing one tamama was a leader of his tribe in the center of Rabia peninsula and once he was horse riding and the soldiers of allah the companions of the prophet SAS assam captured him so they took him to the to the mosque to the masjid and they tied him in one of the pillars of the masjid which means that it is okay to enter a non-muslim to the masjid and he was tied there way the Prophet came to him the first day so he said to mama what's going on what what have you got so so mama said Mohammed if you kill me you kill a person with blood which means that people will come after my blood my tribe will come after my blood and if you pardon me you will find me grateful and if you want money as a ransom ask whatever you want I'll give it to you so the Prophet did not answer him and he went the following day the Prophet came to him so Las Animas said to mama what have you got so again he said if you kill me you kill a person with blood and if you pardon me you will find me grateful and if you want money ask whatever you want and the Prophet did not look at him again and the third day the Prophet came to him and said to mama what have you got and he repeated the same exact words so the Prophet looked at him and said to his companions untie him so they untied him and he immediately went out of the mosque and performed also in one version and another version that as soon as the they untied him he embraced Islam and he was 100% transformed from a non-muslim to a Muslim by his actions and by his commitment from hating the Prophet SAW Allah to loving him from hating Medina to loving it from hating the companions to loving them and he said that clearly to the prophesy ceremony said a shadow Allah Allah Allah Allah Muhammad Rasul Allah I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger Muhammad prophet of Allah your face was the worst thing on earth for me before I reverted Islam now it's the most beloved face on earth to my soul and you your cities likewise and your companions are likewise and just to show you how much a Muslim I am I promise you that not even one single grain will come to the people of Mecca through my area without your permission and this was the first economical buy cut and it went on for a number of months the people of Makkah sent the convoy to the Prophet seeking his mercy and telling him listen we have relatives among us you are our our relative and there is blood between us you cannot let this go by please ask the mama to allow our food to come in and so he did now this hadith tells us that it is obligatory to perform Mosul because the Prophet told her mama go and take an obligatory rehearsal and it's a an issue that has dispute among scholars in my Malik mmm I might say that's obligatory for any person reverted to Islam to perform also the other scholars say no it is preferable there is a hadith by pacer blossom that the Prophet SAW salam ordered him to perform Mosul which strengthens the choice of Malik and an imam I met and to be on the safe side this is the best thing to do because those who revert the Islam definitely had sexual intercourse and they don't believe in awesome so they are still in their sexual impurity and even if they had a tussle previously this law soul is symbolic to us to give us a sign that they have been transformed from a nun Islamic state to a Muslim state and this transformation is marked by la ilaha illa-llah the testimony this is mental and physically by washing or having the total bath I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time via Manila was Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
