  "title": "Does one ghusl suffice for many impurities (Sexual impurity, Janaba, Menses etc)? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh my question is if somebody they were very ignorant of the woodland and russell and say for example they just live like that and then they uh eventually find out uh the ruling um but they when they do also they only intend to uplift the most recent major impurity um so does this one russell account for all the um all the times the original if that makes sense no it doesn't at all makes sense because you don't have scars and tattoos over your arm this i did not make also for this i did not make also for and which means that oops i have like 215 russell to be made up so might as well soak myself in the ocean for a couple of months hope that uplifts all the no the sec the uh um major ritual impurity is one if you have it you have it all the way even if you did 50 100 150 times reasons to obligate you to do russell it's still one russell that suffices for all therefore if a woman was in her menses and she was in sexual impurity and she wanted to do a haram for tawaf and she wanted to do many things one also would suffice for all of that and allah azza knows best you"
