  "title": "Founder of Sufi Sect performs miracles, says he got his teachings from Angel Jibreel assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "there are some people in my family who practice a Sufi set and their reasoning is because they say that the founder of this sect is the Willy of Allah and he can perform Miracles and he reads four times Quran four times a day like he's supposedly very righteous but the Highlight is that this man the founder he claims that he got all of his teachings from the angel jibril and amongst the teachings is like doing you know the care of Allah using Allah's name Allah Allah Allah like that and other Innovations but my question is is it possible for Angel jibril to come down and have contact like what he's claiming and if he's if he can perform Miracles like this does it mean he is a magician even though he's praying five times a day and reading Quran and how sinful are the people who are following his practices this person is a deviant liar because Archangel jibril descends and meets only prophets and Messengers so either he is delusional in the sense that yes he met someone but whom the one who he had uh met is Satan in the flesh so Satan comes to him and he says yeah I'm a archangel jibril he's my ID card so he believes him so he's delusional or he's a blatant liar he's making a lot of money and he's getting a lot of power and authority by fooling people and these Miracles that he has are either done to him by the Jinn because of him worshiping them or because shaytan is dragging his feet and those who believe in him so he makes these Supernatural things happen and take place on his uh watch and Allah knows best definitely he has to be avoided boycotted exposed because there isn't anything as such that goes against the Quran the Sunnah and can be respected all what he is doing is bogus and baseless"
