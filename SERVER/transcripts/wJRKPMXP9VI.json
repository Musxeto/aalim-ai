  "transcript": "does Islam promote being passive or lazy or does work have a special place in Islam oh assalamu alaikum and welcome to a new episode of Youth talk I would like to start by welcoming my guest in the studio I have with me the pleasure is all mine I'd also like to welcome my participants I have to my left Abdullah who is a computer programmer as well as Torre who is a student at the Academy of Art and Mahmoud who is an English translator what is the importance or significance of work in Islam alhamdulillah while looking at the concept of work we have to differentiate between working to this life to do something for our world and Society and working that is in a form of worship pure worship to Allah and work as a concept can be good and can be bad so if we look at the work that has value or is harmful to a person in the measurements of the day after the Hereafter day of judgment we will find that if you do well if you obey the orders of Allah if you uh perform the things that you're told to do and stay away from the things that you you were prevented from doing this is positive work and you will be rewarded with good deeds on the day of judgment and vice versa if you do something bad if you do not uh uh perform the things that Allah has instructed you to do you'll be punished on the day of judgment now coming down to our world we have to work in order to do something whether we are positive in what we're doing such as those who are working to feed their families those who are studying in their universities to achieve a a degree in what they're studying or we could be working in the bad sense and that is harming people making Wars uh killing stealing this is also work but again you'll be punished or rewarded according to what you do and it's very interesting to know that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that there are two names that are very truthful and these names are al-harif and alhammam Hadith means that every person does something whether to his world or to the day to the day of judgment so he is plowing the the ground he's doing something and hamam means that he is about to do something everybody is about to do something he's about to do good deeds or bad Deeds coming back to the concept of work Islam promotes working and that is why whenever you recite in the Holy Quran you find that Allah talks about the Believers as the the Muslims as being those who believe and perform Good Deeds so if you believe without any performance without any actions this is not enough if you say that I'm a Believer and you sit idle you don't pray you don't fast you don't fulfill the pillars of Islam then you're not a Muslim so there has to be belief and actions work the prophet salallahu told us about those who beg and he warned them by saying that those who beg in this world in this in this life will come on the day of judgment without pieces of Flesh in their faces which means that because they have imposed this humility on themselves by asking and begging people in this life they will be punished on the day of judgment by coming in in a skeleton like faces nor flesh nothing to show for another man came to the prophet salallahu asking for money he was begging the Prophet The Messengers of the messenger of Allah may Allah a peace and blessing and praise be upon him the prophet saws redirected him and he told him to go and buy an ax and a rope and then he told him to go to the a forest or to uh outside of the city and shop for firewood and then sell it and to come back to him in a weak time after one week the man came in a very different uh situation and he looked differently because he had money he sold the wood the firewood and he made money so the prophet told his companions and set an example of this man by telling them this is far greater than a man coming and begging people for money they might give him and they may not they may not so Islam promotes people to work I want there was something you wanted to mention yeah share intention in Islam is very important so is it enough to work to earn a living to support myself my family so and so or if it needs to be a higher intention behind work okay that's a very valid and good question intention in Islam is very important if not the most important thing in oral Deeds the prophet said salallahu that all Deeds depend on the intention and whatever you intend then you will be a credited accordingly this means that you could have two people praying at the same time in the same mosque one with the intention to seek the Forgiveness of Allah and to ask the reward of Allah the other one is with the intention to show show his boss that he prays so that he would give him a raise one in hell and what the other is in Paradise because of the intention though their actions and deeds are exactly the same they're prostrating they're bowing they're reciting the Quran in the same fashion and manner going back to your question the intention in in working is is very important but it is not the only thing and and a lot of the brothers and sisters may mix the concept of intention by saying that if I work from nine to five my intention has to be that this work is for Allah and this is not possible to work nine to five for Allah in the sense this is a very uh uh High achievement to reach if you can do that but it's mainly or normally uh unreachable but when you work from nine to five you have to ask yourself what is your intention so what would your intention be from your job one to get a salary at the end of the month that's right okay then why so the answer would be to feed my wife and children this by itself is an excellent uh intention and that is why the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam told us that feeding your family is a charity so this is an a responsibility I have to do this the prophet nevertheless says that if you do this you will be rewarded and it's a form of Charity so this is an incentive for you to go to work with an open mind go to work happy because you are putting the food on the table but at the same time Allah is rewarding for you for it now the intention is very important even to those who are studying now if a a boy or girl goes goes to school they have to have a clear intention and unfortunately this is at the bottom of our list if it exists at all because ask and Survey any Community around you why do children go to school why do teenagers go to high schools why do young men and women go to universities and they all pursue a degree or their parents just ask them to do so otherwise they're going to punish them so if you do not have an objective with a clear intention then you're not going to have good results it is quite important that we teach our kids teach our teenagers teach our youth that they have to have a clear intention and this intention does not mean that you have to stick 24 hours in the match in the Masjid and mosque on the country live your normal life with an intention so if I go to the gym and I work out for a couple of hours a day that's a lot but if I do this what is your intention this man's intention is to have a beautiful symmetric body so that he could uh uh seduce girls you show off or so that he could beat those who uh he doesn't like so his intention his two hours in the gym would be in his sins record he is sinful from the day from the moment he got out got out of his house till the day he comes back now another guy is working out when and his intention is to have a healthy body so that he could perform his worships prayer pilgrimage be representing Islam in a nice way and at the same time whatever there is a call to defend Islam he is fit and Islam asks you to be fit this guides rewarded the minute from the minute he goes out of his house till the time he comes back so intention is extremely important now you have the intention to work and but actually what you face is that people are not treated equally so you may find that those people who are maybe not qualified and the catch jobs that um that doesn't match their qualifications and you know I I'm talking about nepotism you know those who are if you know someone you will work if you don't but you have the intentions and a lot a lot of people suffer from these problems so how could we deal with that this is not only in the Muslim world it's world it's it's not what you know it's who you know unfortunately and this is practice everywhere and unfortunately there are governments that are run through this methodology you have presidents that are not fit to to to to to head a school and they're heading you know my country but this is beside the point the point is that you do whatever pleases Allah azzawajal so if this this means that if you are in a job and you find that people are climbing on your back to reach higher positions people you know uh polish shoes and do things that it's inappropriate to say on TV but they reach where they want through crooked Ways and Means well this is not acceptable for you as a Muslim because Islam tells you you have to work but going to the top is not your objective you have to work honestly you must not lie you must not be with two faces you must not be a hypocrite you must be punctual you must be faithful truthful and so on and if you get a better position if you don't then also alhamdulillah and let those who did uh wrong get what they deserve in this life and definitely they will get what they deserve under here after Abdullah had a question yeah I totally agree with what they should have mentioned yes it is practice all over the world that the end justify the means but especially for for Muslims the you know if you want to catch job and you're qualified but you are um uh you are attached to your uh your religion and stuff so they might be rejected I mean how could we practically avoid these problems I mean for the entire Society um the answer is is very simple by transforming the whole society to be a Muslim Society the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam told us that whoever seeks the pleasure of people over the pleasure of Allah azzawajal Allah the almighty will be angry with him and he will make the people angry with him and vice versa whoever seeks the pleasure of Allah over the pleasure of the people Allah will be pleased with him and he will make the people pleased with you so you cannot compromise you cannot say well it's either this uh and that no it's either this or that it's either you're a committed Muslim regardless of what what the consequences are I'm committed I have red lines that I cannot cross I have my Islamic boundaries that I may not uh go beyond and and this is it well this is what I believe I have my trust in Allah azzawajal whatever they want to do they may do but I will not compromise my religion to seek their pleasure because I know that Allah will punish me for that well okay I just want to ask a question myself this time um some people may say may prefer not to work for example and that they will stay at home or stay in the mosque with them as the Masjid praying all the time and not working when somebody may ask why are you not working I am praying to Allah is that in a sense Justified at all for not working this this concept is found in some Cults that claim to be Muslims and the second caliph once went into a Masjid a mosque and he saw a group of people sitting there so he told them what are you doing because you notice that they did not have anything to do they they've been sitting there for for too long so he asked him what are you doing they said we are al-mutawa kilun we are those who have their trust in Allah and they have the confidence in Allah so we are sitting here so he started beating them with a short stick with him telling them that you are not having the Trust In Allah you are just sitting there like lazy bums no nothing this is not the way of doing it those who claim to have their trust in Allah trust has to be accompanied by work and if someone sits idly in his house and say I have my trust in Allah Allah if Allah wishes he would grant me money food water everything so I don't have to work this is insane this is unacceptable because to the same person we tell him that it's like exactly someone wanting to have children without being married or having sex he said well oh Allah grant me a strong child of my own offspring okay do something no if you want to you could do it to me this is not having your trust in Allah it's like again standing in the middle of a of of the highway during rush hour and saying I have my thrust in Allah Allah will protect me this is insane Islam tells you that you should be admitted to a proper hospital to be a proper Muslim you have to work and that is why the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam said in a authentic Hadith he said if you have your trust in Allah real trust in Allah then Allah Almighty Mighty will support you and provide you with risk he will provide you whatever whatever you need exactly as he does with the birds the birds in the beginning of the day the prophet says go out of their nests with empty stomachs and they come at the end of the day with full stomachs so he the prophet sallam did say to us that the birds work because they have left their nests and they came back at the end of the day what were they doing they didn't go to the Masjid of course to the mosque and sat there no they went looking for food and if we have our trust in Allah and we work and seek what supports Us by having our trust in Allah and by working at the same time then I assure you that Allah will support us and give us whatever we uh need and ask him for well excuse me according to Halal and Haram and work in Islam an extension to the the comment if anybody a man or a guy who wants to work in something and he should work in something which is uh which is we can say that saharam by dealing and working in a hotel that sell a lot of alcohol or something like that what should the what should we do what should we uh make in in this case okay if I understand the question correctly then I'll answer it with a Hadith and comment on that afterwards the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam and the Hadith was reported by Imam Muslim in sahir he told us about a man traveling with lots of dust in his hair because of traveling and raising his hands to heaven and saying oh Allah O Lord he's praying to Allah to Grant him whatever he seeks the prophet says yet he is fed from sources of forbidden money and he is nourished through uh uh sources of forbidden money the things that he drink is from the same Source the things that he aware is from the same uh are the from the same Source how by Allah Almighty will answer his prayer so the prophet is telling us that if your income is from things that are forbidden then you will not your prayer will not be answered by Allah this means that you have to go out of your way to ensure that your income is halal is permissible and this is very easy it depends on condition you know elaborate a little bit more about the condition what do you mean by conditions that's the only job we found for example he have to do this work it gets he he can take a high salary he can maybe if you put it into another aspect that he's working and then he's asked to do this part as part of his work and without doing that he might be fired for example okay let me first of all say that there is a rule in Islam which says that necessity makes forbidden things permissible but you have to define the Necessities yeah necessity makes no rules yeah well I'm talking about the Islamic concept let's not get into it these Concepts now coming back to this Rule and applying it here uh you you mentioned the example of a person working on a hotel and he serves alcohol pork uh things that are not Islamic so is his job or his income is permissible the answer would be no you say if I understand that this is the only job he could do or this is the only job available at the moment well actually it is not but this is the only job that pays what he is looking up for there are thousands and hundreds of jobs that are lower and and salary but this doesn't suit me it's exactly the same uh in the case of Bankers you know there are uh two types of banks Islamic Islam that deals with Islamic transactions and non-islamic Banks which are the majority unfortunately because it gets high interest a lot of the the Muslims work in the non-islamic banks and whenever we tell them this is forbidden because you're taking interest and it's a major sin they say well we can't find an alternative but they do not complete the sentence we cannot find alternative that pays the same salary but there are lots of Alternatives that are 30 percent less forty percent and even 50 percent here comes your trust in Allah azzawajal if you trust the almighty then you should leave this income that is not permissible for you and look for a pure income and in my point of view people don't starve to death in our societies and communities maybe if they were in Somalia maybe they do yeah but in where we live You'll Always Find a Muslim that gives you a loaf of bread if not a half a kilo of meat and some shrimps and and dressing and Cocktails about the shrimps well it depends if you're in a culture or not but this this is the case see you have to look at the things that pleases Allah not pleases you because the sky is the limit no matter how high your salary is You'll Always Find a position that promises more but uh with a little bit more compromise from your side in uh your religious aspects are you going to talk about some common phenomenon nowadays that's it now I work in a company or organization and I'm totally honest and objective to myself and I find myself qualified for the job but I'm required to pay some money if not I'll be kicked out and we I I will work out from this company without having the job so it's permissible to be that sum of money to have the job I see and fit for it so it's a bribe you want to sense they're surprised it's a bride no okay if if I find that the job is is is is mine I fit for it and it's my right to have it okay now paying bribe is something that is considered in Islam as a major sin and those who pay bribes those who receive the bribes and those who are witnessing the bribe the bribing process are all cursed by Allah and this is a major sin but when we come to this case where you have a job opening and you are applying for this job and your HR manager wants a small something under the counter for him to accept now you are the victim but you want to make yourself also the judge because you are claiming that you are the most qualified person and and this is not to you to judge now say your your desire is influencing your judgment you want the job because it pays well and at the same time you're convinced that you're the best man around but this is your own uh thinking and this is your own estimation you may be right and you may be wrong coming back to the situation again if you bribe this HR manager then bribery would be common to the extent that you also have to bribe the man who issues your driving license you have to bribe the man who gets a phone into your house and so on then this means the the end and Corruption goes on and on and on okay we've got a break now and we'll be back in a few moments after this break welcome da da da da da da la la la la la la la la la la la and welcome back I'm Abdullah um actually there is very big problems for for people who are looking for work we have been they have the good intentions and everything but actually the their education actually doesn't match if their education is very very good so actually here they don't have the opportunity so the do you think of immigrating to another country I mean those who are very high qualified Engineers uh doctors and you know those who are they have they have the high level education so they are going to immigrate so how could we in our country to um to start to think to benefit from those people and give them their the opportunity here to work here to um for the for the good for our country I think you're addressing the question to the wrong man see this is the role of the governments and and the role of uh those of our organizations themselves yes but I would have expect you to ask me on the rule of immigrating to work to work in another country in another country because this would what I thought of at the very beginning when you ask a question and if I may of course answer this question I think that traveling to work in another country is permissible simply because this is what the Muslims in the early times used to do the the Arabs at the beginning of uh time were Traders and the prophet sallallahu himself went to Syria and to the Sham area up to the north of Arabia for a trade and he was a merchant himself all the companions of the Prophet were also commercials and Traders by Nature so traveling by itself to seek a better opportunity for work is acceptable as a concept it is not depending on the effect it has on a Muslim so if a person goes to a Muslim country where he is free to practice his religion he is not oppressed and at the same time uh he has a good opportunity to for a decent job this is one of the best scenarios possible because then you got you have a good income and you are leading a comfortable life the question arises when a person goes and travel to work in a non-muslim country where the Temptations are endless where Sharia the Islamic law is not uh applied where there are threats to his faith and belief then the answer would be going to such a country is not permissible because although your income will improve your religion will deteriorate and the level of a man of faith will drop dramatically and in so many cases and I've not witnessed cases like this people abandon their religion they're overwhelmed overwhelmed uh with the pressure of the peers with the environment the society they have to give in they just they're hopeless and then they start to imitate and copy the Western way of thinking ideology and stuff they are transformed into being something other than Muslims so if they are sure to preserve their Islam in Iman they can practice their religion freely they are immune to of uh to uh The Temptations around working in in such environment is permissible otherwise it's not but how can they excuse me how can something like that be measured I mean to see whether or not you will be able to protect yourself from The Temptations around you in a different Society okay the oppression part of that can be found out but how can you actually know if you're going to be able to protect yourself from The Temptations around you and be as strong wasn't it everyone knows his own capability so it's an individual thing yes of course and that's why I'm I'm giving him the choice if you can then it's okay though going to Muslim countries is far greater choice but if if you have no choice except to go to this non-muslim country to work in Europe for example and if you have a strong enough Faith yes definitely and that is why Scholars say that traveling to non-muslim countries is not permissible unless three conditions are fulfilled one that a Muslim has to have a certain level of virtue and fear of Allah that prevents him from indulging himself in Temptation desires lust uh whatever to to have a level of knowledge that prevents him from accepting any uh uh bad idea internal influence yes that that may affect his religion you know you could find someone coming to you if you don't have a strong knowledge of Islam and telling you that Islam promotes Trinity that is why you say Bismillah this is the name of the son the father Son and the Holy Ghost this is straight and the guy said no this is unacceptable you have to have the proper knowledge that allows you to to defend yourself and to to refute these bad ideas that come to you thirdly that you have to have a legitimate purpose for going to these countries so if you go there for just the sake of Tourism I just want to have fun and enjoy myself this is not possible or not permissible because you have lots of Islamic countries that you could visit in tourism but if you have a legitimate reason such as studying looking for a job trading medication you have to go there because they have the best hospitals a proper legitimate reason if these three conditions are fulfilled then it's okay for you to travel other than that stay where you are among the Muslims among your brothers of going abroad for for working what if I stay in my country I'm working for non-muslims in my country for for example for multinational companies okay it's right or wrong or about the income is it permissible to if from or what the income depends on the activities of the company itself so if the company for example is an industrial company that produces pipes so this is a legitimate a a line of work so this is permissible now your your boss or your uh uh the top management are non-muslims so is it permissible for me to work under non-muslim management this would be yes it is there's nothing wrong in that and the evidence of that is that Salman and Pharisee may Allah be pleased with him when he was abducted and sold as a slave he was sold to a Jew and his master his owner who was a Jew used to ask him to work in his farm so he worked in his farm and the prophet saws though he was a Muslim Salman was a Muslim and his boss was non-muslim he did not tell him you have to leave work or do something or kill your boss or whatever because he said I'm Muslim no it's okay especially nowadays with this globalization and and as long as the activity is permissible and there's nothing forbidden in your work then it's permissible for you to work I think we should let's move to another Point um the working environment I mean a lot of people for them the working environment defines how much they love their job and how successful they are and so on and so forth um what about mingling or mixing with colleagues from the opposite sex with females for example in your working environment are there certain rules are there degrees would something like that prohibit you for example from taking a certain job whoa three in one question no the problem is that uh this issue has so many attachments to it and you have to look at it from a holistic point of view you cannot come and say no or you can say yes you have to explain it and elaborate so that people would understand why we are taking such a stand now working with the other with opposite sex is forbidden in Islam we are told in Islam to segregate between females and males and this is portrayed Extremely Loud and Clear in the prophetics uh uh prophetic sayings for example in a Masjid in a mosque the prophet salallahu says that the best throws of men are those at the very front at the beginning and the worst rows of men are those at the very end and the worst grows of women are those at the very beginning at the very uh at the front and the best roles of women are those at the very end which means that Islam wants to keep though we are in a sacred place a place of worship the prophet salallahu tells us that keep the men as far as possible from the women in Islam we are told that a person must lower his gaze from the opposite sex so men are not supposed to look at women women are not supposed to look at men if they are complete strangers this does not apply to your wife although sometimes one would say well I should lower my gaze but no I was just joking your wife your sister your your daughter your aunt this these are all uh women that you are not allowed to marry so they are mahram you can look at them and they can look at you I'm talking about strange a women you have to lower your gaze and they women have to load their gaze as well we have so many things in Islam that tells us that women are if mixing mixed with with men they are cause of Temptation and and this is crystal clear now I could hear but I'm I'm I don't have supersonic hearing but I could hear people saying that listen we we've been to the West we've been to the states and Europe and we've we have lots of men working with women women and nothing happens so you guys are sick you're thinking that things would happen well I'll tell you it's not the case but it did not click you could work with a thousand women and maybe nothing happens not because it's a safe environment but simply because nothing clicked and I'll give you a very Crystal Clear example that was on the whole world TV screens a few years back ahead of a country a very well-known superpower was accused of fornicating with an interim now this guy had a beautiful wife he had a big position but still this did not prevent him from cheating and why was that because he was working with the opposite sex now you cannot come you cannot blame Muslims for being rather saved than sorry because this is what the Quran and Sunnah tells us to do let the woman work with women and let men work with men coming back to your question which I just had to you know set the platform for it if you are working in a company that has females you should isolate yourself from them as much as possible in the sense that it is forbidden for a man to be alone with a woman in one room because the prophet tells us that there's a third person with them and this is and don't tell me that she is ugly don't tell me that she is 10 or 15 years older than you are because it's it's whatever it is not what you feel towards her maybe you have no feelings towards her but can you guarantee that she does not have anything towards you and we've heard so many cases of nurses marrying their doctors of stewardesses marrying their captains of Mage marrying their uh uh boss in in the houses and this is all because of the marriage is a good thing it's a positive thing we've heard so many things about you know uh relationships that did not end in marriage so this is completely forbidden to isolate well we already know that males and females should not be mixed together in the workplace but assuming that this is a on current situation for example how should one deal with it well first of all it's it's very unfortunate if it's the current situation my best advice would be if you can look for a better job then go ahead if not this is only job available then there are boundaries that you must not go beyond there are red lines for example as a I I stated before the break you must not be alone with another female in a room so this is even in an elevator and and so many times I'm encountering this situation I go into an elevator and while I'm going up or down it stops in the floor and and comes a a girl or a lady or a woman or whatever so then I without any hesitation I have to go out it's either me or her not both of us alone in an elevator one would say come on you're being this is too much he said no it's not because so many cases the elevators is stuck for three or four hours and then what happens and again I'm not doing this because I'm I don't know myself or I don't trust her I'm doing this this for the best of the community it's the instruction of Allah and of the Prophet saws so don't be alone with a woman in a room two if you work with a woman don't look at at her in the eyes in the sense try to avoid looking at her unless it's necessary one would say well this is rude well it's rude but this is what keeps me away from her this is what puts a a petition between me and her but imagine if I dissolve myself in the work environment and I start looking at her smiling joking and maybe uh uh doing something Beyond this just to be friendly and kind this is unacceptable in Islam so you have to draw the line here if I work with the opposite sex I would never ever touch them at all because the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam told us that it is better for one of you to be stabbed in his head with a big iron nail rather than touching a woman that is not permissible for him so shaking hands and shaking hands is the moderate way of of of of of saluting but nowadays the kissing is so again where to draw the line so touching is completely forbidden in Islam Now by saying that you're not allowed to be alone with her in a room if there are uh men and women with you it's a different story again putting the scenario that this is the only job I have and I have to do it the more you are away and and and and and segregated from uh the opposite sex this is the Islamic way of doing it imagine that in Islam a woman must not wear perfume because men are so sensitive to the to to women more than women are sensitive to men and this is understood easily if you have a a group of men and a knock a bombshell goes in that room you know a fine woman you know beautiful lots of the heads will be turning not all of them but lots of the heads will be turning but if the opposite took place if you have a room full of women and one fine handsome masculine man comes in very few heads would turn so Islam plays a great role over the Chastity of women of them being properly dressed not being perfumed not uh showing their a beautiful side to men so what about the woman who take a high position High position in the community who are you judge you have to be under the judge what can you do in this case a judge is really not a is not the it's exception really remember yes you don't have in many Muslims down here yeah actually uh the position of Judge is not allowed for a woman a woman to assume because it means that she has to give verdicts and things that she is unequipped to do she has to mingle with men she has to uh uh uh mix with them and probably she has to be alone with the some of them and the prophet saws said that this is not acceptable but if the CEO was were to be a woman for example of a company and you're working in and you're a manager you work in this environment but with these boundaries protected so if she says well come to my office I've uh I want to have a a man-to-man meeting well change the man you're a woman I can't have this meeting with you or unless there is someone else we can do it by a phone conference or video conference or whatever send me an email but do not be alone with her do not talk to her even in the presence of others you know taking your freedom and and Liberty to talk and look and joke and and and smile and do whatever you think because by Nature then this is natural come on it's not only me the one with the suspicion or the doubts it's it's natural that a man would like to impress others um as a man I would love to impress women and as a woman she would love to impress Russia men she would love it any woman would love someone coming to her and say whoa you wearing your hair in US way today what's that nice perfume lovely dress you're making it more Lovelier and so on and a man would like someone when this happens to us when whenever we meet another man in the middle of the road and you know I pull up my stomach the minute he walks away and then I let go my stomach this is human nature so if you work in such an environment eventually this what will happen so you were you you can have a boss that is a female but keep the boundaries of Islam protected but at the end work is a sacred part of of Islam in a sense not necessarily the word sacred but okay no I'm not talking about specifically to work with females I'm talking about work in general yes you rectify the point it's true you have to work because if you don't work you are not adding value to the society and each and every individual in Islam must add value to his community and to his Society okay on that note I'll um end this episode of you talks it's been a pleasure having you with us thank you for joining us I'd also like to thank our guests and of course ahmud thank you all for joining us as well you talk we'll be back again soon with a new topic and until then la la oh oh"
