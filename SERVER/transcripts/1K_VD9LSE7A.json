  "title": "Does slight movement or moving sideways in ruku or sujood impact the prayer? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "being at ease in prayer there's a lot of brothers who rock in like they go sideways sometimes and this happens throughout the position or sometimes in sejud they might walk um like side to side but when we look at them we know that they're praying um so would their uh prayer still be valid if that makes sense okay um this does make sense but what they're doing it does not make sense so i would understand that people in raqqa probably would do this because their feet are aching and they're switching between sides due to the blood circulation this doesn't impact the prayer it's not recommended to do but it does not impact the prayer you don't stay in recur as a statue and if you make a move then it's you're gone no you're human still slight movement is okay rocking in sujud this is a first i've never seen anybody does this but again if it is slight and for a reason this does not impact the study allah knows best"
