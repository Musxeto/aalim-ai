  "title": "Shaving new born Male or Female",
  "transcript": "sister Aisha from Nigeria she says what's the ruling on shaving the newborn and is there is any difference between uh males and females the answer is the prophet Alat instructed us to name the newborn on the seventh day and to shave the head and he said that remove that filth over his head and for the boys for the males he ordered us to circumcise them on the seventh day of their birth and this is for males so it is a highly recommended Sunnah to shave but it is not a mandatory thing it's not obligatory so if a person skips it there's nothing wrong in it but it is hygienic it is good for the sculpt and it's good for the newborn and the scholars differed whether females are Exempted from this or they're also included personal opinion is that they are also in uded because the term remove the filth from the head of the newborn this applies to both males and females and inshallah it's best for them as well"
