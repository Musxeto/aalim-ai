  "title": "Am I sinful if I revise Quran in my head, in toilet, while answering call of nature? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I realized that I I have like like the third the three to four minutes it takes me to go when I go to the washroom to ancient the call of nature they get like fully wasted so if I revise Suraj from the Quran that I've memorized in my head without without like moving my tongue or opening my mouth then then when I like exit the version I open a Quran app and like see why see what mistakes I had made when I was revising my memory memorization and the correct myself so like we're we're doing this be rewarded by like rewardable by Allah first of Allah may Allah be pleased with him mentioned and then also in the Hadith of Aisha though some Scholars say that this is not an authentic Hadith the prophet would not mention the name of Allah while answering the call of nature not only that he sometimes refrained from returning and replying to the salaam when he was not in the state of voodoo honoring the name of Allah to be mentioned like that however when a person is in the toilet and things go into his mind he's not rewarded for that if he makes vicar if he says subhanallah but he doesn't move his lips it's just thinking and contemplating upon it this is not sinful and he is not rewarded for that therefore I would highly recommend that you refrain from revising the Quran in the state you've mentioned because I would feel that it is a form of disrespecting the Quran and revising it while in such a state and it's only a few minutes so I believe that you have to honor the Quran and not even take it down that level though you're not sinful if you do those this I don't say you're sinful but it is not respectful to the Quran even if someone were to talk to you you would be ashamed when you say to them well I was defecating and I was revising in my head and I made a few mistakes people would look weird weirdly at you and you wouldn't feel good about it so it's best to avoid that and Allah Knows Best"
