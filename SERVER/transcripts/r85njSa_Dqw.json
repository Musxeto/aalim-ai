  "transcript": "and I was reading about the sacrifices of the sahabi and how much they did for this for Islam and for the prophet sallam so I wanted I was I was feeling emotional and I wanted to make Dua for them but I don't know what Dua I should make for the sahabi for the prophet Allah I can say salaam on him or read the or ask but for the sahabi I don't know what do I should make if I ask for their forgiveness or should I ask for them to for Jannah but they're already in Jannah because they are the pro the companions of the Prophet so that I wanted to ask about first of all we know that those whom the prophet Allah named to be in Jannah or in Jannah so Abu Bakr Omar Osman ali abdulrahman um and the son of Abdullah in his eight I forgot his name the narrator of the Hadith subhanallah I skipped his name uh he's the brother-in-law of um these 10 are in Jannah Bilal is in Jannah because there's a Hadith stating that that they are in Jannah now the companions in total are in gender but not every individual of them we can confirm that he's in Jannah but in totality so what Dua should we do we can say Allah Allah forgive them o Allah be pleased with them as mentioned in the Quran and any such Dua Allah raise their ranking in Paradise would do so there is no problem in making Dua for them or better more make Dua for yourself oh Allah make me on the day of judgment in the same rank of the companions to be with them to be able to meet them and mix with them because I love them for your sake and for what they had done to our Prophet Salah to assalam in supporting him this would be a better option on Allah Knows Best"
