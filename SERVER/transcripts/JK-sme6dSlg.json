  "title": "Is it allowed to over estimate zakat & give more or must make specific calculations assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign specifying an overall Collective estimated sum of money merely on estimation basis is acceptable or I have to make some rough calculation because it is uh difficult for me to uh know that how much gold is sold or have stolen in the past years so suppose for example if I'm giving 15 lakhs for the past 15 years without making an intention of how much I'm dedicating per year so is it less or more uh it it would be more okay no problem inshallah there is no problem none whatsoever in overestimating and giving more than the zakat see as long as you're doing what you're supposed to or above this is permissible what is above is and charity for you so you are in the clear what is not permissible is to underestimate and give less than what you're supposed to do so you're in the clearing"
