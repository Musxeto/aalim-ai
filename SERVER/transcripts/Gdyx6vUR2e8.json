  "title": "Do pieces after using Miswak or tiny food particles in teeth break my fast? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] what if one cleans his teeth with miswak and pieces of the miswak and the wetness from the miswak reaches his throat does his fast break well pieces of the miswak are pieces if you deliberately swallow them they break your fast likewise if I have a piece of meat between my teeth and I do this and I do this and it comes out and I swallow it if it's in prayer it breaks my prayer because this is considered eating and if I'm fasting it breaks my fasting goes because this is deliberate eating this is different from someone who finds something and he tries to take it out but it's so small and negligible it goes to the back of his throat there's no way he can take it out and he swallows it unintentionally this doesn't impact your fasting a piece of miswak that was there I didn't pay attention to it I didn't know it existed and all of a sudden it's at the back of my throat and I swallowed it unintentionally it doesn't impact your fasting what about the liquid in the miswak itself it does not impact your fasting because never it was reported to us that the Prophet used to brush his teeth and spit it out so this liquid is so negligible it has no impact it's exactly like when you rinse your mouth and waddle and you spit it out there remains an amount of water mixed with your saliva this is negligible you [Applause]"
