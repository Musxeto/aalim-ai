  "transcript": "foreign I was traveling to my home country on a plane recently and you know it's a long flight there were other Muslim sisters and brothers because it's a long flight I'm you know you get served a meal in between so while booking a ticket um you have to opt for a Halal you know option um I noticed I noticed some of the brothers and sisters were being served none halal food just like other non-muslims and I thought maybe they didn't know that they had they should all opt for a loved one so in short I wanted to um to warn them but I thought maybe if I go in and tell them they would get embarrassed and because I didn't know in person and then they were much older than me so I didn't do it so I just wanted to ask you um if something similar happens next time like how what should I do thank you you're quite welcome this is again too genetic if I'm traveling I wouldn't be looking around at people and this is Muslim this is non-muslim this is being served me I don't know what they're being served I don't know if they're eating the meat or not and to Snoop and try to investigate is unislamic we should mind our own businesses yes if someone next to me and he's a Muslim and I can tell he's Muslim and he's being served meal let's look at the origin of the country if the origin of the country is a place which is Christian the as I said before and this is the opinion of many great Scholars that the meat that is slaughtered by the Jews and the Christians is halal to for us to consume so if it's from UK it's from Germany from the US no problem if it's from China this is not a Christian country it's from Japan this is not a Christian country so we must not consume any of their meat because whatever they slaughter is Haram for us due to the fact that they're not Christians or Jews they're either Buddhist or uh worshipers of of the Sun or whatever so if you see this you may give a friend the advice and you may say to them that oh I used to be like you but then I figured out that I have the option of asking for a Muslim meal alhamdulillah since I think 2001. when I first started traveling to these countries I used to ask for a Muslim meal and they used to serve it to me on the plane with the grace of Allah before we used to ask for kosher Meal which is the Jewish meal that does not contain pork but unfortunately kosher meal may contain wine so refraining from that is is is a must so you may talk to them and give them a friend advice and move on with your life but you're not allowed to go to each and every one you think is the Muslim what is this meal is it Muslim meal have you eaten the the meat maybe they're eating fish maybe they're eating something only vegetables or asking for vegetarian food or whatever so one has to be wise and diplomatic in the his approach and Allah Knows Best"
