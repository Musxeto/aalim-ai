  "title": "Will Martyrs be resurrected like normal people when they're guaranteed Jannah #hijab assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "do Shahs get Resurrection okay okay very like normal people even though they're guaranteed Jenna very good so the Shahid which means the martyrs who are the martyrs they are the Muslims who die on the battlefield this is called what Shahid we cannot testify that he is a Shahid why he died on the battlefield because I don't know about his intention he may have died to gain power he may have died to get a rank he may have died to gain booty of war and he may died because he wanted the name of Allah to be the highest so if I say he's Shahid I'm saying he's in Jenna and no one has the ability to say that but when a person dies in the cause of Allah he at the side of Allah is called a Shahid question is the Martyr who died in the cause of Allah in the battlefield she why are you repeating Battlefield because I can be injured on the battlefield and go to the hospital and spend two weeks in the hospital and die am I Shahid no I have to be be washed shrouded prayed upon and buried like normal dead people people who die on the battlefield they're not washed they're shrouded in their own clothes and we do not offer janaza prayer because we don't intercede for them they intercede for us and we just bury them so this is the difference so those who die Martyrs in the battlefields I give you my back because they will kill me if I don't you know those who die on the battlefield it's an issue of dispute is or will their bodies decompose or not there are narrations that their bodies will not decompose evidence from that some narrations that Hamza the uncle of the Prophet Alat wasam after 20 years of his death they dug his grave and found his body intact and in another narration jab abdah Haram his father Abdullah Haram was also 40 years the flood came and uncovered his body and his body was intact but these are two cases other cases say no they decompose what we know for certain is that the bodies of whom Messengers and Prophets they do not decompose they are intact and it can never happen any change to their bodies they will be resurrected but they will be resurrected meaning the souls will be inserted into their bodies and they come back to life if this is your question so I hope I answered it"
