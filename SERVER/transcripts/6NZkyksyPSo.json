  "transcript": "Riley says how should we have a balance between dunya and akhira and I don't know why you guys like to ask questions that require a whole lecture this is a way of life to balance this life with the hereafter is a way of life it cannot be summarized in a couple of minutes allah said in surat al qasas robert every female attack Allah who Daryl affion well attention RC became in at dunya Allah says the people of Harun said to him in whatever Allah gives you you should seek the hereafter meaning that this is your objective this is your mission and vision and while doing so don't be like monks neglecting your worldly needs no you have to take what is appropriate according to the amount you need from this life meaning whatever health we have whatever financial means whatever power that Allah has bestowed upon us we should devote this for seeking Allah's pleasure because my life span on earth cannot exceed average of 60 to 70 years maximum 100 then what then death and it's all in decline after 40 years of age so you should utilize everything that you have for eternity in paradise but while doing so do not neglect your needs you need to get married you need to eat and drink you need to wear good clothes right a good car have a sustainable income that would allow you to live an honorable life without begging people for money all of this is a combination if you manage to achieve it then you would be in good hands the vast majority of Muslims are focusing 90% on this dunya 10% on the hereafter this is why they get usually a big zero it's a failure but those who go extreme and focus like 95% on the Acura with 5% on this dunya they would be begging people for money no you have to have this balance which the Prophet said at his salat wa sallam - I'm the lion I am Ramirez your Lord has rights over you your body has rights over you your wife has rights over you and your guest has rights over you so give all it's do right so you have to balance and know that yes I memorize the Quran I read books of fancier I spent time worshiping Allah but I need time to go to the gym I need time to jog I need time to burn some calories to do some weight exercises or push-ups or setups or something to take care of my health I have to connect to my next of kin and entertain how guests that come to my house visiting me I have to also take care of my kids and my wife give them quality time this is the full package deal if you manage this balance then you are in good hands in Charlotte"
