  "transcript": "says my mom my mother-in-law says You must not sweep after Maghrib what does Islam say about this this is a misconception that a lot of the people in the subcontinent have and in Islam I can make up things like crazy it's not permissible to drink green tea after Maghrib oh what can I drink only coffee and this is baseless but if I say it to people and they buy it what can we can be done about it Islam is a religion of common sense of logic that is based entirely on evidences you cannot speak of thin air and come up with a resolution or a verdict and say Simon Says do this so you tell me I can't sweep after sunset show me the evidence there's none in the Quran or in the Sunnah so this is bogus I will not accept this people say on Wednesday you can't clip your nails subhanallah why hairdressers and and body cure and manicure are not working on on Wednesdays hello so all of these things are rubbish they're baseless I got a question the other day maybe today or yesterday stating that my mother-in-law says that dragging your feet because my shoes are heavy I can't lift my foot up so I drag my feet and this makes a scratching noise on the ground some people are lazy you know they they pull their legs on the ground and she says to me this is prohibited and sinful I said why she said because you're hurting the ground yeah did the ground complain to you so if we dig the Earth to or plow the Earth to plant seeds and crops this hurts the Earth what is this so don't listen to nonsense especially that which the elders say without any evidence from the Quran or the Sunnah or the books of or the people of knowledge they just make up stories and and the likes and it has no Foundation none whatsoever no"
