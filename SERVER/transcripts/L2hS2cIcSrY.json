  "transcript": "the question says if I apostasized do I need to take Russell and say the shahada to enter Islam again if a person commits apostasy and he exits the fold of Islam is he obliged when saying the shahada to have a Russell to uplift the major ritual impurity or not first of all not everything that crosses your mind takes you out of the fold of Islam and this is a very important Point all of you should pay attention to why because I give a lot of counseling sessions for such people and they come to me and say Sheikh I had a thought crossing my mind I smiled so am I out of the fold of Islam Sheikh somebody said something and I shook my head so I think I left the fold of Islam so I take my shahada and make Russell and they do this 10 15 times a day this type of hardship is Satan driven and it would end with you leaving the fold of Islam for real because you'll reach a level where you are so distressed and anxious that you say out of pure desperation I've had it if I'm going to hell might as well leave Islam leave prayer leave everything and live like a cafe and this is to shaytan mission accomplished so first of all you have to identify whether what you're doing takes you out of the fall of Islam or not and most likely it it doesn't but you need to sit with someone who tells you this and put some sense into your head and opens your eyes you can find this in your local Masjid you can find this when your local Sheikh or someone who's wise and knowledgeable you trust and they can do this but you have to get this fixed secondly the ruling on taking Russell when accepting Islam is an issue of dispute the majority say you don't have to however the Maliki and the hembeli school of thought say that it is mandatory due to the incident of may Allah be pleased with them when he accepted Islam after being tied to a pillar in the Masjid for three or four days the prophet ordered his companions to go and take him so that he could have Russell and come back and also for the Hadith may Allah be pleased with him where he told him to have a Russell but the other Scholars the shafir and the hanafi schools of thought and the vast majority say that it is not mandatory it is highly recommended why they say because hundreds and thousands of people accepted Islam at the time of the Prophet Islam and it was never reported that he ordered them to perform Russell the Maliki and the humbbelly say yes but a kafir accepting Islam most likely he would be in the state of major ritual impurity janaba they don't perform whistle so this is by default the most likely so it would be only logical to order them to make also to counter this we may say that well it's a major ritual impurity it's a ritual not physical so by accepting Islam this cleanses the whole thing and purifies them from a ritual impurity not of a physical impurity if we can see a physical impurity it has to be washed off but a ritual impurity they should be fine with that and the evidence is that the vast majority of Muslims if not all of the Muslims were not reported to us that they were ordered to make also of course to be safe rather than sorry performing also would be the safest opinion but I wouldn't say that it is mandatory thirdly this applies to original kafirs not to one with OCD who keeps on thinking 10 times or 15 times a day that he invalidated Islam and Allah Knows Best"
