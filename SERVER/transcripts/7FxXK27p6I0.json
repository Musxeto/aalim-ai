  "transcript": "he says that when I perform Recor people often come to me and say that you're not bending your back straight of course we know that the Sunnah is to keep keep your back straight and the Prophet used to attempt to do so parallel to the ground people say that if we would put water in his back it would not fall down it would stay still this is a perfect way of doing it but if someone does not is unable to do so there's no problem in sha Allah as long as he's placing his hands over his knees so this is the minimum as long as you're putting your hands on your knees no matter how is your back this is applicable"
