  "transcript": "i mean foreign and welcome to the ninth episode or the ninth class of the islamic faith in total this is the tenth but the ninth was all for q a so we are today insha allah going to the real ninth question we if you remember last time we talked about the issue of kufur and who has the right to label people as kafir and what are the actions that takes a person out of the fold of islam so as a recap kuffur is this belief and in arabic is to cover so the english word cover the verb and the noun is derived from this from the arab word and the farmers are described in the quran as far because they cover the seeds with soil and the earth with soil and a person who is a disbeliever or a kafir his intellect his understanding has been covered by such disbelief which prevents him from recognizing allah azzawajal and appreciating his blessings and favors now kufur is this belief all scholars of islam all denominations of islam all sects and cults they believe that kuffar is disbelief and they differ in the technicalities so we ah believe that kufur can be through belief through rhetoric through actions and this is why when we come to discuss the meaning of eman what is amen it is defined as belief of the heart rhetoric of the tongue action of the limbs so kufur which is the opposite of iman also takes place in these three things whether this disbelief is driven by falsifying the evidences and this is few among the disbelievers few will actually deny and say no this is not true the quran is not true muhammad is not a messenger few but there are others who disbelieve through arrogance others who would disbelieve through rejection and being defiant others would reject and and this belief by turning away refusing to learn and there is the greatest of all this belief which is hypocrisy pretending to be a believer a muslim while inside you intend ill to islam in the muslims and you hate quran and allah and the prophet is also but you don't show that this is the worst of all types of blasphemy now the sheikh has broken these into examples so that you can understand what is meant when we speak about the issue of having kufur why do we need this we need this because so many people call me text me send me emails have counseling session i watched a bollywood movie where they were worshiping their idols is this kufur or shirk why would it be kuffar or sheikh if you're not believing in it so the question would be do you believe in it if they say yes he said yes this is kufur no doubt if you say no then this is not kufur because you do not believe in it did you speak about it no did you act upon it no so it is important to know what are the categories what are the examples of kufur so that whenever shaytan whispers in our ears and it tells us that you've committed kufar we know whether to believe him to rectify or to ignore him and move on so the sheikh says in number one a person who denies allah or his messenger peace be upon him denying saying that this is a lie there is no god there is one no one supreme allah who controls everything or he says i believe in allah but i don't believe that muhammad is his messenger this is total cover major kuffer without any doubt because the pillars of islam are five without the first pillar there is no islam to believe that there is no god worthy of being worshiped except allah so this is the first pillar of islam to believe in the existence of allah to believe in his supreme right to be worshiped and not to be associated than not to associate others with him and then there is the message of the muhammad sallallahu alaihi to believe that the prophet is allah's servant and allah's messenger if you believe that allah is one and that he's worthy of being worshipped and no one else but you refuse to believe that the prophet is his messenger and slave as many contemporaries among the christians the jews they say yeah yeah i believe in allah i believe in the oneness and allah but i don't believe in muhammad ali then this person is a kafir even if a muslim claims to be a muslim and he doubts the prophet islam or he says that whatever is told to us this is a lie this is a fabrication so he rejects it then this is an act of number two a person who ridicules either allah or his messenger allah says should you question them they will say we have only been indulging in idle talk and gesturing say was it that what was it then at allah his revelations and his messenger that you have been mocking make no excuse you have disbelieved after you have professed to be believers though we may pardon some of you we shall punish others on account of their being guilty surah tawba and we spoke about last time we spoke about the reason this ayahs were revealed and how these three hypocrites were making fun of the companions and this was an act of kufur and apostasy because it's mocking the religion and allah made mocking them part of mocking him his revelations and his messenger now having said that we have to know that a person who denies allah or his messenger he may do this with his heart so he did not say it he did not act upon it but believing that this is a lie that something is not haram or something is not part of islam this this belief is done by the heart is kufur the second one making fun mocking gesting of islam is done by the tongue so those who crack jokes making fun of islam making fun of its rituals making fun of allah or of a verse of the quran or of a hadith they had committed kuffer and they left the fold of islam because of a word they said and this is what exactly these verses of chapter 9 verse 65 and 66 talk about allah is telling them when they justified what they had done that we were just engaged in idol talk ingesting just playing around fooling around allah made that kuffer after believing so before they engaged in such idol talk they were believers once they engaged and talked about it they came out of the fold of islam number three a person who in all arrogance refuses to submit to allah and his messenger and this is found in a lot of the people their disbelief is out of arrogance so they believe in allah they believe in muhammad ali they believe in islam but they are arrogant they would not submit they are in defiant they are in defiance and such people exit the fault of islam because of that and i think i told you in one here or somewhere else i don't know that an example of it is when people are told to pray and they refuse and they're taken to the muslim ruler who puts them in jail and says you have to pray oh we will execute you and they say we believe in allah and the prophet hassam we believe in prayer but i'm not going to pray and once he sees the executioner with the sword on his head and he says to him last chance pray or i will chop your head off he says no i'm not gonna pray this person is executed as an act for doing an act of apostasy he's not washed shrouded prayed funeral nor buried with the muslims nor he is inherited he died as a kafir because of his stubbornness and arrogance and rejection of the truth when the truth came to him number four a person who denies a definitive islamic ruling a definitive not any ruling not something that is an issue of dispute for example covering the face for a woman it's an issue of dispute whether it's mandatory or not if a woman says no i don't believe is part of islam this is not kufar but if she says hijab as a totality which is mentioned in the quran which is agreed upon all muslims she says i don't believe hijab is mandatory this is an act that takes a person out of the fold of islam a person who denies intoxicants are prohibited he's a kafir even if he does not drink so we have two men one is a drunkard and he's always drunk when you ask him what are you doing he says i'm doing a major sin i know it's haram and it's prohibited but i can't stop it i'm so weak and he drinks this is a muslim but he's sinner another person never put a drop in his mouth and when he asked what what do you think about intoxicant nothing wrong with it i don't believe it's haram i hate it i don't drink it but there's nothing wrong in drinking it and he knows that it's mentioned in the quran it's mentioned in the sunnah that's prohibited such a person is not a muslim don't think twice as long as he knows it's haram yet he is denying a definitive islamic ruling this guy is bad news number five one who invents a falsehood and attributes it to allah okay someone who makes up things and attributes it to allah and he says allah said so to get out of it of a problem or to fool people or to attract them into believing him and taking him as a leader exactly similarly to what was done by the priests and the rabbis for the jews and the christians they changed the scripture that's why we have the torah and the injil the gospel the old and the new testament with hundreds of virgins different to one another changing words like they wish no problem who's holding us accountable you have the catholics having books of their own and you have the protestants having books of their own and different sects and cults why because they have fallen into this kufur which is altering which is inventing falsehood and attributing it to allah allah says in the quran it is only those who do not believe in allah who do not believe in allah's revelation that invent falsehood it is they indeed who are liars when you come and claim that allah has a son that's it no problem where did you get this from i made it up when you claim that allah like the jews say got tired after creating the heavens and the earth in six days so he rested on the sabbath but nonsense is this they make up things the jews say that allah is poor and his hands are chained to his neck the jews say so many awful things about allah this is why they are disbelievers allah says who commits a greater injustice than one who invents lies against allah or denies the truth when it reaches him is not hell the proper  a abode for the unbelievers of course the answer is yes as used in this verse and similar ones injustice is synonymous with disbelief this kind of vuln is usually associated with disbelief and shikh in the vulnerability is great injustice and transgression and then we have number six i may make mistakes in the numbering one who offers worship to any other than allah this is goes without saying this is shirk and it is in general kufur and disbelief whenever you attribute something that should not be attributed to other than allah you're committing ship allah says he that invokes beside allah any other deity a deity for whose existence he has no evidence shall be brought to account before his lord most certainly the unbelievers shall never be successful so any type of association with allah azzawajal this is ship the most independent from any type of association or partnership whoever associates other with me i shall leave him and his associates and his ship allah would abandon leave that person and abandon him and this the sheikh says is applicable whether his worship is completely addressed to any being other than allah or he considers those to whom he addresses his worship intermediaries between him and allah what does that mean some people believe and associate others with allah azzawajal thinking that this statue this rock this idol the sun the moon the stars are actual gods to be worshiped some religions have 6 000 gods rat is a god a cow is a god monkeys are gods and if you travel and you see temples even the human genitals are considered gods to them so such people are associating others with allah this is purely shirk there is another side of it where these people associate others with allah but acknowledge that allah is the only controller of the universe so they if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth they say allah who brings rain from the sky says allah who gives life and death say allah who provides for you allah who facilitates things allah everything they say allah this is known to hid which most idol worshipers and disbelievers believe in it the issue is intel the tahiti of worship the head of lordship believing that allah is the creator the one who gives life and death the one who provides one who sustains they have no difference with you they are ghee but when it comes to specifying allah with forms of worship excuse me this is where they would stand a listen no we can't do that so they say we can offer sacrifice to our idols we can prostrate to our elders we can bow to our statues or gods we can invoke and supplicate and seek refuge in the jinn when we're traveling in the deserts all of these are partial form of shirk because they are taking them as intermediaries so they want them to intercede for them and they declare that we don't worship them because they're gods but they intercede to allah and allah considered that to be also blasphemous allah says they worship side by side with allah what can neither harm nor benefit them and say these will intercede for us with allah say do you presume to inform allah of something in the heavens or on earth that he does not know limitless is he in his glory and exalted above whatever they may associate with him so muslims who worship graves who sacrifice for awliya who think that the tijani the gilani and the badawi all these peers they they visit their graves and they wipe over the graves and they seek blessings of them this is blatant shirk and disbelief even if they pray five times a day even if they fast ramadan gives zakat perform hajj because they've committed something that nullify that nullifies islam which is kufurin and shikh and they took these to be interceding for them with allah this took them out of the fold of islam and this is why the prophet al-islam was so careful when his companions said something that it would not be sheikh once a man said to him whatever allah wills and you will he got angry and he said are you making me similar to allah say whatever allah wills and that's it so even things that may insinuate not clear not explicit but things that might indicate that the prophet islam prohibited it just to protect the heat and not to fall in such blaspheming so you cannot associate others with allah azzawajal and you cannot offer any form of worship to other than allah and if you know that then you understand why we say it is totally prohibited to bow like the japanese when greeting because bowing is a form of worship and this is why we do it in salah and likewise it is prohibited to kiss the floor or to prostrate to elders or to the kings as done in some islamic countries this is blasphemous this is shikh and there's no doubt in it you don't say yeah okay maybe he's kissing maybe he's smelling the ground he wasn't prostrating no this action is an action of shirk uh i think that we will stop here and we will take your um foreign and we have a number of questions so question one is from someone who wants to be anonymous says i have not been settled my inheritance from my parents a brother of mine nominated himself as the executor of an uh orchestrated will after my mother's death he decided to give us as he wish it's over 25 years and he has not as yet settled my meager share which amount he stipulated i have repeatedly requested asked and demanded however i continue to have kinship with him as he's my brother what should i do in this situation cut off ties legal battle i'm in the grave need of my fair share please uh advice first of all unfortunately this is not the first uh problem that comes my way in this regard and it is so sad that a lot of the people who do not know allah who do not practice islam fall in such practices so many cases that i have seen where a brother consumes the inheritance of his parents and deprives his siblings from their rights including sometimes their mother i had a case where six siblings and their mother authorized the eldest to be the one who takes care of their father's wealth after he died the brother is a businessman he's rich and their father left them literally millions which they did not know about they gave him power of authority one month two months three months every time they try to contact him he's in milano he's in paris he's in new york he has business deals and they've noticed that some of their assets were sold without their knowledge so one of them called me and said what to do i said immediately cancel his power of of of attorney immediately on the spot because this man is a crook even if he's your eldest and this is one of the devastating catastrophes anyone could encounter my own flesh and blood blood flesh and blood my brother whom i known for 40 years 30 years 20 years now discover that he's a crook and is stealing my money my siblings money my mother's money this is devastating let alone when we talk about the wealth who cares about the money and he had the audacity to confront them all and say this is my doing i do whatever i want i know what's best for the family many cases come to me the father dies leaving an estate and property and cash it's the mother who takes control of everything and says to her children you're not selling the house you're not selling anything i'm not giving you a penny of the wealth until i feel that you are deserving it many many other cases what to do should we cut and sever kinship the answer is no no matter what they had done to you you should maintain kinship ties but i would highly recommend and to do that immediately to take them to court even if she is your mother take her to court because taking her to court has nothing to do with being undutiful or disrespectful no this is why courts were made why did allah azzawajal put a court system for us why did allah azzawajal order us whenever we dispute that we refer to the people of authority the muslim ruler the muslim judge etc because they can enforce the law of sharia and they can restore the rights that were taken and abducted in an unfair way so is your mother or your brother wrong doers or not the answer without any hesitation indeed they are so you have the legitimacy the right to go and complain and get whatever is yours rightfully through the court and never mix apples with oranges the inheritance is your god-given right yet no one can deprive you even if it was your father if your mother died leaving a fortune and your father says i'm taking all i'm not giving you anything he has no right take him to court him being unfair does not exempt him from sin and being accountable and there's nothing un-islamic in taking him to court because this did take place in a number of occasions at the time of the prophet sarah a son would sue his father or father would sue his son there is nothing wrong in that totally legitimate and allah knows best uh fatima says my question is what is the ruling of a salawat on a friday known as we used to read them right after than at during the time the first for raqqa usually but in friday we can't perform them because of the sermon or the khutbah is it still recommended fatima is asking about the hadith where the prophet told us that whoever prays 12 raka's in a day allah will build him a house in jannah and he mentioned two raka's before fajr four raka's before two these are 12 rakats so she says we maintain observing these prayers but on a friday we have a problem because before the jummah prayer the friday prayer the adhan is given when the imam enters the masjid and says [Music] so there's no time for us to pray the four raka's first of all fatima if you're a female it is best for you to pray home and for those praying home not in the masjid business as usual meaning you pray for raka's after the time of the ada and like any other day of the week you're not praying friday but if you insist on praying friday or if you're asking on behalf of men who are obliged to pray friday and they are at the masjid in this case they are exempted from the foruc as before and it does not account here so friday is an exceptional case and the business is as usual with the rest of the week and allah azzawajal knows best ashfaq says is it permissible to prioritize masjid over fear of covet the question is not clear if you mean that there are three masjids and you would like to pray in one of them due to the fact that it has taken better precautions than the others so they abide by the social distancing they abide by the facial mask they abide by a number of things so is it permissible to prefer such a masjid over the others answers yes there's no problem in that especially when you're afraid of being infected or infecting elderly in your family if this fear is genuine then there's no problem but those who ask such questions but at the same time they go to the gym they go to the supermarkets to go to the soup they go to business to do their work and to colleges and mix in public transportation without any taking without taking any precautions and then when it comes to salat they want to social distance and do this and that this is ridiculous only those who are abiding by it all the way should do that as well in salat and allah knows best michelle says is it enough for a muslim a female muslim to intend getting married to complete half of the deen even without having the possibility of getting married due to some issues this is in allah's hands as long as you have the intention to implement the sunnah and apply it and follow it yet allah did not choose for you that to happen now or recently then inshallah you'll be rewarded for your intention and as long as you're taking the necessary precautions to stay away from fitness such as fasting lowering the gaze not free mixing inshallah you have you would have completed your half half-deen by that and may allah appoint someone who fears him and would cherish you as a spouse in the near future this is from jannah what can we do for establishing the sharia as being common people do we have any other thing to do except preaching islam and establishing the hate the answer is no establishing sharia law it is either a general concept that applies to the whole country to institutions to individuals or it is limited to one's individual preference in the first scenario we don't have a say in that this is something that only the muslim ruler can implement so he is the one responsible for making it or breaking it you may find a muslim ruler like um may allah have mercy on his soul reigned only for two years and few months imagine he transformed the whole nation the whole um which was huge at the time till the people used to collect zakat and look for poor people to give them zakat and they could not find any he restored the rights he prevented injustice he made sure that people were equal so they had the best time of their lives after the companions due to the influence of a single person before him is what it was not like that and after him it wasn't like that yet he managed with the grace of allah through knowledge through his sincerity to transform the whole nation in two years and few months likewise you find an imbecile who comes and changes the whole nation to the opposite and he allows things to be committed that allah azza abhors and the prophet prohibited allah so this is not in our hands sharia is not in our control it can only be implemented by the head of the state and this is why we always ask allah to appoint upon us a person who fears him and who would be helped and aided by people who fear him with knowledge now when it comes to individual when it comes to individuals you and i can implement sharia in our control in our environment so i can implement sharia in my house there's nothing haram to be played no music no movies as prayer is on time women go out wearing the proper hijab boys don't smoke don't flirt with opposites gender is no free mixing we try our level over the things that we control but when i go to the mall when i go to the souk when i go to work it may not be as i wish it to be but hence this is life and allah azzawajal knows best zaji says you can't read fatiha without bismillah because bismillah is included in the seven ayats of fatiha if you don't complete fatiha in salah your salat is incomplete well if you don't ask a question properly your question can be answered i don't know what you're talking about but this is not a question this is a statement and the statement is wrong so you cannot read fatiha without bismillah this is totally bogus and wrong and we have stated that so many times but when we open the mushaf it says bismillah and this is only done in the fatiha well my friend this is an issue of dispute among scholars writing it in the fatiha and saying number one doesn't mean it is part of the fatiha because the fatiha as all scholars agree is made of seven verses the issue of dispute is whether al-basmera is part of it or not so bismillah is these are seven verses making the last two into one where the other hadith and the other scholars say no basmati is not included there are seven verses these are seven verses so it's an issue of dispute but how to resolve this issue of this future that's very easy in the hadith of kutsi the prophet says allah the almighty says i have divided the prayer between myself and my servant into two halves okay whenever my servant says allah says my servant has praised me my servant has complimented me malik allah says my servant has glorified me says this is for my servant and my servant shall get what he asked for this is a hadith the prophet did not recite alaihis al-swam bismillahi which clearly indicates that it's not part of the fatiha otherwise he would have recited it and there are many other evidences so what you have said that we you can't read fatiha bismillah this is not true the most authentic opinion is that the fatih is a separate ayah and it comes in the beginning of every surah with the exception of surat chapter 9 and your prayer is not affected if you don't recite bismillah tajuddin says i also heard that you should not use your employer's time for sunnah prayer does that include the 12th recommended sunnah prayers this is not true but at the same time it must not be abused by the people prayer time is something that people all know that includes performing wobble and praying normal people fair people would usually take between 15 to 20 minutes to do the wudu and to do the sunnah and fault prayers they would not abuse it i know people who pretend to be practicing that would spend a whole hour so they go and answer the call of nature perform mudo do the sunnah give the adhan wait until the people come and then lead them in prayer and then pray the sunnah and do that one hour who's paying for this the employer this is haram this is not permissible until unless you take permission you are allowed to pray which is normal taking 10 to 15 minutes that's the normal any extra you can do that on your own time or at least compensate them with adding an hour to your working hours schedule not to do that but most employers usually yeah they allow such room in their working hours because they can see and sense the benefits of people praying and coming back to work more energetic and more productive beside that people at work have time to make coffee to go to the toilet have a lunch break so people who fear allah azzawajal should utilize these times so that they would not exceed more than what is needed as they don't want people to get the wrong impression about muslims and islam teljudin says the 12th daily recommended sunnah prayers two before fajr four before dohur two after the two after maghrib and two after isha his question the two after isha are they the same with shafri sunnah prayers the answer is no these are different than the shaft and the witter and the schiffer and the witcher are two raka's and one rakah or the night prayer in general which is two by two by two by two and then you perform witter by playing three rakahs two plus one or three in a one row without sitting in the second blackout so a chef well with this is referring to what most people especially in the subcontinent consider to be two rakaas and then one raka with her and they usually pray this in the masjid unlike the sunnah so they pray the four rakah of risha after concluding the congregation they pray two raka's and then they pray these two plus one calling it shepherd water so tajin is saying is the two plus one included with the sunnah of richard the answer is no they are separate and the two records of sunnat is done alone and it's best for you to postpone and delay the shepherd and witter at the end of the night before fajr because this is the most preferred time for it alpha says what is the position of islam regarding fake marriages just for one of the couple to get documents when he talked about the issue of marriage and divorce allah mentioned in these verses do not take the rulings and the verses of allah as a form of mockery so marrying and divorcing marrying and divorcing marrying and divorcing this is making fun and mocking allah's laws you want a divorce go ahead just as she's about to get over her edda you say i reconciled to burden her and then you say immediately i divorced you the second time so she spends like two months or three months waiting in edda and just before it ends you say harika and i revoke my second divorce now i divorce her for the third time so you prolong the period of her not being married like this this is totally haram now going to europe and agreeing with a female that you are willing to marry her only on paper and you'll give her an amount of money so that you apply or she applies for you for a permanent residency maybe a nationality this is totally prohibited because it's lying it's cheating and it's mocking with allah's religion so now on documents you're considered to be married at the sight of allah you're not and you have no intention to marry her she has no intention to marry you so you're mocking the rituals of allah azza in the religion of allah and this is totally prohibited fahad says what is the ruling on praying sunnah prayers after praying the mandatory prayer without talking with anyone or changing the place i heard that this is not permissible please tell me about this in details the prophet alaihis was prohibited connecting prayer to a prayer as one hadith stated and in the hadith of the prophet prohibited them praying anything after friday unless they speak or change their spot and in the third hadith the prophet allah got angry when he saw someone praying in the same spot he offered his fault and he said couldn't any one of you go forward a step or backwards a step or a little bit to the right or a little bit to the left before praying meaning connecting his sunna with his father so this is these are all clear evidences that after praying the father or the jumurrah you must not do what most if not all brothers from the subcontinent do and we see them the hanafi's in masjid assalam alaikum imam says they offer salaam immediately they stand up and press on them in the same spot this is totally prohibited now you like your school of thought i know but you should like the hadith of the prophet sallam more because this is what the prophet ordered and the hadith is elsewhere some scholars said that talking can be done by saying i start from lost of allah and reading either or saying that this be etc however this is not in accordance to the hadith the hadith says he has to speak and this is why some scholars like ar-ramli in moon in said that he must speak to someone other than himself otherwise the hadith would be fruitless if everybody's offered his congregation and afterwards he said to himself okay i should get some groceries afterwards and he stands up to pray sunnah and he justifies this by saying i spoke to myself i see that no the prophet said he must speak he must talk meaning not to himself to someone else and this is the most authentic opinion knows best so the final uh question today is from tazrian and says some people say that the atharis ash aries and mataridis are all sunnah since all three are united in accepting the sunnah the divine decree of qadhar and respecting the sahaba they say the difference are of no importance to a layman is that correct answer is no it's definitely not correct the actual reason them to read is nowadays their belief in is not at all resembling their belief in allah's beautiful names and attributes are not at all resembling to allah's uh to allah and there are many differences whether it goes to predestiny or allah's beautiful names and attributes or allah's rising above the throne and being uh in the height subhanal ta'ala above everything and they disagree with that among other things so yes they are considered to be from jamaa whenever there is a contrast between us and the rafale the shia they are with us and so are the martizilla and the sufis so we cannot consider them generally speaking all the way rather they are when it comes in contrast to rafale but when it comes between us they are not part of a sunnah they are not following the way of the prophet sallam and his companions and hence the difference is not of little importance as the question says it is of great importance and that we have to identify our arteda our creed so that we worship allah according to the teachings of the prophet and his companions and allah azza knows best and this is all the time we have until we meet next thursday i leave allah"
