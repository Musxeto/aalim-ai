  "transcript": "sister came to me for advice on an incident that happened in her college she she said there was a brother who works in an Islamic uh Society Committee in the college who told her that another brother who he was re representing was interested in her for marriage what should she do because she finds this way of being approach strong and un Islamic should she accept the proposal and he approached this girl because he doesn't know her mams outside the college no this is not proper and it is UN Islamic if he is actually interested in proposing to her he should ask for her father's number and she could give him or she could write it down on a piece of paper with her father's name and he could contact him if he's interested but approaching the girl directly like this it might be he might be sincere and he might be playing around and I have received so many similar emails of girls that have been played around with unfortunately people who claim to be from an Islamic Society committee a lot of those who are attending the universities especially in uh Europe and un Islamic country countries they tend to have loose uh uh dealings with the opposite sex when it comes to quote unquote Islamic uh uh dealings so uh I believe that uh she should not communicate with this brother and she if if if a must she may give uh her phone her not her phone number her father's uh telephone number passion and Allah knows better"
