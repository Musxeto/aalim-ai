  "title": "Plucking the eyebrows from between the eyes (Unibrow) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my sister's asking more about beautification she wants to know about the eye browes when I was little and younger and was not religious I used to pluck my eyebrows and make them very thin and so forth and now I understand that it's Haram to make my eyebrows thin I stopped plucking but I've noticed that they're getting very thick and they're joining together she says I've heard before in in ASA that this is allowed on conditions um what do I do am I allowed to pluck just one or two just so they don't look strange or they don't join together in the middle well the scholars say that area in the middle is not considered to be from the eyebrows so she has the green light to remove that uh uh hair in that area but what's not permissible is for her to beautify herself by plucking by cutting or by shaving unless one or two hairs become harmful they come in inside her eyes or they forbid her from uh uh seeing then in that case it is okay to remove what is harm ful not what is ugly and alhamdulillah now medication and and be new materials are in in the market where you can use oxygen or some sort of chemicals that makes the color of uh uh the eyebrows close to the color of your skin so bleaching is allowed bleaching is it's okay it's the prophet s wasallam told us not to uh uh remove the hair by shaving or by cutting or plucking it but he did not say anything about uh uh bleaching it"
