  "transcript": "Oh Oh bismillahi r-rahmani r-rahim alhamdulillah Oh salatu salam ala rasulillah wanna he was so happy he oh no wallah a movado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we move on to another hadith that illustrates the importance of attaining kosher and kosher means submissiveness and concentration and prayer it means that your heart is present and it's not wandering somewhere else and it also means that your movement are restricted to the movement of Prayer so if I see someone spraying and every time he's doing this he's doing that he's scratching and playing with himself in a friendly way that is this is not a sign of who Shuar and anything that distracts you and prayer if it is realistic and logic you should try to avoid it and why do I say if it's realistic and logical because sometimes shape on whispers to you that this or that is distracting you and it may take you out of the loop of following the Sunnah in the sense that there are people who may complain that the noise in the masjid distracts them that the air conditioning distracts them that the smell of sorts of worshipers in front of them when they prostrate or the smell of the carpet or this or that distracts them so what do you want he says it's best for me to pray in my home where I'm not distracted and i attain a hundred percent of for sure what do we say to this man we tell them that you have gone against the sunnah and share upon is playing with you big time why because now you're making a sin for something that is or is not achievable this might be achievable it's may not be achievable besides at the time of the Prophet Alice Aslam did they have similar things that distracted them yes in the masjid the prophet as you remember once so lalala Salem completed his prayer in a hastin wig very quickly why because he heard the cry of a child and he was afraid that his mother's heart would be broken you know when a mother is praying and her child is crying what would the mother feel very bad and she wants the prayer to be concluded quickly so that she can hold her child and attend to his needs and that's why the prophetess m continued his prayer quickly did the prophet that is salatu salam after justifying and explaining this why did he finish it quickly did he say all people when you come to the best you don't bring your infant's with you know did he reprimand the woman your woman don't fear Allah you should have stayed home no and from this we learn another etiquette what would happen if a child cries in the masjid in the men's section and his father is next to him and he cries any child cries can you stop a child when he cries maybe if you choke him to death maybe but other than that the child doesn't understand that is why he's a child and you were grown up after the prayer concludes what would the people do they Chow at the man why did you bring a child you don't fear Allah you did dish and they make a lot of chaos and disturbance in the masjid I was once in my masjid praying asia and during the prayer a child started to cry and started to cry sincerely not you know playing know it as if it was hurt and after i concluded the prayer I i did i followed the sooner i prayed in a very quick manner without disturbing the prayer but instead of saying subhan allah by allah 10 they said three times enough for the worshipers to say what is mandatory and I completed the prayer very quickly after the prayer ended immediately one old man in his mid-50s started shouting at the man who had two girls with him one was about five beautiful girls what about five years old and the second one was about two and a half or three years old of course the five years old is the mother is trying to make her sister stop but she's a five years old and the two and a half years old would not stop even if you do whatever you want to do so the man was shouting you don't fear Allah you don't keep them home don't come don't the man did not say anything in reply he took his daughters and left I immediately went out from the Imams door and I met the man outside and I apologized for him and I said my brother forgive this old man he is one of the regulars who come to the message it but any you know when you're old you become short-tempered and this is a very bad thing the Prophet said Alice allows them the best of you are those who their ages are prolonged and the deeds are good and a third characteristic that a lot of the Muslims don't know in the hadith and their characteristics are good morally and the way they behave with the people is good the character is good so people usually attain the first two they're so old masha'Allah and they have a lot of good deeds but their character is as bad as it can be the older they get the short tempered the cursing and not able to communicate you know this from your grandfathers and grandmothers except those whom Allah bless them so I apologized for the man being the Imam and I try to reconcile and make him feel better by Allah the man broke into tears he started to cry you know outside there's only me and him no one else because it's outside the message it and he said share what can I do tell me it's been almost six months I'm trying to propose two families to find a new wife to these kids that would take care of them and no one is accepting my wife the mother of the girls left me and sought divorce and I'm on my own how I what to do I can't leave them alone and come to masjid so they're 24 hours with me in the car in the home wherever i go what to do and he went on crying so i said to myself subhanAllah we always judge people if we had the courtesy if we had the wisdom to give them the proper excuse now the old man inside if he knew what he had said what he had said no but Subhan Allah we always jump to the gun we always jump to conclusions and we execute accordingly so for sure is extremely important and it has to be logical and probable not something that is made up and has to be in accordance to the center so that people would not leave prayer completely I remember one of my relatives close relatives subhanAllah he was a daddy he used to give sermons and different types of messages and one day something happened to him that made him flip and before long he started to pray in the house so I visited him and I said my friend what are you doing he said in the message it I cannot attain kosher I cannot concentrate so many people coughing sneezing children playing at the back their conditioning is not on time there are smells there are this there that so i decided to pray home where I can fully attain my sure and I told him that this is not permissible what the prophecy that somebody didn't listen few months later he started to pray in a separate room his mother complained to me said he doesn't pray in any place in the house there's a designated room for his prayer he no one enters it and I told him that this is forbidden to take a mosque in your house this is the doing of the Jews it's not permissible he said no this place i'm sure it's clean no one comes in I have full kosher in it I could it was not convinced few months later I was told that he only praise when he turns off the AC and the lights and when I spoke to him he said this is the best way of attaining kosher there's no light no distractions I can't see anything and I feel as if I am in the grave look at the footsteps that Shaitaan is making him do and by Allah few months later he abandoned prayer all together he stopped praying and unfortunately soon afterwards he died so look how Shaitaan plays with you if you don't follow the Sunnah well I he plays with you immensely greatly he has full control of you because you are not abiding by the Quran and the Sunnah Soho sure is the core and the soul of the prayer that you have to try your best to get how to do this we will get some of hints when we go through hadith 130 and who will read it for us sha la Rua did I char Adela an aha the prophet salallahu luis salom prayed in a hamesha a square garment having marks during the prayer he looked at its marks so when he finished the prayer he said take this camisa of mine to abuja ham and get me his in virginia a woolen government without marks as it the hamisha has diverted my attention from the prayer this hadith mother I Shami Allah be pleased with her tells us that the prophet alayhi salatu salam received a gift from abidjan one of the Companions who gave the Prophet Alesana gift when the Prophet wore it which was a square piece of cloth with drawings on it of course drawings of marks or of houses or anything that is not a life permissible drawings markings that are permissible because we know that it is not permissible to wear something with a picture on it like people wearing a t-shirt with a picture of a singer or a wrestler or of a footballer this is haram so the Prophet prayed in it at a histological sonam and was distracted by what was in it what did the Prophet do I de esta la tercera this is what we'll find after the break so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back so the prophets allah salam when he prayed with that camisa when he prayed he was distracted by the colors by the drawings by the markings so when he finished prayer he immediately took it off and told his companions take it to abuja abuja hem is the one who actually gave it to the prophet era stato salam now look at the wisdom and the kindness and the mercy of our prophet alayhi salaatu sir if you gave the Prophet something and he returned it to you how would you feel I would feel miserable the Prophet is rejecting my gift this means that there is something wrong in me the Prophet doesn't love me but the Prophet did not do this he said take it to abuja ham and bring me his ambition iya which is something made of wool and it's harsher harder and it has no markings so the Prophet wanted to compensate abuja ham for returning his gift by asking him for another gift which is lower in price and value due to the fact that he did not want to break his heart and at the same time he did not want to pray with something that would distract him so this did happen and he was brought with an bergenia sallallahu alehiwassallaam which would not distract him while in prayer now there are a number of things that would cause you to attain Joshua and salat and this is the first and by far the most question we are always asked about how can i attain kosher and salad how can i get for sure and salad I don't know I wish I knew well actually we know but it is difficult to implement among the things that help you to attain assurance a lot is to pray to our screen a Sutra because if you remember we took a class about Sutra and the ruling of it when you pray to a Sutra this makes your vision restricted it doesn't wander around and this makes your heart also restricted that it would not wander around also seeking Allah's refuge from the Shaitaan because what causes you not to have assurance alot traitor and what is the name of the Shaitaan who comes in salat rinse them his name is hinz abbr we also know his name so we know that he is distracting us from prayer and we know him by name if we can we can arrest him unfortunately we can't so when you seek Allah's refuge from the Shaitaan Allah would grant you this when you contemplate in the different forms of vicar and in the verses of the Quran this elevates your ho sure to the highest levels remember when we said when you say Allah Haq about how many times do we say Allah hawk but in a day and the significance of that that Allah is greater than anything you can imagine also when you recite the fatty how do you say al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen you know for certain that Allah is responding to you by saying hamid any IBD my servant has praised me al rahman al rahim a lot of sponsor that and says my servant has complimented me so when you pray and you say this and you contemplate in it then this adds a lot of kosher to your tara are to your recitation and to rather than those who share Hamlin or America be near empiricism and they finish their not getting there or not even getting close to it among the things that grand chief usher is to free your heart and how can I do that you remember that it is forbidden or it is highly not recommended to pray while you are in the state of hunger and the food is being served or you are fighting the urge to answer the call of nature so those who are fighting the urge for the call of nature and they pray would they attend for sure the only thing they are thinking of when is the prayer going to be over so that I can go to the toilet so you have to free yourself you have to go to the prayer not thinking of what you will be doing afterwards because if you're thinking of going shopping while in the record you say okay they want two kilos of oranges or one I forgot semi Allahu Liman Hamidah is it low fat yogurt or full fat Allahu Akbar as you keep on thinking of what you're going to do afterwards can you attain for sure you're kosher is zero so there are a lot of things that would help you attain kosher but some of them is this hadith of Abu jams camisa and in Virginia from this hadith and other Hadees also the scholars say it is highly not recommended if not forbidden to decorate message imagine decorating messages are not recommended in Islam and some go even to the extent to say that it is forbidden and what do you mean by decorating the masjid when you are going to beautify the message what are you going to do you're going to put chandeliers you want to put signs on the wall marbles you're going to use extravagant things in the message is this part of Islam nope the Prophet Surata Sam said in the authentic hadith if you decorate your message and beautify your copies of the Quran then destruction will befall upon you imagine and this is what's happening in the Arab world in the Muslim world when they build mosques they pay four or five times more than what is needed to build a normal mosque they bring from different countries of the world decoration in the Qibla and they write verses of the Quran cool llamada hilali has a korean mob was at the end of a race car they write the verses regarding the korea and maryam mary when he entered to her prayer hall and he found provisions what does this have to do with us because it contains the word may have up so they write this in the prayer place of the mm and all of this is innovation its bid on some of them go to the extent to write a law and the other corner they like Muhammad and this is Haram this is making Muhammad peace be upon him equivalent to Allah if you say Allahu la illaha illa who for example and then mohammed rasoolallah it's a different issue but even writing that is an innovation is a bidder and one would claim okay then why is it in the Halloween why is it in mccarren medina this is not the doing of the scholars and this is not approved by the scholars this is the doing of the Turks three hundred or two hundred years ago and it remained as it is and sometimes maybe they fear that if they remove it this would cause more chaos and damage because the ignorant people the ignorant Muslims would consider this to be an insult to the two holy mosques rather than honoring them so they would accuse those in authority to be hateful to the Prophet Alice as they usually do as usually try to tarnish our reputation by you're not loving the Prophet as salam you're not doing this you're not doing that not knowing that loving the prophet alayhi salatu salam is only and I mean only displayed by following him and those people who claim that we do not draw the Prophet SRAM there the furthest away from following the prophet Isaiah salatu salam by being part of the deviant sex around us there for decorating the message is not something permissible because it calls for the distraction of people if your garment distracts you if the government distracted the prophet i'll assume how would it be then if you have carpets with decorations and markings in front of you when you're looking at them what will happen you start to look here and there and wandered around if you have tiles and if you have verses of the Quran people as well would raise their heads and look around them and this is not permissible also from this hadith we learn that if a man wears a plain dress like I'm wearing it's permissible and if a man wears a t-shirt or a shirt with markings with different colors this is also permissible because the Prophet erase allah salam had done it providing it does not have anything with soul so you cannot have a drawing of a a dog or of a horse because these are animals and you cannot have drawings of human beings or of birds etc yes brother it's just not necessary the designs of the character sometimes it is the wordings also lines which are written like somebody's in my front row offering salah and i am behind the person and the killer tis surah fatiha is being decided i am in that and i see the wordings I Love New York honest sister so I get distracted so you know will it affect my should it affect my prayer because is it in addition it will affect your prayer if you're distracted but we cannot tell people not to write on the t-shirts if someone writes on his t-shirt something that is permissible the there is nothing wrong in that yes if he writes some of them rights I love you o prophet of allah and one who's praying looks at it and he reads it it's your problem in looking at it because you should have looked at the place where you prostrate you're making your eyes wander so what is the ruling on wearing t-shirts with writings on them if the writings are ok this is permissible once I remember seeing a girl with her mother walking in the market in Saudi Arabia and the girl had writings on English on the t-shirt and I was shocked because I know that the mother doesn't know what's written and I cannot go and tell her because that is would be even a worse offense it was written on the girls t-shirt if you think i'm cute wait until you see my mother and the mother was with her i know this is an invitation and the bottom mother definitely did not know what it meant in arabic so the writing is ok it's your mistake not to look where you're supposed to look this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah Salaam alaikum what I have to la hero barakato"
