  "transcript": "today share is about the fasting on the day of Doubt because like for example last year and this year I'm fasting on almost all Shaban except like the first days or so uh so basically last year there was the day of Doubt for us because the C was not seen and all of that so I didn't fast that day of Doubt but this year this might happen again because our authorities are quite not really competent let's say it like that but since I'm already fasting almost all of Shan if there's a day of doubt I still fast it as Shand then and continue my stuff or it better not to do it no no you must not do it it's best to leave a day or two before Ramadan to avoid disobeying the prophet alaih and fasting the day of doubt"
