  "transcript": " I heard from one of the scholars um sheikhs a different person is very um showing that he's praying very perfectly with ease and attractive but in if his heart is not at rest it means that he is in that he has hoshua nifa and his Prince is not accepted so I wanted to ask her how can we protect ourselves sometimes the scholars put words that would terrify us and make us doubt our own Islam they use terminologies and put scenarios once we read it we say to ourselves whoops that's it you're done you're a dead person you're dead man why because they speak in a level that we could never match it's impossible it's difficult to reach that level so when they speak when they wrote these statements seven eight hundred years ago they were addressing Pious people like themselves they were addressing Scholars and students of knowledge people that would spend on daily basis four hours three to four hours night prayer they revise the Quran once every seven days from memory and they spend like 10 15 hours writing and teaching and and reading and doing this fully dedicated for Islam and for Iman these guys are on a whole different level than us totally so when they speak about they speak about themselves when we relate ourselves to them we think whoops I think we're Hypocrites there's no hope for us shaytan utilizes this and says why pray why do what you're doing if you're doomed both ways call it today and and do whatever you want and this is wrong first of all never despair of Allah's Mercy second of all do your level best so the term means that you are pretending to be submissive in prayer just because people are watching you this is a problem but generally speaking people are programmed to try and look good when others look at them this is in their DNA you see I walk in the street like this when I see someone from the gym or from my old friends or a sportsman and he comes and I flex my muscles and I stand up straight the moment he goes back I try to go back to my natural posture this is human nature so definitely your prayer in the Masjid is not going to be the same as when you pray home rarely you will find someone wearing this and the soap and applying perfumes when he's praying praying night prayer in Home Alone hey Julie he's praying in his pajamas or his normal dress but not as he would like people to see him this is normal the scholars maybe six seven centuries ago were talking on a different level then we're not talking to our level yes if you pray in your home from 0 to 60 in 3.4 seconds faster than eight uh not faster a little bit slower than a Tesla then you have a problem but if there is a sort of in your prayer in your home you don't look around you don't play you don't move you try to do your level best in Salat but it won't be as good as it is in the Masjid inshallah you're in good hands so don't let these things put you down and Allah Knows Best"
