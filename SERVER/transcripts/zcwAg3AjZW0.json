  "transcript": "turn regarding parenting you say we shouldn't be different between kids in giving gifts what if the gift is due to an excellent or rather outstanding performance one of one of them had wishes promised brother Ashraf what he has stated is true in the sense that hadith oh but now man even a machinima side may Allah be build it with him when al Bashir the Mossad gave his son and man a gift a slave or a property the daughter of navaja said I will not accept it and you till you make the profit it is awesome a witness so when he the Prophet Alakazam and like brothers have said he asked a specific question did you give all of them the same he said no so he asked him another question would you like them all to be kind and dutiful to you and he said yes of course the Prophet said in this case you have to be equal to them in gifts and another narration he said make someone else testify I do not witness injustice and he in another narration said it top ilaha illa-allah dickham fear allah azzawajal and be just between your offspring there are two things that you usually give to your children either it's a gifted or something that they require and need in giving and giving a gift whether he's an atheist a student or someone who's excelling in Shores and work at at at home or obedient to you a gift is a gift you cannot favor one over the other because the other would hate and envy and maybe due to his brother what the brothers of yusuf did to yusuf why did they do this their father was a prophet he wasn't unfair but he loved him more and this is why the Prophet said that this wasn't to a man who had a boy and a girl and he used to favor and kiss the boy and when the girl comes he shoves her next to him and he doesn't kiss I said you're not fair even in kisses you have to be fair with your children so this you have to be equal with but if your son goes to university and the other son goes to grade one at school the one that goes to university you give him pocket money far more greater than the one in grade one because this is not a gift this is something that they need to live if one of my children goes to hospital tonight I pay to operate on him $100,000 the others can't come in the evening say okay daddy give us equal amount you don't deserve it because he was in dire need in this is maintenance and not as giving this breaks your heart because this son is Ruby Dee intend and this one is a rebellious one yet in read in Saudi we give and read to our children like most most after Ramadan so we buy them presents we have to be equal in the presence for the one who goes to university and for the one who is 2 years of age the same financial and Allah knows"
