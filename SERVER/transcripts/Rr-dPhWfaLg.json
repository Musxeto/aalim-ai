  "title": "Life's Adornments - Episode 10 - Spending On Our Children - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] uh welcome back to another episode of life's adornments we will be discussing child rearing its benefits its virtues how do we rear our children in a manner that is according to the quran and sunnah we have alhamdulillah gathered a wonderful episode we will be talking about nothing or spending on the children as allah says and that which we have sustained them with they spend uh in accordance that is amended as a pleasing seller's penalty and the prophet saw saddam said [Music] he said spend all children of adam and allah will spend on you so we would like to discuss this crucial matter of spending how do we spend how do we do so in a manner that is pleasing to allah ta'ala and to help us we have sheikh assam looking at hakeem who's a teacher at zad academy and a teacher at kiu and he has been an imam and a teacher for over 30 years would like to welcome our sheikh assalam alaikum and jazakum and tv for having me that's a pleasure to have you as always we would like to get into the matter uh what does the quran say about spending uh on the children is before islam came to get the people out of darkness into the light the arabs used to be known to kill at infancy their daughters in uh particular and their children in general so killing the children in general was done out of the fear of poverty and allah azzawajal mentioned that in two places in the quran do not kill your children we provide for you and for them so this concept of allah being the provider is something that is essential in a muslim's belief this is why a muslim does not seek provision of allah from haram sources because you know he knows that allah abhors this and allah has prohibited this so now you add the fork of the road if i believe in allah azzawajal i should take the road that leads to his pleasure and refrain from anything that is haram dealing with my income if i don't trust allah azzawajal this is manifested in me choosing the other route which deals with prohibited and unlawful means of provision because i think that if i don't do this i'm going to starve i'm going to find hardship and this is a breach in my trust reliance and dependence upon allah so islam tells us that allah is the provider now other non-muslims before the era of islam used to kill their daughters in particular because they were afraid that they will bring shame and disgrace to the family whenever she maybe has a premarital relationships or she marries someone that the father does not uh accept or she marries someone who is lower these are all pre-islam uh um notions and and and beliefs that islam came to abolish so islam tells us it is the responsibility of the husband the father the man to provide for his family whether it is the wife that we mean by family or the whole of the family the extended one which includes the children the offspring allah those who have the ability financially they must spend from their wealth which means that if you don't have then you're not obliged to provide as for women the wives allah azzawajal stated in the quran that men are guardians over women because allah favored men over women now feminists would you know take up arms what do you mean allah favored men over women it's in black and white in the quran it is important to bring to the people's attention nowadays with social media that feminism goes against islam you cannot be and i've seen this on twitter a lot a woman claiming to be a feminist wearing the niqab and claiming to be a muslim it cannot go either you don't understand what feminism is or your islam is not correct men have a degree over women and this is undisputable there is nothing as equality in islam there is fairness and justice but there is nothing as equality allah says in chapter 3 when the mother of mary gave birth to maryam peace be upon her before she gave birth she didn't know the gender she vowed that she would be a devout servant of allah a monk according to their religion and a servant of allah but when she gave birth to a female they never had this before so she said i gave birth to a female and allah stated in the quran and a male is unlike the female so we know that men have a degree as allah stated also in chapter 4 the men have a level or a degree above this is from allah azza so in order to be a proper muslim you have to acknowledge this this at all does not mean that allah is unfair but it means that there are differences between men and women feminists say no we have to be equal said okay should i conceive child a child next year and then you will conceive a child the year follows men don't conceive what do you mean they should be equal there's no equality there is fairness according to the quran there is justice according to the quran and the sunnah so men used to kill their daughters when they are five or six years of age for the fear of a shame in addition to poverty islam came to abolish all of this and not only that islam highlighted the virtue and the reward of upbringing two girls two daughters or more and the more you have the greater reward at the side of allah providing that you are kind compassionate you upbring them well and you provide for them there are so many hadiths stating that a man must provide for his children for his family this is the job and responsibility of a man one of the 10 heaven bound may allah be pleased with him he fell sick and he thought that he was about to die so he went to the prophet isaiah he said o prophet of allah i'd like to leave my wealth in means that would benefit me i have only two girls two daughters so can i write a will donating let's say three quarters of my wealth the prophet said no so he said two thirds the prophet said no so half the prophet said no one third the prophet said one-third and one-third is a lot then the prophet elaborated allah he said to leave your children well-off is better than leaving them in need and begging people for money so this hadith tells us clearly that even if you want to give in the cause of allah building a masjid supporting an islamic channel like huda this is good this is positive but if this was on the account of leaving your children poor and in need this is not something that islam recommends okay with regards to spending we mentioned favoritism and we find like in the different resource or the evidences in the quran you'll find uh there's certain places where um where the prophet someone mentioned like uh the mother his favor has favoritism of the father or in different situations we find like the two daughters now is it such that the man in terms of his the given degree over it's because the spending hand is better than the hand is the receiving so he's better favored in a sense that he's spending and providing a sense of his responsibility and it draws when one's nearer to allah but with regards to one's humanity one spirituality is it is it equal and in the playing field like uh i understood that there's no difference between two people two human beings this up the one that has more taqwa this is correct if you look at the context so allah says that men are guardians of women for two reasons why two reasons because of which allah favored some of them over the other so this is total favoritism from allah azza we have nothing to do with that two and by which they spend upon their uh womenfolk so yes in terms of jannah in terms of good deeds they are equal allah mentioned in a number of verses of the quran that whoever does righteous deeds whether man or woman then the reward would be so and so and so and so and all of these texts and evidences if you look into them you'd find that this is nothing to do with akhirah with jannah they are all equal at the sight of allah we're talking about this life we can't have two captains flying a a plane or uh sailing a ship because it would definitely end up uh uh uh drastically in in something bad it's only one that steers the wheel the ship whatever they call it and this is why women should acknowledge and men should also know their responsibility the prophet told us that he who takes care of a widow or an orphan is like a person in jihad why a widow is this a male or a female no it's a female not a widowed man rather a weathered woman because women are weak and vulnerable so they're supposed to be unlike what we see in the media nowadays we see the physique of women but the characteristics of men they can't be women they have long hair they put eyelashes and wear makeups and short skirts but they act like men such specimens usually are not we're not related to so we're talking about when a man takes care of an orphan or takes care as mentioned in sura nissa in the beginning or takes care of a widow or takes care of his two daughters or more we find that islam highlights men assuming their responsibilities future we're going to pause here for a short break viewers stay tuned we're going to come back with more talks on spending on the children is benefits virtues what what do we find in the quran and asana ta'ala stay tuned and we'll be right back until you come back assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi [Music] and welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments where we are discussing spending on the children alhamdulillah we want to return back to sheikh asim and talk about spending now when it comes to a man spending for his family does this count as or not well it is indeed charity the prophet salallahu in a number of different hadiths highlighted the different aspects of charity so he said directing people who are lost to the right road is a charity your smile to your brother's face is a charity helping someone to fill up his bucket with water if he's taking water from a well well is a charity and he said even the morsel you put in your wife's mouth is considered to be a charity providing she doesn't bite your fingers off but this is not our point also the prophet alison and his companions once saw a man who is so agile fit quick to move you know strong so the companion said look at him subhanallah or prophet of allah if his strength and agility and enthusiasm where in the cause of allah that would have been great meaning in jihad so the prophet clarified how to look at things and this is not for his companions only but also for us he said if he is working to feed his young children he is in the cause of allah if he is working for his old parents to provide for them he he's in the cause of allah if he's working so that he won't have to beg others he's at the cause of allah so all of this shows us that when you give money to your children this is a charity and i wish we could always keep this at the back of our minds when we go shopping so many times we go shopping shopping for groceries for an hour or two we come back with big large bags we're tired we're sweating it's hot and we don't feel good about this not only that sometimes you're frustrated angry depressed because we're not anticipating the reward if we were to think of oh masha allah whatever i'm spending is for the cause of allah whatever i'm buying to make my children happy it's for the cause of allah then you would be a different person when doing that subhanallah it reminds me of the hadith of the prophet that the best of you are those who are the best of their families and i'm the best of my family i know many times people think when in spending for their families it's like burdensome it's tedious but when they go out where they see someone on the street begging they can give it to them easily and they feel like oh this is sadaka when it comes to their own families it's very difficult in in in giving in a situation and it's even worse when you go to dinner with friends and you insist on paying the check but when your family tells you we need a sandwich take away something from outside we have a budget we have a tight budget we always eat from outside this is not good which is not a good sign of a person understanding what islam really is and your family is even more deserving of this money than outsiders correct subs uh moving forward along this line if a woman finds that her her husband it's difficult in giving is stingy and giving we know the hadith of abu sufyan how was that to be understood is it permissible for her to take from his wealth and what context how do we navigate this okay first of all it is a responsibility of man to provide yes but again we have to understand what his responsibilities truly are in the sense that a wife comes to me and says sheikh my husband doesn't provide for me so i say what do you mean she said no he doesn't provide for me i said okay do you have a house she says yes i have a roof on my head do you have three meals she says yes i have food and i'm never hungry do you have clothes to wear she says yes but they're not up to date okay then what are you looking for she says i need pocket money for what just pocket money i need him to give me a salary this is not from islam if he wants to do this from his own but other than that he's providing you with the essentials medical care clothes food shelter this is what he needs to now if you want to say i i'm interested in in a chocolate cake this is something extra it's highly recommended for a man to do this and usually men would do this without any questioning unless she is obese and fat but generally speaking yes but it's not an obligation so we have to understand when women come and ask to get the permission to take from their husband's wealth what is their intent and what is the limitation of what they can take hindu may allah be pleased with her and she is the wife of abu sufyan she came to the prophet allah and we know that abu sufyan before islam was the head of quraish and at the head of quraysh should be wealthy should be giving should be generous hint came to the prophet and complained and the arabs don't lie usually they used to so she said that he doesn't give me what suffices so yes he gives but it's not sufficient so the prophet stated in a beautiful statement by saying take what is sufficient for you and your children is a very general broad word that means that that has different meanings in here ma roof is what people acknowledge and accept so if she says okay the prophet gave me a carte blanche so i'll take money from his wallet what for to buy a veron or to buy a mansion so no wait wait wait wait no one around would say that this is my roof this is transgression she said okay i'd like to buy a gucci uh uh handbag so why so i need a purse so i need to put my things in it shouldn't be gucci or armani or whatever so buy something that is not a label is not a brand something that you need actually do you have any bags you said yeah i have six or seven of them i have seven purses then you're not allowed to take money so what did the prophet mean when he allowed her and permitted her to take he allowed her to take what is essential so she needs to take take the children to the hospital the husband says no there's no need just do rukia and they will be cured yeah i'm seeing my child dying in front of me is good but allah also told us to seek medication and healing and we've covered that so she goes and takes from his wallet what is sufficient to buy medicine or to admit him to a a hospital children go to school the boy doesn't have shoes his shoes are worn off so no no he can go with the old shoes and i can see that there are holes in it i take money and buy him new shoes not a brand but yeah they don't have to be jordans but anything would do that is within reason so this is what is meant by bill maher roof the thing that is accepted in the community within range without any extravagance you know and there was a study done about the level of suicide rates across different countries and it was saying that men have higher much higher suicide rates than women and when asked the interviewing different men that were suffering from depression things of this nature they explained that they were depressed or sad because they weren't able to provide for their families uh you know unable to find employment things of this nature so this is something that stresses men out from diff across many different regions and some believe that they are responsible themselves for risk like that doesn't come from allah and in the way of their thinking it's me if i'm able to provide this reduces my my manliness my manhood i'm not even worthy of living how do we address this well actually alhamdulillah with the grace of allah that the muslims are universally known to be the least in committing suicide because they know it's part of the religion whoever commits suicide will go to hell so no matter what calamities you're facing and you think that this is the bottom of the ocean that you've reached just take a light or light a match and put your fingers and count to five you won't be able to withstand the heat so if this is worldly fire how is it going to be in your grave god knows for how many decades or thousands of years and then how is it going to be in hell fire when the day of judgment is called so anyone among the muslims community knows that suicide is out of the question those who are in non-muslim countries yes it's it's an easy way out if you don't believe in heaven or hell then what am i doing here i have so many calamities boom end of story that's what he thinks we muslims think otherwise said whoa this is the beginning of the end what what did you do man you killed yourself you got into hell for eternity then this is bad news men think more about so many things while women think much less not because of their in intellectual ability or powers rather because of the responsibilities so a woman's responsibility generally speaking is confined to her home her husband her children their livelihood while the man's responsibility is to pay the rent to provide for the children's school fees to uh pay the mortgage if he has halal mortgage or if he has haram mortgage then he has more to worry about to pay for the installments of the car to pay for taxes and to put food on the table this is why when they go to bed man has so much on his mind that it cripples him while a woman has nothing to do except the man next door her husband so she nags his head off with all her demands not knowing that he's trying but he's unable this is why if not committed suicide he'll die with a heart attack with a stroke with high level or diabetes blood cholesterol uh blood pressure so many things and in my family men die like early and women are widowed for like 40 50 years because not anything to do with gender rather than the responsibilities are overwhelming for men and allah knows best may allah give you a long life this is the end of our episode uh thank you so much for your immense knowledge and wisdom uh until next time inshaallah allah viewers stay tuned we have another episode of life's adoramas coming up inshaallah you have benefited much insha'allah we will see you soon assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi [Music] um [Music] oh"
