  "transcript": "usaid says from holland when allah mentions in surat al-qaram that he has a shin a leg this shin this leg belongs to allah and the authentic hadith in the bukhari confirms this and sunnah al-jamaa from the prophet salaam to the companions to the tavi into the all agree upon this so he says how can we refute and reply to those who accuse the muslims of giving allah azzawajal a figure and he used the word i never wrote it down and i never took the initiative to memorize it because i don't use it so how would we reply to them first of all you don't need to reply to them the people of innovation and uh of desires and whims those who follow the desires and whims not the sharia you do not waste your time replying to them yes yes but they are truth seekers no they are not they have a different mindset they follow innovation whims and desires our prophet told us that this ummah will be divided into 73 sects all of them are in hell except one and this one is those who are following my footsteps and the footsteps of the companions these people are not following the footsteps of the prophet isaiah now the quran in the quran allah tells us that this is a book that is clear in arabic so it's an arabic book and it was made clear so the arabs understand it and allah tells us in this book that he has eyes that he has a face that he has two hands specifically he did not say one hand or hands he said two hands he specified this so that there's no ambiguity of it being a metaphor when i say i have a hand over you means that i have a favor of you so i use one hand that's it but when i say two hands that this cannot be a metaphor into the arabs they know that this these are two real hands so the hadith says that allah has fingers the quran says allah has a shin so when we come to all of these things and these deviant people come and say no no no no this is not true it's in black and white it's in arabic allah is telling us the prophet is telling us no no no still this is a metaphor now why would we even go down this road and talk to them such people don't deserve to even reply to them because they're deviant so stay and remain steadfast learn your religion abide by the quran and there's a very very beautiful book that i encourage everybody to study it it responds to all of their doubts in straight forward leaves no room for any ambiguity or for them to try and maneuver because it's straightforward and it is"
