  "transcript": "what's the ruling on men wearing tight skinny low-waisted jeans first of all whether men or women the aura has to be covered and the aura of men is from their navel to the knees what's between these two points are considered to be their aura that have that has to be concealed and covered and it has to be covered with something that is not transparent you cannot see through it and it must not be tight because if you wear leggings or uh um something that is like a stretch to the organ itself it might be more attractive and beautiful than if someone was naked it covers a lot of the defects in a person's skin therefore this is the islamic attire low waste would usually lead people to think of you as being as being a punk or imitating the disbelievers respectful people don't wear such trousers where their underwear usually are visible or when they prostrate or pray you can see their uh maura and as we see in many messages unfortunately and this is saddening and it makes one really depressed when he goes into a masjid and everybody is prostrating in salat and you find a couple of men or seemingly with their butt crack apparent you can see that and if you address them after the oh sure we forgot oh the shirt is too short or the pants were too low loose this is prayer this is your aura this is your dignity so people should pay more attention to that first not to imitate the kuffar the disbelievers secondly not to expose your aura with something that is tight or transparent thirdly to be observant that allah is constantly watching you so you shouldn't do something that displeases allah and at the same time you shouldn't do something where others would take you as a role model and follow you"
