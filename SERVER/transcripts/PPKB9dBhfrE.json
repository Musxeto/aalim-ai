  "title": "Is it a valid divorce if husband threatens it? 3 divorces in one sitting, how to get a fatwa for it?",
  "transcript": "my second question is about I was like in sub-continental they consider tweed I was a three in one city so I know it consider one so if any kids have fins around me or someone asked me so do I have a right to tell those couple as a student of knowledge that you can carry your relationship it counts one or can't they call in another country scholar and ask for South come here would it be right instead of referring their own countries called viola Marte decisioning and you first recording to particular Muslim not from Quran and Sunnah I please enlighten me insha'Allah now in the subcontinent and this is the case in some of the schools of thought they consider three divorce in one sitting as three and this was the case at the time of Omar be may Allah be pleased with him in the beginning the prophet sallallaahu lives Elam's time three divorces we were considered as one so if a man tells his wife you divorced you're divorced you divorced or I divorce you I divorce you I divorce you this counts as one now a lot of ambiguity takes place when people don't know the terminologies and the concept of divorce so if someone tells his wife and I get a lot of questions about this issue I will divorce you soon you deserve to be divorced you will go to your family's house this is abusive this is trash talk a real man does not say this but sometimes he's cornered and his wife is bullying him and his only means of defense is to just threaten her so the woman asks a my divorce Nasus know the intention or what should be done in the future is not a divorce a divorce is when he says I divorce you he says it in the past tense you are divorced this is it so at the time of the Prophet as a scientist you used to be considered as one at the time of a bucer it used to be considered as one in the beginning of the time of the reign of Omar may Allah be pleased with him it used to be considered as one but later on people started abusing the right to divorce so Omar wanted to reprimand them may Allah be pleased with him and he said ok from now on if you say three times your wife you divorced you're divorced you're divorced it's over it's done you cannot get back to her until she marries another man in a legit marriage and he divorces her in a legit way then you made Mary remarry her again so the difference between jurors and schools of thought is whether to apply this ruling or this ruling and both are acceptable now for us as laymen can we cherry pick and choose whatever suits us so a couple in time of rage or not even rage in time of wanting to divorce the man says to his wife I divorce you I divorce you I divorce you and after couple of weeks he regrets it and he says to his wife I revoked my divorce because it's only one divorce I want you back the wife knows the ruling but she says I don't want to see you anymore and I want to get out of this marriage and according to some jurors this is 3 to the Hanafy for example according to the Hanafi school of thought this is over and in order for me to marry you again I have to remarry another man so they have a dispute now in such cases how to rule is it the father of the girl who has judgement is it the man who gave the divorce in such cases this is only solved by going back to the Islamic Court in your country so in India if there are a hundred and fifty to two hundred million Muslims they must have a judicial entity that they refer to whenever they have problems with marriages divorces holder separation inheritance and many more this entity is responsible in solving such cases but for a person to divorce his wife and then Google's the issue he will definitely find loopholes for some scholars who went against the mainstream or even went against Quran and Sunnah unintentionally and gave a verdict that suits you but does not suit the community and the Muslim Court and this is what we are having at the moment fatwa shopping people keep on cherry-picking whatever they want so even if there is a consensus of scholars they will find any Tom Dick or Harry somewhere and they would choose whatever errors they made and then consider this to breach and to nullify the consensus of scholars and follow that this is an Islamic therefore consumed when there is such a situation and there is a judicial entity like a Muslim Court or Sharia board or an Islamic Center that is authorized to give fatwa in such issues in India or in any other country Muslims have to go there it is not permissible for me wherever I divorce my wife for example and then this is the third divorce and she is in her she was in her menses the four schools of thoughts say that divorce is active and correct it is not permissible me for me to go to Morocco for example or to the United States of America and look for a scholar who I know after googling that he gives fatwa of the divorce not taking place so I leave all the scholars in my country in the Muslim world and the Muslim League and the whole nine yards and I just go to a random share who gives fatwa according to what I desire and what I want this is not applicable and Allah so Allah knows best"
