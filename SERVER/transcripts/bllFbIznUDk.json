  "title": "How did shirk begin on earth? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Habib says how and during which time did  start in the beginning well we have a hadith that states that between Adam peace be upon him and prophet nor peace be upon him there were ten centuries and centuries can refer to a hundred years but it also can which is most likely refer to a generation when the Prophet says are some Hyrule Peroni Arne those who want to translate pardon can say it's a hundred years a century but in the hadith Hyrule Peron the best of generations is my generation so it's not limited to 100 years it's a generation of the Companions than the Taba mean then the tablet a being and no peace be upon him gave Dawa to his people for 950 years so you could imagine that the generation of his was whoa quite long so there were 10 generations between Adam and Noah all of them were on to hate on Islam but the people of Noah came up with the concept of shirk as even advanced may Allah be pleased with him and his father said that there were five righteous men whom were considered to be among the elite of their people and when they died they wept and cried for their loss so Shaitaan the devil came to them and said why don't you build statues on their graves so that whenever you see these statues you remember how righteous they were and you would increase in doing arribada and worshipping a lot so they liked the idea and they did so when their generation was gone and a new generation came afterwards the devil told them by the way these statues where gods were idols that your forefathers used to worship asking for rain and provision etc so this generation started worshipping them so this is when sherek started analyse ogl knows best"
