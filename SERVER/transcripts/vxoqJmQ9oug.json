  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] can [Music] [Music] dear brothers and sisters in Islam Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him narrated that the prophet alai wasallam once said no one will enter Paradise if there is a weight of a Mustard's seed of arrogance in his heart and no one will enter hell if there is a weight of a musters seed of faith of Iman in his heart this Hadith tells us that the heart is the warehouse a storage room for whatever is good and whatever is bad a sh may Allah have mercy on his soul said this Hadith indicates that arrogance is one of the obstacles that would prevent from entering Paradise even if it was Tiny and small but the question is if a person is arrogant does this mean that he's a cfir that he would not ever enter Jenna this is what the concluded which is definitely wrong they follow a holistic methodology they don't come to one verse or to one Hadith and they simply act upon it ignoring everything else rather they gather and collect all evidences from the Quran and from the Sunnah and they implement it so that it goes side by side so the Hadith means that this is the reward for those who have a mustards seed of faith in their heart and this is their punishment for those who have the weight of a must the seeds of arrogance in their heart if Allah were to punish them or to reward them but when it comes to reward Allah never goes back on his promise when he tells you that he is going to do this if you do something good Allah will fulfill that folds and folds but when Allah threatens to do something then it's up to Allah it is up to his Divine will whether to fulfill that or to Pardon and another opinion is that the one who has a musters seeds weight of arrogance in his heart would not not enter J with those first patch that would go in without accountability and without any torment rather he would enter it but after a long time and likewise the one who has the weight of a mustard seed of Iman in his heart would not enter Hellfire for eternity like the disbelievers rather he would be punished for his sins but he would be admitted to to to Paradise afterwards explained this Hadith and he said that this is the ruling not necessarily to be implemented but this is the ruling it is like saying that this little tiny house a king would never stay in it so this is the ruling usually Kings and presidents don't stay in such small tiny places but there is a possibility that he may stay in there and it's like the Hadith of anas may Allah be pleased with him when the prophet saidat whoever Allah promises to reward for a deed he will fulfill his promise and whomever Allah promises to punish for a sin then it up to Allah's Divine Will i t said that the arrogance mentioned in the Hadith is divided into two types arrogance that contradicts and goes against Islam contradicts and goes against Iman and this the one who has it in him would never be admitted to Jenna such as the arog AR an of Satan such as the arrogance of pharaoh and the likes and similarly the arrogance of the Jews mentioned in the Quran they this blocks them from entering Paradise for eternity but the second type of arrogance is the arrogance over others and this is punishable like all major sins maybe Allah would punish that individual in Hellfire for a period of time and then he will be uh taken out of Hellfire and maybe Allah Asel would not punish him this is up to Allah subhana tala's Divine will it's like when the prophet saidat a person who cers ties of kinship would never be admitted to Jenna and we all know that this is a major sin but we have to understand it with other evidences that are mentioned in the Quran and in the Sunnah now arrogance is a huge huge major sin may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet saidat wasam once he who has an ants weight of arrogance in him his heart would not be admitted to Jenna an ant's weight how heavy is an ant so a man stood up among the Companions and said oh prophet of Allah one of us would love to have a beautiful dress and a beautiful set pair of shoes would that be arrogance so the prophet saidat Allah is beautiful and loves Beauty arrogance is rejecting the truth and looking down on people resenting people this is the major sin the arrogance when you reject the truth then you will be imitating Satan the first sin ever to be committed is the sin of arrogance and that came from Satan Allah says in the Quran so the Angels prostrated all of them entirely except I with the exception of Satan he was arrogant and became among the disbelievers how many of us Muslims have this heus characteristic someone comes and gives us an advice we repel it and reject it simply because the one who's advising us is a younger brother or a weak wife or someone below my pay grade or someone who is a janitor or a driver or someone lesser than me in status in wealth in lineage whoever rejects an advice due to any of these reasons he is is in great danger of falling into one of the pits of Hell Allah says about such people and when it is said to him fear Allah pride in the Sin takes hold of him sufficient for him is Hell Fire may Allah protect us how many of us when is advised we're arrogant and we reject such an advice definitely those who refuse the advice of an honest person or complains when someone brings to our attention that this is evil act and we should not do it whoever does this is an ignorant and his ignorance would lead him to hell not only that his ignorance would lead him to a bad ending and his heart would be sealed Allah Asel says thus does Allah seal over every heart belonging to an arrogant Tyrant an arrogant person could never ever understand or comprehend Allah's Universal signs and Allah's Universal Allah's legislative signs Allah says in the Quran I will turn away from my signs those who are arrogant upon the Earth without right they're arrogant but they don't have any right to be arrogant so neither they Ponder or contemplate in Allah's beautiful Creations so that he would humble himself and be submissive to him subhanahu wa'ta'ala nor he would acquire Islamic Knowledge from Scholars because he despised them he resents them he looks down upon them and he thinks that I am a great CEO I am a great uh uh rich person I'm a great uh uh official I know more than they know and this is why the scholars of the salaf used to say this knowledge is not attained by someone who's arrogant nor by someone who's shy true knowledge cannot be attained by someone who's arrogant why why don't you go ask Sheikh so and so he will teach you this Sheikh no he's from a country that is poor no he's from a different ethnicity no look at his color no look at his height he doesn't even know how to speak what family what tribe is he from this arrogance blocks them from acquiring in proper Knowledge from Scholars and those who are shy would never learn call the Sheik ask him no I'm I'm shy maybe he's going to make fun of me maybe he's going to scold me I don't want to ask but you will remain ignorant to the end of your life this is a big problem with many many of us therefore as Muslims if we want salvation for our hearts we have to Humble ourselves we have to abandon arrogance and pride because the prophet saidat no one humbles himself before Allah but Allah will raise him in status if you humble yourself Allah will raise you in status how either that Allah will raise you in status in this dun by putting you in a high position in people's hearts because of your humbleness because of your knowledge and this is why you get people that don't look strong that don't look that of authority yet Subhan Allah the love is from Allah you find the whole world loving them respecting them putting them in a very high position though they're poor if you look at the great Scholars of Islam they looked really horrible in our standards not having the adornment of this dun expensive watches cars fancy clothes no they were regular people if you see them in the street you would not even even pay attention to them yet Subhan Allah how Allah through the respect and the honor in people's heart towards them so this is raising their status or it means that Allah will raise their status in the Hereafter in the levels and the different levels of Jenna and this is one of the so many great fruits of taking care of our hearts may Allah purify our hearts and grant us to be among those who are humble and take all signs of arrogance of our hearts"
