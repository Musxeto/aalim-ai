  "transcript": "I'm a new revert to Islam and currently my new religion remains as a secret to my family members and most of my friends however uh however when I'm learning Islam I came to know that Friday prayers is compulsory for male Muslims can you adise me on what I should do for the time being well it's very simple you have to cross the line you you have to come out of the closet as they say and embrace it publicly to the people telling them that you have become a Muslim you cannot hide this I got an email about four or five days ago from a a brother who says that he had a friend who was a Hindu and he accepted Islam but he did not tell his parents about it his friend happened to have died Subhan Allah and his family created his body and threw the ashes everywhere nobody offered Salat janaza funeral prayer on him and he was given a cafir burial so he's saying telling me what what what can I do now it's too late you cannot do anything you don't want to be buried with the non-muslims in a non-muslim cemetery or a graveyard you don't want to be surrounded when you're dead with CER in the graveyards and you are being harmed by their shouting and screaming and torment in their graves so you have to come out of the closet as I've stated tell them that listen I have accepted Islam about 6 months one year whatever and I'm a Muslim and as you have seen I have not changed Islam has improved my character Islam has made me more tolerant and more obedient to my parents and more loving to my siblings therefore accept me for who whom I am now this doesn't mean that it would be an easy run and they will accept you and they will love you and embrace you you know they you might find some resistance but after a while if you are steadfast on Islam after a while maybe it's a month maybe it is 3 months they will accept you and they will appreciate your religion and who knows maybe Allah would bless you and make you one of the causes and reasons for them to accept Islam and to be saved from Hell Fire and Allah knows rest"
