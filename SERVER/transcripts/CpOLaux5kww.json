  "transcript": "how can one learn the humble Pi without having a teacher and without knowing the Arabic language since the Arabic language is needed to read the books that are not translated what will happen is that you will learn the views of the on specific issues such Asar such as purification W prayers menes and the rulings of it and the likes by reading their books most likely you will understand 75 to 80% hopefully if it's in English and there will be 25 maybe 20% that needs a Sheikh or a scholar to explain it to you because a lot of what you will read will sound gibberish due to the fact that you don't have any background in such Sciences but nevertheless yes you will benefit from that inshallah but it's not like when you know Arabic and definitely it's not like when you read it to a Sheikh"
