  "transcript": "bat from india but my question is regarding praying in the masjid i am praying alhamdulillah four time prayers in the masjid now about fajr prayer i am thinking what should i do should i pray in the masjid or at home because i'm studying in a foreign country and masjid is 10 minutes away from my flat and i'm afraid a little bit so what should i do should i put my trust in allah and go or should i pray at home why are you afraid is there any damn there may be drunkard peoples outside and police may be outside so i'm afraid little bit no this is not a genuine reason because drunkard people are there all the time 24 hours seven days a week and policemen are supposed to protect people not to intimidate them so if you are alhamdulillah in a country where there are no precedents of being attacked or lynched because because you're a muslim and everybody around you in the neighborhood goes maybe you'll find other students going with you to the masjid then there is no excuse for you the prophet isaiah did not exempt a blind man who gave a number of justifications for being unable to attend such as being blind the medina is filled with reptiles and and scorpions and dangerous things and that he does not have a proper person to guide him to the masjid nevertheless the prophet said no alaihis allah if you hear that you have to attend so 10 minutes walk is not far it's almost 800 meters maybe or a little bit less a little bit more so you have to attend the prayer and trust allah"
