  "transcript": "question sh regarding obeying the order of the ruler by the meaning by meaning ruler of what category a ruler who follow Islamic ruling system or elected by an Islamic system or who doesn't it's not clear the question it's it's um clear to me in a sense that as Muslims we are instructed to obey the rulers whom Allah Asel appointed them to rule the country we're in by default if it is a Muslim ruler a just and fair Muslim ruler or an unfair Muslim ruler if it was a Muslim who was ruling in Islamic law or a ruler who was Muslim but not ruling in Islamic law we have to obey him as long as he is the ruler whom people follow his instructions and under his flag if there it was to be Jihad we would F fight under him as long as it is not a sin that he's instructing us to do the prophet said that there is no obedience to any creature in disobeying Allah the almighty so if he instructs us to stop when the traffic light is red we have to obey now the question is if I'm living in a non-muslim country and the ruler instructs me to do something would it be mandatory for me to obey him most likely it would be mandatory for you to obey him as long as he is instructing you to do something that would make you coexist with the others so it would not be Islamic to say well I'm living in London and they all drive on the wrong side of the road which is left so I'm going to be a proper Muslim and I'm going to drive on the right side of the road despite the instruction of the uh uh the ruler there this is not logical and it's un Islamic these laws were made to govern the life of the people and there is only one way to coexist with them and that is to uh uh follow these rules and Allah Knows Best"
