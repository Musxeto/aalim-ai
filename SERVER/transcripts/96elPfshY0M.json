  "transcript": "I asked a question and this question is regarding the fasting of oath is this fasting supposed to be continued by a relative even after the person dies so basically speaking Ali is asking about a number of things that take place after a person dies so he has financial debts he has Hajj he did not perform and he has fasting that are oaths he did not perform first of all regarding financial debts it is a well-known fact that the first thing that must be extracted and taken from the wealth of a deceased is something that is needed to prepare his washing and shrouding of the body and burial so this is the fair first thing to be taking from him secondly we have to look at the debts so we announced does anyone gave our deceased money before he died and he owns he owes him debt so he comes forward he brings two male witnesses or a written statement that yes this is his signature okay we give him what the deceased owed him then we have to look whether the deceased had left behind a will or not and it is his right as any Muslims right to write a will not exceeding one-third of his wealth allocating it to any other than his own heirs so I cannot write a will to my wife to my daughter to my son to my father to my mother because they are inheriting me they are my heirs finally the fourth category after finishing the first three is distributing the inheritance the wealth to the heirs according to the division that Allah has stated in the Quran so now financial debts are over what about religious debts each individual is obliged to perform pilgrimage once in a lifetime this is part of the pillars of Islam if a person dies and he did not so scholars say take from his wealth and appoint someone to perform Hajj on his behalf and it's known as had Jill baedal is it valid inshallah it is valid what about prayers if he had missed prayers scholars say prayers cannot be performed on behalf of others deputizing people in prayers is not valid what about zakat money my father pays the cat in Ramadan he died in Shaba in shawol in 8 but because he was sick he was unable to pay it in this case it is Allah's right in the wealth give 2.5% of his cash or whatever he used to give the cat front if he died before the time of zakat there is no zakat it's over what about fasting well fasting is a separate issue because there is a hadith where the Prophet says Aslam whoever dies while having fasting to make up then his guardian or his relative would fast on his behalf so a person falls sick and he continues being sick for six months unable to make up for the missed month of Ramadhan and he dies there is nothing to be done no feeding no fasting on his behalf a person fall SiC this is scenario number two and he recovers but before he makes up for the missed days which he is capable of doing and before our Madonna's do he dies in this case his relatives fast on his behalf so if he has 10 10 sons and daughters each one fasts 3 days this sufficient for the whole month of ramadhan a person falls sick and then continues to be unable to fast for three four five years because of his old age or illness in this case it should have fed one poor person for every day missed had they because they did not do so they can do it now or fast on his behalf and I hope this answers your question"
