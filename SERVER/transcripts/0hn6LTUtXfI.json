  "title": "Imam doesnâ€™t pronounce Subhana Rabbi al Atheem correctly, can I pray behind him? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I live in India and here some of the imams not pronounce the subh they not pronounce it correctly and it's a big problem in India so should I pray behind them or should I not or what about the J prayers the prayer behind them is permissible because number one subh is something to be said silently number two maybe they are not capable of pronouncing the correctly number three it does not change the meaning basically speaking but it's wrong so instead of going around trying to invalidate imam's prayers like so many wackos who called me on daily basis daily basis they call me I know they're watching and they confess that they have OCD they have problematic mentally in but again I'm trying to slap them so that they may wake up over and over again these guys call every single day the IM says okay this is bad because this is Al but in the Salat I know he says sub and I know that he does not say this he does not say that he did this he said and they call every single day like clockwork to the extent that even 80% of their questions are not questions it's it's an obsession just to call the Sheik they know that the Sheikh answers calls for free so what the heck let me call so if I drink water after is that invalidate my my it's after oh okay thank you and they hang up so don't be obsessed of invalidating people's prayers focus on your prayer and do your job and move on"
