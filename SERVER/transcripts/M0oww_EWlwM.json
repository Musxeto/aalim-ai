  "title": "Watching & Sharing Cooking videos that has music and show women or their hands? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "her last question was about some youtube channels that deals with cooking and these are picking up momentum nowadays unfortunately people with the lock down have nothing to do but to watch these videos and then make delicious meals and the men get fatter and the women are fat by any default and and it adds to their problems anyhow if they do the proper exercising they watch their diet and they eat healthy there's no problem she says there is music and there might be showing off the hands and sometimes the woman herself come so can i watch this if you mute the music you're a female so watching women cooking there's no problem in that can i share it if it has music it is not permissible for you to share because you will not guarantee that people would mute the music like you had done can i like it the answer is if it has haram definitely not because liking it is endorsing it and we as muslims should not endorse it yes we may benefit from it if it's a good meal and a good recipe while staying away from haram but but this does not justify us sharing it with others and allah azza knows best"
