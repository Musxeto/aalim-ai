  "title": "How to seek refuge in Allah from satan in prayer & outside prayer? Dry spit 3 times? Assim alhakeem",
  "transcript": "yes um um yeah i have a question allah says in the quran to speak refuge in aim from satan when something bad or we have whisperings of satan comes to our mind but can we ignore this when we are not alone when we are among people i don't understand if the whispers are with you whether you're alone or with people why wouldn't you seek refuge in allah by saying doesn't make any sense unless you're happy with these whispers and you don't want to seek refuge in allah and that would not be a normal thing for a muslim to do so do you care to explain a little bit more like when like if i should have a bad whisperings i must look um at my left and seek refuge in allah no no no no no no this is when you are praying when i'm praying and i get whispers of shaytan the sunnah is to say and to spit three times to my left if there is someone standing to my left it wouldn't be a hey what are you doing no then i should spit underneath my left foot like this and it's dry spreading not moist and and and liquid uh filled spitting it's just dry blowing to ward off shaytan if this comes to me when i'm sitting normally among people or in a cafe or in my home i just stay out of shaytani regime there's no splitting needed or required okay must i do this also no only when you're praying not you're in the mosque or in the home or in the cafe only when praying you do this even if people are around me if you're praying and people are around me i can look at my left also while praying or you're not praying while praying yes no problem if you don't look uh um to your left you can do it to the left foot of yours okay okay thank you very much you"
