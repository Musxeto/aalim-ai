  "title": "Ruling on paying security deposit when renting a house (huge deposit Riba?) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "namira from georgia she says they ask us for a deposit and i specifically ask her is the deposit normal so if i'm paying rent a 12 000 a year 1 000 a month for my apartment before getting in before moving in they asked me for 500 or 1000 or two thousand dollars as a deposit which will be returned to me after i even leave the the apartment after they check whether i had left some damages or not this is halal there's no river in that this is a deposit for security what's happening in other countries like india and pakistan instead of paying 12 000 dollars a year they come and give fifty thousand dollars or a hundred thousand dollars as a deposit whoa that's a huge amount of money and then they offer me to rent for five dollars a month which is peanuts so this is actual riba because the hundred thousand dollars deposit is an actual loan and the interest over that loan is me staying in their apartment for literally free and when i check out three four years later they give me the hundred thousand back which is my loan to them this is prohibited and allah knows best"
