  "transcript": "I would like some advice regarding alternatives for Children's shows like cartoons so my daughter she is seven and a half months old and sometimes I might be working outside or going outside for some reasons and her mother is at home with her and she has to do some work maybe cooking or some other chores so we and she is also awake the daughter and there might not be much other options just to put her in front of the TV and turn on the channel cartoon channel so and I only I really hate this option because cartoon channels as you are aware of you know filled with music and other literal garbage and so I just wanted to know what are the options that we have what can we do regarding this because my daughter she's only seven and a half months old and but she's already uh hooked into this and these shows okay Grand your daughter to grow up according to what pleases Allah azzawajal it's a huge and Grave mistake for you and your wife to get your daughter addicted to such shows from an early age seven and month half seven and a half months old what is this this is preposterous take the TV set and throw it out of the house she'll cry for a few days and she'll get acquainted with not having one in the house but if she grows watching it at this early age when she's two she would like to watch more and more when she's five she would like to watch more and more when she's 10 she starts developing a taste for anime for a Korean pop culture from this and that when she's 14 she's looking for PG movies and Anime animated would not do she wants action she wants violence she wants nudity you brought all this up I brought all of my children alhamdulillah without having a TV set in home and with the grace of Allah 12 of them memorized the full Quran by heart before they graduated from high school would I didn't put any effort in that with the grace of Allah uh some of them teach in universities some of them are head masters of international schools some of them are entrepreneurs and doing well in business this has nothing to do with bringing it's it has to do with the parents who just don't want to cater for their kids so they just throw them to the TV set or give them a tablet and let them watch whatever they want on YouTube this is throwing them in fire so you have to definitely put an end to this and may Allah protect all our children"
