  "transcript": "okay I am doing Ria on myself these days because I fear that I have evil or black magic so my question is me can I resite rugia not loudly I mean silently if you recite the Rya while moving your lips and tongue silently this is 100% valid so if you do it by just reciting it moving your lips and tongue this is valid it's best when you do it on water before drinking you say till the end and then blow on it and drink that's best because the impact of what you recite verbally to the water and how it impacts it with the grace of Allah and then impacts your body is noticeable and uh been tried before now"
