  "transcript": "is the Hadith of the Prophet where he says don't envy one another and don't B one another out of for raising the price and don't n hatred or enmity and don't give your back to one another and don't enter into a transaction when the others have entered into that transaction and be as fellow brothers and Servants of Allah the Muslim is the brother of another Muslim he does not drown him let him down or look down upon Him tawa is here and the prophet pointed to his chest three times it is sufficient evil for a man to look down upon his Muslim brother every Muslim is taked to another Muslim his blood his property and his honor I believe that we stopped last time at talking about what a Muslim should be towards his brother Muslim and in this Hadith the prophet is instructing us that we should be brothers to one another and that we should not think that our Brotherhood is a Brotherhood of color or of ethnicity it's not a Brotherhood of the land we belong to being a citizen or not it is the Brotherhood of Islam and that is why Allah the almighty says in Surah Alat verily the believer are brothers this means that if I am from a country I'm from Saudi Arabia for example that my brother in Bangladesh or in Indonesia or in the United States of America though we have different cultures different color and different background though we speak different languages yet they are considered to be my true and real brothers despite that other Saudi person who is a Saudi like me who's an Arab who comes from the same country but he has a corrupt belief being a Shiri for example so my brotherhood towards those who share my belief and share my manh my methodology and they also consider sacred and above all criticism the same things that we believe in such as the Quran the Sunnah and the companions of the Prophet they are my true Brothers not that person who talks and Slanders the companions of the prophet and the prophet goes on to say that one of the rights and obligations of being Brothers to each other is that the Muslim does not wrong his brother Muslim and he does not look down at him upon him and he does not let him down so it is few options that we have either the Muslim in inflicts harm and wrongdoing to his brother Muslim and this is totally [Music] forbidden or he is a passer by he just watches wrong and harm being inflicted upon another Muslim and he is negative he is passive he does not intervene and he does not do anything and and this person is also sinful for doing what he is doing the prophet said in the authentic Hadith be victorious or help and Aid your brother whether he is the aggressor or the person being oppressed so the companion said oh prophet of Allah giving help to our brothers when they're being oppressed is something we understand but how can we help our brothers if they are the aggressors the prophet told them by preventing them from oppressing people by preventing them from inflicting harm and unjust unjustice and unfairness to others so this is what a Muslim should do you should help your brother whether he is the wrongdoer or the one who's being uh uh wronged and then the prophet said piety righteousness is here and he pointed to his heart three times or pointed to his chest three times and this is an an indication that Allah the almighty looks at our hearts Allah Almighty looks at our souls not at our physiques not at our wealth and clothings and the way we look and that is why as reported or narrated in Muslim the prophet said Allah does not look at your bodies and your colors or how you look and another narration oh at your wealth but Allah looks at your hearts and your Deeds"
