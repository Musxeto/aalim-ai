  "title": "Am I sinful for taking my prayer mat to the masjid if its causing gaps in the rows? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I take my prayer mat to the Masid because sometimes I may have to pray in a place where the floor may not be clean I notice Sometimes some Brothers Stand a bit far from me to avoid their feet touching my prayer mat but it's just it is not always the case but and this also creates a gap between the row so I was wondering am I sinful if I take the prayer mat if there is a legitimate reason for that no you're not sinful however you have to fold your prayer mat so that it fits exactly your uh standing position and where you prostrate rather than have a prayer mat that takes the place of two like you so if you fold them so that you can pray on them no one would stay away but if your prayer mat is this wide and you stand in the middle and there is like one foot here one foot there nobody is going to step on it most likely and Allah Knows Best"
