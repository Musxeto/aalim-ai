  "title": "My chef dad serves haram food at retirement home & asked me to fill form, is it OK? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Allah um my dad is a chef at a retirement home and he serves her own food there and he told me to help him complete this annual test paper for workers working with seniors which is required by the government and if he doesn't complete the form he will be fined so can I help him in this yes you can help him in this because generally speaking servant serving the elderly in the retired homes is generally speaking halal this aspect of his work where he has to serve them Haram food by itself is Haram and this may constitute like four percent or five percent of his entire work of taking care of his duties so I I see no problem in helping him while giving him nasiha an advice and Allah Knows Best"
