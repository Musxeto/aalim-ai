  "transcript": "the next question is is it allowed to a woman committed Z which res to pregnancy is it allowed to do what to to to marry who made the zena the woman I know who made the zena with her it takes two to tango she didn't do it alone on another planet yes huh and is the man asking is the C culprit her partner or someone else oh so many people know the woman I I'm not very good in social media so apparently I have to learn okay no it's not and the marriage is invalid definitely the majority of Scholars say if a man fornicates with a woman and they get married whether she's pregnant or not the marriage is invalid the contract because she's not chased and we cannot say that she is pregnant or not pregnant we don't know if she's pregnant the vast majority say from him is invalid and this is something that to be looked into Case by case but this is what the vast majority of Scholars say now for someone else who is doubtfully a real man to come and marry someone whom he knows she's pregnant from another man what is this I might as well marry a a public toilet what it's like reusable condoms you don't have those what are you doing this is totally insane for a Muslim to do so the marriage is definitely invalid"
