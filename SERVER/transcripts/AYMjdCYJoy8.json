  "transcript": "foreign forces uh the other is active salary from a French or paris-based multinational third is salary from attending meetings of Naval shipping Corporation if the pension comes through the fixed deposits which mostly doesn't contain interest but the rest of my salary is coming through deposits they keep in interest based Banks and it does carry much amount of Interest so am I only supposed to rely primarily on my pension for my own expenditures and for my personal zakar as well because I feel it is less likely to have River and leave the salary that I'm sure has more of it because I don't exactly you know I can't keep track of it and um does a person need wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait how many questions are you asking uh this is one question no these are seven questions first of all the other two sources of income that you're getting you're getting them as freebies or you're doing actual work where you're getting paid for through services come again it is I'm asking in the context of actual services like attending meetings and then being paid for it okay these meetings listen listen listen I I understand your questions so don't make a statement or a lecture if you please because our time is limited when you do these services and they pay you the services are Halal or Haram the services that the person gives them their Halal for example and don't give me examples listen to me now the companies you're serving are Halal companies or their interest-based companies like Banks and insurance companies one is a multinational it has different sections and the other is a naval shipping Corporation board okay so first of all any work you do any service you do the income you're getting is not defined by whether the company deals in riba or in Haram or Etc and they're giving you money accordingly it deals it it is defined by two things one is my service Halal or not so my service is halal I drive a car I do secretarial work I do HR this is totally legit number two the line of work of the company that is paying you they manufacture um Goods Halal Goods they give consultation over medical issues there's not no riba in their line of work there's no insurance there's nothing Haram however they may put some money in the bank and they get interest money which is not their line of work so whatever service I'm providing for them and they're paying me this is totally halal because if you look at all Muslim countries you will find that all Muslim countries deal in Riva so I'm a teacher in a public school and my country deposits billions and billions in interest-based backs Banks and takes riba and they give me my salary so is my job Haram of course not the sin is on them because this is a country this is a government the whole thing is halal but they have these aspects of Haram so there's nothing wrong in what money you're making"
