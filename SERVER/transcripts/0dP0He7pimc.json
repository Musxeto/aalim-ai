  "transcript": "ahmed from sweden he says that i wasn't a practicing muslim and like many practicing non-practicing muslims in the west everybody is putting tattoos so everybody has some ink on their body unfortunately and now it's becoming a trend even among the muslims they see movies they see athletes they see soccer players with all this ink on their body so horrific so ugly and they would like to have something just to show that they're sophisticated i've seen people memorizing the quran half of who used to be hafel who drifted and shifted and went way way away from islam because they listen to their demons they follow their whims and desires they have no personality they have no attachment to the dean except maybe a few prayers here and there and few charities putting tattoos on their arms women are putting tattoos on their hands i don't know if they have this trump stamp we don't see this alhamdulillah but they have tattoos on their feet they have tattoos on their legs what is this you guys are muslim didn't you know that the prophet said in abdullah narrated in the sahih that the prophet isaiah said i'm cursed those tattoo artists and those who have the tattoo done to them yeah yeah but this is understood in a different way maybe the hadith is not right maybe it's in the sahih yeah yeah but this is not logical sir then you have an issue with submission to allah like the issue that iblis had why didn't you prostrate to adam yeah i'm better than him oh so you have it's an attitude problem so the good news is you as long as you started practicing and you repented to allah from these tattoos and you have deep remorse and you're asking allah for forgiveness allah will forgive you now the issue is what to do with these statues i don't know if medically can be removed alhamdulillah and there's no harm on you and you can afford it then go ahead for it if not then there's no problem it does not impact your salat it does not impact your purity but you have to keep it covered all the time so that you would not be a billboard for other muslims to follow suit so you try your level best to cover them if they are coverable but if they are in your face may allah forbid or in your neck and you can't cover that then alhamdulillah there is no sin on you as long as you have repented and allah azza knows best this is all"
