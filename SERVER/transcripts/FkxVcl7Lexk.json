  "title": "If I don't send salutations on Prophet ï·º before making dua, will my dua be rejected? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is that Prophet Muhammad Sall s alai wasallam said that every Dua is blocked unless you recite the before an end of your Dua so if I did not do it will my Dua will be rejected no your Dua is not rejected but the fear of it not being answered is there any Dua that you say has eates so the etiquette is to praise Allah and then to offer salutation upon the prophet who said any Dua that you don't offer salutation upon me is blocked and afterwards you ask Allah for what you need without transgress transgression and without any sin in it now if I don't do this if I do not follow such etiquet if I don't say my Dua at preferred times like between and the third night of the uh the third the last third night of the uh night and um when the rain is falling down and the rooster is calling before fer Etc if I don't select these times and I just make Dua will it not be accepted the answer is yes but it's most likely to be accepted if you do them at these specific times and likewise it is mostly to be accepted when you offer salutation upon the prophet Alam but if you just say oh Allah Save Me Oh Allah cure my illness without doing these steps of etiquette then it is heard and Allah says in Surah whenever your my servants ask you about me tell them that I'm close I respond to whomever calls me then this is sufficient for us and Allah Knows Best"
