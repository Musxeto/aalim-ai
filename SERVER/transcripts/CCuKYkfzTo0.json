  "transcript": "unus um was very afraid of my father and when I learned that um if I'm forced to eat during no very fast I don't have to make up that day the things there were some times I wasting far or making Ramadan um I wish I got scared of that and I and I think I ate now the thing is if I look back then I don't know whether I can really say okay I was forc otherwise I I got this I would get the stick or I just was afraid and there was no real here like we can't say I was really F so children know make up these cfar days in the Ramadan first of all we know that compulsion is an excuse however compulsion has to be genuine and real someone comes to me and says sheh I divorced my wife out of compulsion I say to him divorce due to compulsion doesn't take place but um excuse me can you elaborate on how were you forced to divorce he says she she came to me and said if you don't divorce me I'm not going to cook lunch for you there's no genuine compulsion here she doesn't want to cook lunch for you go and buy food from outside don't eat lunch skip it you're not going to die so this is not true compulsion you divorce the divorce takes place she says to me if you don't uh divorce me I'm going to strangle you look at you you're 6'4 and you're a strong man and she's a weak woman she can't strangle you no this is not acceptable but if he said Sheikh we are uh uh she com she forced me to divorce because she was standing at the balcony from the seven floor and about to throw herself and she's crazy she did this many times said whoa whoa whoa okay in this case no your divorce is invalid because that's real compulsion if she if he says that she was holding a knife to my throat and she was threatening to uh uh Slaughter me so who okay the divorce doesn't take place so again we come to your father with the stick first of all my advice to such parents to fear Allah what are you doing you're raising cattle you're raising your own children and why do you force them and beat them up for worshiping Allah Asel if they were to wear a cross or to go to a temple and and and worship a cow you would be happy come on fear Allah you can not deal and treat your children in such a barbaric way especially when they are worshiping Allah otherwise you may fall into the danger of exiting the fold of Islam so this is my advice to such parents secondly if you're not able to remember whether you were forced or not but you're sure that you were uh uh that you skipped fasting and you ate this day has to be repeated because you don't have certainty of finishing it and completing it for the sake of Allah and Allah Asel Knows Best"
