  "title": "Why do we refer to Allah as ' Him '? #Assim #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I have a question uh that why we uh call Allah him why we refer Allah as him Allah does not have a gender but due to the fact that in Arabic and in English we have two genders masculine and feminine so we refer to Allah with the most prominent most honorable and the higher of both of each and that is the masculine pronoun this is what Allah subhanahu wa taala used in the Quran to describe himself so we stick with that and we use it and Allah Knows Best"
