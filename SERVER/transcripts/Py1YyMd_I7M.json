  "title": "Why should we recite ayat al kursi after fard if we're going to be cleansed from sins in hell anyway",
  "transcript": "Amar from the UK um my question is um um I read on your one of one of your question and answers that someone asked about um readingi after the F prayer and if that person commits major sin there is a POS you reply you in your reply you said that it is possible for that person to go to hell to get purified and then enter Jenna so my question was if I religiously after every prayer if I read what's the then what's the benefit because um if a person who does not read will also there's a possibility of him also ending in hell and if I also read it there's a possibility of me also ending in Hell may Allah protect us but to get purified so what's the or the benefit of reading ayat in that situation first of all we do not deal with Allah like we deal with traitors and Merchants 1 + 1 equals 2 it is not like this we are in need of Allah and of his mercy and we cannot calculate things and say okay I did and this expiates and erases everything in the past so I have credit to make sins in the future secondly the Hadith is authentic whoever recites aat Cy after each nothing will come between him and entering Jenna except death now this Hadith is authentic and we have a number of scenarios if I abide by your logic to this Hadith and say I have a cart blanch so I can go clubbing tonight I can go for a one night stand I can drink booze I can lie and cheat and business as usual I will go to Jenna this is scenario number one do you believe in this because if you do then we have a problem scenario number two is the Hadith is authentic but we understand it as if someone avoids major sins and hence minor sins are forgiven with the grace of Allah when we avoid major sins as the Hadith between whatever is between to Ramadan to Ramadan the five daily prayers is Forgiven as long as you avoid major sense so we can understand this Hadith of aat Ali in this way and this is one of the ways of understanding it but certainly it is not an endorsement for entering Jenna regardless of what you do of major sense no one in his right mind would think like this because you just imagine the consequences of me praying five times a day religiously observing to read ayat afterwards and I do the whole major sins that are found in the book counting that all will be erased and gone and I will go straight to Jenna this doesn't uh um work unfortunately uh or fortunately otherwise we would be living in chaos and Allah Knows Best"
