  "transcript": "for ald after the battle of Badr the prophet sallallah alai wasam had a number of military Expeditions especially around the area of Medina because of the bedwin and the tribes around them were encouraged to attack Medina thinking that the Muslims were weakened by the war and attempting to score a point with the tribe and the poist of quray among the attacks that took place on Medina was a Expedition an expedition by the name ofat and is the flower that people make dough with and bake Abu sufyan har who was the leader of the Caravan which escaped bad he took a vow on himself not to have a total bath not to shower at all until he invades Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and the Muslims until he raids them and this was a vow that lots of the Warriors do which means that they will not have any intimate relationship with their wives until they do what they want to do so in the middle of the night he took in secret 200 Riders and they rode to Medina at night and they hid so that no one would be aware of them at first he went to a leader one leader of the Jews his his name was H and he knocked the door but H did not open the door for him he did not want to break the treaties and the the the agreement agreements with the prophet Alam so he went to another Jew and his name was Salam musim and this Jew opened his doors he hosted Abu sufyan he gave him wine he fed him and he told him about everything Abu sufyan needed to know about Medina he gave him all the information needed so this Jew did not honor the agreement with the prophet Alam Abu sufyan sent a Detachment to an area called and there he instructed his s soldiers to burn to cut off the palm trees they were met by one of the ansar and a companion of his they killed them both and they fled Medina the minute the prophet sallallah Al wasallam knew about this he came after them he went after them and tried to catch them but they were fast Riders they were on horses so they traveled in in a very fast f Way fleeing Medina abandoning everything and when they felt that they were too heavy to travel fast they threw the bags of flour that was with them and that is called and that is why this battle is known to be the Battle of and the prophet Sall wasallam once he recognized and realized that he's unable to catch up with them he went back and the companions collected these bags of flour and food and what it was uh used by them the second year of Hijra was over in the first month of the third year the month of muharam the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam his reconnaissance people came back to him informing him that the tribe of and the tribe of muharib are compiling an army to come and attack the outskirts of Medina and there were also Nomads and bedwin so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam prepared the biggest Expedition military Expedition before the Battle of uh this was the biggest of all because it it had 450 Warriors he took this Army and he went to the area of these tribes the minute they saw the prophet Alam as usual they escaped and ran away and they went to the uh top of the mountains and the caves and they hid there the prophet Alat wasam stayed one full month in their area the whole month of saf he stayed there camped just to show the Arabs how strong and powerful they were and the people could never come back to their the same place place it was reported that one of the pothys his name was darur as the first day or the second day the prophet s wasallam and his companions were setting camp and it rained slightly so the prophet sallam was napping under one tree and his sword was hung next to him D came and he drew the sword of the Prophet Alam and the prophet woke up and he said Muhammad who prevents you from me now who protects you from me who's the man so the prophet said Alam who protects me Allah and the guy trembled and the sword fell so the prophet took the sword from him and he said now who protects you from me the man said nobody and the prophet let him go the man on the spot embraced Islam went back to his people and instead of provoking them to hate the prophet alham he called them to Islam and they accepted Islam the prophet Alat wasam used to have guards and the companions used to guard him because they loved this they've enjoyed guarding the prophet Sall wasallam as they thought it was one of the greatest Deeds they could offer until Allah revealed the verse of the Quran that Allah Almighty protects you from the people so the prophet looked at them and said said go away I do not want any protection because Allah Asel has given me his protection and since then nobody guarded the prophet when they went to Medina after the battle of Badr after these military Expeditions there was one prominent Jew who did not swallow this well he did not like what he was hearing and when they told him that the army of Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam won in Badr and that the leaders of qur died he was in pain and Agony the kings of people the rulers of the Arabs are dead this is not true after the battle of Badr finished the prophet Sall wasallam sent two of his men of and z may Allah be pleased with them to the people of Medina one to go to the top of Medina want to go to the bottom of Medina to bring them the Good Tidings that the Battle of bad Was Won by the Muslims the Jews when they saw Z riding on Al the camel of the Prophet Alam said we know who Z is do we Z no I don't do you know Z I've heard of his name well Z was the adopted son of the Prophet Alat wasam he was a slave and he was given to Khadijah the wife of the Prophet Alat she gave him to uh uh the prophet who freed him and considered him to be his son and then he claimed it claimed him as his adopted son and he uh uh notified everyone in Mecca at the time that this is my son if I die he in hurts me and if he dies I in hurt him this was the practice at the very beginning until the Quran was revealed Banning adoption so in Islam it's not it's not allowed for us to adopt in the sense that the child that I'm adopting does not bear my name he's not actually my son but having said that in Islam we're encouraged to sponsor and support or orphans in the sense that if you see an orphan and you take him into your custody he is called after his father he is not a mam to your wife or to your daughters he is not a brother to your daughters but by supporting him and by giving him provisions and so on in your house the prophet says sallallah alaihi wasallam whoever takes an orphan to his uh uh uh custody and in his in his house he is with me on the day of judgment like this and he pointed out with his two fingers so that means you're so close to him so adoption is forbidden you're not allowed to adopt a person and say that he is my son and he's named after me or after my family and likewise it's forbidden for a woman to be called after her husband she has to be called after her father and this is an Islamic tradition and know I don't know how free women are in the west when they have and when they're forced to change their names and god-given names to their husbands names anyhow the prophet sent Z who was known to be the adopted son of the Prophet but not anymore on his camel so the minute the Jews saw it saw this they said well Muhammad has died in the Battle of Badr and the evidence is that Z is on his camel and they were proven Wrong by the grace of Allah we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back learning how to recite the Quran properly learning the meaning of what we recite concluding the from the verses which we recite trying to implement what we learn in our daily life would listen to The participants and the guests will take your phone calls we're going to recite life we listen to your recitation and we'll correct it according to the rules and regulations which will state in each episode now your dream will come true asalam alayum after the prophet s wasallam and the Muslims won the Battle of Badr and after the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam besieged the tribe of B the Jews and he ordered them to leave and he sent them to their Exile in sham and they were Jews one Jew who was so rich and Powerful started to annoy the Muslims and disrespect the agreements between him and them he was so frustrated when he learned that the leaders of quray were killed were slayed on the Battle of Badr and he was outraged the kings of the Arabs the rulers of quray and for whom for a bunch of no no no one of Muslims so-called Muslims it was like a shock it was a severe shock and blow to to him to the extent that he went in mourning to the people of qur giving his respects and sympathies and trying to provoke them to come and fight and Avenge the dead ones and he was telling them that you had no right to lose you shouldn't have lost they are no one they're Farmers there bunch of nothing so they asked him a straight question as a Jew as a scholar of the books the Old Testament who's on the right path and track is it Muhammad and the Muslims or are we on the right path and track who's better at the side of Allah now any fair and just person would tell them that those who worship one God who worship Allah are far greater than those who worship 360 Idols so you pagans by no means are close to him yet because of his arrogance he said no of course you are way better than he is and that is why Allah revealed the the the verses of the Quran condemning his actions and condemning his false testimony that the pagans are better than the monists are better than those who worship Allah alone and when he went back to Medina this was not the end of it he started saying poetry condemning Muslims slandering them ridiculing their religion and also he started saying love poems against the ladies of the Muslims the wives of the companions their daughters and this was outrageous because as you recall poetry was the prevailing media uh at that time tool at the time so the prophet saidat to his companions this man's name was asra the Jew so he said to his companions who would relieve me from his nuisance who would relieve Islam from his evil acts so Muhammad musl said I do that with honor prophet of Allah and he chose four other men with him but he requested the prophet Alat permission to say something that would in other circumstances be considered to be things that nullify a person's religion person's belief and Islam so the prophet gave him this permission this was an assassination attempt against this enemy of Islam and before we go on the normal question would be is assassinating people acceptable in Islam well generally no but this was not an assassination attempt he was not the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam was not killing him for the sake of killing he had to be executed there's no doubt in that because he did not honor the agreements and he was slandering Islam and he was ridiculing the Quran and he was talking about the female companions of the Prophet Alam in a bad way and you remember when a state crime against excuse excuse me it's a State Crime yes and by itself when someone talks bad about a woman by talking bad we mean he accuses this woman of adultery this is unacceptable in Islam any person who talks about a Muslim woman and says I've seen her having sex with a man or she is a prostitute or she is this or that which is an an insult to her honor and dignity if he does not bring forward four Witnesses he should be lashed 80 times for what he said so if if he brought only three Witnesses that's not enough he has to bring four witnesses that seen the actual act so this as needed to be executed the prophet could have easily Alam go there and executed him but he did not want his fellow Jews to stand up which would cause more Bloodshed he wanted the prophet Alam to minimize the casualties not from the Muslim side we have the upper hand but from their side because he would be defended by his people and lots of his people would die they did not have to a hand in what he did it's his own responsibility so the prophet s wasallam sent Muhammad Muslim Muhammad went to and he said you know me I know you we've been friends for so long this man he's a pain in the neck he's been asking us to pay charity and sodak and zakat puru we don't have money all what he asks is for money and money money so relaxed a little bit and said well you haven't seen nothing yet there is more to come this man is going to do this and that for you so Muhammad masl said you're a rich man can you lend us some money so he told him yes I can lend you some money but what would you give me as a guarantee that you're going to pay me back or we called as mortgage so what's what would it be so it was like a trick or something yes they wanted him to feel safe and secure so Muhammad musl told him what do you want as guarantee so said um give me your women keep your women with me and when you pay me back I'll give you your women back so Muhammad told him are you crazy you're one of the H most handsome Arabs around how would you want us to guarantee our wives and daughters with you you will seduce them by by no no no way no other way so he told them okay then keep your children your kids as a guarantee in my Fortress and Muhammad said again this is unacceptable because our sons will be slandered till they die that they've been given as a guarantee for a dollar or two for a Dirham or a dinar so this is an insult to them so asked him then what is your guarantee then he told him I think that the best guarantee for us is our armor and swords and knives we're going to get you the Weaponry this would be as mortgage to us and to guarantee that we're going to pay you back I actually heard the tradition of Arabs is that if a man did not carry his weapon he was considered foolish so was this like like this offering was like a big as big as the deposit of the wives and and the children no it it wasn't at all because your weapon you can buy them on the market so when they went to Ka and told them that we will give you our Weaponry this was this was a security for him and this was an a trick from their side to be to come to him with full armor wearing their swords and so that they can assassinate him yes and kill him on the spot and they were Justified to do so because we're bringing you your guarantee so he approved of that and they came they went they brought their armor and they and and and weapons and they came at night and he was a newly wed so they called him from below his Fortress and he left the bed to go and answer them his wife said where are you going it's the middle of the night and I hear a voice with blood pouring down out of it this woman was so smart she recognized from The Voice from the tone of the voice that this was not good I don't I don't feel it's a it's safe for you to go he said wa who are you talking about this is Muhammad Muslim my brother he's my buddy he's my friend and with him is Abu na he is my brother from suckling so and and beside all of that a brave boy like me if he is invited to be stabbed at night he would answer this is something to be proud of he was saying this out of arrogance so he went down to them they showed him the the the the weapons and he felt okay so they talked for a while you know the Arabs the poetry and the bravery and so on and they said why not take around round the Fortress around your Castle just walk right here and there so he agreed while they were walking they said somebody took a smell and said wow what a nice smell and immediately he was you know double in size he said yes I just married one of the most beautiful women who wears the most beautiful perfumes of Arabia so his brother said can I smell it so he gave him his head and he smell his hair and they walked for a while and then said then he said uh can I do that again the smell is so beautiful and he was happy you know being flattered by people so he gave his head again and they walked for a while and the third time he said can I have a smell he said yes sure so he put his hand in his hair and grabbed him right really well and all the four started stabbing him until he died they went back to Medina and from the outskirts of Medina they cried saying allahar the prophet heard this and he was in joy and he said Allah abbar your faces have succeeded and they said your face has succeeded oh prophet of Allah we managed to kill and this was the end of this evil enemy of Islam and this happened once or twice whenever the prophet wasallam did not or whenever the prophet found people who did not honor their agreements with him and lots of chaos would be caused if an army went to them he would send people to get rid of them because they deserve to be executed I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program inshallah until we meet next time for m m"
