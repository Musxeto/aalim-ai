  "transcript": "alhamdulillah so my question is is it permissible to use a real nation as a ringtone like the name of allah is mentioned and etc so the question is can we use a nasheed what is a nasheed a nasheed is poetry sung in a lotus way without any musical instruments so it's a song without any musical instruments so can one chant or use such a chant as a ringtone the answer is yes what about if this nasheed includes the name of allah well it is inappropriate for lots of these nasheeds that revolve only on the name of allah because they can sing it up and down in a very nice way or the salutation upon the prophet muhammad it is put in a melodious uh i don't know if this is even the correct adjective or not so this is inappropriate but is it permissible the answer is i don't see any harm in it it's different than asking me is it permissible to put a quran verse recitation the answer is no this is disrespecting the quran when you put it as a ringtone what about the advan the same thing goes with the adhan it is not permissible to put the adhan as a ringtone having a nasheed is way different and it seems permissible and allah knows best"
