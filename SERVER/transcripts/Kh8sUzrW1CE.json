  "title": "Tayammum and Wudu for a person who sustained injuries - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "can a person who has sustained injuries make Woodill ante m-mom together and what is the procedure please see the most essential thing is when I want to pray is to wash the prescribed areas of my body so I have to turn the water in my mouth I have to rinse my nose and blow the water out I have to wash my face I have to wash my arms to the elbows I have to wipe once over my head and white wipe once my ears and then wash my feet to the ankles that's it if I sustained an injury that prevents me from washing one of these mentioned parts of my body so for example if I broke or if I sustained an injury in my left arm when I come to make wouldl I have to see can I wash that limb or not if it is not possible let me see can I wipe over it or not what do you mean by wiping there's a cast there's some plaster on it so I can with wet hands just wipe over it once that's sufficient if this is not possible because there are burns on it in this case I have to perform normal woudl on the limbs that I can wash this limb because it is not possible to wash it with water I perform tayammum on its behalf for skipping it so I've combined between Woodill and TMO but generally speaking in 99% of the cases it is possible for you to wipe because there's a cast over it there's a plaster there is tape there's some sort of bandages that cover the area so simply with wet hands you just wipe it once and that would suffice insha'Allah if someone says I cannot eat wipe I cannot do anything of such not even complete dodo make them oh I cannot make the mo mom not being able to move in this case pray as you are prayer is a pillar of Islam no one is exempted from it as long as you have your sanity as long as you can think and know and recognize in this case you have to pray you can't make what'll make them dry ablution you can't make dry ablution pray in this in whatever state you are in because this is the best of your ability"
