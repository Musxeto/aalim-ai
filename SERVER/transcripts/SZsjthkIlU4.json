  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] there will be challenges and you will face a lot of obstacles some of them major obstacles [Music] I will not say welcome to the force alhamd the topic we are about to study deals with a subject that touches every person of us it's extremely important yet it is also extremely saddening that a lot of us has fell into this Haram it's an obstacle indeed it is that may prevent us from entering Jenna that may prolong our residency our stay in Janam may Allah gives us Refuge may Allah give us Refuge all of us from the Hellfire now yesterday we've mentioned the Hadith about the most major sins and the first one was a the second one was killing an innocent Soul without any right without any legitimacy however in the same Hadith of the seven major sins the prophet Alat mentioned two major sins and he saidat consuming riba so this is a major sin and consuming the wealth of an orphan because usually orphans are unable to claim their rights so you have the upper hand and you can commit such a transgression without anyone knowing about it so to begin our talk Islam is the perfect religion Islam is the only religion from Allah Asel that has been preserved and will be preserved till the day of judgment Islam is the last Revelation to all mankind and to Jin as well you cannot doubt this fact so do not anticipate another religion to come do not wait for another Messenger to come because the law the Shar of Islam is fin final and therefore we have to understand that the consensus of all Scholars of Islam state that Islam came to preserve five essential things one is your religion two is your life three is the safety of your mental health for the safety of your wealth and which we are about to talk about and finally your honor and this is a bit vague in Arabic is and can refer to your honor in the sense of your wife your daughter your mother all females in your family and it also can referred to and this is the most authentic opinion to your reputation so is the thing that people praise or CR uh uh criticize so my reputation if I backbite you I am attacking your if I look at your wife I am attacking your and so on if I slander you definitely this is an attack on your on your reputation on your honor these are the five things that Islam protects now money is the essence of life people had written poems on money there were songs on money there were novels on money there were plays written on money and people a lot of of them live and die for money and this is why Allah describes it in the Quran as a trial as a FNA verily your wealth and your children are but a trial it's a FNA it's a test what are you going to do with the money or before that where did you get that money from and this is what the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam reiterated and emphasized upon when he said that every umah has a FNA a trial a tribulation and the tribulation of the umah of Muhammad is in money now don't go far because we're not going to be very techn technical because if we want to be technical it will take us seriously a few days because wealth is important in Islam when I say money I don't mean Rings or dollars money is defined in f as anything that you possess so your property your gold your silver whatever has value for you to sell this is also considered to be money so your car is money as well now usually when lots of you mallah are billionaires they are not sitting at ease when they hear this said yeah yeah this is what the poor people say money is bad manone is trial money is s this is what you say because you can't afford it well this is not true because the prophet could have been the richest man on earth it's sufficient for you to know one Hadith that jiel came to him peace be upon him and said oh Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam if you wish Allah tells me to turn this big neighborhood I'll turn it to you into gold just say the word and the prophet did not choose this he voluntary whenever he got the booty of War his share of War it would not spend one night with with him he would all give it away to the extent that he would not find food to be cooked in his house for two consecutive months and he is the prophet the messenger of Allah and if you visit any house of ours and open the kitchen's cupboards you will find food that would last us for 3 years sometimes we do this sometimes we throw the food because the date has expired and we not did not consume it compare us to the prophet Alat so in a sense oh billionaires you are not quite right when you say that this is what the poor people say no money is of value in Islam and the prophet saidat no wealth has benefited me more than the wealth of Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him because Abu Bakr was sort of the Finance Minister no he was one of the richest men of qur of mecah but he spent all of his money for the cause of Allah he bought bil the abian slave the muin of the Prophet to the extent when Omar used to see Abu Bakr and bil walking together together he says Abu Bakr is our s and he has freed our he's referring to to be his his master his peer because of the humility and humbleness of Omar may Allah be pleased with him so the prophet told us that wealth can benefit and he also said to oh the best of wealth is the one in the hands of a righteous person why because he's going to use it and utilize it in what is right and what is correct so today we are to speak about some and this is the tip of an iceberg some of the Haram income that unfortunate most of the Muslims May knowingly or unknowingly be consuming be earning and I'm say I'm saying that this is the tip of an iceberg because it can literally go for days without end talking about this subject which is very important Allah Asel mentions consuming the wealth of an orphan this is Haram but what happens if I do consume it and is it literal or a figure of speech so $100 that belongs to an orphan whom I am the guardian of if I take it and I buy cheeseburgers I'm going to be fat in less than two weeks but let's assume I do eat it so is is this Hellfire actually or a figure of speech it is both because on the day of judgment due to the fact that you had consumed something that is Haram you will consume Hell Fire in your stomach on the day of judgment Allah asael says indeed those who Devour the property of Orphans unjustly are only consuming into their bellies fire and they will be burned in a blaze so it is tangible and you will feel that if you do this the prophet saysat he who consumes Haram money and his flesh grows from that he will not be admitted to Jenna that's an authentic Hadith and the same Hadith was narrated in a different way he who has his flesh grown from Haram will be worthy of Hellfire so this is serious you will not enter Jenna said okay I don't want to go to Jenna but you'll enter fire this is a problem because if I'm not punished and if not I'm not rewarded no problem but if I'm punished this is a big problem once you remember that the least person to be punished in Hellfire the least punishment what is the least torment is a stone of fire placed in a person's sandals from the heat of that Stone of Fire his brain boils so his whole body is conducting heat and you can imagine what what's happening to the flesh to the Bone to the nerves to the everything else and this is the least no one is less than this so if Allah forgave every single sin you have committed in your life and he wants to punish you for a cigarette that you enjoy after lunch wow that's good people Subhan Allah this is not our topic anyhow if Allah wants to punish you for that cigarette this is your punishment because this is the least torment in Hell Fire but what about if Allah wants to take us for the whole nine yards then we have a serious problem indeed no one Among Us is interested in entering Hellfire or even being close to it if a drop of a from Hellfire were to be dropped on Earth it will spoil and corrupt the food and the drink of the entire Humanity one drop what about those who drink it in Hellfire every single moment till eternity may Allah save us each one of us is so happy I'm happy I don't know about you when someone says sh make Dua for me that Allah pays off my debts and I say oh Allah pay off his debts and he calls the following morning day sh Allah paid my debts and I say where's my percentage everybody feels happy when you make Dua and Allah makes it come true because Allah answers your Dua whether it comes true or not we know this and again this is not the time to disclose the three types of Allah answering your Dua Allah answers all of your du however those who fail to consume Halal and they mix or have only Haram to eat Allah will not answer their Dua in a weak Hadith though it is very famous and popular S one of the 10 heavenbound companions Malik known as he came to the prophet and said oh prophet of Allah pray to Allah that I become someone who is always answered when he makes Dua to Allah and by the way through the history of he was that person which strengthens that the Hadith is authentic all the companions feared it when s said listen do this or I will make Dua I apologize this happened withman this happened with so many companions so the prophet gave him an advice s he said be keen on consuming and Allah will answer your Dua in an authentic in Muslim the prophet tells us about a traveler and we know that the Dua of a traveler is is accepted and he has Dusty clothes and hair and this is also a sign of Those whom Allah answers his their call and he raises his hands to the heavens and also raising the hands for Dua is one of the means of answering your call and he says y y he's calling Allah by his beautiful names and this is also an indication or one of the means of getting your Dua answered however the Prophet elaborates however his he's fed by Haram his drink is Haram he wears Haram so how would Allah respond to him how would Allah answer his call this is why the majority of Muslims say oh Allah free Palestine and Allah does not make that happen for a purpose but the majority of our income is not Halal and I'll try to um study it with you in a very easy manner because this is technical I know it's heavy after lunch no desserts maybe it's a little bit difficult but try to cope with me inshallah first of all what is the definition of prohibited wealth prohibited property prohibited money what is it there are numerous definitions of it the easiest and the most yeah convenient to remember is any wealth that you are not allowed to use or to possess so you may possess it okay I know that taking something Haram is not permissible I'm not going to possess it but can I use it no as long as it's Haram Mal Haram again you are not allowed to use it so you cannot own it and you cannot benefit from it and jurors and Scholars have a number of Divisions so some of them say Mal or the prohibited wealth can be prohibited for its own nature and it can be prohibited for a description not for its nature what is this you're getting us confused I'll tell you don't worry I hear you not that I know the Unseen but you know so money that is prohibited for its nature such as intoxicant wine whiskey Jin tequila vodka Scotch Black Label you know these things this is Haram for its nature pork swine's meat Haram for its nature dead meat an animal that was not slaughtered it's Haram for his nature selling impurities such as blood can I go and sell blood or Slaughter an animal and collect the blood and sell it or consume it this is totally Haram for its nature and there are Haram things not for their nature but rather for their description so I have $100 I can go and buy the hamburgers that would make me fat or I can give it as a bribe to That official so he would give me the contract if I give it to that official this is a bribe but the $100 is the same $100 so it is not Haram for itself but but for the description that it was given due to something Haram expected which is to facilitate the contract and we will speak about uh um inshallah bribes in a very quick fashion Scholars also divide Haram wealth into whether it had been taken from you willingly or unwillingly one would say how is it possible that it is Haram and taken from me willingly I'll give you an example some airports I'm not disclosing anything so that I would not B be banned from entering that country again some airports you you land and you find this beautiful gorgeous shocking it's not a female a car standing there seducing you with its four wheels with its curves and he say Subhan Allah you look at the car and they tell you pay 500 and only 2,000 will participate and you may get a chance to win 500 out of 2,000 well it's not a big ratio I'll I'll take 10 this is called what this is called in Arabic it can be called Lottery it can be called gambling and this is the official Islamic terminology I'm paying 500 on the hope that I will win 500,000 the price of the car or I lose so this kind of money that I'm paying am I paying it willingly he's definitely H hoping also nobody forced me to take it and by the way now this is category one the Haram things that are taken or consumed willingly from the owner and I will move on to the unlawful things later on they're all unlawful but without the permission of the owner the issue of lottery or gambling is so widely spread in the Muslim world to the extent that people now are indulged in it they're justifying it they're making excuses for it without knowing Oram I'll give you another example competitions so I'm a football player we have a football team and we would like to play with other five six teams each team puts 1,000 Rings and The Winner Takes all this is Haram this is Haram income this is gambling if you go and play with a slot machine gambling I'll give you a bigger example insurance we all have medical insurance Good Luck insurance car insurance medical insurance life insurance all of this is gambling now I'm not going to go into details if the government obliges you to do it and if you don't do it they'll put you in jail this is out of necessity I'm talking about the things that you have a choice in pay 1,500 Rings a year and I'm medically insured to the to half a million I may get cancer chemotherapy physiotherapy new limbs bionic hands and and so mashallah with 100 1,500 there is a possibility that for 30 years until I die I don't use one ring out of it and there is a possibility that the minute I get insured the following day I consume of Allah how much this is prohibited and you don't have to be a rocket science a scientist to know this whatever you give if you have the option of winning it all or losing what you put this is gambling and I'm not going to uh uh hold it here because the time is really running out dealing in Haram this is consuming Haram what do you mean mean by dealing Haram the prophet said it is not permissible for a Muslim to have the cost or the price of a dog meaning dogs are prohibited to sell and to buy did you know this who raise your hands please just to be sure did you know this that dogs are not permissible to to be bought okay Mah we have like 5% and also cats you're not allowed to buy cats did you know this mashallah someone is lying this is Haram for you to sell the prophet prohibited this the prophet prohibited what a prostitute gets for her Services the prophet prohibited Alam what a fortune teller a soothsayer a priest who predicts the future and I think Muti is mink spoke about this that Allah does not accept 40 days of your prayer if you consult a fortune teller without believing him so if you open the newspaper and look at the zodiacs I'm a scorpion i'm a cow I'm which depending on what Zodiac you are and you say haaha they say that this is going to happen tomorrow ha I don't believe it 40 days your your prayer will not be accepted yes I don't believe it yes 40 days but if what happened or what's written happens tomorrow by Allah's decree and he said ah this is what they said yesterday then you have abandoned Islam and you became a cfir and this is the Hadith of the Prophet not of someone is extremist this is the Hadith of the Prophet Muslim don't argue about it a lot so a lot of the things that are prohibited to sell these are considered to be consuming Hellfire based on ambiguity in Islam it's Haram to make a transaction in an ambiguous way and there are a number of hadiths where the Prophet tells us that he prohibited ambiguity such as one of them is Al this is the prophet's word wasam so if you come to my shop and I say listen all what you see is for one ring it providing you touch it whatever you touch you buy so you touch something that is worth nothing you're obliged to buy it and you may touch something that is worth tendering it this is if I throw anything for you this is 10 Rings you agree said agree I give him a tissue uh box oh gets too much we've agreed so any such thing as uh um transactions such sales are prohibited and the list is so long I don't have time for it there are ways that you take a person's belongings without his approval so the first one was by Mutual approval now we're talking about things that are without his approval such as the most famous thing is stealing if you steal from a person this money is Haram you cannot benefit from it you cannot utilize it and you cannot possess it you have to return it back and also taking something forcefully but publicly and there is a difference I can steal something instead in nobody's watching with conditions if caught then they will chop my hand but I can't embezzle or take something forcefully publicly like if I'm holding a public office and I take millions and millions of reals or of dollars due to my Powers everybody knows this do I get my hand cut no this is a crime but but it's a crime that everybody knows about and they can catch me they can prosecute me they can do this and do that with stealing it is concealed it's hidden that's why every one of us can be a victim Islam protects our wealth so if the conditions are fulfilled in stealing such as first it has to be concealed if I'm walking and I find somebody's wallet I'll take it is this stealing no it's wrong but it's not stealing because it's in the open it has to be in a Cupboard it has to be in a safe it has to reach the it has to be done without any justification so if I steal from my father and don't listen to me kids if you steal from your father there is no cutting of the hand but you're doing something wrong so there are so many uh um conditions and this is not the time for it some of the means of consuming Hellfire is bribery giving bribes and this is quite famous among some Muslim countries this calls for Destruction for any country that this is found in and the best of countries are those who put serious punishment for whomever is discovered to have taken even one single real and this br bribe has many many forms and we can spend the rest of the lecture talking about bribes the prophet saidat may Allah curse the one who gives bribe and the one who receives the bribe and the bribe receiver is usually someone in a post or in a position and this is why they're giving him the bribe and that is why the prophet said Alam if you were not in in your position and sitting in your mother's house would anybody give you anything so the governor the king the president the minister the heads of departments mashallah big positions what is this well I got this as a present from whom from XY Z he loves me for the sake of Allah okay let's assume you're not in your office or in your job and you are leaving in your mother's house or your father's house would he give you anything no in this case this is a bribe and you can Cascade this on every single position a teacher receiving just a week before the day of the exams a beautiful gift an expensive pen a doctor who prescribes medication and the company of the pharmaceutical company comes and gives him a 3 days uh um free ticket first class board and and and and everything to attend a conference in the Bahamas doctor what conference are you going to the Bahamas well I don't know with the family and the children and the neighbors this is a bribe and so on as again the issue of bribing is extremely complicated but it is as clear as a daylight you can see it you know it you feel it it's in your office it's within the purchasing department there are the most people purchased so they are the the the procurement I go a this is a gift this is three days in the hospit in in a hospital eventually in a hotel this is a free ticket this is a new laptop I I think it would help you in your work and the people are getting richer and richer and richer their bank account was this big now mallah it's this big where did they get this money from bribes and we know this in the Arab world I don't know about you here but inshallah you don't have this problem why are they laughing anyhow um one of the major sins that deals with consumption of Haram is riba and riba each and every one of you knows the meaning technically it takes us ages to explain but I'll give you an example R is divided into two types is the difference in the same category so if I have gold and you have gold and we would like to exchange any difference in the caliber any difference in a gram of weight this is RBA women do this a lot they go to the with all due respect it's the husband paying but they do the transaction they go to a Jeweler's shop and they say look how much is this bracelet of gold and he says after weighing it it cost 2,000 and how much is that new one he says it cost 3,000 so she gives him the gold a th000 extra and she takes that this is RBA ah now this is what you say look what your husbands are saying hey transactions are Haram I'll give you another example this is for the men you go to an exchange office this is $100 how much is it in rengit approximately 400 so okay can I have it he said I have only 300 here is 300 come after 5 minutes I'll get it to you okay this is riba this is riba it has to be Hand by hand when it's exchange between gold and silver or gold and money silver and money also the there are six categories I don't want to get into technical things you will sleep six things that the prophet named Gold by gold silver by silver salt by salt dates by dates Wheat by wheat barley by barley two categories one anything that is used as a price gold and silver currencies uh two anything that is weighed either by size or by weight and it's consumed so these two conditions have to be fulfilled these are two different categories but riba applies in anything that falls under this table let us get back to Earth she show me riba riba is the interest you get from your bank account I'll be more extreme when you deposit your money in a bank I have 100,000 rings I put it in a bank do you think if I have 100,000 I'll be lecturing here assume assume I have a 100,000 and I deposit it in a bank what is the transaction between me and the bank is it for safekeeping no if it were safekeeping if the bank was burnt to the ground he would come to me and say I'm afraid your money is gone because if I give you for example my car and I tell you put it in your garage and you put it safe in your garage and an earthquake happens and the car is gone do I have the right to tell you give me my car back you are doing me a favor this is called safekeeping the bank actually guarantees that he gives you back the money because this is a loan to the bank meaning with 100,000 rings in my bank account every year twice a year the bank sends me gifts sends me boxes uh fancy boxes with with suets with dates with pens with mobile phones these gifts are riba because it's an interest charged over a loan if you want to dispose of it I'm willing to take it with me all to Saudi Arabia and now inshallah find a way for it but it's Haram for you to use also when you put a time deposit box you throw money and they give you percentage now I'm not talking about the Islamic banking because the issue of Islamic banking is so vague that a lot of the Islamic banking are dealing in riba but camouflaging it especially in the issue of if the issue of these words you all know and everything is done on paper uh excuse me I'd like to borrow 100,000 rings so that I can deposit in the bank like the she and be rich like him okay no problem how are you going to do this listen we will sell you air conditioners of 100,000 yes we will sell you air conditioners of this uh uh maker and sign here please okay and sign here another contract authorizing us to sell it and we will sell for 15% less of the market price okay you've you've done this here's your money when did you do the transaction so don't worry we take of care of all the technicalities this is clear riba they're selling and buying of something that you did not acquire no acquisition on paper and we don't want to go through this because it will take us another couple of days is extremely Haram the RBA on the loan and I'll give you another example I know that most of you will hate me after this if you do did not if you're not hating me at the moment a lot of us love to invest I believe that a lot of us are investing in Haram I'll tell you how you know a brother who is righteous and practicing and he says I need 50 ,000 rangit to invest in a project that I'm doing she told no problem this is 50,000 what's my percentage he says I'll give you 10% 5,000 every month okay on the guarantee that I do not lose anything of my Capital said yes you will not lose it's a a winning project and I give him the money this is clear riba 100% riba no difference of opinion she I'm investing yeah you're investing but you are guaranteeing a percentage and no loss meaning that it's a loan of 50,000 and he is giving you the RBA of 5,000 a month but if you say I demand 90% of the profit if there is a prophet and if there is loss I lose my money this is halal no she lose my money it's not Halal ah then then don't invest this is Islamic investing not riba the one you want and we can go on it will take us another couple of weeks anyhow the prophet saysat or ja may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet Alam cursed the one who consumes riba the one who gives RBA so there's someone who takes and someone who gives and the one who writes the riba the register the accountant and this is a a problem I know that half of you are accountants but you want the truth well you want me to sugarcoat it and give it to you you want to eat Halal right it is befitting for you to sit at the Gate of the Masjid taking s rather than to eat Haram the prophet curse the one who gives the one who takes the one who registers and the witnesses those who are witnessing I'm I'm not charging anything I'm just testifying the the prophet said and the is Muslim all are in the same sin the gravity the danger the consumption of Haram money of Hell Fire they're all the same the prophet saidat is 73 divisions or types so there you have the highest the lowest of it is like having intercourse with your own mother are you serious this is authentic Hadith do you have second thoughts about RBA the least is having intercourse with your own mother not even animals do this so it's a serious thing among the things that cause us to consume Hellfire or you had enough well I'm afraid uh false oath and this is plenty see in business and I've dealt with so many people in business what you rely mostly on is your word so if I make a transaction with you I don't have to sign I don't have to have witness I depend on your word and this is why if someone swears and says I bought this for 10 I believe him because I glorify Allah I trust Allah so if you use Allah's name I'm going to believe you in and this shows you how we deal differently with Allah than our predecessors peace be upon him the prophet of Allah saw a man stealing so he got hold of him and caught him and he said you have stolen and the man said I did not steal he let him go and said I believe in Allah and I falsify my own eyesight I do not believe my eyes I believe that you swore by Allah he is a messenger of Allah and I'm not going to go into details of explaining this Hadith and what is the concept of it because anyone can come and say w I did not steal and he took my wallet saidas then I will do this I'll become rich and I'll have 100,000 R in my bank account but it would be Haram so the concept you have to understand that we glorify Allah however people who use Allah's name in their transactions they will be punished and they will be severely punished if they were lying even if they were telling the truth they will be punished because they sold the name of Allah people did not buy it from you except because you used W but if you were lying this is even worse the prophet Alat wasam says whoever takes the property of a Muslim by false oath then he has taken a part or a portion of hell and he will not be admitted to Jenna very scary one of the companions said to prophet of Allah even a stick of arak even this miswak even if I managed to swear by Allah to take this miswak he said even if it was a small as a miswak where I come from we have mashallah people taking not countries regions by swearing by Allah that it is theirs if you go to the courts you will find people falsely testifying swearing by Allah I Will Do Anything by Allah if may Allah take my eyesight if I was lying who turned off the lights they swear they have no problem and and I know a lot of people like this may Allah have mercy on us this is he said I go for Allah erases the sins no this is not correct Allah erases minor sins the major sins such as this you need to give it back to the lawful owner and this is known as y Yamin is oath pled is the one that dips you why it dips you in Hellfire when you consume someone's wealth uh uh through that and you can Cascade it to false testimony I need you tomorrow to testify with me in court I didn't see don't you believe me yes I believe you I will testify yes he did not take yes he took this is Haram and this is part of it Allah says oh you who believe do not consume one another's wealth unjustly but only in lawful business by Mutual consent what will happen Allah asael says then we will drive him into fire whoever does this among the unlawful ways of consumption of money I don't know about you I have been stung a number of times people come and borrow money and you give it to them and that's it you never see them and we have a saying in Arabic when someone wants money from you he kisses your hands tens of times but when you want your money back you kiss his feet tens of times and this is absolutely true I've witnessed this myself in business transactions in borrowings in people come to you humble like a panda bear Mah please you give it to them and then they become Pharaoh mashallah they would not return your calls this is among the major sins of consuming people's money in transgression also part of uh the Haram income is cheating we all know cheating the prophet say whoever cheats us is not from Among Us and cheating is not only in your exams when you do your English test no this is one part of cheating we're talking about cheating in transactions so cheating originated from the prophet wasam walking once in the market he saw a pile of wheat of food of dates he gets his hand inside of it and he finds wetness now the food should be dry so he said owner of the food what is this he said prophet of Allah yesterday it was raining so I turned it upside down said Subhan Allah why didn't you make it on top so people could relate to to it and know whoever cheats us is not from Among Us Now nowadays do we have cheating in our transactions in Malaysia how is that done it is done in quantity so I pretend to be selling you a thousand pieces it's actually 9.98 and when I buy from you a th000 pieces I insist it is 1,2 this is a kind of transaction if I weigh to sell I reduce if I weigh to buy I increase I always take what is in my advantage cheating can be in quality so the the quality is lower the quality is less and unfortunately a lot of the countries sell uh uh counterfeit something that is not original so one says she I'd like to be uh uh berbery I'd like to wear this I would like to but I can't afford it okay you don't afford it you don't need it so no but I need people a brother came to me three four weeks ago with a set of watches he said she I know you like like MBL this is this this is this how much is this he says 800 R wow looks real take it I'll sell it for you with a discount the original cost 20,000 said who knows I know how would I live with myself wearing something that is fake fooling people but who will fool me so selling counterfeit is Haram because you're cheating people okay sh they know it's still Haram because it's a company that has copyright and you are trespassing you are making transgression after their research and production and designing and investing money you come and make part of that and we would not like to go into copyrighting because then we will talk about Windows 10 we would talk about all of these things she are they paying you no W they're not paying me but this is Hal and Haram this is Hal and Haram and if they were paying me I would be lecturing here also we have this I don't know if you have uh auctions for used cars yeah we have this in Saudi mashallah they make the biggest cheaters on Earth they tell you this car goes from zero to uh 100 in five meaning hours but they cheat they lie they tell you this car is this this car is that auctions in food auction in property all of this can have cheating in it 8 minutes left and so many things to talk about selling Haram do we sell Haram here in Malaysia we sell Haram everywhere in the Muslim world and this is a big problem we're not practicing Muslims don't kid ourselves we have problems from here to mecah distance is long not not because meca is anything don't get me wrong we have a problem and we're not ready to fix ourselves yeah we have Haram we have this um are you do you car in an interest based loan yeah I know I know Subhan Allah when does the job again among the things that are Haram to sell are anything that is Haram to use so let me give you a quick list Musical Instruments music is Haram this she is wahhabi this definitely she is extremist w w w if music was Halal I would be the first one to listen to it I would be the first one to enjoy it but it's not this is the religion of Allah the Haram of Music which unfortunately here is widely spreading not to the extent of enjoying it personally but to the extent of even getting closer to Allah what are you doing are you praying no no I'm getting closer to Allah I'm listening to music excuse me yeah I'm singing Nash behind you there's an orchestra yes it's very good H Haram it is the prophet who prohibited it and theith is inar yeah maybe it's weak maybe okay what are you sh Mal the four schools of thought the consensus they all agreed it is Haram to listen to musical instruments this is this is a big issue seriously now W it hardens your heart it makes it as hard as Stone that's why you pray I'm unable to cry I'm unable to feel the Quran and the of Allah let's not get into this this is not our subject it would take us maybe four weeks more to conclude this so selling of any musical instruments violin pianos guitars synthesizers even synthesizers because synthesizers are not uh uh um brass based or string based it's something new anything that has music has beat into it that makes you dance or want to dance that make you cry that make you happy music is totally prohibited movies come on after the convention I have tickets to go and watch um whatever hang Hangover four how how do you say it's Haram any movies that contain music okay m music we're over with or mixing between the genders women violence sex profanity all of this is Haram so I cannot even sell it I'm not going to watch it selling it watching it is all Haram songs we've gone through that dogs we've gone through that intoxicants nobody sells alhamdulillah or consumes or buys because we all know it's Haram but what about drugs cocaine heroin opium Haram what about marijuana you have to be cool man you have to chill dude Subhan Allah it is all Haram a major sin in Islam Allah will not accept your prayers for 40 days come on 40 days yes anyone who consumes intoxicant Allah will not accept accept his prayers for 40 days now this is a big problem so smoking uh what do you call it shisha or it has in Arabic we call it anything that you consume of such tobacco based or or whatever they call it it's all Haram it dangers and harms your health and it burns your wealth so selling it dealing with it renting it is all Haram income selling images of human beings of animals whether they statue 3D or 2D drawings it's also Haram because the prophet prohibited it selling Haram things for people selling a wig you know hair wigs for women what have you made Halal for us well this is the next year in convention we will talk about Halal things wearing a wig for a woman is Haram having extensions her hair is this long and then Mah tomorrow her hair is this long what is this there extensions she it looks real huh Haram the one who does it it cursed so you selling it is Haram having clothes that are Haram sold to people that you know will wear it in Haram then this is Haram selling men gold rings or gold watches is Haram for them to wear it's Haram for you to sell and 2 minutes and 5 Seconds renting your property the brothers billionaires who we've addressed in the beginning they have a lot of properties and they don't consume Haram alhamdulillah but they lease their properties to Banks based on riba they leas their properties to insurance companies they lease their properties to nightclubs to massage parlers to selling alcohol tobacco Etc to restaurants that sell pork and sell uh uh uh intoxicants I'm not dealing with that yeah but you're taking the rent you are contributing you are cooperating your income is Haram then am I doing a sin if I'm serving in a restaurant or an airplane Haram liquor or Haram food after 1 hour ex any minus one minute you do not understand this please watch the recording definitely it's Haram selling the prophet cursed 10 in those who buy it those who sell it those who carry it those who it's been carried to those who make it those who plant it those who 10 people are cursed in one single item so do not cooperate on Haram do anything but make sure you do not consume Haram and finally did I say that a while ago okay no finally before the final final one the prophet told usam on the day of judgment when it is 50,000 years long when the sun draws closer to the people until they sweat and each one the sweat reaches his body according to his deeds on that day you your feet will not move an inch until you're questioned and asked about your in in come where did you gain it from and where did you spend it from and finally there's no way to know whether my income is halal or Haram except through knowledge one of the means is coming here but this what I what I was telling you is not knowledge it's just the tip of an iceburg you have to go back to your Quran you have to go back to your Sunnah of the prophet am read learn and ask there are Scholars all over the world alhamdulillah with some research with Q&A you will understand you will learn and then you will be able to identify whether I'm consuming Haram so that you prepare yourself for Hellfire you know walk in the Sun and turn off the air conditionings W nothing would help there is nothing that can prepare us to Hell Fire just like a handle and put your second put your your your your finger for 3 seconds count 1 2 3 can you do that Hell Fire is 70 times worse than the furnaces the most heated furnaces we have or a volcano or something 70 times and how long we will stay there a year two years one second we cannot Toler it so fine may Allah be pleased with him for those who are interested in doing business you have to learn may Allah be pleased with him used to go in the market you flash from here until I'm going to finish I'm going to finish so don't flash for me the time is over I'm not going to stop so may Allah be pleased with him used to go in the market in the souk huh like the malls with his famous dur with his stick and when heever he sees someone new he asks him few questions and if the man does not reply or unable to answer he hits him and takes him out he says get out do not spoil our Market only those who know Halal andam can come and sell because if you come and I have hundreds of similar questions she I didn't know that this is Haram but now the transaction has been done why didn't you know because you were keen on gaining money rather than keen on getting what pleases Allah may Allah make our income Halal may Allah purify the countries of the Muslims from any Haram transaction may Allah make our transactions with our brothers and sisters all based on honesty and trust and Allah Knows Best Al"
