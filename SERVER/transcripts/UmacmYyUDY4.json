  "transcript": "his third question that in the sub-continent they say that 20 raka is mandatory a tracker is wrong and they are wrong Erika is the prayer that the prophet offered that is awesome are you crazy this is what he did mother aisha says hey I'm a Muslim when she was asked about how did the Prophet pray night prayer in Ramadan sallallaahu Salim she said he did not pray in Ramadan or out of Ramadan Mandir 11 raucous so this is the sunnah now having said that it does not mean that we should limit it to 11 because there are other hadith that may open the door for us and the sky's the limit so whether you pray 8 or pray 20 or pray 50 this is no problem insha Allah"
