  "transcript": "is it weird for someone to want hardship to feel closer to Allah to feel loved by Allah it is or to just feel like it is totally weird and out of the question because it's like testing Allah come on bring it on show me some hardship and I'll show you how a strong Muslim I am this is nuts this is crazy who you testing you don't speak like this with someone on worldly measures who could beat the heck out of you let alone speak to the owner of the heavens and the earth and the creator of everything we see and the most merciful the most compassionate instead of asking him for Mercy for his kindness for his generosity in order in instead of asking him to make you steadfast on Islam without testing you you go ahead and cross the limits this is totally insane it was reported that one of the salaf said oh Allah test me with whatever you want and you will see how patient and tolerant I am so Allah tested him that urine would not come out there's a medical terminology it's the opposite of urine incontinence so it would not come out why I don't know I'm not a medical doctor you go and check with him so the man was in pain and Agony and he used to go down to the masjids and talk to the youngsters the young kids doing Quran and say ask Dua for your uncle bahul because he lied and he's unable to tolerate and be patient no one can test Allah and I think it's even mentioned in the Bible when the devil uh uh crossed path with Isa peace be upon him and he told him if you trust Allah throw yourself from uh a mountain and Isa peace be upon him said you do not test Allah Allah tests you so this is totally insane that's why at the time of the Prophet alhat a man a companion fell sick and he was so sick he was like a a small bird that was shaken he lost all of his weight so the prophet visited himam he said this is strange did you invoke Allah did you ask Allah for anything and the man said yes I said oh Allah whatever I was supposed to face as punishment on the day of judgment in Hellfire bring it on to me here so I would it would cleanse my sins and the prophet was outraged he said Subhan Allah and who can tolerate this why didn't you ask Allah for forgiveness for ask for forgiveness and for health and for well-being because there's nothing better on Earth after certainty than a well-being and Allah Knows Best"
