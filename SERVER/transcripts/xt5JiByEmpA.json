  "transcript": "Fatima says if some one mistakenly misses frustration in Salah and all of a sudden remembers during the prayer itself what should he do either repeat the Salah on the whole or do such that a Sahu first of all we know that salat is composed of three types of actions and rhetorics pillars mandatory acts and sunnah if you abandon a pillar of salat such as the inauguration takbir the first tech videos he Allah who walk about if he skipped it your prayer is invalid because this is a pillar so whatever comes afterwards is void if you skip reciting the Fatiha if you're praying as an imam or an individual if you skip frustrating or bowing or whatever these are pillars so you have to offer them if you don't nothing would compensate for it meaning that your salat is invalid because it's missing a pillar which means that the whole structure will fall down now Fatima is asking about the scenario I'm in the first wrecker I offered once as de and I stood up for the second wrecker what to do first of all if you did not reach the position of the pillar you had skipped from the second raka or from the following worker if you did not so now in the second rack are reciting the Fatiha I remembered immediately go to the pillar that you have skipped which is sitting between the two sister because you did not set you stood up immediately sitting between the two sajda rubble fairly rabble fairly allahu akbar make your second prostration which you have skipped and stand up and continue your prayer as usual offering show yourself after the Salam and then offering another Salam but if I finished my sec maybe my third rocker maybe my fourth raka and I remembered after a while what to do I've already prayed Erica or more afterwards scholars say that this rocker which you skipped the second or the first sujud of the prostration in it this is void so your second raka is your first third is your second fourth is your third you have one raka more to add say okay but this means I prayed five fraca for Lord no the first one was void because you've dropped a pillar and following three are considered to be your first three so stand up and pray your fourth original raka of your jihad and tired of your Salam to prostrations of studio of Sahu then another Salam and I hope this answers your question"
