  "transcript": "sister Fatma has OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder a lot of the people have this and it grows and it reduces depending on your belief on your conviction so many times I may feel feel ill and I increase this by hearing people saying oh you look bad you face is pale your temperature is high and I get convinced and I believe in that and I feel sick so many times people give me a pill and say try this it's a good medication I take it and I feel wonderful and then they say that this is a placebo it has no effect it's only minerals or it's only salt it's all in here so sister Fatima you've been suffering for sixteen years and you want to improve your case and you want to progress and you want a complete healing from what you are suffering from well I have good news and I have bad news the bad news is that there is no such healing process that people can give you but the good news is the only one who's able of curing you and relieving you from what you're suffering is allah azza wajal if you believe in him and not in people and not what they say if you believe in him if you put your trust in him if you know that he's the only one who could heal you he is the healer soprano our surgeon if you know and believe this well aji you'll be hundred percent cure in no time it's an issue of conviction this is a problem our problem is I know that Allah can cure me I know that allah azza wajal has the ability to do whatever he wants as well but maybe yeah well I think I'm gonna take this medication I think I'm gonna trust this doctor I'm think I'm gonna go to this a priest or whatever you have to go to the source when you have little streams coming out from the river why take water from the streams and not go to the river itself all the healing is in Allah's hands so panatar so if you put your trust if you lay all your trouble on him as they were gel and put your stuff on his doorsteps and keep on knocking by supplicating by doing rupiah by truck not thinking or suspecting that he will help you believing 100% that he will help you and this is why when I raise my hands and I supplicate to Allah I'm not doubtful I'm not saying okay maybe you want to if you wish no I insist on a lot because I am in a state of humility and submissiveness and in need I'm showing is my poverty to him and I insist that he opens the door and I keep on knocking the door will open so if you want to get rid of this OCD sister you have to work hard do your rukia in the morning in the afternoon and before you go to bed supplicate to Allah Azza WA JAL between the Adhan and DiPalma and also while you are prostrating you're telling me that you're not punctual in your prayer this is one of the main causes of your OCD that you are not connected with Allah Azza WA Jalla mentions in Surat Arad and let in an inverter Tama in Nepal uber humidicrib he alibied ik related my new club it is Lowe's who remember allah azzawajal and they find their hearts tranquility in remembrance of Allah the hearts will never reach the state of tranquility without remembering Allah so the more you remember Allah social the more your OCD reduces and shrinks in size and in effect but you have to be consistent you have to keep on supplicating showing allah your humility not just trying cry we can all cry I'm suffering I'm okay what did you do about it nothing Allah doesn't want to help me a sort for a lot is this what you think of Allah you have to help yourself and ask him to help you so you have to go out of your way doing the rakia supplicating to Allah it praying on time trying to overcome your own self your own demons your own bad influence of these thoughts while putting in the back of your mind it is Allah who is helping you it is Allah who is doing this for you give up hope of everyone and especially of yourself and keep your hope only with a large Dajjal and you will find inshallah your healing"
