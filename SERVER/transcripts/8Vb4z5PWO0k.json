  "transcript": "it's a lot of men over him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa Abdi he wore a suit he nabina muhammad in mana and he was up eh my dear brothers and sisters in Islam Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number 23 in our series of our brain in a year the 40 hadith compiled by the mandali Allah have mercy on his soul this hadith was narrated by abu malik al had it if not a sermon a Shiley may Allah be pleased with him he said that our prophet sallallahu alaihi wa sallam said purity is half of a man of faith alhamdulillah fills the scales subhanAllah and hamdulillah fills that which is between heavens and earth and the prayer the salah is a light and charity is a proof and patience is illumination and the Quran is a proof either for you or against you every person starts his day as a vendor of his soul either freeing it or causing it to ruin and this hadith was reported by the Muslim in the Sahir now this beautiful hadith has a number of benefits the Prophet item is highlighting a number of things on top is purity at Lahore and technically speaking we know that purity is divided into uplifting the hadith and removing the Naja's and we will not go into this technical part but in general how can pure 'ti whether it's performing muscle or performing wouldl how can it consist and be half of Eman scholars have many interpretations to this but it appears that the most authentic of all that it is half of Eman because the branches of Eman are either concealed and hidden or exposed and visible so the fear of Allah is concealed no one knows about it except Allah prayer is visible we can see people praying in front of us and performing ablution and cleansing their body which is half of the things that are constituting a man visible and concealed exposed and hidden and the hidden and concealed are something we cannot see you have to purify your heart by believing in the oneness of Allah so that by worshipping Allah alone this is something that is concealed the actions you do cleansing your body washing it preparing for Salah by offering ablution this is half of the Eman it is equivalent to what Allah has said subhana Allah what he Ibaka Papa meaning that your clothes your garments you have to purify scholars say that you purify yourself from associating others with Allah and also Allah says in the law he Bhutto Abena where you hit boom o tapu here in Allah loves those who repent and Allah loves those who purify themselves so cleansing yourself offering woudl is half of the Eman and in the authentic hadith the Prophet tells us a listen up no one observes no one keeps in the state of purity meaning in the state of having ablution except a believer now you have it wada lulu allah what men no one would preserve and stay in the state of Woodill except a believer and this is what belong may allah be pleased with him used to do once the Prophet asked him o belong I went to Paradise and I heard your flip-flops in front of me wherever I went and what did you do so that you would be entitled to this privilege and billah said I don't know prophet of Allah but whenever I am the call of nature I believe that it is Allah's right upon me to perform Moodle and then pray 2 rakats so he was constantly in the state of voodoo and this highlights to us the importance of voodoo the Prophet tells us Ali is salatu was-salam that whenever a person performs woudl his sins fall out with every drop that falls out or down from his body so if you wash your face everything that you've looked at which is haram falls with the last drop that comes out or comes down from your face the same thing goes with your arms that same thing goes with your feet so everything you had done Woodill or purity means of purification ablution cleanse these impurities from your body the sins that you have committed not only that it is a means of attaining all those forgiveness the Prophet tells us at least a lot to say when an individual goes to bed in the state of wood meaning that he performed evolution and then went to bed whenever he turns on his bed there is an angel between him and his blanket whatever you turn on your bed the angel says o Allah forgive him because he went to bed in the state of Votto this is mind-blowing I could be asleep and there's an angel appointed by Allah to ask Allah for forgiveness for me I'm not doing anything the only thing I had done was to perform will do before going to bed what a beautiful religion but tell me how many of us perform Moodle before going to bed the majority of Muslims when they remembered I'm gonna perform Moodle and go to bed then I have to chase sleeping because it will run away from me now this is not true if you do this with the conviction that Allah would reward you immensely or lie you would never leave going to bed performing Moodle the prop tells us a little artisan that whoever goes to bed and wakes up in the middle of the night and the first thing he says is la la la la la sharika Luka Luka dear Subhan Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah for Allah and then he supplicates Allah would answer his supplication and if he performs rudl and praise Allah would accept his prayer you have debts you have problems you have calamities do this and I guarantee you that Allah would answer your prayers then the Prophet says Ali salatu salam well hamdulillah tamela all mizzen saying alhamdulillah fills up the scale and what is alhamdulillah alhamdulillah is praising Allah Almighty and this is done by describing Allah Almighty with all feelings of love and glorification so it's not enough it is not sufficient for you to praise Allah to thank Allah without having full feelings of love and glorification and you may praise someone but not because you love him I can praise a king and say good things about him because I need the money not because I love him I could praise someone who's fixing my sink not because I glorify Him because I need him and Allah is the only one who's praised with full feelings of love and glorification so this is praising Allah Almighty giving him all the beautiful attributes of perfection and the Prophet tells us that this saying alhamdulillah fills up the scales and we believe as a national jamar that on the day of judgment there will be a scale with two pans and a tongue that speaks a scale that speaks yes on the day of judgement this will happen and what would be put in these hands scholars different some say it's the deeds that you do good deeds and bad deeds others say it's the records that the deeds are written in that would be in these pants and thirdly some scholars say that it is the person himself and that is why the Prophet says in the hadith Harris or saran that a big fat man who's a disbeliever would come on the day of judgement not weighing the wing of a fly and also in the other hadith when the Companions laughed about the legs of ibanez rude they were so thin and they were laughing in the Prophet said by Allah his legs in the scale on the day of judgement are heavier than the mountain of Earth and the most authentic opinion is that all the three will be weighed on the day of judgement the deeds the records and the person or the individual who did these deeds so alhamdulillah fills up the scales so minimal amount of work and effort so great reward from Allah the all-mighty we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuhu this is your brother in Islam in green and you're watching peace TV where truth is hidden leaving petitions create confusion where truth is hidden lack of knowledge and wisdom caused upheaval and commotion where truth is headed my way the scriptures and twisted facts emerge this very hidden truth creates false propaganda mission chaos disorder and turmoil in our lives and the world order but is there anyone with courage and wisdom what is the truth and who has the courage tricks because it's watch truth prevail and lies perish in truth exposed by dr zakir naik next on peace TV and welcome back alhamdulillah fills the scales and subhanAllah and at hamdulillah fills what's between the heavens and the earth so what is Subhan Allah Subhan Allah is a word that states that Allah Azza WA JAL the Almighty is secure and far away from whatever does not befit him and from whatever is imperfect so this small phrase subhana Allah gives Allah Azza WA JAL all attributes of perfection and it means that we free allah the almighty from having anything that deals with imperfection or that is inappropriate to allah subhanaw taala and that is why when someone says Allah does not do this Allah cannot do that in sit subhanAllah meaning that Allah is praised Allah is glorified Allah is perfect and he's far away from any imperfection and in the hadeeth we have this encouragement to say subhanAllah and there are three stages of freeing allah azzawajal or not attributing things to allah that does not befit him subhanahu wa'ta'ala so when we say subhanAllah we mean that anything that is imperfect or anything that is negative cannot be attributed to Allah like saying Allah sleeps this is completely unacceptable Allah says in the Quran latter hallucinatin wala wrong Allah does not doze off and does not sleep because this is an attribute of imperfection and this does not befit Allah and the attributes of imperfection it can be an attribute of perfection to humans because if you say that a human does not sleep this means that he's imperfect he's sick something wrong with him when you say Allah does not sleep this means that Allah is perfect Allah is complete because I'll I cannot sleep if Allah sleeps and the whole universe would collapse no one sustains and takes care of this universe except Allah the Almighty Allah does not die and this is an attribute of perfection the second type is that the attribute is there but it reduces its perfection so any reduction in perfection is also unacceptable with Allah Almighty so if someone says that Allah gets tired Allah created the heavens and the earth in six days and rested on the seventh as the ignorant say as the disbelievers say this is unacceptable because a reduction in 'unless perfection is not accepted Allah says in the Quran that we've created the heavens and the earth in six days and we did not get tired nothing of tiresome came to us to Allah Almighty and the third thing that we say that allah azza wajal cannot have and this goes against the perfection of allah subhanaw taala is when we simulate Allah to his creation when we say that Allah is like this Allah has hands like humans or allah azza wajal does this like humans all attributes of Allah social are unlike any Allah says in the Quran there is nothing like unto him and he is all-hearer the all-seer so you believe that Allah hears and sees but does he hear and see like us definitely not there is nothing similar to Allah there is nothing like a lot Almighty so praising Allah saying alhamdulillah these are attributes of perfection with love and glorification so this is completing and praising Allah while saying subhanAllah is deflecting anything that is imperfect from allah azzawajal and freeing allah from any such negative attributes so one completes and one negates and both subhanAllah and alhamdulillah they fill what's between the heavens and the earth and that is why if you look at the hadith at the beginning purity is half of the Amen so this is physical purity and praising Allah and glorifying Allah by saying subhanAllah hamdulillah this is spiritual purity the Prophet goes on to say that prayer is light and it is a light your prayer your salat is a light in your heart it's a light in your face you can tell by looking at people who pray that they pray it's a light in your grave it's a light on the day of judgement and whoever truly believes and who ever truly prays will find this light in his life and that is why our prophet our asaram was the first to find this light he used to say that my heart's satisfaction is only found in prayer and whenever he had a problem he used to rush to pray and ask Allah Azza WA JAL unfortunately a lot of the Muslims neglect ignore prayer you see a lot of Muslims sometimes you see Muslims with beards not praying on time ok why aren't you praying on time he says I have work I have this to do I have that to do the priority in your life should come to prayer and everything follows the prophet alayhi salatu salam tells us about charity and he tells us that charity is proof what is meant by proof I could claim from here till the day of judgement that I'm a believer that I believe that Allah is the sustainer the provider etc but if I don't verify this claim with actions then it's all in thin air and the verification of my claims is by paying by spending by taking money from my pocket and giving it as charity believing that the one who gave it to me will accept it and he will give me more so it is a proof in this sense it proves that you truly and sincerely depend on Allah the Almighty and the Prophet tells us about patience and how it illuminates life and this illumination has some heat into it it's not like prayer prayer is light light without any Heat patience has illumination has some heat to it why because it is hard it is difficult and there are three types of patients there is being patient on offering what you're commanded to do so to pray you need patience you can't just simply wake up every morning at 4 o'clock a.m. get off your bed wash yourself go to the Masjid and pray you need to have patience in able to do this or to fast Ramadan or to give zakat or to perform pilgrimage there is patience on staying away from Hara from forbidden things the temptation is strong I'd like to have this glass of wine I'd like to fornicate I'd like to gamble these are forbidden things so I have to have patience so that I can prevent myself from going there and third type of patience is to be patient and tolerant to the calamities of Allah my car was stolen this is a calamity I have nothing to do with it what you do well you have to be patient in your heart by saying that this is something a larger will decreed upon me I have to accept it I'll report it to the police I'll try to look for my car but it is something that aggravates me I'm not going to have any bad feelings or negative feelings I'm not going to complain and say why I don't know that Muslims do this they complain and say why me I visited an old man once he was in his 70s he was sick bedridden and I said uncle may Allah have mercy on you this is all for your good deeds Allah will erase your bad deeds and he said my son I don't have any concerns except one I've been praying to Allah for 50 years in this Masjid next to my door every single prayer and my neighbor has not played a single prayer in that Masjid yet look at me bedridden and look at him as strong as a bull and I said subhanAllah uncle you have wasted all of your prayers you're objecting to a large rulings you have to have patience in your heart by not complaining in your tongue by not saying bad things such as this and in your actions by tolerating and not tearing your dresses or slamming your face as the ignorant would do the Prophet tells us a lot to some that the Quran is either something that would help you on the day of judgment or will be against you on the day of judgment so if you apply it if you abide by it if you obey the instructions to stay away from its prohibition it would be something that would defend you on the day of judgment as the hadith that the Quran would intercede for you on the day of judgment and if you don't then it would condemn you to hell because you read it you recited it and you went against it and then the Prophet tells us about Allah salatu salam the individual who wakes up every morning as a vendor selling his soul every one of us we wake in the morning what do we do we portray our soul for sale meaning that my actions would determine where my soul would be some of us may manage to free this soul by abiding by the Sharia by going and following for Anderson and some of us would send it to its doom and destruction by going against the Koran and from this hadith we learned that freedom is not what so many of us think if you ask someone what is freedom you'd say ah to be able to party all night long to be able to be with my loved one to be able to date this or to go out on tour or to go around the world in a cruise this is freedom freedom is to be able to wear whatever I want whenever I want freedom is to do whatever I feel like doing and this is not the definition of freedom the Prophet tells us are en salat WA Salam in the hadith and he says that every person starts his day as a vendor of his soul either freeing it or causing its ruin how do you free your soul by worshipping Allah soldier but this feels like a lot of restrictions I cannot do a lot of things I want to do this is freedom when you party all night long when you're addicted to smoking pot or doing drugs or drinking alcohol when you are so in love with this girlfriend of yours that you do things that are not lawful this is not freedom you're enslaving yourselves to these things but if you free your soul by worshipping the creator of the heavens and the earth and doing what he tells you to do your freedom is when you put your forehead on the ground praying to Allah asking him for forgiveness your freedom is when someone offers you a glass of wine or some whiskey and you say I don't drink I'm a Muslim your freedom is when you free yourself from being attached enslaved and dragged down to earth by these worldly matters and liberating yourself by worshipping and following a last command over you this is all the time we have and meet next time ta Manila Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh you"
