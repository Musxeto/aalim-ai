  "transcript": "is I have mandatory music lessons in school um and the teachers are saying that they've spoke to religious leaders and it's fine for educational purposes so my question is is music fine for educational purposes and can I do with music lessons in school the answer is no there is no dispute among Scholars that music musical instruments are prohibited in Islam the four schools of thought Abu hanifa Malik schools of thought all agree that musical instruments are prohibited according to the numerous a Hadith that the prophet saws prohibited it so when your Administration or teachers speak to uh so-called Scholars these are not Scholars this is uh I need Tom Dick and Harry who don't even know a thing or two they don't have authority to give fatwa over such religious things so definitely you're not allowed to go to such classes"
