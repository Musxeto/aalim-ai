  "title": "Can I keep clothes, badges etc that have cross on them? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um i have some uniforms like some jerseys and things from when i was in school and some badges that i kept for memories and because like you know people write on them messages or whatever um but the problem is the press of the school has a cross symbol in it so is it permissible if i keep these you know in a cupboard in a container or something or should i cover up the crest so it's not no longer visible it's it's a real cross or it's just a plus sign uh it's like it's a cross meant to be like a christian cross no this okay the prophet was had never seen something that was at the shape of a cross without going to it and dismantling it and removing it because a cross which is the christian cross is a sign of idol worshipping the christians worship this idol they wear it they tattoo it they have it in all their places of worship and we believe as muslims that resemble maryam peace be upon him jesus christ will come and descend at the end of time and the first thing he would do is to break the cross because this is their false ideology and belief they believe that isa jesus peace be upon him was crucified and died on the cross which is something that the quran denies and the prophet wasallam told us that this is a blatant lie he was not crucified and he did not die nor was killed peace be upon him rather he was ascended to the heavens and he awaits until allah orders him to descend and to kill the antichrist the dajjal and to rule with sharia law where all the whole earth would be in prosperity and blessings when everything is under the ruling of sharia and of islam therefore you must dismantle this cross you must break it or cover it permanently or put some dye or paint on it so that it would not be recognized you"
