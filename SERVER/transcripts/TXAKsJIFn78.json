  "transcript": "from bangladesh says he often gets this with swas what's was it's whispers of shaytaan and he seeks frequently refuge in allah azzawajal sometimes it goes sometimes it doesn't so how does he know whether this is from shaitaan or from himself it doesn't matter it's the same so the end result is the same and usually there is a huge collaboration between the two maybe satan does this on his own maybe some sometimes satan collaborates with your own soul and self where you have your own whims and desires and he mixes both together so it doesn't make any difference just seek continue to seek refuge in allah azzawajal from these whispers and try to remain steadfast you"
