  "title": "How to treat an apostate? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother yakub says Asam alaykum I have three questions uh the first question well the situation is as follows he has three brothers who converted to Christianity over 10 years and they all have families and live separately so originally they were Muslims but they The Three Brothers committed the act of apostasy they rejected Islam and they embraced Christianity so his questions are as follows how should I and the rest of my Muslim family treat them how would a Muslim treat a relative who committed the act of apostasy well first of all you have to show the W and the bar you have to declare your refusal of such an act of apostasy and you have to hate this act of apostasy and you have to announce your rejection to sh to such an act secondly there are no pledges of Allegiance between you and that relative who committed the act of apostasy whether he is your father your mother or your brother the minute he rejects Islam in such a fashion you have no relationship with him or any pledge of allegiance to assist him or to help him thirdly if you think or believe that it is possible that he may come back and he may listen to what you say in this case it is permissible for you to visit him to give him advice even to give him gifts so that maybe Allah would open his heart for you to accept him uh uh or for him to accept Islam once again it is permissible for you to help him providing that you feel that there is a possibility for him to come back but if you feel that he is defiant he is fixed on not accepting Islam it would be advisable for him for you to shun him to civer all connections with him especially if you feel that this would add value and make him feel bad about what he had done because my relationship with any human being is dependent on what Allah has instructed me to do so I love my neighbors I love my family and I love those uh uh who are related to me because they obey Allah and if they're not Muslims Allah tells me to connect to my next of kin but if they committed the act of apostasy this is blasphemy and this cers all connections and uh commitment between me and them"
