  "transcript": "blessings of Allah beond beond of Allah and blessings of Allah dear brothers and sisters in Islam Mercy for mankind is our Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam there's so much to learn about him even if we spend our entire lives reading his biography reading his Sunnah we would not be able to reach all edges of it it's an Endless Sea it's an endless ocean that is filled with Goods favors and blessings of Allah asael it needs a good diver to dive in and extract the pearls and jewels underneath today I will begin to study with you a milestone in the history of Islam one would say are you going to take talk about b or are you going to talk about the migration from meca to Medina actually I'm going to talk about an event that took place on the fifth year of Hijra and that is the Battle of Al known as the battle of the the trench also known as the Battle of alab so why pick such an incident firstly because Allah revealed the regarding this battle and it's called after it second of all after this battle was over the prophet Alat highlighted this great milestone by saying today we invade them and they do not invade us meaning that the idol worshippers of qur they will not be able to invade the Muslims in Medina and the tables have been turned over them and this was a prophecy that Allah asael has fulfilled to his Prophet sallallahu alaih alhi wasallam what is the origin of this great battle now we know the hatred and enmity of the disbelievers to the religion of Islam and specifically to Muhammad sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam the prophet of Islam the messenger of Allah asael and among the those who hated him and his religion most were the Jews the origin of this battle who ignited the fires were the Jews and throughout time and quote me if you wish but I'm not being racist I'm not being anti-semitic because the Jews and the Muslims originally are cousins the Jews are the descendants of Isaac the son of ibraim while the Muslims are the descendants of Ismael the son of ibraim so actually they are cousins it's not something racial about them however if you read throughout the history you will always see the Fingerprints of the Jews in all catastrophes calamities problems worldwide it's hidden but it's there and in the Quran Allah described them in a way as if we can see them their treachery their deceit they constant lying all the time just hear any Declaration of an Israeli politician and you will find that lies flies out of his mouth and they're not ashamed of that they tell you that this is who we are and this is what we do best they are arrogant and look at everyone else as their own mules and donkeys to use for riding when the prophet sallallah Al wasallam came to Medina there were three prominent tribes of the Jews living in Medina there was there was and there was and about 80 miles north of Medina there was another Village known as which was inhabited by Jews but we're focusing on on the Jews who were living among the Arabs who were living among the Muslims in Medina and the reason the Jews have this personal vandetta against the Muslims and the messenger of Allah asael specifically at the time of Medina historian tells us historians tell us that the Jews used to have a feud used to have skirmishes and small fights with the Arabs inhabiting Medina and they would threaten them and tell them that this is the ERA this is the time when Allah would send a messenger and we will fight under his flag and we will Anni annihilate you all and we will kill you all so they were anticipating this and when the prophet Alat wasam came and was given the message they were disappointed because they were hoping that he was a Jew which he wasn't sallallahu alaihi wasallam he was an Arab so they expressed their inity and they went out of the way they went overboard because was their hatred their Envy as Allah described in the Quran made them hate Muhammad sallah wasallam and anything that he says is in his beautiful s reported that mother safah and we know that safah is the wife of the Prophet Alat wasam but before he married her she was a Jew and she was the daughter of Hu one of the prominent leaders of B so she tells us that I was the most beloved child to my father and to my uncle Abu yaser and they would not favor any boy or girl over me whenever they see me they would leave their offspring and embrace me and kiss me because I was their beloved good child when the prophet came sallallahu alaihi wasallam to Medina she says and he was announced to stay in Kuba my father and Uncle went to see him early morning and they took their time they came at the end of the day just before Sunset and they were dragging their feet they were lazy they were depressed so I went went to them to greet them as I usually do expecting them to embrace me to kiss me Etc but they did not even pay any attention to me and they did not look at me because they were so depressed she says I heard my uncle Abu Yasir say to my father is he the one is he the man and my father said by Allah is the man so Abu yaser said do you know him do you recognize him you're sure about that you can describe him and my father said yes so my uncle said to him okay then what are we going to do about him meaning should we follow him should we fight him what do you advise so my father said by Allah I will exchange enmity with him as long as I live and this is Envy this is pure rage and hatred to the prophet wasam though the prophet did not do anything to them so this how it started now when we say that the enmity of the Jews to Islam and the Muslims not that all of them are enemies of Islam there are among the Jews those who are peaceful those who are kind and loving to other nations and Islam has as would they say has no beef with them and Islam tells us to be kind to them some of them even go the extra mile and they are people of reason and intellect they see what's right and they follow it it was reported that abdah Salam may Allah be pleased with him and he was one of their great Scholars and rabbis he said when I heard about the coming of the Prophet Alat wasam and people talk about him I said to myself let me go and see this man so he went and he said the minute I saw his face I recognized that he this is not the face of a liar now look at his objectivity he's going there to check the man but he doesn't have any hidden agendas he's going there as a seeker of Truth in his scriptures there is a prophecy of a man coming to be the Seal of the prophets in his scriptures there is a description of a man coming similar to Musa a being a an orphan being raised in hardship being uh uh migrating from one uh place to the other so he just went there to listen to him so he recognized the face of the Prophet Alam is not the face of a liar then the first thing he heard were words of wisdom when the prophet said oh people spread the word of peace and this is the greetings of the Muslims peace be upon you and feed the food to the needy and the hungry and pray at night when the people are asleep and you shall enter the paradise of Allah asael In Peace So Abdullah Salam when he came and asked the prophet Alat wasam and the prophet answered his questions he was convinced he said these questions no one can answer them except a prophet of Allah and I believe that you are the prophet of Allah he became Muslim on the spot a rabbi a scholar however he was smart he said oh prophet of Allah if the Jews hear about my rever reversion and conversion to Islam they will most likely slunder me and say bad things about me however I would request that you call them summon them and ask them about me and then tell them about my acceptance to Islam so he hid behind the curtain and the prophet Alam called the scholars and the rabbis of the Jews and he asked them how is abdah Salam among you how do you rate him so they said to him he is the most knowledgeable Among Us and his father was the most knowledgeable Among Us and he is the best of us as his father was the best of Our Generation so the prophet Alat wasam said to them what would you do if you come to learn that Abdullah Salam has accepted Islam and embraced it and they said we seek refuge in Allah from this no this cannot happen and they repeated this twice or three times so the prophet alhat wasam called Abdullah Salam to come out and when he came out he said to them mamad then they turned against him and said he is the most evil Among Us and the son of the most evil Among Us they changed their words they altered their statement because of hatred and their enmity and this is usual this is in the genes of the Jews this is their belief okay now when we say that this doesn't mean that there is a Black Sheep here and there this doesn't mean that there can be good people among the Jews who stand with the truth and defend it this is found but it is very rare like red mercury we see them defending the rights of the Palestinians and standing in the face of the oppression of the zionists and the Israeli armies we see those but they're very little they're very few and we have to stand by them and we had have to congratulate them and show them our support to them but in general the hatred of the Jews was not only to the prophet Alat wasam and they know this it was to their own Messengers and Prophets as Allah describes in the Quran that the so many Messengers and Prophets sent to them they either accuse them of lying or they would kill them and slaughter them their own prophets and Messengers they have no problem in killing them they have no problem in assassinating them and this is the role model of today's Jews and Israelis assassinations they're good at it because it's based on deceit and lies they tried to kill the prophet a number of times the confirmed are two and one is found in the books of history and that was even when he was a child giving to Hala sallallahu alaihi wasallam to suckle him and breastfeed him and when she met the Jews and asked them about this these wonders about this boy and the Miracles that Allah has shown her through him they asked is he an orphan and she was afraid to tell them the truth so she said no I'm his mother and this man is his father and they told her had he been an orphan we would have killed him because this is the the prophet and the messenger who would come at the end of time and they tried to kill the prophet Alat wasam in two other incidents tried to kill him once and also in when they gave the prophet Alam a sheep that was filled with poison to eat from so this is history and we can see it open the news look and read between the lines and you will see the Fingerprints of the Jews everywhere in calamities in wars in chaos even in the financial crisis who runs Finance throughout the world who controls Banks and financial institutions who controls the media what is the main cause of brainwashing people's minds through the media through the the violence in the movies through the lyrics and the songs Through the articles in magazines and newspapers it's the Jews they're good planners and they work hard but the thing that they did not figure out was that it is Allah that they're fighting and they have no ability and no one has the ability to fight Allah the almighty and they will be defeated without any doubt and the Muslims would kill them at the end of the time though Islam is not a religion of violence but it's not a religion of weakness at the end of the time at the End of Time the Jews will collaborate with the Antichrist known to us as M the impostor there will be 70,000 of them and they will originate from asahan in nowadays Iran and this shows you the G great collaboration between the Jews and the Persians the fire worshippers or those who claim to be Muslims among the ra who bluntly say that the Quran is distorted who curse all the companions of the Prophet Alam these are not Muslims of course it shows you the collaboration because the Dalal would originate from there and 70,000 of the Jews of asahan would accompany him at the end of time this is when they will hide behind trees and rocks and Allah would make the trees and rocks talk to the Muslims and say oh Muslim oh servant of Allah behind me is a Jew come and kill him so this is a specific incident that will happen and take place at the end of time not that Islam is a violent religion we coexist with the Jews the Jews never had a safe haven never had a safe place to live in except under the Islamic laws they've been living in Arabia in Morocco in Egypt in Iraq in Syria all over the place in peace for centuries however look how the Muslims are being treated whenever the Jews are in control 70 years they came to Palestine as guests the Muslims the Palestinians opened their doors to them what did they do they kicked them out unlocked the door and now they're treating them as Invaders and they're treating the the Muslims the Arabs that the the original owners of of the land they're treating them as in people who are coming from abroad and trying to take their own land and they chant and sing This Land Is Mine God give this land to me who said it's yours it's like the red Indians overthrowing the American government and annihilating the people because this is their land well actually maybe this is why the US government supports Israel because they feel that they are there's chemistry among them they're all Invaders and they're all aggressors transgressors and they're all killers it's not their land and it's the land of the Muslims where all would find peace and tranquility and fairness this was their way of spreading chaos since the beginning of time controlling the financing they're the best people to deal with Usery with riba interest based so all financial institutions all bankingsales of FNA of Distributing or distracting or dividing the people this is what they do best in the books of History thei reported in his tap that shb the Jew and he was one of the Jews who hated Islam most and he had this real grudge against the Muslims it was reported that he once passed by the ansar and we know that the ansar were made of two big tribes Al and alaz and there was a 100 years old feud between these two tribes of the same city of Medina and when the prophet came Alat and they accepted Islam they all became as one they all became brothers so he passed Chas passed by them and they were gathering and laughing and talking as brothers and he could not bear this so he went back to his tribe and he asked one of his slaves one of his servants to go there and to say poetry and Arabs love poetry but to say the poetry that would provoke their feelings of avengeance and revenge and remind them of the words they had so the boy went there and he started saying poetry and each sides their blood started to boil they remembered their ancestors they remember their uncles their fathers who died who perish who were assassinated who were killed in such battles and before long they started to fight with one another Shan overwhelmed them came to take control so they felt that it's time to avenge one another and they started to Feud and they almost got physical with the swords and only at that time the prophet Alat wasam heard of it so he went out with the muajin with the migrants from quray and he stood there and shouted at them are you calling with the slogans and calls of the pre-islamic era of Jah while I am among you Allah asael has honored you with Islam Allah the almighty has cut off you the issues of ignorance and Allah had made you to become Brethren the people immediately realized that this was from Shan so they threw their arms they embraced one another hugged one another and started to cry apologizing from one another and that day Allah asael revealed INB the Ayah saying say oh people of the scriptures Jews and Christians why do you stop those who have believed from the path of Allah seeking to me make it seem crooked while you yourselves are witnesses to Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam the messenger of Allah and Islam the religion of Allah that is to worship one but him alone and Allah is not unaware of what you do so this was a warning to Shas and those who were with him that why are you doing this what is it that you hate about Islam most is it because they call for the Oneness of Allah and not to worship any other is it because Islam prohibits intoxications fornications using uh dealing with Usery and riba being bad to your parents sing your kinship what is it that you hate about Islam and if you you have an iota of logic you would discover that Islam is a great religion and that all the negative things that may seem to you negative you will find that these minute things are overwhelmed by the greatness the advantages and the Beautiful Things in Islam we have a short break stay tuned and we'll be right back asalam alaykum and welcome back the lines are open for your questions if you have any uh we have a question from R she says that is it true that if a mother feeds her child even after the period of two years is over then every drop of milk that a child drinks is Haram this is baseless to totally um a big blat LIE there's nothing like this the scholars have differed whether it is permissible for a woman to exceed the period of two years in suckling the child or not because after two years now the child is capable of eating and should not drink anymore and this was the period given in the Quran but there's nothing in Islam that prohibits it so some Scholars say that she could go on to three years and some say that she could go on for four years but this is not natural this is not normal therefore U maybe the scholars who said that two and a half years is the max would be the right thing to do nevertheless one should not be hooked to such an addiction which is an addiction to the mother more than the child because the mother is so attached to her child she doesn't want to uh uh sort of kick the habit anyhow this uh uh should not be prolonged for too long and the child should learn how to uh eat normal food and Allah knows best uh Sarah says I have been afflicted by the evil eye for three years now I am doing on myself my question is will the healing take longer because I have had it so long the issue of r definitely is one of the greatest means of healing in Islam and is a number of verses of the Quran or prophetic hadiths or supplications and invocations to Allah recited over someone who is ill whether physically or mentally whether something that is tangible and we can see and touch or whether it is something that is mental such as the evil eye such as the possession of Jin black magic Envy Etc and this was directed To Us by the prophet Alat wasam when he said whoever is capable of benefiting his brother meaning through Rya he should do so and the prophet also instructed sallallahu alaihi wasallam the Muslims to give Rya when he saw a child with a change in his face and he asked them to give R to him so evil eye is there and evil eye is different than Envy because evil eye is ignited when someone sees something he likes and this person can be righteous and can be a good person but Subhan Allah he did not say may Allah bless he did not uh make Dua so his he ignited this and it went straight through so the best thing for a person who gave an evil eye to clear the patient from his harm is to perform woodo and to wash the inside of your garment and then the water would be collected and thrown over the patient from behind and he will be as good as new if this is not possible then we have to do Rya and Rya May work in a week it may take longer it depends on how strong your conviction is how strong your belief in Allah is and how good the Rya was done so if you believe in Allah and you recite the Rya over zamzam water and you wash yourself with zamzam and drink of that and you trust Allah 100% you will be cured inshallah how long will it take it doesn't matter as long as you believe in Allah we know that Prophet a peace be upon him was sick for 17 years and he was a prophet and then after 17 or 18 years Allah healed him and cured him so this is Allah's test for you you have to be patient you have to be tolerant and you have to be a believer and with the grace of Allah Allah would cure you uh Bas from Saudi please I'm asking on beh of his sister he said want to know they she's staying with her husband they have she's staying with her husband they are not married they have two children they plan to get married but unfortunately the the husband died before they got married so she want to know will she stay a mon for the prescribed four month and 10 days they were not married at all they were not they had the intention of getting married but they were not married any more questions yeah I want to ask I always pray my at home I don't go to Mo and I always like is he rewarding as as going to the mo okay all right thank you very much you're quite quite welcome Salman hello yes Salman from Pakistan yes I had two questions yes sir first I wanted to you know ask you something it was in documents in Wikileaks that said lots of network in you know Islamic states and countries have been paid off by Saudi government and your Network's name was in that list it says that you have been paid $112,000 in year 2012 by Saudi government not to say anything against them my my name I was I was your Network's name my name okay not your personal name your Network's name what's my network name it's not your name is Huda TV all right okay and lots of other channels I wanted to see if it is true and secondly there was a caller yesterday and in answer to his question you said that Saudis are not killing people in Yemen but whoes are okay okay I think the brother was cut off very uh expected but um C okay Bas says that she has a woman had two children from an illegal uh relationship they intended to get married and then the man died so does she wait the period the answer is no she is a fornicator she is an adulteress she was living in a prohibited relationship with this man and she and him were in a m major sin so definitely she has no because the is to honor the husband who died by staying in mourning for four months and 10 days and she was not uh uh like that so the answer is no she has no because of his death Muhammad from Africa Alum uh quick question for you I'd like you to clarify for the five Salah prayers what are the actual breakdown what is Sunnah what is far what is na that should be done as a normal thing every day okay you're quite welcome the second question of Bas was uh if she prays in the house is this permissible the answer is this is recommended not permissible the women are encouraged and recommended to pray at home as the prophet saidham and their reward by praying at home is more than their reward by praying uh in the Masjid Salman from Pakistan like our brother uh I don't know what's his name jabber or something from Afghanistan yesterday again raised the issue of Saudi Arabia and he says that he read in Wikileaks that Saudi uh government paid uh uh agencies and one of them our Network I think he meant uh um uh what's it called uh Huda TV they paid them in 2012 $112,000 $112,000 this is my monthly salary what are you talking about what is this this is peanuts it's not even uh uh uh money enough for one minute advertisement in a respected uh TV and he says that how authentic is this again what is it that you guys have against Saudi Arabia is it the hatred in your heart because they live a good life and they have a good income and they spread Islam worldwide and they have the biggest Print House of Quran and they serve mecah and Medina and they give scholarships to students from all over the world and because education for the citizens and the noncitizens are free so is the medical care is it because they produce the greatest and highest amount of Scholars in the world spreading the man of and most likely yes this is the only reason I can find for you to have such a grudge you say things against them that you don't say against America or against the Jews Israel no no one called complaining about what the Jews are doing in Israel so it shows that these people are delusional they have their hidden agenda and look at their source of information Wikipedia or Wikileaks or Wiki wackos what is is this are you a Muslim and you if someone publishes in Wiki leaks that uh what's his name Salman's father was a Jew from asbah would I take this for granted Allah says in whenever someone who is immorally practicing someone who is a sinner someone who's not reliable brings you with a piece of information make sure and authenticate it and all what you're doing is slandering a whole country that defends Islam and the Muslims and helps to spread the word of Allah by an article in wik leaks have some sense in you but again coming to his second remarks about the houthis before the strikes began what were the houthis doing what did they do to the legitimate uh uh uh government what did they do to the sunnis what did they do in Dage killing all the salais and bombarding their Villages what they did they do to the scholars of Islam the Muslims in Yemen taking everything into their control and opening a back door to the Iranians to come and control it again it's the same uh um propaganda being paid for by the Iranians being used by those uh uh people may Allah asael guide them Muhammad from Africa uh okay before Muhammad uh T from the Emirates yes yes what can I do for you yeah please I have a question uh I'm a married and uh I'm a married and we we are alhamdulillah we are Muslims happy family but my husband this is the first time he's dreaming in his dreams that we're getting diversed so I want to ask what does

bre for them to cook food for you to eat who's cooking food for you some sister like maybe people or sister that you live with from the same country you don't know them I will answer the question inshallah Ahmed from Afghanistan sh I would just speaking I think this is because of poor connection I want to say that in the month of Ramadan actually uh I saw many Muslims being happy and many of them being angry about what's going on in the region basically I about a and I believe that it emergence has a has a background related to salafism and you know wahabism in the in Islam and Muslim world as the as the wahab brand that is was brought by Hillary Clinton to the region because it wanted to destroy and you know vilify Real Islam I know what how these groups are formed and I so clearly know everything about this say as you said these are the of Z we shouldn't allow them to live any longer we need to be bring real force in this okay I got I got your message Ahmed and I will inshallah try to uh speak in a way about it are she from Saudi Ramadan and to you as well my question is about prayer uh like I read in books uh with reference to sah bukari as well that uh prophet sallu alai wasallam used to take a short nap or maybe sleep and then used to get up for Taj Salah but sometimes what I notice in my routine that I'm not sleeping in the night either I'm doing my household course or some reading or some of my college work and then I want to offer T Salah so can I do it I mean without sleeping in the night okay I will answer I will answer you're quite welcome Ahmed Khan I have two questions initially I want to ask if uh as nowadays if I have sold land worth 10 million to someone and he has paid Me 2 million and then he declines and he's not able to pay the rest of the money so should I return the money back because according to the laws uh I mean the land laws which are followed in this worldly affair we are not supposed to pay the money back but what is it in Islam okay second and second is I have a cousin he married a girl and then he divorced her but that he divorced her without consuming the marriage now he wants to remarry the girl so is he going to do it after the Halala thing or he can remarry the girl okay I will answer you inshallah thank you Asia from Saudi for this beautiful program Mah we are getting lot of knowledge alhamdulillah authentic knowledge all the past companion knowledge what we are supposed to get it alhamdulillah we are getting at home may Allah bless you may Allah bless this country amen who who is allowing this to to transmit to all over the world may Allah give to this country to this Channel and to you no questions okay I think no questions we have nine minutes so I think we will stop taking questions so I can answer the questions at hand uh Muhammad from Africa says can you tell me about the prayers what are the five daily prayers there are the mandatory five daily prayers two ra of four R of four R of four three ra of and four of the are these are 17 mandatory they are they're obligatory now the highly recommended Sunnah are 12 in number and they're distributed as follows two before F four before two after two after and two after is these are 12 whoever observes them every single day and night Allah would build him a house in Jenna is it a house for every day or is it a house for the entire lifespan Allah is most generous don't feel being deprived of any good from Allah Asel the na prayers the door is open so if you add two to the existing two after so that makes it four and if you add four Before Time so this is also permissible and of course you have the Witter which is highly recommended and you have night prayer as well Tara from the Emirates she says that she's married happily married with her husband and her husband has been getting these dreams of divorce so what is this I don't do dreams uh uh um interpretation I don't have knowledge in it U um simple as that but I know one thing it's either two things either your husband is eating too much before going to bed so it's causing him these nightmares mares and this is probable or this is his subconscious because you're nagging and you are dealing with him unfairly and you're not being kind to his parents so his subconscious is creating these the third option which is always there this is shaan so he should when he wake up seek refuge in Allah from thean and Dy spit three times to his left uh uh providing that you're not on his left so this is what is recommended Allah knows best Ahmed from Afghanistan as usual a good introduction uh from these countries and then they start to um fire at whatever they think is right and I beg to differ he claims that salafi and wahhabi is a byproduct of har Clinton and this is so pathetic and and so illogical for someone to claim that something that had been here here for three centuries was the byproduct of uh someone like that and disbeliever salaf and wab if there is anything as wahhab there isn't anything nobody around says I'm a wahhabi or something except to laugh about over people but it is it is it is it is the same methodology the same manh the same AA that the prophet was uh uh embracing and conveying to his companions and the umah so those who attack it they do this out of their ignorance or they do this out of their extreme love to their deviant sects Sufism Shia uh Etc you name it there are 73 of them the prophet said Alam All In Hell except one this is what the prophet said my um would divide into 73 sects or Cults all of them are in Hell except one which one is it those who are following my footsteps and no one can claim that he is following the footsteps of the Prophet Alam in terms of in or in terms of or in terms of uh moral conduct or in any any aspect no one can claim this except the salafis except those who abide by the Quran the Sunnah they Clans to them with the understanding of the righteous predecessors no matter what you are or where are where you are from if you don't have this methodology then you're not part ofama because you're following Tom di or Harry we follow the prophet we follow his companions we follow the we follow their understanding because they understood the Quran more than we did and they took it straight from the prophet's mouth sallallahu alaih wasallam so claiming that these these Isis Affiliated d these uh terrorist extremists fundamentalists Fanatics you call them whatever you want to be originally salafis or wahhabis I tell you definitely not the principles among all salais is the Hadith of the Prophet Alam who says that whoever kills a disbeliever who has a covenant so any Christian Jew or anyone who's a disbeliever there's a covenant between him and our government and he's residing in our homes in our countries whoever killed this disbeliever this Infidel this cafer whoever kills him will not find the scent of Jenna will not enter Paradise this is what salais believe now you compare us to these people who kill not only disbelievers they kill the Muslims they burn them alive they drown them alive do you believe in this this has nothing to do with the Islam they are Professionals in extracting women from their wives from their husbands from taking children from their fathers and they are taking them of to to Syria or to Iraq and making them give takir to their husbands and their fatwa is ready to make their marriage void and they remarry someone else so they are fornicators they're adulteresses these are committing the act of Zen but they have already made fatwa by who by Abu XY Z you don't know their names you don't know their tribes you don't know their uh Scholars so I beg to differ you have to be fair once in your life and study Sala and study the religion of the Prophet Alam as it was revealed the religion that is embraced and the manh and methodology that is embraced by by Al albani the great Scholars of Islam byb by T by IM Ahmed by Abu Malik Shafi all of them were salafis but you failed to see that Islam from Saudi Arabia his question was unclear and he made the same mistake of turning on his TV and I'm hearing the echoing he's saying that he's living alone he doesn't have anyone to cook for him people send him food can he eat the answer is yes as long as you're in a Muslim country and you don't have any reason to doubt the food that that they sending you you can eat that food without any problem Ari from Saudi Arabia she says that she doesn't sleep at night so when she prays could this be counted could this be counted could this be counted as tud the answer is yes and no see tud is more rewarded than night prayer in general though it is part of not night prayer because it is preceded by sleeping so you would fight yourself to wake up and pray but if a put it done in this case you can take him to court and demand the 8 million back or he just gave you this as uh a down payment and the transaction was not done in this case this is called down payment and the majority of Scholars say that if he did not conclude the uh transaction and give you the rest of the money the money is totally yours and the last question someone divorced his wife before consummating the marriage and he wants to remarry again if this was the first divorce and actually it cannot be any other than the first divorce if he did not consumate the marriage in this case yes he can marry her again but he has one down two divorces to go and Allah Asel knows best with this we come to the conclusion of our episode for today meet you
