  "transcript": "brothers sisters assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu and welcome again to a new episode of contemporary filth issues we have with us again our guest chef and father Shea Hassan milkman Hakim shehas and welcome Zach muhajirun thank you for having me Erika la fille comme si Hassan is one of the well known diet was travelled extensively around the world and lectured in both English and Arabic he's the hottie and Imam of Masjid in Jeddah Saudi Arabia and has been in such position for the last 21 years she today we're going to discuss a very serious issue that a lot of Muslims find difficult in dealing with and we ask a lot to save us from it and as the issue of abortion we'd like your expert opinion on the issue but first we're gonna we have a report that we filmed with a doctor dr ehab Sanaa ha so let's go to the report first inshallah not ahem my name is a Hobson's aha I am a lecturer and consultant of of ascetic and gynecology today we are going to talk about abortion abortion can be defined as termination of pregnancy during the first or during the second trimester and it can be done on a debt or a living fetus the types of abortions are many it includes it includes a blighted ovum which is an an embryonic pregnancy can be spontaneous it can be incomplete it can be complete it can be missed it can be septic or it can be recurrent abortion the instance of abortion before the age of 12 years before the age of 20 years is about 12% and the incidence is about 26% above the age of 40 years and the instance of spontaneous abortion is about 80% how all I'm sorry the more than 80% of spontaneous abortions occur during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy the causes of abortions are many it could be fatal like chromosomal anomalies whether it's an employee or employee an employee like trisomy monosomy which is 45 X 3 ploidy tetraploid II it could be of maternal origin like if she has a chronic debilitating disease like TV or cancer it could be endocranial causes like hypothyroidism or diabetes mellitus it could be you trying if we have uterine anomalies was acetate or substitute or bicornuate uterus or incompetent us it could be from drugs like alcohol caffeine tobacco could be from radiation or from contraception if she has an ID inside the uterus can be from other diseases like Rambo philia or antiphospholipid syndrome or systemic lupus erythematosus axes are too many reasons for abortion and the least is infection indications of abortions are if the baby is dead we should give some other treatment in the form of drugs or we should or we could do an surgery in the form of evacuation and curettage if she's in the first trimester or induction of abortion if she's if she's in the second trimester his baby is living the indications are variable depending on whether the problem is in the mother or in the fetus is the problem is her mother like if she is having a heart disease that caught with 10 pregnancy we should terminate pregnancy if the mother develops a disease during pregnancy like preeclampsia or a clamp SIA we should terminate pregnancy if there are problems in the fetus like if the fetus is congenitally malformities there are many muffled if there are anomalies in the fetus we should terminate pregnancy but anomalies that cannot that cannot survive later on like neural tube defects like multiple congenital anomalies in the lames in the heart and abdomen in this case we should terminate assalamualaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh and welcome back she Hassan we just saw the report on the issue of abortion by dr ehab Samaha for many individuals in the West specifically people equate abortion with a miscarriage they say well a miscarriage is the same thing so why can't we have an abortion could you please elaborate on the difference between these two issues Rahim did not I mean sallallahu wasallam of our economy here also I mean Mena why honey he was happy he remained there is a difference between miscarriage and abortion miscarriage is something that is done without any human intervention so there is no interference from the part of the woman who's carrying the fetus or from an external part someone who beats her up or gives her medication or interferes surgically to have her abort the child so a miscarriage is something that happens from Allah Almighty as we say and we believe that it is in the best interest of the mother because usually as physicians say that whenever a miscarriage takes place this is because there is a some form of mutilation or deformation in the feeders that would most likely be the cause of this child to be born into some form of being  being yeah it's something that is wrong in it so Allah so John would choose for the pregnancy to be terminated as this early stage and as a believer we believe that whatever Allah has are gel rules upon a Muslim then this ruling is for his or her best and a miscarriage is as said is something that humans have known first intervention to or with not like abortion abortion is something that is prima dated and it is something that a person does either a physician or by sort of abuse of the pregnancy the mother can abort yourself by carrying heavy things for example or by being beaten by or abused by someone else and then she aborts her pregnancy and this form of abortion is divided into two types as we know that the first step is before the soul is breathed into the fetus and the second type is after it was breathed into the fetus allah almighty tells us in the Quran or the Prophet Allison tells us in the authentic hadith the creation of any one of you is put together in his mother's womb for 14 days so these are of course by a person who was illiterate and did not go into any medical schools sallallahu sallam the Prophet and who could not read and write yet it is a revelation from Allah he stated this fifteen centuries ago he said that the creation of any one of you is put together in his mother's womb for 14 days then he becomes a laka which is a piece of thick coagulated blood before a similar peared which is another 40 days then he becomes like a toothed piece of flesh for a similar period and this is another 40 days then Allah sends an angel who is enjoying to write down four things and it's said to him right down his deeds his provisions his lifespan and whether he is doomed for hell or distant to paradise then the soul is breathed into him so from this hadith we understand that the soul is breathed only after the hundred and twentieth day before ultimately three months four months four months and this before it the soul was not breathed so this gives us an indication that it's a different way of looking at a miscarriage or an abortion before having this also allows Adele tells us that the chewed bit a mudra it can be formed and not formed analyze or gel mentioned this in the Quran Allah Almighty said o mankind if you are in doubt about the resurrection then verily we have created you from dust then from ánotá which is mixed drops of male and female sexual discharge the offsprings of Adam that is then from a clot which is a piece of thick coagulated blood then from a little lump of flesh some formed and some unformed that we may make clear to you back off you come we'd like to continue insha'Allah after the break and discuss the difference between the forms and the unformed Sarah Malcolm allahi wa barakato you Oh [Music] amazing stories with theories of the whole end as well as the stories that were told to us by our beloved Prophet Muhammad Ali salat WA Salam are not fairy tales there are not stories that were made up to convince us of something they are true stories that actually happen they said in the message the Prophet Allah saw - sarin he's talking they said subhanAllah Baccarat in Tekken and they said Subhan Allah the car that speaks a last panel at Allah has created this universe my dear brothers and sisters in such a beautiful way that everything is balanced that every creature has a specific function that they do not go outside of that frame seas to panama how the Prophet Ali Saleh - Salam it's telling us about the story that happened before us and this reminds us of the fact that Islam is a universal religion in this program we will know about peoples from different times and places whose stories who were mentioned in the Islamic tradition all of this with sheikh lotfi will relate their stories and extract the lessons and wisdom behind them sir American War Akito and welcome back she has some just before the break we were discussing the differences between what is mentioned in the Quran the formed and the unformed what is the difference between these two there is a big difference in the sense that of the rulings that are given whether the fetus that was aborted or that came out as a form of the miscarriage whether it's formed or not formed so that we have the rulings regarding purity regarding the funeral prayer regarding washing the fetus and burying it or discarding it a number of things so is it fair to say that the difference between the forms and the unform is the difference of that period that the prophesy said I mentioned that when there's no spirit and then when the spirit is finally in the fetus no it's not because as mentioned in the hadith there are 40 days 40 days 40 days and then the spirit is or the soul is breathed into the fetus now scholars all agree that before the second phase which is 80 days this is not a living creature yet because the soul was not breathed into it first of all second of all it's just a clot of blood it's not still formed and they all agree that from day 120 onwards it's a living creature because the soul has been breathed into it so it's a living a creature the differences between day 81 and they 120 these forty days in between where it is either formed or unformed so if a miscarriage takes place in the spirit between the 80 and a 120 or an abortion takes place we have to look at what came out if it was four in the sense that it has arms it has legs it has the shape of a head then it takes the ruling of a born baby in the sense that it has for the mother that is but as a child no it's not it's not a living creature yet it doesn't have the spirit it doesn't have the soul spirit yet but for the mother if it was formed then if she was divorced we know that there is what is called as EDA and if the divorce takes place while a mother is pregnant she is out of the idea of the waiting period she still remains the wife of her husband until she gives birth the minute she gives birth then she is considered to have her EDA over so her waiting period after marriage yes after a marriage has been terminated so this is one second of all the blood that comes out of Ullman which is the post-delivery of bleeding this is considered to be one of the things that prevents her from praying if the fetus was formed but if it was not formed then she has to pray and she has to fast because this is not considered to be posting post-delivery bleeding and so on there are a number of verdicts if the fetus was formed she does not pray she does not fast if it was unformed she prays and she fast and so on if she is the the formed creature that goes out of the miscarriage and we ask a lot to protect us does it have a Jen answer that's prayed on it before if this if the soul still didn't enter the baby it's not considered to be living a living look that's why we do not pray janazah for it some scholars say because it is formed you can do this and this is a little bit closer to reality because it's in between a living creature and a clot of blood so because it has the formation of a living creature some scholars say that you would offer a funeral prayer and it wouldn't harm this miscarriage fetus to have this prayer inshallah it would add value and reward to the parents but in all cases once it's formed we bury it we just once it formed we have to bury it and we give it a proper burial because it is not something to throw out as in the case of a clot of blood or a piece of meat so Halle one can't help but think like after discussing this issue and understanding once the babies forms and so on I mean we see in the animal kingdom even animals are very protective of their offspring what could be worse than killing your own children in in the eyes of common day murder so what dry what would drive somebody to want to abort their own child well this has a lot of answers to it unfortunately but before going into these answers or cases we have to understand that Islam gives a lot of value to life and that is why like other religions it's forbidden in Islam to abort a child except in the very very limited cases that we will come to mention in Shia life there if the time allows us to what Islam gives a great value to life unfortunately when you do not have proper belief and Eman you tend to feel that life is something that is worthless usually people who perform abortion are those who conceived through Haram those who conceive through illegal means out of adultery or fornication maybe the doctors would come and say that the child or the fetus is not properly created in a sense that it has a deformity or something that is missing so the father and the mother would feel that we don't want to go into this let's abort the pregnancy all together maybe and in so many cases especially when dealing with abortion in a commercial way people would use the fetus in their stem cells research researches so they would sell this with a lot of money so whenever a woman comes in they would pretend that there's something wrong with her and they would advise her three or four doctors who don't fear Allah who don't know Allah and who are only interested in their wallets and bank accounts in her and they were tell her to go and abort the pregnancy for her for her own safety and well-being and they would take the fetus and would use its body parts it's used as stem cells and etc from it so there are a lot of reasons but among the reasons are abuse because not necessarily the consent of the mother is always there in abortion maybe if someone attacks her or beats her while she is pregnant and she is having this miscarriage or abortion accordingly so there are there are many reasons for that are there any Islamically valid reasons we could think of where a woman would want to abort her child for example if she was raped or she committed fornication scholars say that a pregnancy that resulted from rape though it is a great calamity the one that was raped is rewarded at the side of Allah because of this calamity and the child she is conceiving it has no guilt he did not do anything wrong to be killed for so they say that it is not permissible for her to perform this abortion and unless it's 40 days young or old or below but more than that it would not be permissible and some say it is not permissible all together in the case of being conceived out of wedlock out of fornication or adultery this is even greater this is not permissible because it's their own wrongdoing and it's not the child's fault that his parents or his mother that is did this sin which brings us to our next point so there is really a difference in terms of how the woman has to purify yourself afterwards how the the child is considered a living creature or not between the first 40 days the next 40 days and the final 40 days correct so yeah yes continue so then is an abortion at different stages whether it's the blood clot or the fetus that's been formed or finally the child that obviously has a soul which is obviously the worst time to abort is the ruling the same how are the people who abort their children in Islam treated are they punished are they well this is a good question I don't think we have enough time to go into details but 40 days and before 40 days and below some scholars say that this is permissible if there's a legitimate reason if the soul was breathed then there is no legitimacy whatsoever it's killing it's killing some even say that even if the mother was facing a heart attack and it she could die while giving birth we could not abort the child because her death is probable she might and she may not but the the killing of the the fetus that was it's a living creature this is something that is found there so is it wrong islamically to abort a child yes it is is it is punishable yes it is it is punishable and in Islam if you kill a living fetus after the 120 days you are forced to give expiation blood money you are forced to give blood money to the family of the child that was aborted which is about five camels worth of money what if it's the woman who bought her own child then she's the one who's supposed to do this and she gives it and she has no share in it she gives it to her husband who is inheriting this child and some schools of thoughts say that she has also the person has to also fast 2 consecutive months as form of expiation but they're not charged with murder well it is not murdered yet because if the abortion takes place while the the woman is pregnant with it it's not fully fledged murder but it is part of it and it's it's a major sin in Islam and we can go on to call it murder if the assault takes place at a pregnant woman and then she gives birth in a time which is usual for a woman to give birth like 7 months 8 months 9 months and the child lives for a normal period of time which is 10 minutes half an hour a normal life and then dies out of this views or this assault so we can say this assault directly caused the death of this born child and he has to be the full blood money this is called murder it's not like the five camels worth no he has to pay the full 100 camels as blood money to the parents where they compare colorful misshape it's always a pleasure to have you we'd love to continue and benefit greatly but unfortunately we have to go to suckle Harun and please you're welcome to join us again next week assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh you Oh"
