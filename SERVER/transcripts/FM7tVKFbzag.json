  "title": "Why did Prophet cover his leg when Usman Uthman entered the room & felt shy from him assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I just wanted to ask about a Hadith um it was narrated that once the prophet Alat wasam was resting in the House of M and abak came and the cloth on the prophet's leg was uncovered and he didn't do anything but then came and he immediately covered his leg so M Aisha inquired about this and the prophet said that why should I not feel shy from whom the angels feel shy from sorry why should I not feel shy from the one whom angels feel shy from so I just wanted to was like what does it what did the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam mean by this like the angels feel shy from him the Hadith thatman may Allah be pleased with him was among the most bashful of all the Companions and this was a characteristic in him that he was shy from things that would bring bad reputation to his name from things that were immodest more than anyone else to the extent that it was reported in his biography that he never touched his private part at all with his right hand since he gave the pledge of allegiance to the prophet Alam because he shook his hands with the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam though it is permissible to touch one's private part with the right hands but the prohibition is when urinating or when cleaning yourself after answering the call of nature to use your right but other than that it's permissible it was also reported that he never took a shower nude that he always had a piece of cloth covering himself when he took a shower or a bath because of his bashfulness now having said that this is not something that would deter him from enforcing what is righteous and virtuous and forbidding what is evil and vice because he was the third Khalifa and you cannot run a country by saying oh I'm bashful I can't order this or that no he was determined in so many things and he was decisive in so many things and this had nothing to do with his modesty and bashfulness and the Hadith shows us that whomever deals and treats with Allah subhanahu wa tala in a fashion in a way that we deal with him out of respect in the same fashion so those who fear Allah We Fear them we give them the the amount of respect that is equivalent to their fear of Allah those who are generous for the sake of Allah when we deal with them we're generous with them why why do you treat him better than XY Z well he's generous in giving charity so might as well I be generous with him whenever I deal with him this is what the prophet's message was and also to highight light The Importance of Being bashful and uh modest at all time and Allah Knows Best"
