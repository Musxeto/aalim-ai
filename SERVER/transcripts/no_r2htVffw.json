  "transcript": "mustafa from belgium he's saying can you give us what is the story of the woman who used to get sick i think mustafa is referring to the hadith of a black woman who used to have seizures so that she came to the prophet allah salatu and said to him o prophet of allah i get seizures so pray to allah that allah cures me from these seizures so the prophet said to her to her i will do that if you wish i will pray and you will be cured with the grace of allah but the other alternative is that i don't pray for you and you will get jannah and you will get paradise as a reward so the woman looked at the pros and cons and said no of course jenna is is far greater than being cured because how long am i going to live now this is not seeking medication so someone who's chronically ill says no no i don't want medication i want jinnah like that woman no no no it's different she's coming to the prophet salaam to ask him to ask allah and this is a miracle so the prophet said if you wish i could do that but i would direct you to something that is better and that is that you are remain patient and allah azza will grant you jannah so the woman said to the prophet sasam well i think no no okay i don't pray for allah azzawajal to cure me i'd rather go to jannah but is it possible that you ask allah that when i get these seizures and fall down on the ground that my aura is not disclosed and revealed you know when a person is in a seizure he may have his aura exposed her dress may be uplifted and uh some of her body may be exposed so the prophet said assam i will do that this doesn't def uh defy praying for you to have this happen to you no problem i will ask allah that whenever you have your seizures that you're not exposed and your aura is not revealed so this hadith is an indication for those who are tested don't despair don't lose hope in allah azzawajal you never know where goodness is yes take the necessary means of seeking treatment getting your medication but at the end of the day if you insha allah are connected to allah azzawajal and you have your heart related and connected with allah subhanahu wa then you will be in safety as wajal"
