  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome to another episode of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman I'm here with the Sheikh awesome al Hakim of Saudi Arabia as salam alaikum and welcome how do you come cinema ellicott thank you for being with us Sheikh we will continue our discussion on the subject of women as promised we are looking in this show at the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad Sal Allahu alayhi wa sallam and how he interacted with various members of society around him part two of women I'd like to ask you about this story about a non believing woman or who and something about her water okay what's that all about I mean sallallahu wasallam about economy Muhammad in why he was so happy he edged main women did not have a lot of rights before Islam so it was normal for them to be abducted to be sold as slaves to take their wealth and no one would stand up for them the prophet alayhi salatu salam came to change all of that even with non-muslims mm-hmm so this is a great lesson for us to compare the way we treat women in the first place and the way we treat non-muslims as well the story goes the authentic hadith that the Prophet had some was worth with his companions 40 of them in an expedition okay and they ran out of water so they looked around and could not find water until they saw a woman and she was an idol worshiper on her camel with two large water containers at the side of the camel so they stopped her they brought her to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and the prophets allah while he was seldom mate his usual thing and that is the Prophet as Ursula took some water put it in his mouth turned the water in his mouth and spit it back into the water hmm after that the 40 men all drank and filled their containers from those and one of the Companions who needed the major ritual washing or hoshido Suton did that and the Prophet had some ordered his companions to collect whatever little things they had from dates from bread from ghee and they collected it in return for what they had used the prophets eyes asam told her listen this is for you and we did not take a single drop of your water it's still as it is but this is water that Allah has given us and blessed us with so the women the woman went back to her tribe later on the Companions used to go and fight with the tribes around her mmm sparing her try mm-hmm so then I don't worship in try they're all idol worship but but she was spared she is she and her tribe were spared so after a while she said to her people listen I see that Muhammad and his companions are sparing us because of that day where I provided them with drinking water I believe that they're doing this deliberately so I think it's best for us to accept Islam so as a form of gratitude the Prophet ala Kazam ordered them not to attack this woman's tribe look what the favor she did to the Muslims and she's a woman she's an idol worshiper which the Prophet did not forget so Lala how are you Selim and they all came and accepted Islam mm-hmm I I'd like to thank you for that for opening up that story the non-believing idol-worshipping woman her tribe and her water I'd like to ask you about I mean this subject of the number of wives permitted to a Muslim man I think it's very easy for us to look to miss how revolutionary it was to place a restriction on the number of women that could be married in the context of our discussion on women and the way that we are led to be with women how to respect them can you elaborate for us about this revolutionary idea at a time when as you said women were were property where commodities were treated with little or no regard not only in Africa in Asia in Europe really it was a global phenomenon so in the midst of this a prior to human rights Canon Geneva Conventions and all these kinds of things the prophet in Islam was placing a limit and only to the extent that you could carry out your obligations to them help us I mean maybe I've made the point ok the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam so a man by the name of Raylan and this man had 10 wives with him so he ordered him to keep for and to let go of 6 this is mentioned in chapter 4 surah an-nisa where allah azza wajal tells us in the very beginning that it is permissible for you as men to marry women in twos threes or fours providing that you are fair with them and if not then you must restrict that to one hmm so in Islam Islam came to solve problems and not to cause them mm-hmm if you look around you and forget all the statistics that they provide you with you will find that amount of women far exceeds the amount of men yeah this is due to fatalities road accidents Wars illnesses heart problems high cholesterol levels blood pressure that are prevalent in men more than women in addition to just being silly and reckless yes but women far exceed in number so what is the solution you can't ask a woman not to be natural in seeking a spouse a woman who's not married if there is not a lot of belief and a man in her heart she will tend to wear up wear her makeup put her perfumes and go this is how women are even men when they go to the workplace they put the best perfume they wear nice clothes trying to look sharp maybe just to impress with intention or without intention unintentional it is it depends on the person's Eman therefore Islam came to give a solution and that is if a man has the ability to marry more than one financially and to be fair and to treat them well then this is permissible women on the other hand cannot marry more than two they're made only to love one like the old song torn between two lovers feeling like a fool loving both of you is breaking all the rules it's the same concept worldwide now you may have a black sheep of the family you may have one thing the woman in a million that is able to have more relationships but this is not the norm women get depressed get emotional they can only love one man while a man can love more than one woman so it is to solve a problem providing that the conditions are fulfilled you must be fair otherwise you will come on the day of judgment with your side tilted this is a threat a warning the Prophet says I assume whoever has two wives and he's not fair with both of them in terms of how many nights he provides for each in terms of financial support in terms of being fair in gifts whoever has two wives and it is not fair with both he will come on the day of judgment with his side tilted hmm so this shows you that it isn't a serious issue the serious issue I'd like to we're almost ready for our break about two minutes to the break the next thing I'd like to ask you is about you just mentioned giving gifts to both women what about prior to marriage the non married man accepting gifts from women we have the example of course of the Prophet himself peace be upon him he was in a position to receive gifts from many people men and women alike the slave you told us in an earlier episode that slave but servant honest even alemannic even Malik was a gift from a woman is that right so the subject is when we come back please hold your answer we're going to take the break and we'll get your answer on accepting gifts from women Salam alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet will please continue our conversation about women shake before the break I asked you a question about accepting gifts from women correct as a correction hmm ohm so lame the mother of Ana's did not give him to the prophetess and literally he was a servant she gave him his services okay so that he would work for the prophetess time without a pay now generally speaking is not correct for a woman to give a man a gift okay who's not related to her or a man to give a woman a gift without any relationship as this would be dubious what is the purpose of this is this like predating you want to go for a date or you want to just have good relationship this is a no-go but it's okay if I for example go to my brother and say listen I bought your wife this a bottle of cologne this is okay my brother won't feel bad about it because I'm giving it to my brother to give it to his wife okay so if my sister-in-law tells my wife listen I thought I saw these pair of glasses and I think they would look good on your husband she would accept that and she would give it to me and I would be grateful to my sister-in-law but there's no communication between us I see it's not straightforward and using your example I may never even smell the Cologne on her the point is RIT I it's a gift to my to my brother yes so through this yes and always bear in mind that the figure of the Prophet SM was not like any other figure also lying for example who the Prophet re so sanam used to visit a lot in her home till the companion said prophet of Allah why are you visiting this woman the Prophet had mercy towards her and he said her brother died with me in battle and I feel sorry for her and a half of the man Hodja may Allah have mercy on his soul he related her to the Prophet I saw some to be one of his mom through suckling because the prophet's mother and the upbringing of the prophet's father in medina way before the Prophet was born so he related it and he said that um Selim was the prophet's Muharram and this is why it wasn't something special for him um Saleem told her son anis once that let me cook something for the Prophet area so Sam and she cooked to the Prophet s M some ghee with with dates and and made a meal and sent it to him said I live in Santa Sarah T tells us that a woman came to the Prophet as a son seeing how sort of poor he was so she made him a garment nicely a tailor then she said I made you this outer garment so that you can wear and the Prophet factor and wore it one of the Companions said prophet of Allah this is a beautiful garment give it to him and the Prophet said yes and he went inside took it off and gave it to the man the man's companions blamed him don't you have any shame don't you fear Allah you know that the Prophet needed it most and you know that he would never return anyone asking him for a gift yet you still ask him for it he said I know by Allah he does not return anyone who asks him but I'm going for battle and I believe that I would like to be shrouded in it hmm so the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam gave it to him in a third incident a woman came to the Prophet Elias awesome and she offered him to build a pulpit she said I have a slave who is a carpenter and we know that before the Prophet used to re Susanne sit on a bank of our tree is it called a drunk drunk of wealth they were the same a trunk of a tree that was cut and he was to give his hot buff from so she made that to him and gave it as a gift so yes accepting gifts like this no strings attached is totally permissible in the profit used to honor women a less awesome by accepting their gifts in the first episode on women we talked about important differences between men and women and throughout you've been mentioning the emotional difference the emotional nature of a woman versus that of a man how does this feature when it comes to correcting mistakes when the prophet saw women I mean surely women made mistakes around him peace be upon him was he different in his manner towards correcting their mistakes did he encourage them in a different way towards righteousness see correcting people's mistakes needs knowledge requires knowledge and wisdom it is almost impossible to shove information down people's throat and accept them to be happy with it and when people make mistake they make mistakes by default they're defensive so it is not a debate it is not an argument you just say what's wrong and move on some people want to shove it down our throats no you have to change and now the Prophet wasn't like this I saw for example when his cousin Jennifer I'm not may Allah be pleased with him the brother of highly he'd been a battalion when he was martyred in the Battle of Mokpo on the eighth year of hijra his wife and sisters in the family were crying were weeping mm-hmm natural thing a man came to the prophet Azzam in his house as mother aisha narrates and the Prophet was for what he had to endure his cousin Jaffa his previously son-in-law Zaidan Haditha the lovers of his life who was his sons used to known be known as a dear Muhammed before adoption was bad and a beloved hour high three of the great Muslim companions martyred in the same day so he was sad a man came said o prophet of Allah the women folk of Jaffa are weeping and we can hear their voices mm-hmm the Prophet said go and forbid them so the man went and came back he said I did forbid them but they continued mm-hmm the Prophet said go and forbid them in the third time the Prophet said go forbid them and if they don't stop take sand and put it down their throats he was frustrated of this man mm-hmm Aisha could not tolerate this may Allah be Peter and he said may allah azza wajal put your nose in the sand you neither left the prophet alayhi salatu salam to be sad on his own and respected his feelings no you forbade them from weeping and stopped you keep on insisting and insisting and insisting so the Prophet Isis Salam gave them the benefit of the doubt he knew their nature and he just said forbid them and that's it mm-hmm likewise in another story and this is authentic hadith he the Prophet a son was walking with his companions and he saw a woman sitting next to a grave of a son who died okay and she is she was weeping and wailing so the Prophet as sallam told her Oh woman slave or servant of allah fear allah azzawajal and be patient that's it there's nothing wrong with that because wailing is Haram in Islam it's a major sin weeping is not mm-hmm so the woman in anger said leave me alone you have not been afflicted with the calamity that I have in yeah so the Prophet left he didn't insist the Companions came to her and said are you crazy this was the prophet of Allah she didn't recognize him because she was yes she was so outdone and yeah destroyed so she van tried to follow the prophet s er and she found him in the place where he sits in the Masjid and she came Oh prophet of Allah o prophet of Allah now I'm patient now I'm so the Prophet is said to her patients it is at the first instance of a calamity not after you tend to relax and forget about it so again the Prophet did not force her to stop or to do this because he understood the way she felt yeah that that's something that really stands out there yeah yeah one of us you know or one of our shakes or your moms may have responded differently unfortunately and I think well just a follow-up question is this the reason why I don't know if it's something that all the Arabs and Muslims do but the burials that I've attended here in Egypt were attended only by men for the actual burial and then the day or the next day subsequent days the women would come with the kids is is that a common practice it's it's an issue of dispute among scholars mmm whether it is permissible for women to visit the cemeteries or not the most authentic opinion which I follow in Bassman if they mean in the whole nine yards of the Saudi scholars that it is prohibited because the prophet alayhi salatu salam prohibited women and cursed women who frequently visit the graveyards so this is something that is only for men but it's an issue of dispute it goes without saying that women are emotional so if they were to visit a grave of a loved they would do things that may not be acceptable even we see this in some of the soap operas in movies when you have a portrait of a deceased husband or a father and you get people talking to him oh my my love right if you've seen what they've done to me and he's dead right so they tend to get emotional but again we don't have a justification we know that visiting graveyards for women is prohibited and not permissible at least their emotions we can agree are more expressive more we have been disciplined socialized to we're emotional men are but we don't show it in the same way I've seen the brothers weeping there and so we'll have to leave our discussion there I hope in these two episodes on women that it was satisfactory to a loss for not Allah may accept our efforts and Thank You Sheikh barakallahu he comes after Milan failing that concludes our discussion on women we look forward to continuing with the Prophet insha'Allah until our next episode assalamualaikum warahmatullah"
