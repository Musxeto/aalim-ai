  "transcript": "what's important about being proud to be a Muslim find out in a few moments asalam Alum and welcome to youth talk I'd like to welcome our guest in the studio today it's a pleasure having with us see him here I'd also like to to welcome my guests I have to my left maraan who is a corporate lawyer Mustafa who is a translator and T who is a student at the Academy of Art shikim we're talking about being proud to be a Muslim how can one be proud to be a Muslim what is the importance let's start off with what is the importance of being proud that you're a Muslim pride is an important thing for any human being to keep on living anyone can be proud of what he does or can be proud of what he believes otherwise there's no value to the things that he's doing for example if you go to a janitor who cleans up buildings after the people have gone home who cleans up offices if he does not have the pride in what he's doing he's not going to do it effectively now going back on onto the broader sense Muslims have to be proud of being Muslims for a number of reasons for example Allah Almighty says in the Holy Quran there is no one better than he who says good things and does good things calls people to Allah and proclaims says that he is a Muslim there is no one better than this individual so it is essential for a Muslim to be proud of being a Muslim and the reason of this pride comes from a lot of different angles for example a Muslim is proud of being a Muslim because he knows that his religion is the authentic religion worldwide our authenticity when what we believe is documented and all historians believe it to be authentic and accepted for example no Prophet no messenger of previous religions uh uh uh has his biography we do not have any biography of any of the messengers of Allah we don't know except few details about what they preach and what they did while if we look at the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam we know exactly what happened since his father Abdullah married his mother Amina till the day he died every single detail a Muslim is proud because his book that he believes in the Quran is exactly the same as it was revealed on the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam nothing has changed and no one can have this claim anywhere no religion could come forward and say well this is my book it has not been altered and that has not been changed a Muslim can be proud of being a Muslim when he talks about his his religion and his belief what does Islam tells you to do if you look at Islam you will find if if it's at a scale of of 10 or or maybe far uh greater than that if it's out of scale of 1,000 you'll find that 99 999 points of it is is is logical it's acceptable universally and only one out of a thousand that may be disputed what does Islam tell you to do to worship one God everybody on Earth feels the urge to worship one God and they feel it in themselves that this God is in heaven so whenever they are in a problem or in a crisis they just with their hearts go upwards they don't go to uh a place here on Earth it's by Nature Islam tells you to be kind to your parents your brothers sisters your children your neighbors your community to everyone else it's Islam sells you not to fornicate not to drink something that makes you lose your mind like lots of uh the intoxicants you know alcohol and so on because it makes you behave wrongly it tells you not to steal not to kill not to uh uh uh slauer people not to talk about women who are who have a good reputation by slandering them or saying bad things about them it tells you so many positive things and all what Islam teaches is in the interest and the benefit of humans so if you believe in Islam then you are definitely proud to be of being a Muslim that is why it is important for you to acquire the knowledge that tells you about your religion this itself gives you the pride of being a Muslim to acquire the knowledge to acquire the knowledge and Quran and Sunnah MH because if you don't know what is Islam what are you going to be proud of but just because we have my father and mother are Muslims because all those I know AR Muslims this is not a reason to be proud of but once you know your the essence of your religion then you are you have something to hang on to and to be proud of yes so well ex okay thank you um first uh I'm just asking how can I be a Muslim while um most of the Muslim Community nowadays are supposed to be illiterate and Liv in the darkness of science they how can you be proud to be a Muslim oh sorry how how can we proud of being a Muslim while we see the case of all Muslims uh all over the world they are illiterate they don't have much technology they live in the darkness they don't have anything to be proud of I am proud of being a Muslim as a Muslim but the other person how can I speak to other persons about Islam what am I going to to him about Islam beside the teachings that most of the Muslims do not apply unfortunately okay first of all we have to segregate between modern science civilizations and being proud of being a Muslim you said that the majority of Muslims are living in darkness and this is unacceptable at all our Prophet our messenger was sent to humanity to take them out of Darkness into light so the Islamic concept is darkness is worshiping other than Allah even if you have the means to reach outer space and to invade the whole universe even if you have uh uh uh weapons of mass destruction or nuclear bombs whatever you consider to be part of modern science and civilization if you are not worshiping Allah then you are in the darkness so let's get this thing cleared out coming back to the Layman those who are living in rural rural areas and who uh do not enjoy modern uh technology who do not have uh inter access to Internet DSL Broadband or whatever who do not have cell phones they can be proud of what they have and this is a very important issue because a lot of the Muslims think that in order for them to be proud is to be or to live in the same standard of living as the westerners do and by saying the westerners we have a lot of Western Muslims so I'm whatever I I I use this terminology I'm not you meaning those who live in the west they could be living living in the east I'm I'm I'm it it's meant that the non-muslims it is very difficult and actually it's impossible at sometimes for us to reach the level of technology and modern science that The non-muslims Have and no matter how hard you compete they're always they'll always have the edge over you because it's their science nowadays though it was originally ours but they always have the edge so it's very wrong to be proud of what you're learning or what you're trying to to to reach in in modern technology and in Sciences you cannot be proud of this because they're always a step ahead of you what you have they don't have which is Islam which is the ethics the values Traditions uh uh the livelihood of our religion the dynamic of our religion that fits all a all times all uh uh locations this is what you you are proud of even if you are a nomad if you are a bedwin in the desert with camels with tant you are proud of your generosity of your honesty of your commitment to the Quran and Sunnah you are proud of being sure that in this vast desert where no one is watching you you wake up in the middle of the night just before or just at the break of dawn no one is watching you go and perform ablution you face the the direction of Mecca and you pray for Allah this what makes you proud no one is forcing you to do this no one is going to reprimand you or punish you if you don't when you prostrate to Allah when you put your forehead on the sand no one is watching except the almighty this is the cause of your pride of being a Muslim T well actually my my question is uh what's the characteristic of Islam that makes us um uh more encouraging this way that we we like this way this way is the right this is this way is uh nothing but this way except any other thing it you know you understand me yeah see everyone is proud of what he believes yeah so a Christian a Jew or any other follower of any religion has to be proud of what he believes and by default a Muslim is proud of what he believes now it's not our job to go and criticize other religions because it's endless you like in in India you have like 2,000 religions and and Counting and whoever wants makes a religion it's just okay for them but if I spend my time and and effort you know ridiculing or criticizing or trying to pin out the bad things in other religions it's going to take my time and effort on un vain it's nothing that is highly recommended or even recommended at all we are proud of being a Muslim Muslims because of what our religion teaches that's why the best way to show our pride to the people is by pra practicing it and then by them comparing their religions to ours they'll find that there is a reason for us to be proud of but practicing it in the true sense definitely because you could practice Islam in a wrong tense you can do things that are not even logical you know there are some Cults that beat themselves with chains and and and and knives and end up bleeding and what is this this does this relate to any logic definitely not is it mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah definitely not so I cannot accept this and and and others don't accept this because it's not the teaching of the Quran or of the Sunnah so you have to be a practicing Muslim and whatever I do I always have the evidence here with me I've got the proof from the Quran or the Sunnah whenever I I I I do something I expect people to come up to me and say why did you do this and I have my answer ready for them Marana as as as a lawyer do you think that um the proof of the the importance of Islam and of of the that makes somebody proud to be a Muslim do you think that the proof is something that's important okay I'll I'll speak into two topics here first of all how is uh Islam evidencing to the truth this is first how to for anything in the world to State anything in the world you need proofs so these proofs have to be logic and have to be existing practically the second thing is the is how how is the incentive varied from one person to another being proud as a Muslim or about his religion how to be proud that I'm Muslim this varies from one person to another through so these These are the main two topics first of all as a proof it's the only religion in the world not compared to the others but from Readings General readings and general beliefs it's the only religion in the world that is very convincing to the mind and that never lied about anything everything is true everything happens maybe we don't understand it correctly but if we read the interpretations of Quran and Sunnah we're going to understand it quite well that it is existing and it is a fact doesn't lie about anything so it does not take you first to trust in God and then believe his words no it takes you to believe to trust in God through believing his words and understanding them so it's a very logic very logic religion though the book itself if you if you studi the book itself it's it's a very reasonable book I mean if we studied the Holy Quran as if it's a simple book and you're reading the versus of the Quran as if it's a novel or something of course with with regard with the difference of between both but Quran is a very very convincing message it is a very convincing message if you read a verse for example if you read a Surah now and you come read it again tomorrow you're going to understand in a different way you're going to feel different you're going to understand some different things than what you read yesterday and goes on that way if you read the Quran for 100 times you'll still understand things more and you'll still see see truths that's been hidden to you in the past and you're seeing it in a different form now this one two that it never changed three that it will never change four that is guaranteed that it's it's never going to change and it will always have conflicts between people interpreting the Quran and the Sunnah and this is the most but anything that has a debate has to have a point so if we're debating about something then there is something existing and this thing is very strong to prove that we debated on it so it stands and exists as a fact as a very strong fact that everybody is is conflicting in thoughts about it but in the same channel but with different interpretations this one two uh the second topic is uh is the more you know about Islam the more you have a strong will and you have a strong belief about Islam so you get more proud when you know more about your Quran and Sunnah you become more attached to Ita so if if you take it as as a default that you're born to be a Muslim I think this is not enough you got to go to the Quran and Sunnah read them very well and once once over and over again and you'll get convinced more and being proud more and be able to conduct your thoughts and and able to conduct your personality to others very smoothly and likely and that goes that same Mustafa there was something you wanted to ask oh yes um do we have a relation between being proud of my religion and my facial expressions my movement my when I speak to an non Muslim person I have to raise my nose up and just say I'm I'm a Muslim and I'm proud of being a Muslim yes what I want to ask about Islam and so on um please answer me well there is a difference between being proud and being arrogant being snobbish or arrogance in Islam is is not accepted in Islam the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that he who has the weight of an ant of arrogance in his heart will not be entitled to enter paradise and and this is a a grave and major sin yes so this is way different than being proud arrogance is to look down at people and to refuse whatever truthfulness and right they have so ignoring them rejecting whatever right they have is arrogance and this is not something that a Muslim is being proud of but being proud of being a Muslim means that you don't feel humiliated a lot of the Muslims in the west are insulted or feel humiliated when they're asked or told that you are a Muslim they think small of themselves so whenever someone asks them where you from so well I'm from this country said are you Muslim he says looks down and says well yeah I'm sorry but please forgive me yeah it just happened you know no this is wrong here you have to say yes I am a muslim with a big smile and I'm proud of being a Muslim and you have to be also prepared to any attack that people may have on your belief and religion so you are a Muslim then this means you are a terrorist mhm the image again the the image again so you have to be uh uh um equipped with the tools of accepting criticism the tools including knowledge I have a good knowledge about my religion of course without religion without knowledge you have no case because the only thing that remains would be emotions and with emotions that emotions that are not governed and controlled with knowledge you have chaos and then you may have an impulsive uh response that does more harm than good is it shameful to excuse me is it shameful When anybody asks me a question about Islam and I said I don't know oh I may please give me time to ask and reply um is it shameful I've have done this hundreds of times and I find out that the more I do this the more knowledge I get because I research Allah Almighty supports me because I'm humble and my case is better presented to the to the people and I've got more credibility with them Cas of course because if I whenever someone asks me a question yes and I keep keep on talking and and then they find out that I'm full of hot air I'm I'm on the losing end and I'm giving a very bad image to my religion while Imam Malik one of the four uh uh Scholars of schools of thought in Islam we have Abu hanifah Malik sha and Ahmed IM Malik said that half of knowledge is I don't know half of knowledge is I don't know and the other half is answering your question and it was reported that a man came to him after traveling for a whole month from karasan from an Eastern uh region and he came to him in Medina with 40 questions from his people Imam Malik answered only six of them and in the remaining 34 he said I don't know so after he concluded his 40 question he said give me a break I C I traveled for more than a month on celb back from my people with these 40 questions what and you said 30 to 34 of them I don't know what do you want me to go and and and talk to my people and tell them what what is my response he said Malik who is one of the four greatest Scholars of Islam said tell your people Malik does not know it's very simple so I'm not going to sell my religion just to answer your question though I don't know it it's very easy this is part of your religion not to talk without knowledge Allah in in verse 33 said that there are four things that one should be uh one should avoid void they are completely forbidden and at the last which is the highest of all is to say on Allah without any knowledge so you it is one of the sources of Pride to say I don't know it's coming down to knowledge again the the circle tends to go round and round on the issue of knowledge um is there a certain way to be proud I mean how can a Muslim be proud we know that um that a Muslim um if he has knowledge then he has more proof of things so that when he comes to speak to somebody and says he's a Muslim he can have his head up high when he's saying it but are there other ways of being proud I mean should you um well I I'll leave the answer to you then unfortunately it's not only having your head high because non-muslims have their heads High Muslim sinners like uh uh uh pop stars or actors or they all have their heads High so it's not the point of having your head high rather than feeling the satisfaction the internal satisfaction inside that you are committed Muslim and at sometimes you being a proud committed Muslim have to lower your head down out of humbleness now imagine the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam after 20 uh plus 20 years almost of fighting and insult from the non-muslims of Oppression abuse you name it they've done it all to the prophet and to the followers of the Prophet sallallah Al wasallam when he went to conquer Mecca which is his hometown he went with an army of 10,000 now remember they've attacked him so many times they've uh uh killed his uncle Hamza and they ripped up his guts and they did so many bad things to his followers he went there a conqueror he came into Mecca on his camel and everybody was shaking and trembling because they knew that it's doomsday and what did the prophet Salli wasallam did he was proud of being the prophet messenger of Allah he was proud of being a Muslim he's he was proud of being the Conqueror of Mecca yet he came on his camel riding on his camel with his chin almost touching his saddle of humility and humbleness because this is not a day of being proud of conquering Mecca he's proud of being a Muslim but he is humble to Allah that granted him this victory over those who fought him for so long we have a break now and uh after a few moments we'll be back to continue with uh the prophet Sall have informed us that we should not obey no one on the account of disobeying Allah subhana tala so the superiority is to Allah's command so the husband tells his wife that I want you to check hands with my colleagues with my business partners no even if it leads to divorce if the husband says to his wife that you have to party with me with partners and so on no you have to take your hijab off now by any mean communicate with Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala definitely Allah knows your language and he would be very happy to answer your Dua Mar one other I'll take you first of all um are there other examples or situations where one should be proud that he is a Muslim um yes um I I think for for ladies for example being veiled as a woman and uh being stuck with that Veil all over their heads and uh the hot summer walking around uh beside or for example going to the beach with with a lot of other ladies wearing bathing suits and sitting getting taned and stuff like that how are they going to face the situation I mean I mean they're they're all covered from top to toe and other ladies are in their bikinis on the beach tanning with their men as well so how do they face this well this is an interesting uh issue see part of being proud for a female Muslim is her veil because it is her identity it's her protection from others looking at her and at the same time CRI it's a declaration of religion what if she feels that she needs to be like the others everyone can do this it's I always tell my associates and friends it's easy to be an uncommitted Muslim anyone can be a bad Muslim anyone can fornicate anyone can go to discotek and party and have fun it is extremely difficult to be committed it extremely difficult for you to prevent yourself from doing what you are tempted to do but but in in a society like like which we're talking about U everyone's very open everyone's not strict to this Islam and a veil woman walking around in the street like an alien so that that would that would look a little bit weird she's going to be faced as well with some some phrases and sentences that she's going to hear so how's that being faced it's it's it's very easy it's when you look at it from an outside point of view it's it might looks look difficult for you but if you ask any sister that is living in the west with her veil from head to toe she'll tell you that I would not give up this Veil even if they gave me the whole world uh to do so all the sisters living there are so proud of their Veil they're so proud of being a Muslim and they are proud of portraying the the the the this image of a Muslim woman living in the west behaving doing whatever she does because she is following the commands of Allah and of of of the Sunnah of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and this is not the only thing because Allah says that the Jews and the Christians will not be pleased with you until you follow them yes so let's okay try to compromise let the sister wear a dress with a long dress with with with long sleeves is this is sufficient for them again how dare you go to the beach and not being looking like Baywatch or example whatever this is unacceptable so even if you if she does wear a decent and I quote this a decent a bathing suit is is there aent let's not deny the fact that some of the failed women are deprived from some jobs and are are having and being subjected to a certain look the society looks to them maybe Western Society or non-muslim societies they receive a very weird look this one uh the other thing is how to help them and how to convince them from our part for example if my wife is not veiled I want to convince her of being veiled because this is this is f from Allah this is a must that a that a Muslim sister has to do so she's my wife and going convince her to be veiled cuz this is the pr the pride of Islam and this is how to be proud as a Muslim as a Muslim female and if I'm if I'm for example searching as a youth now of of a woman it's another topic that these are two different questions that I require answers for please uh the other the other question is if I'm looking for a for a woman to marry and uh and the society does not take uh in the wedding night for example someone being veiled she's not going to put all this makeup while she's veiled and she's veiled has she have to be veiled correctly without any makeup without any foundings from the external so how she apply this practically okay Kim keep track of of of questions because I lose track every now and then going back to your first question the sister herself we have to differentiate between aspects of Islam and Islam as a whole yes now Veil is one aspect but it's not Islam entirely so you could be not you of course a a sister could be veiled sister but she has she she lies she she cheats she does so many bad things she has a bad uh tongue She talks about everybody else she's does this mean she's a good Muslim definitely not not yeah okay so let's get this tra straightened up coming back to the sister although she gets weird looks or although she's de pride of getting a job a decent job also does not mean that if she let let go uh that more jobs will be offered for her because they will keep on demanding more and more compromises they don't want this anymore so you have to show that you are not not a Muslim a real full-fledged Muslim it's not the veil it's not the the skirts you're wearing it's your attitude as being a Muslim now prove it have a drink have dinner with me let's date Let's uh party um let's socialize let's do this and you keep on doing this and that and I've get I get so a lot of emails from sisters working in the in in the west complaining that they're not being allowed to have five minutes for prayer and I got this so many times the sister says I cannot praise can I join uh afternoon and noon and afternoon prayers together because my boss doesn't allow me to pray the answer is no this is your the essence of your religion prayer on time and if they give five minutes for coffee breaks if they give lunch hours if they give you time to go to answer the call of nature so the least you could do is say I'm going to to answer the call of nature I'm going to the toilet and pray this it w't won't take more than five minutes every time so you have to keep on giving in you have to let go a lot of things that you believe and at the end of the day you don't have anything having nothing yes nothing to be proud of no again we come back to the sister it's not only the veil that you are proud of you got you're going to get a lot of accusations of saying you're oppressed woman Muslim sisters are oppressed they're forced to sit in the home you do this you do that you don't and all of this is unacceptable for a sister to give into she has to have her pride in being convinced of what she's doing she is taking care of the most important role in the society and that is the human the house the nucleus of the family mhm she is giving a safe haven and a comfortable place for the husband yes otherwise imagine if you have a ning wife that makes your well you're not married are you no okay that's not yet if you have an ning wife that makes your life hell for let's say 12 hours a day and you go out to your work how you what's the attitude never perform correctly you're going to kill everyone next to you if you if you have subordinates you're going to squash them and if you have bosses on top of you you're going to line and cheat and and try your best to you know relieve some of the pressure you have no doubt that a woman puts the man to the optimum like like you could really killone else including her and and it's the opposite the other way around imagine when you read in the S of the Prophet wasallam what did Khadijah his first wife did when he came trembling because of the first revelation he had she didn't tell him you came late where are the groceries what's wrong with you no immediately when he told her what he was what he encountered she told him have no fear Allah will not shame you because you are so and so and so and she started listen the good attributes of the Prophet s wasallam she's a comfort to her to to her husband and she took excellent care of of her children and this is why a housewife is so proud of because she has results A working woman can be proud also but look at her results if the maid is taking care of the kids if the maid is taking care of the husband if the maid's going to be the second wife for the husband exactly there's nothing she's going to be proud of okay just like to ask also a question this point this main point what about the political uh aspects in in Europe or in France about this idea about alab or or the so about the Islamic dress and yeah what about how can we deal with such a problem how can one provide for females the faith that they should continue to do that despite whatever happens I mean is that a situation that there are certain compromises or should one still stick to his pride her pride in this sense again we come back to knowledge it all Roots back to knowledge if the sisters have the proper knowledge to know that it's not their choice if it were their choice we would have told them go ahead and take it off it's something that Allah decreed on them to wear so if you go to the west or to some countries that prevent uh the students from wearing the veil or uh unfortunately some so-called Muslim countries that prevents uh uh women from working in public areas wearing the veil and I'm I'm talking about the uh uh the veil that you wear our sister wears on her hair not covering the face covering the face is is is a a crime punished by execution problem in these areas no I'm talking about just only covering the hair itself now if you go to these countries you find something that is not logical a person with good virtues with righteousness that try to cover their body from people or from men looking at them is unacceptable but being nude or topless on on beach is is is acceptable okay is it only Islam that you are against or is it all the religions for example nuns cover their hair and they wear decent clothing so why aren't you attacking them as well here you have to be proud of your religion Christians are proud of their religion nuns and Priests they always uh they're always proud of of their costumes or and what they're wearing because it says that they are followers of this religion Hindus are the same lots of the people are the same and again I don't want to narrow the discussion into how you look it's not only my beard that shows I'm a Muslim although it's it's it's an important thing and it's an obligatory thing to do for a Muslim it's not my appearance only it's part of it it's one aspect of it so even for the sisters that are studying abroad they have to be convinced that what they're doing is something that Allah decreed on them which means that there is no room for compromise in the sense that whether it's a choice you have to make whether you study unveiled or sit home with your Veil the answer would be sit home with your Veil because it will go on on and on on and on so even if you go to the school and and and this happens a lot of the Muslims say well this is not logical you're telling me not to send my daughter to school to study no I'm going to send her to school to study and pursue knowledge which Islam tells us to do and blah blah blah he sends his daughter to school unveiled and then she is faced with physical education classes and she has to wear shorts and a t-shirt maybe she has to uh uh have swimming courses a mandatory swimming courses in that school where a male teaches her how to swim so she has to wear a bathing suit and what else what else then to be proud of you are being stripped of everything that you believe in and all the things that you are proud of having and it keeps on going and going until you wear the cross or the the SAR of David or whatever Whata please go ahead okay um my question is the nowadays most of the people care about uh the health the clothess the education and after a while the job and the wife for their kids but nobody thinks about how to bring up our kids in a good religious way and how to make them proud of Islam uh please uh okay I need advice is it wrong let me ask you this question is it wrong to care about your job about your education about your uh financial status no of course not it is part of worship as long as you are applying the Quran and sunna whatever you do whatever you say it's all accredited to you so in in this sense my 9 to5 job to put the food on the table as long as I intending that with the salary I'm getting I'm being a good Muslim I'm providing my I'm supporting my family then this I'm rewarded for this 9 to5 job if it's permissible job that is so it's not on the top of my priorities to have this and that on the top of my priorities is to be a good Muslim which Islam tells me to be efficient in my job to be good to my kids to my family and to upbring my children in the best manner possible now to be able to upbring my children in the uh uh the best manner possible this means that I have to teach them Islam yes and I also have to teach them how to love and respect their religion it's very essential for me to teach them how to love the prophet to teach them the Quran through all of this they become Proud by default I remember once uh during the the Bosnian War I had a a visit to the refugee camps the Muslim refugee camps in order for me to give them support and to give them food and and and detergents and whatever and to comfort them of what the crisis there in because they most of them lost their men and children so on in one Camp I met a six or seven year old child excuse me and he was talking to me through an interpreter and while walking with him in the camp he saw something sparkling so he picked it up and The Interpreter told me that he's asking is this a symbol of or does it resemble a a cross I said yes it does so the child who was six or seven years old threw it as far as possible saying that I'm a Muslim and I'm proud of being a Muslim and I don't like anything that looks or resembles these things because they it's not the Christian that did this it's the enemies of the Bosnian but they had at the time that resembled them yes so this is part of being proud and showing your children how to be proud at the end um for all of us to be proud not just us sitting here the viewers as well watching and um give us again a little bit of like um advice about how to be a proud Muslim I believe that a proud Muslim has to be a practicing Muslim has to be a knowledgeable Muslim willing to share share his knowledge with everyone else you can be a Muslim a good Muslim in your own home but you do not show and glow what you believe to the others and this is negative being proud is being able to communicate to the others what you believe to receive their criticism and to refute whatever they're saying that does not fall in line with your your teachings being proud of your mus of of of your religion of your Islam is to show the world that this is my religion and this is what I preach and at the same time this is what I do I think by spreading the world of of of of Islam by commun communicating to People by teaching them the essence of Islam is the best means of of being a proud Muslim well I'd like to thank of course lakim for joining us it's always a pleasure having you with us on youth talk I'd also like to thank um the rest of the participants who are with me Maran Mustafa and thank you all for joining us we will be back again soon with a new episode of Youth talk and until then this all the best from the team here andam la
