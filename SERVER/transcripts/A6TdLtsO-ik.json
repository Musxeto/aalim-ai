  "title": "Dealing with The Pressures Of Life ( Stress ) || Podcast - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign Tidings podcast alhamdulillah today we have a special guest with us I don't think he needs much of an introduction but just to keep on TV and also ask zad Masha Allah on YouTube alhamdulillah he connects with the limbs with q a and also in Saudi for many years so we're blessed to have you may Allah bless you how are you today alhamdulillah getting old but doing well yeah you're not looking old hello tell my wife that very important topic something that's been requested quite a lot and it's about dealing with the pressures of life so you see today in in society especially in the west but I'm sure all over the world there's many many pressures to the Muslim subhanallah in terms of keeping firm to the Deen and just generally Family Life lots of things alhamdulillah so we wanted to ask you in general what should be the Outlook of Muslims when dealing with pressures and difficulties and things like that that's the first question inshallah foreign I was born in the last century so I'm pretty old for these things alhamdulillah I'm not from the uh New Generation so do it excuse me I conduct a lot of counseling sessions for the Muslims and this is something I undertook uh um and the funny thing is whenever I ask people to list for me the six pillars of Iman 99.99 they would say oh Namaz fasting these are the five pillars of Islam I'm talking about the six pillars of Iman and when I do this people look at me as if I just landed on Mars never heard of it and this is due to our distance from our religion and if you ask anyone on the streets whether you're in Birmingham London Leicester Manchester whatever about Islam they would give you a blank check that of course we know everything about Islam we don't need new old Giza to come and teach us about Islam we know everything about Islam if you ask them about the basics you you you land on deaf ears if you ask them about purity zero if you ask him about prayer zero zakat zero marriage divorce custody zero zero zero and what do you know about Islam oh we read the Quran masha'allah the shortest Surah in the Quran the one who you recite 100 times a day women's what does it mean I'm not a scholar yeah you don't have to be a scholar how many surahs do you you memorize well actually this Surah and subhanallah so we are light years away from our religion but we are defiant we don't confess and you'll never learn your religion if you keep on being arrogant and defined no why is our hobby I'm not going to learn from him oh no he's from Saudi not learned from him he's from he's he's black he's white he's yellow he's a revert he's this okay who are you going to learn from me okay let's see what you have zero so coming back to your question this was just an introduction to break the ice you guys are freezing today is 26 degrees in Saudi Arabia and where it's eight o'clock in the evening is on my fan is on and I'm perspiring but the guy says are you cold kidding me you guys live in the freezer so coming coming back to your question fact number one each and every Muslim should have this as at the back of his head in his subconscious wherever he goes there is not a single human being on Earth neither in the past nor in the future who's not tested oh sure come on yes you mean to tell me Elon Musk is tested Bill Gates is tested yes sure they have trillions and billions of dollars how are they tested they are the most miserable people on Earth they have they have billions how many divorce cases have they gone through Jeff pays us Bill Gates half of their wealth is gone this is enough to give them a heart attack despite the depression the drugs Elon Musk is known to have a joint in his hand 24 7. the guy stoned yanique all the time but they're tested so whether you're rich or poor whether you're healthy or sick whether you come from this country or that every single individual is being tested the fun part is everyone is tested according to how Allah azzawajal will said so you guys in UK oh I have a lot of sessions counseling sessions with UK residents and they come to me in the five 10 minutes the first five ten minutes complaining of this and that and this and that okay finished you're you're vented they said yes is it okay masha'allah you live in the UK you're even happier on average than the people in the U.S who are living the American dream you guys have benefits you even get diaper benefits for your children give me a break come on guys what is this if you're unemployed oh I'm getting benefits for unemployment and if you don't have a house they give you a house in the projects or whatever I don't know if they still do that but again how many meals do you have free no Chef we have five because we have to reduce the amount of intake of calories you know we have to take care of our bodies and wait what you guys are talking about what about your transportation oh the best uh busing services in the world they come right on the spot Railways um underground schooling how much do you pay oh it's free share but you know we have students loans for uni NHS we have this we have that okay what are you suffering from tested me with something I can't tolerate what I can't go to the gym all gyms are mixture what can I do I can't work out are you crazy they come and say I have a problem with my spouse what's his problem he doesn't send me love messages does he provide for you yes does he put a roof on your head yes food on the table yes he ever physically or a verbal abuse you never share what are you doing so everyone is tested but people think that their test is the worst okay there are people in hospitals if you have a test go and check those who have uvarian cancer breast cancer colon cancer blood cancer go and check those who were in a car accident paralyzed neck down go and check with people who had contracted I don't know if the world is right or not my English is poor uh herpes they got herpes when they're young and they had nothing to do never ever kissed a girl or a boy it just happened since they were seven years of age and they're now in their mid-30s having uh oral herpes and the guy says Sheikh what can I do this is your test from Allah but imagine such steps when your government proposed to people and they reject you oh no no no no I know you I saw you in SoHo or wasn't that you I don't know anyhow so everyone is tested but go to Yemen go to Syria people are dying like flies and you think you're tested go to the rohingya killed decapitated playing with their children's heads as football just because they're Muslims go to the yogurt ogres in China a million in captivity for what just saying force you to drink alcohol during the month of Ramadan take your hijab shave your beat don't pray what are you gonna do and oh I'm testing so every single individual is tested and rarely those would pass Allah says do people think that they will be let alone to say oh I believe I believe I'm a Muslim without them being tested name we have tested those before then and we shall test them so that it would be a parent who is saying the truth and who is lying so rule number one every single one is being tested rule number two the test you are undergoing was something that falls under the six pillars of Iman just to refresh your memory I know you guys know it by heart and our listeners as well anyhow uh first of all to believe in Allah to believe in the day of judgment to believe in the angels to Believe In The Messengers to believe in the scriptures and to believe in the Divine decree whether good or bad Divine decree is one of the things that if you have it you're the man what is a chair the prophet said when Allah first created the pen Allah told the pen right and the pen said oh Allah what should I write Allah said write the decree the predestining that is going to happen from now till the day of judgment so the pen started writing in the preserved tablet that no one can see except Allah the prophet says Allah this incident of writing took place 50 000 years before Allah created the whole universe whoa in the beginning there was a law and there was nothing with him Allah is the first without the beginning and he's the last without an end subhana but we don't know Allah so everything is written down oh this means that if I decided to raise my left hand this was written 50 000 years ago this is written putting it down this is written no one knows what was written except Allah this means that when we under are under pressure we have to always have this at the back of our minds that we're being tested what are you gonna do because the results will be your results on the day of judgment the test did you pass or fail so my my son died alhamdulillah don't have sons by the way they're all girls so one of my sons died I have one of two choices in life number one either to bang my head in the wall to whine and weep and cry and complain why me why not why I could have done this I could have done that and keep on complaining and objecting the result I failed the test I will be sinful my child will not come back to life [Music] Choice number two I say Allah has taken what he has given and I'm content with what Allah has decreed upon me yes I'm sad I may weep but I never complain I never object what will happen number one I'm rewarded number two Allah will substitute me with something better number three my child will not come back to life still so pressure is there for everyone it's a test from Allah azzawajal fact number three why does Allah test us doesn't he know everything can't he change things can't he make me Rich can't he make me healthy can't he make me listen that yes but who are you to question Allah Allah owns everything in this universe a well-known fact if he decided if he willed that everybody in this universe go to hell he tossed them in hell they burn in hell can anybody say objection your honor I'd like to go to the hay and escalate this with the international criminal court I'd like to complain to the security Council hey sit down and relax loosen up your belt let your hair down take off your shoes you ladies also can do that so what are you gonna do nothing so Allah owns everything in fact number one Allah is fair and just Allah would never ever transgress or do anything that is unfair fact number three Allah is wise Allah is knowledgeable so he does the very best for us now when we come to look at all of this when we compare our calamity our pressure to others we find that we have nothing to worry about and this is a sign of a True Believer Allah says in Surat um foreign whoever believes in Allah Allah would guide his heart Imam mujahid says it is revealed concerning someone who is tested and his heart is content because he knows it's from Allah that's it and wallahi will be lahi what Allah these are the three types of swearing by Allah's name with the three letters preceding his name so I'm swearing and I'm emphasizing my oath that the happiest man on Earth is someone who's content with whatever happens to him in the midst of a car accident it's my new 2023 car what are you doing you smash the headlights you did this the guy comes out from the car alhamdulillah nobody's hurt Abdullah aren't you angry for what happened to your car no it could have been worse I could have injured someone I could have banged my head in the steering wheel and went into a comma the car could have been totally uh wasted nothing happened content so coming back to your question I guys I know you fell asleep while talking out I I can bore myself to death sometimes that's why if you have pressure always be content that it was pre-ordained by Allah always acknowledge that it's a test and whatever you do is the result and finally always acknowledge that there are way way worse people who are being tested and I don't know that's very insightful very informative and again we've just learned a lot um you know um in regards to something that you said earlier um about stress um I have a question myself and that is um again I don't we didn't experience you before but I'm a counselor as well myself by profession um and I've dealt with a lot of people in the past and currently as well and a lot of people they complain about stress but there are those that complain about just the smallest of things and they call it depression so what I would like in Charlotte to Allah for you to explain to the viewers uh the difference between stress and depression foreign okay so okay I'm a counselor in the sense that people come to me due to truth reasons one my Islamic knowledge to my age so I am able to help people by opening their eyes to see how shaytan is messing up with their heads and secondly to give them wise advice coming from an old man with alhamdulillah experience in life so when it comes to stress stress is something in my point of view I'm again don't quote me huh uh it is something that no one can escape it's like anger so when the prophet Islam was approached by a man and he said oh prophet of Allah give me advice so the prophet said don't become angry the man said give me more don't become angry don't become angry don't become angry Scholars said if you don't become angry you're a wimp so someone comes and grabs your wife excuse my French and you say oh I'm not going to become angry you're not a man so then what does the prophet mean ah the prophet means Allah each and every individual must have anger in him but you must control the consequences of your anger if you see sin in front of you you have to be angry if someone attacks you without becoming angry you will never defend yourself this is my right cheek take my left cheek okay we're out of cheeks the Muslims have been hit right left and Center we're out of cheeks so no so likewise stress everyone is entitled to be stressed even the companions in the cave hiding from the Idol worshipers who were pursuing them and Abu Bakr was so stressed he said o prophet of Allah if one of them looked underneath his feet he would have seen us that is stress man I'm stressed man and the prophet said Abu Bakr what do you think of two their third is Allah I don't know now it was distressed Abu Bakr had no stress anymore once he heard these words of comfort Allah is with you enough colors that's it I'm not gonna care anymore depression is a different story depression is a feeling or a combination of feelings of sadness of loss of uh worries about the past more likely than the present the future where stress is something about the present and the future so in a sense and I just came up with this don't quote me I'm I'm improvising whenever I'm lost I just give through big words and people are Allah words of wisdom so this is the difference between well him alham is something that you carry because of something that's might be coming so you're worried how am I gonna pay the rent next month I don't have enough money this is ham is of something that had that was done in the past oh I did this I did that how can I Rectify it okay I I divorced my wife what what have I done I've destroyed my my house what are my children about to do so it's it's a combination maybe I'm right maybe I'm wrong who cares you're not paying me for this so soon we come back to the issue of stress everybody stressed but this is something that can go away easily you know when I was your age 30 40 years ago I had a lot of stress at work but how I used to take the stress out oh Sheikh By Night Prayer by reciting the Quran no no no no no no no I wasn't that religious I used to go to the gym play an hour and a half of squash and beat the heck out of this ball it screamed its head off it I went home took a shower I'm a fresh person no stress I'm not thinking of any of what's coming or what's going and what's happened I'm an easy going guy next morning I deal with my students at school with the principal with the other colleagues I'm mellow I'm chilling so this is one of the way of taking stress away of course if you engage in reading the Quran teaching and contemplating on things you will feel much better now depression is due to a number of reasons it can be a mental illness and we make the mistake of saying uh you have depression you're not a believer your Iman is weak no no no you're totally out of it because depression could come the duration is related to Iman wasn't the prophet as I'm depressed when people did not accept his call yes but was he on Prozac no no no this is definitely not the type of depression we're talking about this depression is a positive one it's for the sake of Allah he's rewarded for it this is why Allah counseled him or let me rephrase that consoled him with verses of the Quran don't put yourself at Harm's Way don't kill yourself over them don't feel sad and depressed because of them guidance in the hands of Allah so Allah is comforting him and that's why it was a slight Moment In Time unlike people saying oh I've been depressed for like seven years I've tried everything no no this is an illness maybe you need to consult a Muslim psychiatrist not someone who would put you on medication on uppers or downers and make you addicted to it and now with the medical marijuana feels good man I'm really depressed no you have to check it with a real practicing Muslim Doctor Who would see whether this is something clinical that can be solved with drugs or it's just venting and redirecting your process of thinking not Allah knows best remember just to go back early to the point that you mentioned alhamdulillah was to go Bangladesh to visit the rohingan camps and the point that you made is so powerful these kids they've seen the most tormenting things that we can't even imagine when you go speak to them they're still smiling still happy they're still reciting Quran you ask them about the situation they reply with alhamdulillah because they have to of Islam and even the elders subhanallah they were very grateful that we were there and giving whatever we could give but then you go fly to the UK and there's kids that don't have iPads and they're crying subhanallah so it's a massive massive contradiction between it just going back to the point Chef um alhamdulillah we deal with a lot of Youth uh in in our town in our cities and I see a lot of them they come you know they have social media and they have tuition and school and they have lots of things going on their life and you ask them are they happy and a lot of them they say they're depressed and although compared to everything else you know as we've mentioned already in reality it's nothing compared to other people are going through but what would you say to that youngster that youth that feels like they're depressed feels up you know they can't handle they're always anxious what would you say to that youth ah okay this is a lot of issues intermingle together it's not one size that fits all there is no magical pill why is he depressed because it started from his parents they're his parents are always nagging and bickering and complaining the father is 24 7 complaining of the um heating bill the gas pillow don't you um it's crazy the electricity bill the gas prices inflation the mother is always complaining of her in-laws your mother said this your sisters did that and especially if they live in a joint family and the food is this and that and they're fighting and complaining this Cascades down to the children what did you raise your children upon did you ever take a snapshot of how you deal with your children the moment you enter your home I don't understand share you come frustrated from work for not getting the raise for uh the harassment you're facing from non-muslim colleagues from this from that from so many factors so much so many things on your plate however the moment you enter the house the boys are fighting the girls are bickering they're running after one another shouting everywhere what is the first thing you do angrily what are you doing why are you shouting and fighting Oh Daddy she did this he did that they're trying to seek your judgment what do you say do you pray in The Mask God pray Namaz so what is the punishment in their heads Salah did you memorize your page of the Quran Quran you never pay attention Allah will not put you in hell in Paradise but I don't know Allah will not make you an Imam of the Muslims you what is this so the boy instead of being encouraged instead of being brought up to feel proud of his religion he's being put down suppressed what do you expect him to be so whenever he wants to have Daddy this happened at school don't you have friends outside to play take the bicycle and go here's five quid go and buy some Popsicles or ice creamer so they don't want to communicate with the children but they have lots of them how many I have six oh mashallah I have eight oh you're good why are you having so many kids do you love kids nah but the benefits we get they pay the bills I can send money to my family back home I can do that subhanallah so when you come and say to me the kids are depressed it's not bad it is the environment they're living in and it's not only UK come to Saudi I live in Saudi I live an hour drive from Makkah do you think we're any better no rarely you will find children in a good mood my grandchildren are in international schools meaning that they study in English I spoke to their parents what are you guys doing they can't even recite the page of the Quran correctly they can't even order in Arabic so I'd like two Big Mac and one fish fillet mashallah with an accent wow so sophisticated what is this and and all what they know is freeze or Disney or whatever this is what what they see what they uh uh have in their lives how would you like them to be guided look at them when they pray finished mashallah from zero to 100 are you a Porsche 911 terrible s this is not a prayer that you have performed and the kid and the person it's okay they prayed the afraid it seems but there is no relation between prayer and what they had performed so it's a whole package deal that we need to present as you've clearly mentioned all our children grandchildren one of my grandchildren is like three years of age and he's addicted to the iPad and he does this mashallah this magical finger this this this this I don't know how they acted they know the password of the network and they know when to log from the Wi-Fi to the 5G and what this is and then you expect them to not be depressed excuse me Allah says those who believe in their hearts find tranquility and comfort in Remembering Allah verily in remember in Allah the hearts are comforted so without this you have stress you have depression you'll have anxiety you have panic attacks unless you find something to run away from that and you have two Alternatives one going back to the dean going back to the Sharia to the Quran and this is very difficult unfortunately to some even boring two which is the easy way out movies songs soap operas TV a social media tick tock Snapchat Instagram and you find people addicted to it but this addiction is temporarily I have a friend who was addicted to watching movies in his teens he says I used to watch like four or five movies a day and after every movie of an hour and a half I was so happy you know eating popcorn and having a good time race racing cars and shooting guns and after the movie's finished I feel depressed I go to my mom and I say Mom I'm depressed I'm bored Jesus subhanallah do you see on my forehead on board every time you see me you say the same words he said I could not fill the emptiness in my soul except by seeing another movie and a third movie so nowadays it's not movies it's YouTube it's tick tock and it's addiction and the more you go higher you want something more serious more deep so in the beginning it was Tom and Jerry it was Bugs Bunny children laugh fly a few years later they want something something more serious so they have um manga the Japanese and this is levels so now they want more blood more violence and then a little bit eludity now they're in teens okay nudity is not a little bit appropriate I would like something even deeper can we have like a double x triple x then they want to see the movies and the movies they cast They categorize it into PG rated art rated X so now everybody goes to write it X and then you don't worry worry why are they depressed what do you expect so actually it's a full package deal I I don't want you to make to be depressed by what I'm saying but again this is an eye-opener we have to realize our present what's happening to our kids how much time are we investing are we just preaching them okay kids line up I'm gonna give you a sermon for half an hour blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah Allah says the prophet says the beautiful names of Allah issues and the guys sitting ah did you benefit yes daddy Carlos you can go it doesn't happen this way they hear it in the Masjid they hate it at class they hear it in the DARS it doesn't you have to communicate where is your quality time let them speak rather than you let them tell you about incidents that happened at school and don't you dare the moment they tell you what is this he will never tell you anything again try to accommodate them incubate them take what they have and redirect them with love compassion is it easy of course not it's one of the most difficult things in life and it makes you your blood pressure go probably become diabetic and lots of illnesses would occur and this is why men die before women because they suffer more women are you know chilling most likely they have no worries men are who to rent the house jobs taking care of the kids then getting married trying to please the misses the in-laws the family the girl sits home all what she cares about her husband and the children nothing much on her plate but I don't want feminists to come oh yeah yeah I I've been used to be called the male chauvinist Pig so alhamdulillah alhamdulillah um I was saying alhamdulillah is in agreement with you by the way okay I'll tell you um I don't know how much time you got left here we don't want to take up too much of your time uh but I do have a question for you um and that's in regards to uh the actual topic of this whole podcast uh dealing with the stresses of life um I want to ask you that how important is time management for the Muslim um in order to overcome stress and depression Etc and all these other things that we've talked about one of the main reasons for stress is the lack of time management now if I don't manage my time what would I spend my time in nonsense so my Essence in life is time you know the calendar Pages you take I don't know this is too primitive we have it in Arabia maybe in the UK you just this electronic you guys are so rich and so uh wealthy and and like and every time you take one page of the calendar says o son of Adam this is yours this is your life every page you take is one day gone from your life so when you have lack of appreciation of your time and life which will be the first thing you'll be questioned about in Your Grave and your life your youth your time if you fail in utilizing it what will you fill your time with you will kill time subhanallah what did time do to be killed so you find people playing on their PS4 PlayStation 4.3 I'm sophisticated I know these things so you're playing on your PS4 how how long six hours seven hours are you serious I said yeah I don't have nothing I'm just chilling with the boys we like to play fortnite we like to play this game in that game online and we do this and and your time is wasted what about you oh I waste my time just checking social media platforms I write on Twitter I write on Facebook I write on Snapchat I follow many Instagram celebrities I'm not going to talk about Halal Haram you know what I'm talking about and tick tock Tick Tock is like 10 15 seconds what did you gain someone says to me did you watch the soccer game you guys call it football I said no I never watched any game oh  why don't you like footballs no I don't like football well I like sports I'm a sportsman by the way I've been doing sports for the past 45 years with the grace of Allah and still doing it I have trophies in squash I have medals in table tennis I play yeah yeah I give you a handicap anytime today I mean we play table tennis all the time in our community center definitely after any day any day handicap whenever you want I'm calling this channel by the way just to let you know Habibi this is this is a psychological warfare you won't last for one minute in front of this okay okay so I I play sports I hit the gym three to four times a week I do weights and bodybuilding you you think I'm I'm a bit chubby alhamdulillah that's good for me that I don't want anybody to see me but when you tell me that I do you watch squash games I said no that's a waste of time do you watch table tennis no I love it but if I want to practice it I go and sweat and change two to three t-shirts filled with sweat because of the exercise that is beneficial but to sit on my back whatever and just watch 11 or 22. men run after a ball as I use usually say on Twitter buy each one a bowl and send them home why why this this is not beneficial the prophet used to seek refuge in Allah from knowledge that is not beneficial you're wasting your life so definitely it's like a cup it's like a mug you have the right to fill it with laga and you can fill it with orange juice or water your heart is the same you can utilize your time in the same fashion wallahi the more you fill your time with beneficial things with teaching people beneficial things with the learning with acquiring more knowledge you feel that time runs and there's nothing to kill and you wish that you had another five hours in every 24. hours a day but when you don't utilize your time it's the day seems to be so long some of them even kill themselves commit suicide why I'm too bored man I don't I don't have a purpose in life so I don't know this relates to your question or I use big words to divert you from yeah that was very very beneficial  it's okay to I don't know what your time's looking like um but if we have like one or two questions left and then just to kind of sure no problem yeah yeah okay um is there any particular Ayah or um Hadith you may find Solace and you know even for the listeners as well if they are going through a stressful period or anything like that anything that they can turn to or yourself that you turn to personally I find one of the best and beautiful most beautiful eyes in the Quran when you recall what had happened to prophet yunus Jonas when he was swallowed by the whale you just imagine what goes into his mind the guy was in a ship peace be upon him and they said we have to lose weight because otherwise the ship will sing and all will all die so they started throwing valuable things and then still it's a storm it's dangerous so they said we have to throw someone overboard and his name was always drawn so he accepted that and he was swollen by the whale and for three days and three nights he was in the belly of the whale now he's a prophet of course he knows Allah is going to take care of him but come on and he with all due respect you have to be frightened you have to be stressed you have to be 100 worried what was his Dua is [Music] very short easy to understand and memorize and I think in the subcontinent they call it Kalima Sharif or kalimaiva I don't know I'm I'm I may be mistaken there is no God worthy of being worshiped except you glory be to you I confess I was among the wrong doers the prophet said this Doha this supplication no one ever says it in times of depression or worries except Allah would relieve him from whatever he's feeling now the funny thing is the prophet called it Dua and in our minds we think that Dua is oh Allah give me o Allah forgive me oh Allah grant me oh Allah cure my illness oh Allah I'm asking things but this is not the case Dua is divided into two types Ana it's the Dua of complementing and praising Allah example the prophet said Allah the best of Dua is there's no God worthy of being worshiped except Allah I didn't ask for anything yes you don't have to you just compliment Allah praise Allah glorify Allah this is Dua the second type of Dua is Allah when you ask for something so the most honorable one is the first one which prophet yunus said he did not say oh Allah free me oh Allah Set Me Free oh Allah protect me he just acknowledged the Oneness of Allah glorified Allah and confessed of his wrongdoing so Allah shall saved him so believe me whenever you're in distress Wherever You Are depressed or feeling that life is difficult and everything is attacking you from all directions always have your confidence in Allah Allah has trillions of Creations other than us we have only one Allah so he never turns us back he never turns us down he always listens and responds to us of course there is no might or power other than Allah and also the Dua that the prophet says if I'm not mistaken to say Allah Allah Allah is my Lord and I don't associate others with him this puts a lot of tranquility and peace in your heart but there is no God except him so I have no fear he'll take care of me and Allah knows um we just obviously we've come kind of towards the end of our podcast uh we don't want to take up too much of a time like I keep saying uh just obviously but firstly we just want to say a big just like I've said it three times already um uh Grant you and your family the highest place in in Paradise um and the last thing that we normally do habitually is is our Adder to do this um is to ask our guest speaker to give the viewers some Glad Tidings in terms of like nasiha just uh just finish on some Glad Tidings in Allah well there are so many Glad Tidings despite what people think lots and lots and lots of Muslims are so pessimistic so negative look what's happening in Saudi Arabia look what's happening in Makkah look what's happening in Egypt look what's happening in Pakistan look what's happening everywhere the Muslims are divided the Muslims are this you're not seeing anything come to Saudi Arabia come and see the Muslims filling up the masjids the Muslims being united the Muslims feeding the poor during the month of Ramadan in the streets giving dates and water and food come and see the Muslims in their hijab in their beards in their treating one another with all courtesy and generosity and this is everywhere go to Indonesia they don't speak a single word of Arabic the moment they see you and they acknowledge you're a Muslim they invite you to the very little they have you have to share with them the food go to Bangladesh the amount of people coming asking me questions on Ask zad from Bangladesh is mind-blowing who am I nobody yet they come and tune in to zad and ask questions the amount of emails I'm getting people are Rising the Muslims are rising and the beautiful thing it's not violent it's with knowledge it's with wisdom and people are spreading the word in a very beautiful way look at the events in FIFA uh in Qatar beautiful things that happened dawa wise many many things have been positively introduced to the non-muslims in the masjides in the kadura the
