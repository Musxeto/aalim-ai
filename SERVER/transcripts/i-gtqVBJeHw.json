  "transcript": "this is a long topic now originally speaking we will not go into labeling people and segregating and dissecting them because for a revert to do this it would be easier for you to just say oh i'm not interested i'm leading islam may allah forbid but this is how shaytaan works when he wants to deter you from practicing islam he would try to put obstacles or which one i would i follow this so they say wahhabi this one they say he's a super salafi this one is a sufi this one is a shia this one is oh it's so confusing they'll tell you what i quit and this is not the right thing as a leaver you came to islam study islam where is islam quran and sunnah okay who should i follow okay problems to me and try to act like a wise man if you are sick you have stomach ache what do you do i go to the hospital which hospital you're gonna choose uh this hospital why not that hospital um because they said that this one is good okay which doctor is going to see you the er doctor why not the dentist oh because they say the dentist is for your teeth not for your stomach see there is a methodology you follow when you want to check on things don't put obstacles when it comes to deen because this is shaytan this is satan messing up with your head to make you reject everything no look for a trustworthy shaykh that you like his knowledge that you trust his methodology and his religious commitment and his moral conduct his effects he's also accredited by other scholars he's consistent throughout his years on what he says he doesn't change color there are deviant scholars who change their colors every five months some of them change colors to the highest bidder so he says right he's right wing if somebody pays he's left-wing he's a communist he's this he's that don't be distracted follow scholars who are consistent who are known for what they're saying who are logical your logic accepts eighty percent of what they say twenty percent this is pure following you you may not find the wisdom behind it but you follow because it falls under the 80 which is logical when you finally manage to reach such a person or persons they will be able to guide you now if you're not in south africa worldwide there are islamic centers and we can tell which is following the sunnah which is following the righteous predecessors which is on the right track and which is deviant so if you do your homework you check you ask you will inshallah be in good hands"
