  "transcript": "should one recite the Fatiha and surah while praying behind the imam in a prayer behind any ma'am it is either loud prayer loud raucous like in the first two records of maghrib and isha or it is silent prayers like in lahore acid the last raka of madrid and the last two records of asia if you are praying behind the imam in loud raka like in fajar two Rakas of Maghreb two rakahs of Asia the Sunnah is that you recite the fatiha when the Imam has concluded his recitation and I'm saying it is a Sunnah it's not a pillar because the Imams recitation suffices for you so if I deliberately do not recite the fatiha my prayer is valid because in the loud raka his fatiha suffice is for me if I want which is recommended I should recite my fatiha as well after he says well Abilene I mean I recite my Fatiha afterwards now reciting surah for me after the fatiha is totally prohibited because the Prophet are a sort of Salam clearly instructed us not to the sight behind the mmm any surah after the Fatah and that was referring to loud raucous but if it's for her time the imam is not reading audibly I cannot hear him so it is a must that I read the Fatiha this is a pillar if I don't my prayer is invalid and it is optional to read surah afterwards and it's highly recommended why after reciting walla ball lean mean nasa silent Raqqa the imam is reciting surah i can't just sit there do nothing or looking around me i have to do something because in prayer you don't just sit there idle so decide to fire a surah i finished it set a second one beside a long surah until the amount goes for record but in loud raucous no surah to be recited except the fact you have for you as a follower"
