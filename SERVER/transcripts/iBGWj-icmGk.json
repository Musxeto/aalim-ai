  "title": "Can we give Food Items or Groceries as our zakat during this Lockdown? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Beshara says can we give food items or basic groceries with our zakat money because of this lockdown as many people lost their jobs and they do not have money to feed their families these are two different and separate things zakat money must be given in cash to the poor if you want to give them extra charity by buying them food and groceries may Allah reward you this is excellent but if you want to buy with the zakat money food to give it to them this is not permissible unless they authorize you why because they know what to do with the money better than you do so you think that oh they are in lockdown so they need groceries the poor thing maybe they said no we want cash we have to pay for medicine we have to give somebody's his debt that he's been calling us and bugging us for the past six months or we have to pay the rent or we have to pay the electricity bill so you don't know what they need they're poor and needy you give them cash and let them act according to what suits them best but if you take their authorization and tell them listen your zakat money it is X Y Z it will buy you only this much but if you authorize me to buy you groceries and food I can buy wholesale and I can give you this much instead of this much which your money could buy and they say yes please go ahead then there is no problem in doing that"
