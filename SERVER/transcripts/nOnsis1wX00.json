  "transcript": "well I believe that such uh uh websites are commercial and a proper Muslim and a proper muslima would not advertise themselves on such um websites that only look for um material game for worldly gain if there were to be a proper website that that is run by proper brothers and sisters who take care of privacy of those involved who would make matchmaking an experience that is private that is sincere and that intends the welfare of the people if this is the case then in it is permissible I have my reservations I have my reservations regarding posting uh photographs of of women I see that this is completely unacceptable uh islamically I think it is also degrading uh on the social level for a sister to display her photograph and to have high expectations from the side of a man and when he comes and sees her he finds her different than what he anticipated or hoped for and then he reject her this is degrading this Islamic and I believe that this is not permissible and Allah knows this"
