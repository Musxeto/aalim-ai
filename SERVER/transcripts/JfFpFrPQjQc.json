  "title": "What to do when forced to utter words of Blasphemy? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "as aasif from india had two questions his first question he's saying that being a minority in India sometimes fanatics and extremist Hindus may do things that are heinous and abusive and they do this on daily basis and they provoke violence they want violence so sometimes they catch a Muslim individual and they are a posse of them hooligans the scum of the earth and they force him to say cover statements and phrases either praising their gods or praising Mother India or whatever so what is the scenario now we know that uttering the word of ko4 makes a person kafir even if jokingly unless he's forced to do this as mentioned in the Quran and the incident took place with Ahmad Nia said may Allah be pleased with him and with his father when he once came to the Prophet alysus I'm crying so the Prophet told him at is awesome why are you crying he said they kept on torturing me the idol worshippers kept on beating me torturing me until out of pain I cursed you he's crying and weeping so the Prophet asked him a specific question how do you find your heart when you cursed me what was going in your mind how was your heart so amar said my heart was filled with Eman with the love of the Prophet Allah salat wa salam with the love in islam so the Prophet told him it is a solemn if they go back to torturing you go back to insulting me and so compulsion uplifts the ruling of Cooper because you are forced to do it and therefore if a Muslim was faced by such a situation he is permitted to say whatever they tell him to say as long as he hates it and his heart is filled with Eman"
