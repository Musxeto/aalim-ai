  "transcript": "about the TV now the TV as we know is something new so she says I need a new ruling who's asking for she's the one praying at home sometimes I leave the TV on and she's put in brackets for the TV here she says is that necessary to switch this TV off now the reason she said is because angels were not into the house if there's images does this TV do the images from a TV actually become within this hadith of images in the house I presume you shall know that they are not as long as its hold a TV or an Islamic channel that does not have anything prohibited then inshallah it's okay and it does not prevent angels from entering because they are not fixed images and what's shown on TV screens is not considered to be prohibited this also depends on the intention of her leaving the the TV on because if she's gonna pray and she is following a program this is completely unacceptable she's she's following a program she's very interested in what's going on and she doesn't want to miss anything of that program and she prays while watching the program this is unacceptable"
