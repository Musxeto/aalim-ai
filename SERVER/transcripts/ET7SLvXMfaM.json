  "transcript": "yes what can I do for you sh my question is what is your advice to people who say that if you read Hadith and Quran from translation in your language directly you will be astray or you will become so you will become what you will lead astray okay first of all Allah said in the Quran fear Allah to the best of your ability so if this is the best of my ability I don't speak Arabic I don't speak English I don't speak uh uh German or French and the only book of uh uh t or the translation of the meanings of the Holy Quran or the noble Quran and of the Sunnah are found in Tamil or in Udu and you're telling me if I read it I'll go astray so what should I do just look at the stars and do nothing no this is totally bogus and whoever says this want you to remain in the state of ignorance till the day you die I always say this to my congregation I went once to I think maybe the red mosque or I don't know what color it was somewhere in India and I went to pray Juma there and mashallah the Masjid was packed and the Imam came and he was like maybe 150 years old something whoa so and I'm getting there so I'm not making fun of old people I'm already half that age so he went in he delivered the now I'm an Arab I did not understand a word of what he said except alhamdulillah he was reading from a book and you can see flies coming out of it it was an book and probably he read it like a gazillion times and I was looking around and everybody else could not understand a word and the guy gave two hbas and he started the prayer now I didn't understand theba those natives did not understand the so the most likely the IM was the only one who understood it and I really doubtful if he did understand what he read what is the use of Friday if it's wasted like this once a week and no one understands anything and no one gets the messages of this beautiful religion this is why I say when you are in a country that don't speak Arabic don't give your in Arabic Just sh say the and recite an Ayah and then go ahead and speak in the native language of the of the country or in English where everybody understands and benefits and learn their religion rather than just reading something that nobody understands what you're reading and Allah Knows Best"
