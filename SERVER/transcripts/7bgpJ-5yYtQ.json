  "title": "Parents believe in superstitions, if we do what they tell us to avoid conflict Is it hypocrisy Assim",
  "transcript": "if our parents believe in any type of superstitions and they ask us not to do it for example they tell us don't wash your clothes on this and these days because this and this will happen we know for certain this is nonsense what they say but if we decide not to do it in front of them just not to make them angry but we would normally do this without their presence is this problematic and is this maybe some kind of hypocrisy okay first of all to believe in superstitions defies your belief in islam because our islam is based on the six pillars of iman to believe in allah azzawajal the day of judgment the angels the prophets the scriptures and in the pre-destiny whether good or bad when you believe in superstitions you believe in something other than that and it's something that did not or was not revealed in the quran or in the sunnah therefore it's baseless so it defies your belief in islam nevertheless some parents are old are ignorant they don't have the proper knowledge and for you to avoid any conflict you've tried so many times to convince them but they still believe that you should not walk underneath a ladder for example this for you to avoid it just to please them and to avoid any conflict or though you have done your due diligence you've advised them before you have tried your level best to give them now but they're defiant so to avoid this not out of any belief in such superstitious things rather it's just to avoid conflict there is nothing wrong in that insha allah because it all depends on your belief no one says no you have to walk underneath the ladder and whatever happens happens nobody says wash your clothes on that particular hour of the day or on that particular day of the week just to prove they're wrong nobody says they said allah knows best you"
