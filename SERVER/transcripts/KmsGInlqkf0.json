  "transcript": "ald we're still in the chapter that deals with and Hadith number 143 was narrated by jund abdah may Allah be pleased with him he said that on the day of on the day of sacrifice that is the 10th of the the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam offered the prayer and delivered theba and then slaughtered the sacrifice and said anybody who slaughtered his sacrifice before the Eid prayer should Slaughter another animal in place of it and the one who has not yet slaughtered should Slaughter mentioning Allah's name on it again this Hadith is similar to the previous Hadith of but here it is something extra in the prophet said after you pray you Slaughter but here he prayed then offered theba then slaughtered and that is why some of the scholars said that it is essential that you do not Slaughter except after the however other Scholars said that you can Slaughter after the prayer because this is what the Hadith of clearly states and to be on the safe side it's only a matter of half an hour approximately even less than therefore it is highly recommended that you do not Slaughter except after the conclusion after the end of the of Al now a lot of the non-muslims consider slaughtering to be a barbaric act and we as Muslims do not care about what they think we know that this religion is from the creator of the heavens and the Earth it's from Allah Asel and that Allah the almighty knows what is best to his servants and we also know that medical reports clearly state that when an animal is slaughtered all the blood that contains the bacteria and the microbes and all means of illnesses and diseases when the animal is slaughtered the body is dried from the majority of this blood and hence maintains the meat to be more tender more delicious and above all healthier and that is why Islam recommends us to slaughter not only recommends us we cannot eat any animal that it is not slaughtered unless of course it is hunted and this there are different set of rules for a hunted animal but other than animals to be slaughtered we're not allowed to eat them maybe they would say we stun an animal we hit the animal on the head until it dies we suffocate an animal we electrocute an animal until it dies and then we Slaughter it well if you do this this you will find that the blood that comes out is negligible compared to the blood that comes out when you Slaughter and beside this is inhumane the amount of pain and suffering that the animal gets is far less when the animal is being slaughtered and that is why the prophet wasam said Allah the almighty has mandated to be kind on everything and therefore if you Slaughter be kind when you Slaughter and you must sharpen your knife your blade and you must lay your slaughtered animal to rest quickly all of this is a type of Islamic etiquette to those who claim that we are barbaric in Islam it is forbidden for you to slaughter a sheep or an animal in front of other animals do you know that that you cannot slaughter a sheep while other sheep are looking in Islam look at those who have slaughter houses in the non-muslim countries they slaughter the hundreds and the thousands while they're looking at each other this is inhumane and therefore we could care less about what people say about us because we are Muslims we've submitted our will to Allah asael and we are complying to his teachings subhanahu waala we have Hadith number 144 this Hadith is a long one and we'd like someone to read it for us yes AR ja Abdullah reported I observed prayer with messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam on the Eid day he commenced with a prayer before theba without aan and without he then stood up leaning on B and he commanded them to have tawa consciousness of Allah and he exhorted them on obedience to him and he preached to the people and admonished them he then walked on until he came to the women and preached to them and said oh women give charity for you will be most of the fuel for the fire a woman having a dark spot on her cheek stood up and said why is it so messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam he said for you complain too much and show ingratitude to your spouse and then they begin to give charity out of their ornaments such as their earrings and Rings which they threw on the cloth of B bukari and Muslim in this we learn that it is not part of the Sunnah to have an aan or an for and hence it is not permissible I to call people for by saying or as being done in some places because all of this is considered to be Innovation the prophet didn't do itam so how dare you do something that the prophet did not do also the prophet's and sermon ofid would consist of preaching the people reminding them of Allah and drawing them closer to Allah subhanahu waala after that the prophet Alat would go to the women and address them specifically rather than addressing them with the men because he have already addressed the men and the women but then he goes specifically for the women and he would remind them of Allah and as you heard in the Hadith he told them that you must pay charity because the majority of you would be the fuel wood of fire and the women may Allah be pleased with them the companions one of them stood up and said okay this is not normal we do not disbelieve in Allah so why is it so and she stood up and said why is that oh prophet of Allah now you've told us about the punishment can you kindly tell us about the sin and the prophet saidat that you complain a lot and you're not grateful and you do not show gratitude to your spouse so these are two reasons for women to be thrown into hell and one would maybe object and say okay isn't this also found in men don't we have men who complain a lot don't we have men who are ungrateful to their wives the answer is yes definitely we do however the responsibilities of women are far less than the responsibilities of men men are obliged to be the bread earner they're obliged to go out and work they're obliged to pray in the Masjid five times a day they're obliged to do Jihad when it is required and requested they're obliged to attend so many things not like the women women as in the Hadith of the Prophet if a woman fasts her month that is Ramadan and prays her prayer that is the five daily prayers and protects her Chastity she does not fornicate she does not flirt or go fool around and she obeys her husband four things what would happen the prophet says she will enter Allah's Paradise now this is a great reward for what for only four simple things so we men believe though if you put yourself in the women's shoes obeying the husband is not an easy task it is an enormous responsibility especially if the husband is not someone you would love to obey if the husband is arrogant if the husband is ignorant if he's ugly if he stinks if he his mouth smell is awful if his if your in-laws are bad this makes life more and more difficult but yet the responsibilities are less a woman sits home she's the queen of the house everything comes to her on her request so if she complains this means that she is not grateful to Allah nor she is grateful to her husband we have a short break and inshallah asalam alaykum and welcome back so women complain women show feelings of being ungrateful and feelings of not being thankful to what the husbands do this is a major sin and this is one of the main reasons of entering hell but if women claim and complain that this is our nature we can't do anything about it in this case Allah knows the truth and in this case the prophet has directed you to to do what erases some of these sins and that is paying charity and Allah also revealed an Ayah where he says that verily The Good Deeds erase the bad Deeds we learn if women have shortcomings they have to compensate By Night Prayer by offering sodak and of course the best thing to do is to tolerate you must tolerate your husband you must cope with what he has you must be grateful to the least of what he's presenting because the companions their wives whenever they wanted to go out to earn money their wives used to tell them fear Allah in us because we can tolerate hunger but we cannot tolerate Haram money we are ready to be patient and not to eat a lot but we're not ready to eat something that is Haram that would take us to Hell from this Hadith we learn that it is permissible to dedicate a sermon for the females and this was requested by the females at the time of the Prophet when they said oh prophet of Allah the men have overwhelmed you and took you from us so designate one day a week where you come to us or we come to you and we learn from you and this shows how careful they were in learning from the prophet wasam from this Hadith we also learn that women used to go out to attend the sermon and the prayer of Eid and it is unlike praying in the Masjid we've stated before that praying in the Masjid for women is not recommended it is more recommended for them to pray in their homes unlik it is highly recommended for them to go out and some Scholars even went further to say it is mandatory for them to go out and attend theid as we will know inshallah later on from this Hadith as also that the Sunnah for women to be segregated from men so the women were far away from the men they were not mixing together and one of the most shocking and ridiculous piece of news that I've heard in the past few years where a woman led the prayer of Friday she was the Friday Imam in America and America everything that is weird happens everything you think of happen happens in America but this was the funniest and the most stupid because it was unprecedented it never happened at the time of the Prophet it never happened at the time of the Muslims 15 centuries never to happen where a woman leads the Friday prayer and gives a sermon and the MU I saw that on the YouTube was so funny because she was not even wearing the veil she was a woman and in the prayer you saw women and men praying next to each other women in their genes and Men next to them what kind of prayer this this is almost close to being an orgy rather than being a Friday prayer this is ridiculous this is playing with religion and it can reach the stage of nullifying a person's religion if he thinks he can play with Islam like this this goes against the imma of the Muslims the way of life the way of the companions it showed that the prophet Alam promoted segregation between men and women women have their own Society they can do whatever they want but once a man and a woman mix together the inevitable must happen and we all know what happened and they say no once they get used to it it becomes okay and normal and this is only in the minds of you Muslims well I beg to differ we all know what one of the presidents of a superpower did with an intran and we know what he had done with her because she was working with him and he was married and he's married he has children and he did what was known to be one of the biggest scandals in the history of America president with an entr why because of the mixing this is what Islam Pro protects the women and men segregation for the better and for the best for the society we also learn from the Hadith that the companions whether men or women were so quick to respond to the prophet's callam the minute they learned that they will be in hell because of their sins and the prophet encouraged them to give sodak none of them said okay I'll give you a rain check or wait until I go back and get my credit cards or I will try to sell no immediately whatever they had they gave it for Allah and they started throwing their jewelry to Bilal who was collecting this for sod and finally we learn from this Hadith the ruling on piercing the ear because some Scholars said that piercing the ear so that you would wear not you of course men so that women would wear earrings they said that this is torture and it is not permissible and this is incorrect whatever means a woman needs to beautify herself which is known among the Muslims it is permissible and since the time of the Prophet Alam women used to wear earrings and they used to pierce their ears for that what's the ruling on piercing another piercing for having two earrings or three earrings the scholars say that this is permissible though it is not known to be part of women uh wearing jewelry except recently when the women in the west started piercing two or three but they say again as long as this is normal practice among the Muslims is permissible what's the ruling on piercing the nose if the customs of the Muslims state that this is form of beautification it is permissible though it is not recommended now piercing other parts of the body is completely prohibited so someone says what's the ruling on piercing my tongue or piercing my nipples or piercing my belly button or piercing the all of this is unlam and it's cause of torturing and mutilation that is uncalled for in Islam of course to have men Pierce themselves it's even more forbidden piercing is only permitted for more women I believe that these are all the rules that we can get from this Hadith if you have any question I believe we have few minutes left yes brother the age that you stated for slaughtering of animals is the same to be followed for any other sacrifice other than the sacrifice of ID AA yes these ages they must be followed in sacrificing your Hadi for example and as we know the slaughtering is either for Hadi and this is done by a pilgrim a person who's doing pilgrimage he offers a person who's not going for he offers a person who makes a mistake and has to compensate for it by slaughtering he Slaughters a fidia and a person who is blessed by Allah with a baby child he Slaughters and a person who gets smack married he Slaughters his WIA so these are the major five types of slaughtering Islam and it is recommended that it is mandatory for and that they be more than 6 months old for a sheep one year old for a goat two years old for a cow 5 years old for a camel but for the WIA you you can cook whatever you wish it's food that is necessary yes in the Indian subcontinent after the namas the greeting is uh done by shaking hand eming so what is the right way of greeting each other after namas are you talking about prayer of Eid after prayer of Eid after the Sunnah is as reported in m IM Malik that the Companions and I believe that it is reported by ju that the companions used to greet each other by saying may Allah accept from us and you so if the companions used to do this the greeting itself is recommended and it is permissible in however the ruling on shaking hands after normal prayers this is not recommended some some countries some places when you go after Salam concluding the prayer you go to your right even if you saw him and greeted him before Salah you also do this now this is not part of the Sunnah yes if there's someone you didn't see since a long time and you would like to greet him yes but someone you see every single prayer five times a day seven days a week every prayer you shake hands with him this becomes an innovation and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
