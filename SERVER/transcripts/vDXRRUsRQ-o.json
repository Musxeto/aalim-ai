  "transcript": "and this is not what i say it's what the scholars say i do not shoot from the hip i don't say things from my own mind this is what the scholars say if you go back to their classical books you will find this condition mentioned a woman has the right to ask for divorce and she is awarded it as a condition if her husband were to take a second wife without her permission and she read the comments and she said the comments were heinous and in the beginning like 10 years ago i used to be a little bit uh saddened by such comments but then my skin got thick and i don't care anymore why because those who comment are ignorant imbeciles with all due respect and i don't know them so i'm not pointing and saying out of my ivory tower that these guys are imbeciles they're ignorant i don't specifically mention someone by name i'm just talking generally those who comment negatively like this and say no this is making halal things haram etc have zero knowledge in islam if they sit with me face to face they don't even know how to clean themselves after answering the call of nature if i ask them simple things and i've done this gazillion times i asked people what are the pillars of iman said yeah yeah i know the pillars of amen no this is the pillars of islam you shmuck you have to have understanding of your religion you don't know happida you don't know yet you have the audacity to come and comment about things that are mentioned in the books of fick and the scholars agree upon it without any knowledge you just comment so with all due respect who cares what these guys comment upon so many people call not to add value rather to be heard on tv so [Music] no how do you think i should comb my hair what is this they just want to be heard or to make a point not to add value or to correct my mistake or to benefit the the listeners or to learn themselves so don't pay attention to the comments"
