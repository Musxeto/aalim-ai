  "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] oh [Music] Welcome to our discussion of the question can a Muslim practice Islam and have fun I'm riari and with me are Al and hsein Y so aim tell us well before I go on because life is miserable as it is but it's fun it's beautiful I think that we should take a look at the Sunnah first of all to compare Apple to Apple and afterwards then we can elaborate a little bit more what do you think that's V yeah so if we look at the Sunnah we find that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam used to have fun in his life and it was not like we do isolate ourselves from our families and have fun you know it's a boys day a boys night in the states they call the poker night so it's only men and poker and cigars no the prophet Sall used to have it with his family we it's reported that AA may Allah be pleased with her said I was with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in one of the Caravans or convoys or whatever and he told and instructed the companions to proceed on and him and I were left behind and after the Army was cleared and we could not see them he said AA would you like to race with me and she said yes I I'll take up this Challenge and she said we raced and I beat him so the prophet did not comment on that Subhan Allah and few years later she said after I picked up some put on some weight it's the same incident in a different location the prophet Sall wasallam said how about now would you like to race yes I won the first time I could easily win this time so the prophet raced with herat and he beat her and he said two sh this one with that one and if you look at this form of entertainment of pleasure of playing I would never expect an Imam to raise another Imam if I see the Imam the leader of the Masjid racing with another guy look at this Infidel what is he doing what's happened to him what what's wrong with his mind I'll never pray behind him this guy he's laughing he laughs and this means that there's something wrong in our thinking because our raw model sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to not race with his companions with his wife and I know out of experience because I get a lot of calls from sisters complaining that they are abused by their husbands and this has nothing to do with Islam on the contrary the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that the best among you are those who are best to their wives I think every Muslim woman in the world has memorized that Hadith in unfortunately every Muslim man is trying his best to forget this Hadith and this is a big problem so I believe that there is a big room for entertainment and for playing in a permissible way and that does not stop you from being a good Muslim the RO example is the prophet Sall wasallam and there are lots of more examples yeah that's true alhamdulillah first of all as you know brothers and sisters alhamdulillah that Allah blessed us with this Dean beautiful de which actually suits the F and takes all the natural inclinations into consideration so so it is a code of life it is so it governs every aspect in your life from the day in the morning you open your eyes Islam teaches you what to do and until you go back to sleep so throughout your day so this is the beauty about this Dean and uh when the prophet Sall wasallam said the prophet wasallam you see he's teaching us something here he said he waited until I put on weight and then he asked her again he said don't you see don't you see and actually there is something and this is a piece of advice for the sisters take care of your shapes and figures honestly and for the brothers and the brothers as well okay but because AA she explained he explained why he said because our food was you know dry bread and things they were not fatty okay so she said don't you see me he insisted said you have to and then as our brother mentioned so I'm sure that many of double coach practicing Brothers no one did this he took his uh his wife to to you know somewhere room and say let us have fun let us run let us are us to the box with my wife but so alhamdulillah that this Dean is is so beautiful so beautiful and we need we want everyone to know about our Dean whether they are Muslims or non-muslims really because our role model is Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam and he's the most successful husband no one can be successful than the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and uh yes we receive complaints from the sisters and may Allah subh make all the marital lives of Muslims successful and may Allah subhana tala save them from all these marital problems a mean so for instance just I'll just give give you some examples from the life of the Prophet sallam that he's a human being and the house of the Prophet Salli wasallam was not free of any this marital issues and marital problems for instance that all the wives of the Prophet s wasallam they they got together and they started demanding for maintenance and the prophet wasam told them I don't have said I don't have and he got angry and he decided to leave the house and he was staying in the m and he told them actually you will not see me for one month and he was staying in the mid for one month and the rumors went on through the Medina among the sahaba that the prophets divorced his wives his wives and the prophet sallam came and he found h crying and he said to H do didn't I tell you never listen to Aisha see what happened did he divorce you she said I don't know said don't ever listen to her because you cannot be like her and your father is not like her father the most beloved one to the prophet s wasallam is Abu Bakr and the most beloved one from among his wife AA and the prophet made it clear when he was asked whom do you love most from among your he said Aisha so much so that the sahab would wait to give their gifts on the day of when he was staying with so the after one month he went back the prophet sallam AA said I was counting the days and the nights on my fingers he said one month after 29 days he came back and I told him the month is not over yet the prophet Salli wasallam looked at her he said the month can be 29 days and 30 days and he laughed so he is teaching us something here that you will have this problem but you have to cope IM n mentioned another beautiful thing about every Muslim knows about that when he walks in one street the Shan will run away and yet see how he lives with his family so one of the sahaba he had uh his wife is always uh screaming uh flaring up Etc so he went to complain to om when he reached the door of Omar he heard the voice of Omar's wife screaming shouting alhamdulillah I'm not alone this is happening in the how so he decided to go back Omar opened the door and said brother come come what is it said no no no no no there's nothing no no tell me tell me so he told him see said he said a she cooks for me she stitches my clothes she looks after my H she sweeps the house and he started listing the she Bears my children the daily ches sa from time to time she fls up I have to take it so this is because they learned that from the prophet the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and one day Abu bakar sik he passed by said how how do you feel he said I am hypocrite said what are you saying said we would be in the circle of the Prophet Salli wasallam telling us about J and N Heaven and Hell as if we're seeing it and our hearts are trembling our souls are flying the moment we go to our homes and sit with our children we forget that said if you call that hypocrisy I have the same problem Abu Bak makes two of us so let us go to the prophet and they complained to him and he told them where you stay or remain on the same status that means that status of Iman the Angels would have come and shake hands with with you in your beds but from time to time you see this is happening that's why the believe of IM goes up and goes down but some people they now they this hour and an hour one hour like this what they meant now one hour inam no the entertainment that's why the is one hour for your heart and your entertainment and and one hour for your lord so the S now is is divided into s for your lord and S for your Satan this is what the people are actually doing nowadays so there are lots of of Halal ways of doing and having entertainment either alone or with the family but if we would like to explore a bit more well I think there's still some other uh examples from the uh there's some famous story about the tossing a water yeah exactly you say they say the sah they they would eat the melon watermelon and when they finish the the kernel the only the the peels or the Skins they would start you know throwing the each other with this and uh and Subhan Allah Abu Hurr would start just laughing until sometimes he would who he would fall in the floor and the prophet Sall wasallam himself he he was also teaching us that we have to be you know humorous and uh hilarious yes one day he was uh a woman came to him an old lady and she said oh Prophet pray for me that so I will enter the jna told her old woman they don't enter the jna and the poor lady started you know weeping weeping he said no no no no because you are going to be young again he didn't say anything wrong Sall alaihi wasallam also when he said to the other lady are you the wife of that man who has whiteness in his eye he said I don't know a prophet of Allah to be honest so she went to her husband let me see you have any whiteness said what's wrong with you every human being has whiteness in his eyes so so you see the how the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam was I mean entertaining the sahabah but within the also the prophet s wasallam was once asked by one of his companions for a camel so that he would go in the sight of Allah for to join the battle defending Islam so he said no I'll give you a son of a camel prophet of Allah what would I do with a son of a camel he said what what is a son of a camel is a camel himself so something that was born of a camel it's definitely a camel and that's why the companions complained in a sense or objected they said oh prophet of Allah you joke with us you know you're a prophet you're a messenger yet you joke with us isn't this a little bit weird he said no I joke with you but I never say a lie I never lie all what I joke with is authentic and it is accepted like the the time he came to one of his companions and he embraced him from behind he said who will buy this slave slave yeah he didn't lie he is a slave of Allah and likewise this kind of humor and joking is acceptable providing one does not lie because if you lie then you are in a dubious area and this might lead to something that is not permissible that's true and actually in when we read the the lit the Islamic literature there are many books written by the on this particular topics and what the how the scholars they were you know cracking jokes and all these things but of course within the framework of the Shar alhamdulillah so nowadays we have so many kinds of entertainment maybe have some objectionable elements to them so what's left I mean the classic situation that that we face with our children especially is that they want to do this and we say can't do that sorry I want how about this well sorry I can't do that so what kind of things can our children do that are fun but lawful I I believe that in order to make the circle a little bit narrower we should identify the things we're not supposed to do and then apart from that everything is okay exactly yes I do you agree yeah definitely yes for example I believe that anything that involves a sin is not permissible so listening to music is not permissible for men for boys watching women is not permissible wasting the majority of your time even if this is a permissible thing but wasting the majority of your time and which may lead to neglecting a prayer or engaging your your thoughts while praying and the thing that you were doing before that also is not permissible or create hatred sometimes okay that's good how do you mean what do you in games see sometimes people they don't have that Spirit of sport as they call it and we can see it today people they end up fighting killing each other I this is everywhere now you see these uh the spectators at soccer matches football matches because that is they went to the extreme you know because soccer is for soccers well it seems like I mean for some people it's a culture where I mean the the match is sort of a sideshow to the real reason why they're there which is to drink and fight yes this is the holigans and so on but if I am not wrong Allah justifies making intoxicants and gambling Haram because as it says in the the main reason for Satan to throw enmity and hatred in your heart is through gambling and intoxicant so if anything leads to the same effect it takes the same H same verdict two extent you have to it has to be clear-cut but anywhere you compete there has to be an amount of not hatred but of competition otherwise if I compete with you and I say no no you go ahead you you no competition should be there you You raise me I'll make you number one then the Soul of the competition is not there anymore should be a healthy competition yes the competition should be there no doubt but uh I mean when we come to this area for instance the martial art and all these things we we should try to keep these martial arts fixed or remain within the framework of the Shar there is something that goes against the Shar then we say sorry this canot be for instance when the prophet Salli wasallam he wrestled because in Arabia there was a famous wrest in Arabia so he came to the prophet Sall wasallam and he said if you put me down I'll become Muslim fine no problem come so the prophet just took him like that and put him down give me Second Chance said come give me the third again Muhammed this is the prophet of Islam s alhi wasallam see so we need actually brothers and sisters to study Islam you will enjoy it it's is so beautiful whatever you want we have many things we can give to others as well so the beauty of this D that for instance everything the one of the fundamentals of the rulings of the this is one of the principles of the Shar the basic and the fundamental that everything is permissible everything unless unless of course unless it is mentioned otherwise in the Quran or in in the Sunnah so for instance if someone comes to me and say brother this fruit is Haram why what is the evidence so now you produce the evidence tell no sorry my de says everything is for me so you have to produce the evidence that's why the Halal you cannot limit it but everything is halal and the haram's items are you can count them on your hand so this is the beauty that everything is permissible for you unless it goes against something stated clearly in the sh and the law then you say no we cannot do this if you wish we could go on and mention a few Halal things that are applicable nowadays right for example one of the means and ways of utilizing your time is by doing something that is good for your body and your soul so this adds lots of value because you're utilizing your time in something that is useful I believe sh Hussein is a martial art expert and he's been doing so many things in this field so what what what do you recommend no I think we all agreed that Allah subhanahu waala say in the Quran now based on this Ayah we know that Allah himself said that indeed the the world this world according to Allah is of that mean there's a lot of came plays that's why you see when any newborn baby what they do child children they just play that is their F you don't call them to go and even when they are praying they are playing and we we go down with them and to play with them with the children so that is their F only Islam give us a better guidance that if you want to entertain your children in playing with toys you must be very careful don't teach them to use certain toy that can bring harm to themsel or to others because there is a a guideline in Islam the prophet said muslim obvious know whatever game they want to play they always be very selective it's like don't teach your children to play with sword and start to fight with each other and fight with their parent you know is not healthy because later on they thought fighting with your parent your sibling is common don't don't buy them gun and going to shoot somebody from very young then they you shoot your father and the father don't fall father you're not dead then the father pret okay I'm s now I'm dead now then you stand up again so this kind of game is very destructive because you are training the children to fight with you from very young age but you can give them all the kind of toys that is very constructive know that can help them to De the develop the IQ know very educational kind of game but that is the fitra of children life and then you come the second level the love then that's where the entertainment come in everybody is exposed to that I'm sure that Me Myself and are young of course we do everything at the time we are not a Muslim then of course everything goes so now we are Muslim know now we are more selective what kind of entertainment that do not bring any harm to us neither will cause any harm to other or any discomfort for others so Islam the de of Islam is so beautiful that when you want to do something you do do not just do it for the fun of doing it make sure that it benefit you it benefit you and also not only thinking about yourself you must think that do it benefit other or when it benefit you disturb others it's not good so when we look into that then we believe the prophet himself encourage his um to involve in the archery swimming horse riding all these are very healthy kind of gamees sports that really can make you a better person and you can Feit and then when you healthy your body is healthy you have a health healthy mind inshallah this what people used to say your Healthy Mind came from healthy body and also you see that in in the prophet saying a strong Muslim is always loved by Allah more than just another Muslim yeah two Muslim but one is strong and healthy and one is Muslim but he weak very passive we hope that insh the Muslim always are very a positive looking towards all these healthy kind of games like uh you want to go into further detail about if you want to be strong maybe now there's a lot of Arts going on in Malaysia the Mele art you call the SE in China you got the Shing the Kung Fu going on and maybe you have the taii also for the elders if they cannot do any hard kind of exercise you can still make some kind of taii for some kind of for fitness and energy with it builds some energy in you of course what is important is we hope that whatever kind of games or entertainment you involve make sure that that kind of exercise or that kind of entertainment do not go against the Sharia that what we have agreed upon okay anything going FR we see what can we do such as beating the face for example beating the face this is forbidden in Islam as as like boxing boxing yes this is this is no even like you're playing self-defense arts and so on you have the male among the male the female they want to play female they have their own female that example the sister want to do some Arabic classes why not keep themel fit and they want to dance the rock is up to them doing thems as long as they in their own room they can do something to make them healthy they can socialize among themselves for something that they can bring some benefit to their to their body to their health it's not that Islam is so rigid oh no no nothing you just go to the mall recite the Quran finish May zik no even the prophet and the companion they are very active people you see so Islam is a very a practical religion it covers everything that you need in your life this is what is very important for the Muslim to understand so that even our youths you mallah you see now they involved in karate or taekwando from Japan and all these you can entertain all this kind of sport because it is very uh healthy and it do not contradict with Islam teaches you to defend yourself in case you're attacked also of course you need to you you got to be strong because as a Muslim you are supposed to help others to protect the weak and the poor and the needy now how can you protect them when you are weak needs to be protected you need to be protected that's why the prophet say so what we need the Muslim to understand that don't think that Islam is just praying fasting zik ha and omra even you want to go to ha you you need to be fit because there are lot of walking movement to and all these things so man I always encourage even back home in my country I encourage my students let me just interrupt here yeah in one of the years we were in the H you know and it was summer really and uh there was no AC this was many years and uh one man is sitting like this you know the Arabs they have something they cross their legs we call it the prophet used to do that and everyone of us was you know spraying water with this on his face and and one a young man next to him so so one of the brothers said okay you want to said you young people really are useless he said and mallah his body and everything and he said see look look look this is my son she she Breathless okay Subhan Allah yeah because people they walk on yes get on it brother if I may ask what do you do your in your spare time you're big sheh you're a big do you have any time for entertainment yeah I always it's a personal question though but I I couldn't help myself ask I know what the prophet remind us even yourself have right upon you you canot just do everything for people you forget about yourself you still have certain right now I always make time because time is Allah have G us one day one night to our calculation 24 hours is enough it's more than enough yeah so only we abuse time most of the time we abuse our time I always find time inah either in the morning or in the evening do some jogging mountain climbing you know then I go for my taii exercise and then I do for some weightlifting almost everything I get involved in you have time for da as well alhamdulillah that's da I always fix all my da program all my classes I make sure that you know it'll be ongoing but in the same time I always find time for my body I think it is only right for me to do that if I can say that I'm zom to my own body know I believe that this is the healthy you know when you understand Islam as a way of life not just but as a way of life then I believe that you know we will be very balanced and I I believe this does not contradict with because if you're doing it with the good intention it becomes by itself and I saw you last night in the gym Mah he's working out he's doing these stretches I thought I better stay away from she hin is doing putting one leg there and one leg there how he going to put them back again but Mah was he's quite fit I have to give that to him mallah but I one thing again what I do always you see Islam is a way of life now wherever I go I will grab the opportunity to do da what I do in my gym sometime I I mix with the people who are not yet Muslim I'll talk to them about Islam because some say I need to pray now find a corner and pray even I go to any gym in my country when I join any gym I said know I want to pray how do they have a room they said of course we don't have a room but do you have any place that is no that I can perform my prayer I'm a Muslim I'm not ashamed to tell them I'm Muslim alhamdulillah they start to learn and the people who know that I'm a Muslim now they start to ask question when I cycling you know they come alhamdulillah there are people that through through the gym contact we become they become Muslim alhamd but sometime there are certain art that is very dangerous that we forget selfdefense whether in s in the M kind of art also in Taw they coex most of the people they are not careful about the they call X that mean male and female may have free sping sometime and this is the kind of thing that Muslim must be be careful sometime we forgot we we tend to forget all the ruling after we join certain activity we thought that okay we join karate okay for the spirit of sports Spirit the spirit of sport but we forget that there is a do and do when the male and female is but a lot of people are not aware about that the Bowing and is very important for them to understand so we believe yeah inshallah if everybody like what the said if we know the Shar properly we have the foundation then inshallah we know how to move around the problem today majority of the Muslim who like to get involved in all this entertainment fun game they do not know no borders No Limits they want to play game they forget about the AA example some when say bodybuilding who do I I have a lot of friend who involve in bodybuilding I say alhamdulillah I'm Envy with your body the muscular and all but though when you go for competition you know bodybuilding bodybuilder competition what you wear you wear like a Superman you know no Superman had py ho they don't even we at Le Superman is better than you because Superman why we call him Superman why we call ourself normal man because Superman we under way outside you see yeah noral man underwear inside there the difference a good noral but this is something the people foret because under the name of spot oh they think is okay they wrong is like the woman going for fashion shows exposing the hour is a very very big problem people tend to think that it's okay if it's manto man it's okay to expose the thighs and they think if it's a woman to woman it's okay to show the cleaves the backs the thighs and the minus skirts and they don't know that this is and it's not even acceptable between the same sex so how about if it's mixed sex as as happens you're right so are there any other means of entertainment ald how do you spare spend your spare time well we have a swimming pool in our condo so I like to go swimming my main exercise is actually just walking and it just crossed my mind does entertainment necessarily have to be playing can't I find my entertainment in reading and uh doing some woodw and something useful or is it's only limited in playing sports and whatever yeah of course this is something that my daughter she's she really likes drawing so we've got her in a class where she does building pots out of clay she really enjoys do that U and my wife found this lady who does U like uh she paints boxes she does this like flower designs and stuff like that she does very nice work she doesn't teach uh children but for some reason she she let my daughter who was 10 years old attend her class for grown-up women and good she praised her work the teacher is a Malay lady so one of my wife's friends takes my daughter to CL and uh so the teacher when she did her first work she praised uh she spoke about her in Malay to the other at a lady so that she wouldn't get a puffed head you know but she felt it my my friend told my wife's friend told my wife you know this what she said about her so I mean these kind of things um I I mean I used to do art a lot when I was before I was a Muslim but it was all figurative drawing uh after Islam I used to still I used to do some kind of things with decorative boxes and things like that but I haven't had time for it for so long but it feels good when you when you are engaged in these things activities it relieves a lot of the stress definitely and it gives you more incentive to go on I mean this is something you know that I remember when I was in high school we used to have this uh one day a week they would have this u 2 hour hours in the afternoon 3 hours where you could just do anything you wanted free activity free activity and uh so I always used to go down to the pottery lab you know and they have this uh the spinning wheel you know play yeah and you know there's this whole concept of you know it's it's a kind of a meditation because you have to get the clay centered on the wheel if it's not centered the pot will not be look weird you know so that whole concept of centering you know it's a kind of a concentration you know I never got very good at it you know that figures I couldn't get centered what about extreme sports now we can talk about chests and billiards and these are soft things but what the hardcore what about like Benji jumping or parachuting or gliding or or racing Formula 1 racing these are entertaining but the risk risk factor is quite high so what do you think does Islam permits this or it depends on the pros and cons is you have to see and evaluate I believe that it is permissible because to do get kind of to get involved in that kind of activity you got to be prepared you got to have some kind of basic training one thing is good with this kind of sports like through sometime we also go for other kind of activities is to train our them to overcome fear this is important because a lot of people have phobia with oh hi oh there's no so we said no you must overcome of there is a training of again do not throw yourself of if you are not prepared then go for it it's very dangerous I don't think I'm going to ever be prepared to do this you know ATT tying my ankle to an elastic rope and then I'm see the ground is coming at 200 miles per hour it's going to it's going to stop it's going to stop it's a bang that's why all this kind thing not anybody can just participate not quite tied on I mean I've seen a a situation lots of see this is why it's dangerous and you have to evaluate does Islam permit this extreme or you can attack your fear face your fear in places that does not expose you to Danger parachuting is you know the risk is is minimum if you have the proper training and the proper equipment yeah but it's just like diving yes diving if you div in a scuba diving in a swimming pool is different than when diving with white sharks next to your barracudas or they said that the shark is not the a killer the human kill more shars than the Shar kill a human I tell that to the Chart when you meet it next time I don't think it goes well with them but I think we need to add something that uh for the when the about the martial arts so the I think the one should pick the the particular sport that suits the nature so sisters should have Pi something that will not affect their femininity I okay so things because your real s I'm talking to the sisters honestly your real asset is to remain feminine no cuz the husband doesn't want to have him you know his wife with muscles no he doesn't want that okay so except the muscle man I don't think so because I'm sure many of you have seen you know those who are because that is in in other places or non-muslims because they put that they fooled actually the the the woman and they put that seed yet you are equal to the man and you have to do whatever the man so they go for bodybuilding and all that stuff so she's not a woman anymore where where is that real and if if I may comment Where I Come From There is a very great misconception that women should not do Sports and this is wrong women must not do sports like men do yeah women must not undress and get dressed in places that are dubious you don't you're not sure if the people running stops a woman from losing fat from walking from playing table tennis from playing volleyball with other women in a secure and conservative place this is Islamic rather than letting them spend their time on the internet browsing pages that you and I know what's in it or go or spend six or seven hours on the phone or in in the marketplace just going round and round in circles let them do something to lose to loosen up some of the fat and the rate of fat obesity in in the Arab world where I come come from is humongous it's a lot so we should allow them to do something and we should provide them with the Islamic facilities the part and again our children face the same problem now my children usually tell me can we go this place like just mentioned said no why because there's mixing okay can we go to that place no why because the music and at the end of the the day can we stay home no why you didn't do your homework so you know they're stuck between a rock and a hard place and if we do not provide them with proper Alternatives we have a problem in our hands and this is why all the Muslim organizations the brothers and the sisters should collaborate and give proper Alternatives that would utilize their time intellectually and physically yeah but to say it's very easy to sit back you know and say this is Haram this is Haram this is Haram and then what then there's no one left or nothing left for them to do except to do Haram proper Haram you know I remember once I I attended Eid salot when I was in Us in U Hagerstown Maryland and uh there was a group of uh young high school students they were they attended the slot and they came from about 50 miles away they were in a boarding school in Pennsylvania and their school actually arranged they requested and the school accommodated them they they drove them down and uh so I asked one of them he was um from Ireland he was like from an Indian Pakistani background but from Dublin so I said you know teenagers usually they're not interested in these kind of things how come you people are so he said uh well when I was uh growing up the uh the Masid the Islamic Center Dublin they had a basketball court as part of the activ the uh the center and uh we just go down there and uh shoot ball and then when was time for prayer you know they'd call us in pray so their their hearts became accommodated to the Masid and making Salat and they Associated the with good times this is the way to treat the youth I know masjids where people come where I come from in Saudi Arabia with coming you get guys you know young traps coming on coming into the message with ponytail and with trousers you know low waist and know what's happening and they come in to pray to pray alhamdulillah and you find people from inside the mosque saying what are you doing here why you dressed like this get get out BR come this is so frustrating because the guy is coming to pray to Allah it's not your house it's not my house so let him pray let him feel at home and 3 four months down the road tell him it's proper to have a dress code like the Muslims in a nice way but to turn him off in this manner and this this Dublin mosque is an a clear example of how you can put the seed of the love of Islam in the hearts of the youth I I I I was with I was in London last few months for the uh camping or the B Camp then visit one the MOs mallah the MOS is equipped with a gy was so no happy to see you know that a moss and then the gym is just down and then up is the Moss this is something that we we miss actually in other other area but what the the most important thing I would like to remind and all the brother and sister who are active in any kind of activities outdoor activities or entertainment please make sure that whatever you do do not contradict the AA the first thing important there are certain activity may even destroy your certain selfdefense certain as in yoga sometime or not all yoga some yoga just for stretching breathing it's it's still okay but sometime they they go deeper they want you to focus in something something and then the same go to some melee Arts you know in Know Country some now they call it art of life or living or something like that yeah they have they have many many forms now and then they have this m kind of s sometime they reset a lot of thing to all the spirit and so on and this is the area they must know the limit it start with good exercise but it have a impact to the AA so make sure that you don't go against your and also don't go against the Shar that is been laid out by Allah and our Prophet inshallah you can carry on with all the other activities thank you for your time"
