  "transcript": "sister Khadijah Assa says that people don't pray a lot of people don't pray in India I may beg to differ because I've been to India so many times alhamdulillah and the Muslims there are very practicing I went to their masjids and I prayed jumas there and I was shocked to see the amount of Muslims attending masallah from early hours of the morning but like every country like every Community there are Muslims who are not practicing even Saudi Arabia even Mecca and Medina itself there are people who are so ignorant and uh deviant that they don't pray so those who do not pray if you advise them then you are doing the right thing and you have no problem in that you may tell the spouse that his or her uh spouse if he does not pray at all not a single Salat no matter how many times you try he refuses utterly to pray then the marriage is not valid anymore Khadijah from morania"
