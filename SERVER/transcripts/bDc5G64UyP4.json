  "transcript": "during uh prayer if something is going on with our life and we feel in need and you know and we contemplate on Fatiha and others car and Quran we read and we become emotional and cry not necessarily out of like fear or love love of Allah but like their realization that he's the only one who can resolve all these issues does this impact the validity of the prayer no this has no impact on the validity of your prayer your prayer is valid we have only one Allah to worship and he's the only one who can solve our problems so expressing your emotions while in prayer as long as this does not take you out of the form of the prayer then there's no problem in such weeping and Allah Knows Best"
