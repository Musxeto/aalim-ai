  "title": "Eat noodles in Chinese restaurant if not sure its haram/halal? (Cross contamination) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh my first question go to a restaurant is like an all you can eat restaurant but it's from Chinese people if we only for example eat noodles um are we allowed to like eat the noodles there if we're not sure whether they um cooked Haram food or not the norm is that we eat only halal food noodles is halal the problem is that Chinese restaurants they make a lot of their dishes based on pork and pork fat and pork oil they love pork and this is something totally unacceptable to the Muslims because pork is neis and everything derived from it is Haram for us to consume so if you live in Germany or in a western country if the beef or the food served to you we would say generally yes this is halal by default until proven otherwise if it's being served in a restaurant that serves both Haram and halal food here I would advise people to refrain from eating there why because because most likely there is food contamination there is cross contamination that is between utensils frying uh uh oil dishes uh forks spoons and knives when they are preparing food they're not going to change them to serve something Halal and something Haram differently they're going to use the same things and this would render your noodles NIS and Haram for you to consume"
