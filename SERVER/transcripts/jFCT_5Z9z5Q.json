  "transcript": "So, you kind of answered this, but I I'm still unsure. So, you know, um how should I handle uh questions about Islamic rulings from people who know who know less than me when I I I'm when I'm unqualified to answer. I I know some opinions, but I'm sure unsure if I should share them. So, because it's also hard to sometimes reach reliable scholars, and asking can sometimes lead to a lot of Fitna. So what how should I just leave them with their questions or what like is there a better approach? Either you know the answer yourself so you can confidently give it to them or you don't know the answer but you've researched it from a trusted website such as Islamqiway.info info and you give them the fatwa for them to read and follow or you're hesitant, you're not certain or you know the ruling but you don't have the evidence or the scholars who said it, you refrain. Don't give them any wrong information that may hold you liable to it on the day of judgment. So if you know something that is everybody's uh uh common sense, the ruling on stealing, killing, uh lying, you can say the ruling without any problem. If you don't, but you have the fatwa from islamqa.info, give them the fatwa or say to them, sheh so and so said so and so exactly that fits their question. But if you're hesitant or not sure, you don't say anything to them."
