  "transcript": "and chef my question is um is this permissible for me guys who are making street hour to give dawah to non-muslim women who are interested in asking about hope that they will be convinced about islam and convicts with inshallah this is an issue of dispute and it revolves around the pros and cons someone who's young not married full of youth and energy attempts to make such dawah we would say nope refrain the fitna is far greater someone who is flirtiest he's very humorous and he talks to nan mahram women and he cracks jokes and they laugh their heads off and he's having a good time they're having a good time though he's okay he's married maybe he is well protected yet the way that is being used is on islamic stay away someone who is a mature sheikh someone of knowledge who lowers his gaze and he has appropriate knowledge this is okay and permissible why do we have to segregate because everything in islam is judged by the conclusion and the consequences you don't judge something by the face value you have to see what will happen afterwards so people say that something happened here and something happened there we did this we did that no a group of mobs killed a woman in nigeria because she slandered the prophet salaam or depicted him or said something bad they're sinful isn't there law in the country isn't there a muslim judge a muslim ruler how can you take the law into your own hands you're all sinful yes yes but she was a disbeliever she was a non-muslim even though this is not a jungle so you judge things by the consequences not by the process itself and therefore if a person is likewise a woman says i'm in my hijab and i want to give sridhava to men i said whoa no this is not permissible because the way and the consequences are not in your favor nor in the favor of islam and islam doesn't need this so this is why you have to look and uh judge every situation by a case-by-case scenario"
