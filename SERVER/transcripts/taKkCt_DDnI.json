and welcome to lessons in fit as you know we're still studying the conditions of salat and we have mentioned few of them before so just as a reminder a brother Fatih can you give me one of the conditions of salat purity purity and we mean by purity both sides of it which means that we have to clean ourselves and remove the filth the impurities and we have to perform ablution or total bath to remove the sexual impurity or to remove the hadith if one has this state of impurity on him do you have anything else brother Mustafa facing the Qibla and we talked about thoroughly a few programs ago do you have a third one no covering out covering the aura and the aura are the area in your body that must not be seen by others Abu Malik do you have another condition of salat we didn't it deals with the times the Sun so which is times of prayer time of prayer so one of the conditions for a prayer that the time is due if you pray before it's due then your prayer is not acceptable we move on to hadith 168 hadith narrated by a bit Omar may Allah be pleased with him narrated by abnormal may Allah be pleased with them a Las messenger salallahu alaihe wasalam for forbade prayer at seven places a dump a slaughterhouse a graveyard the middle of the path a bathroom and were camels sit at a watering place and the top meaning roof of the Kaaba this hadith is not authentic so it is weak and that does not that does not necessarily mean that everything mentioned in it is wrong but it means that this it's not something that we should rely on whenever we say that it is not permissible to pray in this area now if we take it from the very beginning it says seven places a dump what's a dump Abu Malik it's a place where they throw you know trash and and junk and waste so it's like a junkyard where you put all the trash in and again there is no strong evidence supporting this so if a person is living close to or was stranded in a dump and he had to pray he must pray providing that he is sure or at least he is certain that there isn't any Rajasa and he cannot be certain that there isn't any Rajasa but what is most likely that there isn't any Energizer so you pray regardless you don't have to do any tests or go to any labs to ensure that the place you're praying in is not nachas because the rule of thumb is that everything in this world is pure is pure aspire so to prove otherwise you have to have evidence so if I'm gonna pray on and this is something that lots of people do whenever I go and visit people in their houses I usually ask for a permission to pray if I if I skip soon if I skip Salah because of one reads reason or the other and to my surprise people come to me and bring me a prayer mat you know the prayer mat and they say you can pray on this so I ask them why this why not pray on the floor the carpet the marble whatever they say well this is pure this is power we know it's starter we don't know about the rest so is what they're doing right or wrong Mostafa what they're doing is right or wrong when they give me their prayer mats well if it's that for the intention of of it being pure and the rest there's not period then this isn't correct because as long as there's no filth on the floor then so should you should be able to pray on it without having using the mat okay this means that there is no need for putting a prayer mat if even and this happens even if you are in doubt saying that I remember that one of my children you related somewhere but I don't know where so does this mean that the whole area is forbidden for us to pray on no as long as you're not certain then the whole area is considered to be fire and you don't have to go out of your way and put a prayer mat to pray so unfortunately we find this also in mosques see it shaitaan/satan comes to you in steps bit my bit so if he watches you allowing him to whisper in your ears and not to pray in your house except honor a prayer mat after six or seven months you will end up taking the prayer mat with you to the Masjid you see this in the message people putting prayer mats or people putting their hands handkerchiefs on the prostration position and when you ask them why are you doing this they say that well we're not sure we're not certain that the carpets in the mosques are clean are pure if they're not pure and clean in the marks in the message and mosques with where else can it be clean and how can you ensure that the prayer mat you're carrying with you has not been exposed to any filth or impurity one of your children did something and you did not notice or anything that could have happened so a blaze comes to a person and starts with stupor and make life really difficult for him I had a friend choose me I had a friend who was a really good Muslim and he used to sometimes deliver you know speeches and mosques and Masjid and something happened to him and the guy started to have these whispers of Satan and he listened to what he had to whisper so at the very beginning he used to pray in the masjid and after a while he started praying skipping prayer so when i visited him home and I asked him why do you skip prayers he said well I've noticed that whenever I pray in the masjid people on my left and right are coughing or sneezing I were moving you know when you're in prayer and the one next to you starts picking his nose or rubbing his body and some people get what we call a skin diseases that are related only to prayer they come only in prayer they get skin diseases in prayer when they're out not praying they're normal they're they're like us the minute they say Allahu Akbar they start to have this itching in their body and from the very beginning to the end of the salat you just find them jumping around you know just scratching and rubbing themselves like monkeys what are you either build ah this is an Islamic the minute they say Salaam alaikum o Allah it cools now this is Shaitaan so he said this this man that I don't have any submissiveness and kosher I cannot concentrate in my prayer but without with all this movement and also the air-conditioning sometimes it's too cold sometimes too hard also there there is the noise outside of the mosque you know people hoarding and doing this and that so I found out that whenever I pray in my home I feel more secure and I I benefit more from my prayer so I told them but this is not the sooner you are making a sin my not praying in the Masjid he said well I I don't know I had to figure it out and I thought that this is the best thing to do two or three months later the guy deteriorated and he became too obsessed to the extent that he does not pray and anywhere in his house there has to be a special room for his prayer and he prays in that room and I forgot to say the first thing it started with when he used to pray in the masjid he used to pray with his eyes shut throughout the whole prayer and when i told him that this is not the son that this is the doing of the jews and it's not allowed in islam to shut your eyes throughout the prayer because neither the prophet saw shall have nor his companions did it he said well this is the way I could get sure this is the way that I can concentrate more in my prayer and then he moved to praying in his house and then he became obsessed not to pray except in a particular room with no air-conditioning and it was at the very end of the house and six or seven months later he began to pray only when he turns the light off so he has to pray in complete darkness and it wasn't long before he completely abandoned Salah callously did not pray at all you're so obsessed that shaitaan over cut over Shaitaan overcame him and Hollis he did not pray until he died and this is a person and I know I know him personally he died not praying nice Allah and half here so one should not be obsessed of cleanliness or of the absence of noise or of this or of that as it is Una's lamech now you have here you have to pray in a dump nobody goes to a dump and to pray but if it happens then as long as you don't see evidence that there is impurity ajasa you may pray wherever you are the second place is the slaughter house and why is that slaughterhouse is like any other what is not permissible for you to pray on is when there is blood of animals being slaughtered because the blood coming out from the animals is considered to be nachas and there is no difference among scholars in this a de minimis for when it when it's pouring from a slaughtered animal then this means that this area is nudges and people would hear this and say you slaughter animals how barbaric well medicine proved that this is the best and easiest way to kill an animal they kill Adam some people can animals by hitting them on the head or electrifying them or doing this or doing that this is all an Islamic and unacceptable by slaughtering the animal you ensure in less than one or two seconds that the nervous system is cut and the animal does not feel anything and this has been proven and even if it's not proven this is our religion this is the way that the prophet saw us and taught us how to do it and the Jews slaughter the Christians slaughter the original Jews and Christians it's only recently like 50 or 70 years that the people came to kill animals in a different way not because it's more merciful but because it keeps the blood in the body of the animal so the weight instead of being a hundred pounds it becomes hundred and twenty pounds which means more money when you kill and sell it I believe that we have to break now so please stay tuned insha'Allah we'll be right back Medina beloved Prophet Muhammad SAW Salam and his companions faced lots of troubles and difficulties and enmities and apostle's in the way to Medina before the Hegira to Medina from Mecca also allah subhanaw taala has assistant his beloved prophet and supported him in order to complete his mission and to to emigrate to medina a loss vanity allah has granted us this great prophet and his companions now the question why the emigration to medina the hey jerusalem and his companions was a turning point in the history of hydra in the history of islam my dear brothers and sisters what are the sacrifice is that the prophethood Salam has faced with his companions some of these difficulties insha'Allah we will learn together and we will focus in some lessons what are the lessons that we take from these incidents insha'Allah and our program ruled to Medina my dear brothers a stay tuned with us insha'Allah and this great event of Hadera we will inshaallah focus on some of the lessons of in this program road to Medina may Allah make it easy for us and accept our good deeds and gather us with our beloved Prophet Muhammad assalam in Jannah and Oh salam aliekum wa rahamtullah and welcome back just before the break we talked about the seven things that were mentioned in the hadith though it's not authentic but we're just trying to go through them and see what's right and what's wrong and we talked about that a dump and a slaughterhouse and we move on to the third thing which is a graveyard and it is forbidden for us to pray in graveyards some scholars say that this is because when a dead person dies and his remains mix with the soil this makes the soil impure and edges and this is not authentic because his remains have been completely transformed into something that does not appear in the soil so it takes the verdict of soil but the reason why the Prophet SAW sallam told us not to pray in graveyards is that if you pray in graveyards there is a possibility that someday people will associate dead people with a la razón and instead of praying for Allah in a graveyard your you will pray for the dead people or for the dead person and this is apparent in lots of the Islamic country countries unfortunately where they pray and supplicate to the dead as we see them do that in lots of mosques and messages throughout the Islamic world this is of course is associating others with Allah and this is called shirk and inshallah we'll elaborate a little bit more after one hadith Hashanah the following hadith then it says the middle of the path and why do you think it's not recommended to pray in the middle of the path from stuff ah because people are passing by and which would cause either you to bother them in their way or them to bother you by passing in front of you in Salah and you have the whole world you only chose this place to pray and we're there in the middle of their path this is not recommendable but is it Haram is it forbidden no it's not so again the hadith is not authentic so we have to know which is right and which is wrong what follows Muhammad what's the fifth or sixth thing back bathroom now is this translation correct you remember we talked about it a couple of programs ago we said that the Prophet SAW son did not half bathrooms and what is meant by hammam is Fadi is the place where people gather together to take it's like a public bath sorry that is public bath with a bathe in the Romans used to do it in some Arab countries like in Tunisia Morocco Syria and so on they still have this I don't know if they have it in Egypt but I believe they used to have it like 3040 years ago I don't know if it exists or not usually people go there because they would not have the facility to bathe in their houses but now everybody has a bathroom and they everybody has a heater that that heats the water and mix everything cozy and nice so it's not recommendable to pray in public baths simply because there are so many would be exposed so looking at it being in such a place where probably there is pure impurities scattered everywhere water and that is not clean it's not a proper place for a Muslim to pray in and the following one was where camel were camels sit at a watering place now is this authentic is it a lot for us to pray in the barns or pins of camels nor the mean yet the place where the camels sit no no I think it's it's not what healthy it's it's not authentic it's a minute if the place is clean and pure we can pray that what do you think was tougher I think there was a previous hadith where we said that the Prophet Esaias Adam surveyed praying at the margins and pens of camels so it is authentic this part we're not allowed to pray in the pens or barns of camels in ways that Mustafa do you think the chemist out the droppings and the urine okay what about praying in the barns or pins of sheep Mustafa no the barns of sheep it's allowed that you pray so provided that there is no impurity but like where did you get this providing that there is no impurities just in general as there any other place where you should pray and there should no there shouldn't be any impurity okay a bomb addict I know that animals that are the meat you know we eat are their meat is there their droppings of that urinating is not ninjas you start it and that's exception for the camera a camera is a different case itself but the rest of them is hot do you think of what automatic is saying automatic is saying that it's a rule that the droppings and the urine of animals that we are allowed to eat their meat such as birds camels cows sheep and so on any animal or bird that we are allowed to eat their meat he's saying that their droppings their urine their dung is considered to be pure do you approve this no no paddy yeah I think so I think he's right yeah he thinks he's right well he is right the droppings of animals that we are allowed to eat their meat animals and birds is considered to be pure and there are so many hadith that back this up for example hadith and Loren I mean where the prophet saw Selim these people that came to Medina and fellow sick so the Prophet instructed them salah salem to go outside of medina where the camels are of the sadaqa of the charity and he instructed them to drink from their urine and their milk now this seems grosser drinking urine of of camels this is too much well it is a cure to a lot of diseases and this is medically proven but I don't advise you to do it to any disease see medicine tells you what form of diseases they can cure so they may be able to cure skin diseases they may be able to cure some diseases with that deals with fever or with with stomach pain but that doesn't mean they can cure diseases that deal with headaches or with bone related disease and so on so this it is a cure and medicine has proven this but even if medicine did not prove it as I said before we rely on only on the Quran and Sunnah as long as authentic we don't care if medicine provider approves it or not but it is it has been proven medically so it is for her to pray wherever you are in the minds of of sheep or of camels but in the case of camels you are not allowed to pray not because the ground is not pure or power because of something else that is why the prophets are salam when asked can we pray in the minds of sheep he said yes and immediately was asked afterwards can we pray in the barns of camels he said no so we have to follow it as it is and it has no justification that we know at the present time so we apply it as it is and finally it says it's forbidden to pray on top of the Kaaba on the roof of the camera and again this is not authentic now one would say who would go to the top on the roof of the car but who will go there regardless if somebody reached that place and went on top of the Kaaba either to do some maintenance or for whatever reason that is it possible for him to pray or not some scholars say no it's not possible and the reason because he would not be facing the kaabah but where will be he be facing and the same thing happens if a person prays inside the camera so the Prophet did this huh it's a sooner if you can get away and get into the Kaaba this can easily happen when they wash the Kaaba and they do this twice a year I think and if you know someone you could be lucky and get the chance to enter that Kaaba does it have any significance is it you know 1000 times more or better than any other prayers oh it does it's not the Prophet did that is a lot to say I'm some of the command is that it so it's part of the Sunnah and this is part of the center that we should all try to follow and why is that Imam Ahmed they've been hampered once performed capping he got a person to it tract blood from the back of his neck or shoulders this is called Hazama and he gave him one dinar which is a lot of money so those present said remember this is a lot of money why did you give this man so much he said because I have reported a hadith where the prophet alayhi salatu salam it was said that he performed cupping and he gave the man who did the cupping a dinar so I wanted to follow the Sunnah to that extent they follow the Sunnah so if a person prays inside the the Kaaba then again where will be he be facing which direction he he is inside the camera so it's it's understandable and likewise Islam is good for every time and place if you are on a spaceship and definitely you're not facing the Kaabah you may pray wherever you are so if you are on the top of a Kappa if you are in the on the roof of the camera you may pray if you wish and no one can say that well you have to come down and pray because you are in the car bus or whatever your face you're facing the right direction because as if you were inside the Kaaba wherever you face you're facing the right direction so to put it in a nutshell all what you have mentioned the hadith is weak yet there are things that are authentic and there are things that are not and we have to try and enforce the things that are not authentic by authentic hadith otherwise it's not accepted and it is rejected we have other issues but I think regarding this hadith I think this is all what we have and need and until we meet next time via Manila was Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
