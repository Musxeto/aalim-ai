  "title": "Leakage of urine during prayer Ocd Drops after istinja Opening private part to check Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay so a quick backstory uh for months I've been dealing with like uh leaking after urinating and Performing is ninja so I emailed you on Twitter and I followed your recommendation of 98 is not 100 so you should ignore it so yesterday I or two days ago I came up as I came late from uh came late home so I performed will do I got I prayed Salah I got in the fourth araga and I realized a leakage and I was like wait did I just leak and I check and there's like liquid at the like the tip of my private part but it did not exit yet so I don't I don't know if I should I didn't know if I should redo my will do go clean and come back and pray or I should continue so I went to go clean myself I came back I yeah I may will do I came back and I realized I only have four minutes left of Salah so I made sure to pray to our guests before Margaret came in so I can still be praying on time and after I got up from two rockets I realized I had the same feeling again so I don't know what to do as I don't know if that's uh dropping because I did I did use the bathroom when I when I read them I would do so I can ensure that everything comes out so I don't know if that was uh urine or that was my in istan gel water which uh I pour a lot so I can clear myself from the west west so I didn't know what to do I checked after the Salah and the same thing was there but I was like okay this water may be from istanja so I'm going to continue I'm going to continue with my Salas for the rest of the day and not worry about it did I do the correct thing the whole process that you have done was totally wrong from the very beginning if I were to see shaytan unfortunately I can't see because Allah told us in the Quran that we cannot see him but if I were to see him I would definitely see him with a big smile on his face doing this and telling you my dog you're the man you're making shaytan extremely happy and by doing that you're making Allah angry because what you're doing is not from Islam where have you ever read that the prophet is or his companions or the tabirin or the Tiberian tabirin would ever have these intrusive thoughts and overthinking and going to the extreme to open the tip of their private parts and check in and maybe bring a microscope or a magnifying glass and probably take lab tests what is this if someone asks you is this Islam any person would say no this has nothing to related to Islam Islam is a religion of Simplicity of peace and tranquility it is good for a rocket scientist and a a a physician and an engineer as well as a shepherd and a farmer and a janitor or a Layman it's it fits them all no one suffers like this except those who open the door for Satan to come in and mess up with their head so in the beginning when you got the feeling that something was leaking ignored it to go to the toilet and open the tip of your private part and look inside this is unheard of and definitely it's an innovation it's something that is sinful upon you the urine in the private part is like the milk in the breast of a suckling woman if you leave it it stays in if you squeeze it it comes out this is why we say when you urinate you overwhelm your private part with water and sprinkle some of the water on your the inside of your underwear so whenever you get these intrusive feelings tell yourself that this is the water from Essentia and never ever do this again unless you want to get yourself suffering from infection nobody opens the tip of the private part like what you're doing in Allah make things easy for all of us"
