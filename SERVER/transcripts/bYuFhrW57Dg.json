  "transcript": "ail or ail and he's saying that he lives in a hostel in an inn or in a hotel and the Masjid is quite far from his place so he prays fer in his room but F fer starts at 4:30 and he tends to sleep and prays at 5:30 while sun rises at 5:50 so he prays 20 minutes before Sun rise so is this permissible or not first of all it is not mandatory for you to pray in the Masjid if you are away from the Masjid to the extent that if you were in normal conditions no concrete buildings no air conditionings no car noises if in normal conditions a man comes up on top of the roof of the Masjid and starts to shout the aan the distance that his voice would reach within this vicinity you are obliged to attend the prayer in the Masjid usually this is approximately in a circle of a diameter of 3 to 5 kilometers so if you are this far you have to attend the prayer if you're further than this then you can pray in your home the usage of loudspeakers does not affect the situation meaning that if I live 10 kilomet away from the Masjid but they use big loud speakers and the aan reaches me am I obliged to go and pray the message the the answer is no because this was not at the time of the Prophet Alam so what the voice of a normal person without using mics or loud speakers the distance that it travels this is the legitimate distance if you are in the vicinity of such a distance you must attend the prayer second of all uh second of all or the second point is that postponing the prayer until it's just about F or just about sunrise this is not permissible though your prayer is valid but the prophet alai warned us and told us that this is the prayer of a hypocrite who Waits and anticipates until the sun is just about to set he prays like uh a hen or or whatever just doing prostration and R in a very fast motion and manner likewise those who wait until uh the sun is about to rise and pray F deliberately this is not recommended nevertheless the five 50 is for the sun to have completed its Rising which means that it started Rising like 10 or 15 minutes ago therefore the minute the tip of the sun rises this is a no time for praying feras your fuder is gone and you're sinful by doing this therefore you shouldn't take your time and enjoy sleeping until it's 10 or 15 minutes before Sunrise as this is a very uh Danger"
