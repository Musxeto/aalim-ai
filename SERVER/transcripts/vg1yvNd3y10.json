  "transcript": "Someone has died four years ago. We were committed for one year and one month but before his death we broke up. What can I do for him now? I visit his grave every day. Will he face any hardships? He used to be he used to take alcohol maybe did some stuff but he was he crashed by a truck. Will he go to Jenna? How can I pray for him? How can I pray for our sins to be forgiven? First of all, she was not married to him. So she was involved in a haram relationship with him. Therefore, instead of visiting his grave, which is not permissible at all, women are not allowed to go to visit graves. And this is the most authentic opinion of scholars. Instead of visiting his grave, she should stay home, ask Allah to forgive her sins and to pardon her over what she had done and to express remorse. Secondly, him being indulged in intoxicants and haram. I don't know if he prayed or not. If he did not pray at all, he's not a Muslim. But if he prayed on and off, he's a Muslim. But he's definitely was a bad Muslim for the sins he committed which are major sins. These are not easygoing sins like you know uh smoking or uh playing cards or No, this guy was involved in haram major haram uh sins. Is he forgiven? Will Allah forgive him? This is in Allah's hands. Nobody could say that he's in hell. No, nobody can say he's in paradise. We ask Allah to forgive him and to forgive our sins and to forgive the sins of everybody who's watching this. But at the end of the day, his fate is in Allah's hands. Should we be worried? Should we be careful and caring for? No. There are billions of people like him. He has met his fate. Now for us, we should focus on ourselves showing remorse, asking Allah for forgiveness and trying to excel to be people that Allah loves and forgives and Allah knows best."
