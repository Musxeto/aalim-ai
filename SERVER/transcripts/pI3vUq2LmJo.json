  "transcript": "Mostafa says we have a female garment shop can we display the clothes on female mannequins or does it come under the prohibition of statues of course in Islam it is totally prohibited to make statues the Prophet said alehissalaam was Salam to Hadi this is what Allah narrates Abu Hajj al D says and he's at a barre he said Ali told me shall I send you as the Prophet had sent me allah√≠s alot was salam he sent me and told me do not leave a statue without breaking it and do not leave a high elevated grave without living levelling it with the ground so the instruction in islam is not to have any statues this is prohibited in Islam there is statues of living creatures men animals fish birds etc however there is an authentic hadith where the prophet alayhi salat wa salam had an appointment with gibreel peace be upon him and the angel jibreel was late so the Prophet came out of his house only to find gibreel waiting outside so he said jibley why didn't you come in and you bring peace be upon him said we the angels do not enter a house where there is a statue or a portrait or a dog so older the statute to be decapitated remove the head and then it becomes like a tree no head no life an order the portrait to be painted over and ordered the puppy the dog of al-hassan which was under the bed to be taken out and taken out of the house now scholars say that it is permissible to have a mannequin without a head providing it does not provoke lust and desire so a normal body with a t-shirt with a skirt with trousers is okay but when you have a sexy body or you have a bikini on a decapitated mannequin this may provoke any sort of lust and desire of such figure such perfect measurements and curves and this is not permissible because in Islam we tend to keep things safe and we tend to keep boys and girls away from means of fitna and of tribulation that might be caused by such things and Elijah knows best you"
