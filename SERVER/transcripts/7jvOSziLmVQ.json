  "transcript": "uh shik in my university's prayer room women would sometimes open the windows while others are praying and due to fear of being seen by non-maharams from the next building I prayed all the time wearing nikab and hand gloves but unfortunately my hand gloves aren't that thick and skin can be seen up close so do I need to repeat these prayers no there is no need to repeat the prayer because the prayer is valid Even if men see you while your face and your hands from the wrist and uh uh onwards are visible. Yes, this is not permissible but the prayer is valid because the other areas of your body is has been uh properly covered. So there is no need to repeat your prayer."
