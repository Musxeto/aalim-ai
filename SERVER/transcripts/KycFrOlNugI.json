  "transcript": "Junaid says can we keep the model of Kaaba at home and is it permissible to hang it or use the Kaaba design as a wallpaper wallpaper is something that was disliked and some scholars even prohibited because they considered that covering the walls with cloth would imitate the Kaaba but it is most likely not Haram but it is not recommended having a structure of the Kaaba in the house a lot of the scholars said that this is not permissible because it can be disrespected humiliated and maybe someone would think of it as they do in some schools they build a structure similar to the Kaaba and they make Tawaf to train the people how to do Ambra which is also not permissible and Allah knows best"
