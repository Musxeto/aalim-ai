  "transcript": "Samantha raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wash la ilaha illallah WA ash hadu ana muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh solo Marathi he was the wasabi permanente de bahía de weston visuality he et al madina amar assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh the book we're about to study chapters of is as agreed upon all scholars of Islam the most authentic book after guitar Allah the Quran therefore when we study Sahih al-bukhari we are actually learning our Deen from the most authentic source after the Quran now usually we would introduce who is Muhammad a businessman al bukhari and what is his sahi the book al jamia so he what is it but I think that this is irrelevant because everyone knows what sorry hello Harry is and what caliber is al imam hamid even with my elbow hiding therefore the so he is compiled of 73 chapters if i'm not mistaken beginning with github middle way ending with github at OU heat and it is sufficient for you to know that one of the great scholars of ash a fairy mother an imam in hajj or took about 20 years to write his book federal merry shall sahih al-bukhari 20 years if you take this as a project of a lifetime it would not be underestimated because what is 20 years in life yet 780 centuries after his death we're still benefiting from his book so to come today in an attempt to study two of the seventy three chapters in less than total of 10 hours is and in not that worthy of giving the book it's level and appreciation but in nowadays times it is difficult to devote more than that especially in your professional life so we would like to utilize it to the best of our abilities the book that you have is more personal it is not the full-fledged book of albahari because Ali Mahmoud Buhari may Allah have mercy on his soul he was a mo hadith meaning that he had the knowledge of the sciences of hadith and he memorized all variations of hadith and he knew everything that went into the chain of narrators lives so he knows who Azeri is or Sophia Nina or an Amish or heirship every single one he knew them and you whether they're worthy of being part of the chain of narrators or not so he was a Moorhead he knew everything about hadith but like the scholars of his time he was also a fatty so he had his own understanding of jurisprudence and felt and this is why the scholars say fit whole Imam will Buhari feet are ah Jimmy he the fit of Buhari in sahih al-bukhari you don't find him saying this or that do you you go through the Sahay it's all a hadith of the Prophet as yourself okay where is his fib where is his understanding the understanding is in the titles of the chapters we are reading now this is where he puts his fib in few words in a sentence or less so when we go and try to study it we find that Alabama Bihar in his sorry used one single hadith in 10 15 maybe 20 different chapters and this is why one gets confused he remembers that there is a hadith for example of animal Armour O'Banion so he finds us in hell he finds this this in somewhere else in marriage and so on the why is he repeating the same hadith because one single hadith can be used in different chapters for example an imam is someone shooting me so i will know where to move an imam muhammad al-idrisi Shafi went once and spent the night at imam muhammad IBN baz house and at morning time the maid said to MMA but is this the man you claim that he's a great Imam he said yes why she said he is not a good Imam I left water for him to make boodle for night prayer and I came at Pfizer time and he did not use the water mint which meant that he did not perform pay I'm Elaine so he smiled he prayed for while going back with Imam Shafi he told him about what the maid said and in our Chevy indeed said yes I did not pray night prayer o you Rema he said I spent the whole night thinking about the hadith sahih al-bukhari when the Prophet said re salatu salam to a young brother of an assembly malik yeah a borough my mother farrell a new hire he was a four year old child and he had a bird in a cage and the bird died so he said to him yeah about a mile his nick naming the child about remain as if he has a child by the name of a male what did the bird do so he said I spent the whole night thinking about this hadith and I got only 80 points benefitted from these four words what kind of a scholar would come with 80 points from such a statement one the permissibility of giving nicknames to people who do not have children to nicknaming the children 3 the permissibility of keeping birds and subsequently hunting in medina unlike matka it is prohibited to hunt in makkah which means that being a harem vodka does not mean the same rulings because you can hunt in Medina where while you cannot hunt in Mecca for the permissibility of caping live animals in a cage and this would not be considered as torture five dying in a cage without any shortcomings of yours is not sinful because this is from Allah unlike the cat that was gift at the woman's house until she died Allah admitted her to hell because that was sin and he went on listing 80 points from this hadith therefore the scholars used to do this they would not simply come to a hadith learn what it means the interpretation of words and move on they would try to milk that hadith for every single bit of information that would benefit them into getting into Jannah this is Reina Ellen is not only to know because if realm was to know shapen would be the biggest scholar wouldn't he the beliefs was with the Angels not from the Angels Allah stated clearly a lot of the Muslims have confusion a bliss was not from the Angels he was from the jinn but he was upgraded to a level where he was with the angels and was commanded to prostrate to Adam but he refused would anyone accuse you of not knowing maybe he was negligent maybe he was absent-minded he knew therefore knowledge is to understand it from all types and directions and to implement it in our lives so we have two chapters to study one quite long which is kita boleh le man your organizer you should not speak it's telescope ha kita boil a man and then we have a short chapter which is cat abode erotism being short does not mean it is of lesser significance but this is the hadith in it and I pray to Allah that we benefit from this course in a sense that we get closer to Allah that we increase our knowledge and that we implement this knowledge in our lives okay who will read further [Music] before chapter 1 does it say in the book something book of belief we would like to begin with this issue book of belief in Arabic it's called kita bull eman so as an introduction what do we know about Iman Iman as in the famous hadith of Jabril we know that when gibreel came to the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam he asked him about few things what is Islam what is he man where is he son and then he asked him about the hour at the conclusion prophet said Alice autosum had Jibril atacó you're a limo come amaura Dina come he came to teach you matters of your Deen so Eman is part of our deal however when we talk about the seventy plus branches of Eman or 60 plus hadith authentic and another hadith ending when we speak about the Ummah being divided into 73 sects all of them are in Hell except one and insha'Allah we are among this one where is the fault when we talk about 72 being in hell it is in the definition the understanding the implementation of Eman therefore it is very important to understand what a man is the classifications of it and how it is understood by other sects where did they go wrong now this would be applicable if we were talking about a course in Athena then yes this would be relative but now we are talking about in general chapter of a man dealing with the hadith in Mosul as the Reedy of so hey hey remember Buhari so the book of belief what do we mean by belief linguistically belief means in Arabic and a man is to believe believe is the belief so Shakalaka boom this was very difficult allah azza wajal says women and to be meaning lana one of Qunu saw the appeal the brothers of Yusuf when they came they said to him that you will not believe in what we're saying even if we were truthful so in linguistic belief how a man means to believe in technical terms in terms related to a peda a man has two meanings one meaning is the whole of religion which includes Islam a man acts and acts of the heart acts of the tongue acts of the organs all of this is included in Eman this is one part of it and Imam Shafi reported the consensus of all scholars that Eman belief of the heart and the speech of the tongue and the actions of the whole body it's a full package it's not only the actions of the heart allah azza wajal when he addresses the believers in the quran does he only addresses those who believe in their hearts or the whole muslims allah who only you will move meaning allah azzawajal is the ally of the believers believers in the sense of Eman or the sense of Islam Eman a son and everything that they do the Prophet when he said alehissalaam Salam and Jenna would not be entered except by a believing soul was the Prophet telling us that even the Muslims will not enter it only they're believing so all or he was mentioning a general description this is the description or the general description where Eman refers to what it refers to Islam as a whole it refers to the whole religion so it's not a branch of Islam it is Islam itself allah azzawajal says in the beginning of the quran surat al-baqara when he talks about the muttaqun that they pray and they believe in the unseen in cetera et cetera et cetera now there are people or sects for example Albertus allah and those who go their way like in rwanda they say that a man is only to believe so under this definition even the Jews are considered to be move meaning because they believe also germen Safwan and the jamia are those who dismantle and they say that Allah has no safe at so Allah does not have a hearing ability or attribute he does not see allah azzawajal does not speak Jamia they dismantle all of these attributes so they say that Eman is knowledge and this is nonsense to acknowledge that there is Allah every single Kafur acknowledges that there is allah even the atheists but they do not say it so this cannot be a man more Jia they said that you have to admit with your tongue that you're a believer this is sufficient so again without doing good deeds this would mean that even the hypocrites who used to pray with the Muslims who used to claim that the Prophet is a prophet of Allah can fall under the category of Eman and so on I had a son at iwo jima disagree with all of that they say that a man is to believe with your heart and to acknowledge this verbally and that you have to act upon it yet acting upon it is not a condition in accepting it because if it was a condition then the Huaraz would come and say if you do not act upon it in your a kafir and we would share this with them no we acknowledge that acting is needed but it is not a condition in making it complete or making it let me rephrase that in making it valid meaning if you don't have action it's not valid and if you have actions it's valid no it is needed there is required in this part of al-eman the second definition of Eman is when it is associated with something else the first definition is when a man is used alone so it refers to Deen we've gone through that the second way of using Eman is when it is associated with something else as in the case of Islam so when remark hadith may Allah be pleased with him when real as what is Islam we will have these five issues now what is he man we will have the six pillars of Eman now they're used together then what is it what what is the meaning when they use together they differ alpha tier but there's alpha Tara mean for pay poor huh miss keen needy when they separate they all mean the same he is 14 he is miss Kean this the same thing when they are together each one has a specific meaning Soph appear who has not who does not have enough at all maybe he has lunch but not dinner miss Kean is someone who's better he has dinner he has lunch she has home to live in but he doesn't have sufficient funding to make give him a normal life so a fatir may not have dinner and miss Kean is somewhat is better men may not have rent to pay but he has a house may not have money to go for medication but it's kids go to school so this is the difference and there are so many things in Sharia in the Quran when they are joined each one has a different meaning and when they're separated they're okay such as Islam and EEMA when we say al Islam generally without mentioning a man it is included in it and when we say a man without mentioning Islam Islam is embedded in it but when we say al Islam one Eman we come to a difference Allah says in surah - surat chapter 49 a little roh man Paul let me know what I do polo Aslam not okay then there is a difference because they are used together but throughout the Quran in alladhina amanu one little sorry hat which means that when they are together Islam and Amman Islam means that actions that are apparent Allahu Alem what's in your heart while Iman means the beliefs that are hidden so when we come to the pillars of Islam the Shahada then we have prayer fasting zakat Hajj you can see all of that with your own eyes but when we come to Eman and to Mirabella where you will ask him what Mara a Kuwaiti tab when the be 8 well etc so these are all hidden things you get my point to a layer asleep anyone who has confusion when alone it all means even Islam Eman a religion when combined Islam refers to the actions that are apparent we can see like solid zakat cm while Eman refers to the hidden beliefs and actions mainly of the heart so this is in a nutshell an introduction to the book which is Kate Abu Ali man we begin with the first hadith [Music] [Music] hadith narrated by eben Ranmaru may Allah be pleased with him he's Abdullah even though mark M not haha one of the great companions of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and one of the great pioneers and scholars of medea along with zenith abbot who all what we have of knowledge from medina comes from them - now this hadith and imam al bukhari reported it in islam is based on five principles one would argue if we are de studying the book of Eman why does he bring this hadith what would be the answer I just spent 10 minutes describing and explaining because Eman when used alone it includes Islam which is the Deen and this is why he is bringing you the definition of Islam in the book of Eman because this is part of Eman and the hadith mentions the five pillars of Islam the first pillar that Islam is based upon is the Shahada but I think that it would be appropriate to read the hadith in Arabic as well because so many times translation fails or the translator puts some info into it or takes some info out of it so that he would make it easy for you so he thinks do you have the Arabic okay I live near Rome about the allahu anhu my pod pod maybe salallahu re who are you selling them Boni and Islam or other Homs Islam was built here he says Islam is based so I'm translating from my head Islam is built so allah azzawajal or the prophets Allah Allah is giving us the example as if Islam is a foundation or a building so the building of Islam is based on these five pillars now one would claim and say hulless if I do these five pillars its sufficient no you can live in a house on the structure of a house but you need paint you need windows you need doors you need air conditioning you need plumbing etc so these are the foundations of Islam which are one the greatest of all pillars a Shahada the testimony shahadat la ilaha illallah muhammadan rasulullah what yama saw that were ETA is the cat well was o muhammad on here we find that hedge and some Roma Bahn in other narrations replaced so the fourth is fasting and the fifth is Hajj here it's the other way around the order does not give any much significance narrators narrated it this way and that way it's the same thing now when we come to Islam what does Islam means submission it comes from the word Pease as some would like to say Islam has two meanings one a general meaning in dinner in the law Islam verily the religion between brackets accepted by Allah is Islam which means that the religion of all messengers and prophets of Allah was what was Islam this is the general meaning of Islam there is submitting your will to allah azza wajal the angels are muslims yes or no Allah ordered them to bow to Adam they submitted their will and they bound are they mushrik for doing this this is submission Allah tells you to bow you bow Allah tells you don't bow you don't bow so this is the general meaning of Islam Ibrahim Allah tells him your fourteen year old child take him down and slaughter him what did he say yes o Lord and he did that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam is one of so many prophets and messengers and the common denominator of them all that they submitted their will to allah worshipping only allah this is islam then we have the other meaning of islam which is a specific meaning and that is the religion given to the prophet muhammad salallahu alaihe wasalam through the divine revelation of the Quran and this is different than the other is that in Islam the religion of Allah which is our religion we have 5 daily we first rama bond we give zakat we perform Hajj can anyone say that this type of Islam was done by Moses by Musa was it his religion no religion of risa no they had their own law the main principle which is submission they all shared it they all submitted their will to Allah they obeyed Allah whatever Allah revealed they followed so they're all Muslims which means every single prophet and messenger are Muslims from Adam till the Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu was-salam in the first definition but by the second meaning of Islam which is the five daily prayers the Quran the hadith the Sunnah this is only for the ummah of muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam are you with me alhamdulillah okay what is the first [Music] in Arabic shahadat to testify but it is one not to testimony one but here he mentioned two to testify that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that his muhammad is his servant and messenger salallahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam so why did he make them into one and not two simply because one includes both when you say I read Paul who Allah who I had in salat do you mean only this verse or do you refer to the whole surah you refer to the whole surah so the arabs usually use a lot of abbreviations so instead of saying i read called oh allah had a lump sum of the middle o Khufu and i had they were said they say I read pulled o Allah likewise I said the Shahada one says one or two I said the Shahada so the issue I said the shahada team so there's no reason for that one is by default included with the other so what does this Shahada mean first of all the first part of the Shahada Shahada tutto he the greatest phrase ever said by a human being there is nothing greater than ash-hadu anla ilaha illaallah but here this Shahada is divided into two sentences or phrases one is a negation a shadow Allah Allah I confirm and testify that there is no God Oh Marshall are you an atheist yes he wait until I finish well you're the one who said it and this is a problem when we do toe off in harem we hear the people they give him money to say that as a car for them so he lives in LA and this is they're all saying there is no God and they repeat there's no God and then he says in la-la affirmative except Allah it is not recommended at all to separate them but sometimes unfortunately when we have new reverts wanting to say the Shahada you tell him ash hadu an la ilaha illaallah he cannot say it it's too difficult so you have to break it down tombs ash hadu is as hadoop a la ilaha illallah haha you repeat it once twice until he says it well then in Allah Allah is very easy then you explain to him that it is that there is no God worthy the word worthy is not found in the Arabic so why do we say it because if I say it as follows there's no God worshipped other than Allah there is no God worship other than Allah is this true people would say no Buddha is worshipped other than Allah the idols are worshipped other than Allah so how do you say there are there is no God worship other than Allah so many gods we have but when you insert the word worthy only allah azza wajal is worthy of being worshipped so this is needed to insert so it would give it a better meaning there is no God in Arabic we know this and this is why the Arabs when the Prophet came to them and said to them Ali Saleh to some say ilaha ilallah and the whole of arabia will follow you you will lead them you will own them they refused because they knew that the implication of saying la ilaha ilallah that we do not worship our God's we do not follow our whims and desires we do not have legislation other than what Allah has revealed this is too much for us so they refused so the first part of the testimony to negate there is no God and the second part is to confirm except Allah Allah who is worthy of being worshipped and this means that anyone who associates other with allah azza wajal cannot be considered to be muslim at all he will not be accepted allah azzawajal says walaqad athena frequently Amaterasu near a Buddha la virge tani would pollute and we certainly sent into every nation a messenger saying worship allah and avoid pahud confirmation and negation and allah azza wajal says so whoever disbelieves in pahud and believes in allah has grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam highlights the importance of Shahada to toe hit la ilaha illallah it's a statement that we rarely say it except in salat we do not say it in our daily routine frequently but we should the Prophet said la sala dozerman kana Uhuru Kalama him in a duniya ilaha illallah dahil agenda whoever last words of this dunya before he dies is la ilaha illallah he would enter jannah and this is why whenever someone is on his dying bed we try our level best to what to make him say the shahada now if someone is on his dying bed how frequently should I tell him to say like in a hail a lot every minute 5 minutes or 15 what do you think hello every every one minute once and Hollis I leave the Sunnah is to tell him say la ilaha illallah if he says it leave him unless he says something else get me some water please you get him the water is saying la ilaha illallah and you do not directly say that to him you do not say uncle say la ilaha Lama because this would be a little bit aggressive some of the people on the dyeing beds would become defiant arrogant and said I don't want to see so what do you say you say it on your own here is the water it's a nice weather hey la la he immediately would say it anyone in front of you say light Li you will automatically repeat it but when you say it directly say la ilaha illallah and you start shaking him say la ilaha illa llah this is not the way of doing it there is an etiquette for that [Music]"
