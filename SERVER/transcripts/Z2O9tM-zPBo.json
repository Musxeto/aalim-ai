  "transcript": "so we move on to session six and this is of alquran this is the most difficult section to all people who compiled in this science not to me therefore I would not go into details because I do not have knowledge it's it's very simple one of the greatest compilers of and whoever knows when you hear the name ja people say okay he's the master of all Masters in he said that I pondered for 30 years on the meaning of and then I think I reach I think I reach what can be accepted it is a very difficult subject to tackle but I will give you guidelines inshallah with the grace of Allah that might make you on the straight path without going left and right first of all what is the meaning of in Arabic letter so we have which is the alphabets Al T these are each one is and also there is another linguistic meaning for which is Edge Edge among them are those who worship Allah on the edge so if Allah gives them we're happy Allah you're okay and if Allah deprives them they start having doubts is Allah the is Allah the provider is is is so another meaning of is Edge and also it can mean type or W so there are a number of when we come to the meaning ofran this we understand only from the Sunnah is it mentioned in the Quran no is it mentioned in the Sunnah yes what is it mentioned how is it mentioned in the Sunnah we will get to see couple of hadiths and there are a number of had stating that the Quran was revealed on and we will come to this inshallah and these were only revealed in Medina so in mecah it was only one har and what is the meaning of har the most authentic opinion and explanation is that har means dialect there are other interpretations of har in the of Quran by Scholars it reached 40 interpretations four zero this man says it's dialect this man says it's languages this man says it's Halal Haram promise punishment so on so this man says differently four zero opinions different opinions of Scholars and this illustrates to you if the Muslims are dividing into 40 different opinions on this subject then it is not an easy thing to discuss so there are guidelines that you have to believe and know in order for you to be able to understand this inshallah first of all there are seven in number not more not less what's so special about this it's very easy some Scholars say that seven is not intended and when we say seven in Arabic they mean to multiply so when I say yeah I came seven times to your house do you mean 1 2 3 4 5 6 7even no it means that from one to 9 and if I say I called you 70 times which means from 10 to 99 and that is why Allah says in the Quran this uh uh Ayah was revealed when the prophet asked for forgiveness for abdah and he was the head of the Hypocrites and the Omar said prophet of Allah how do you seek forgiveness for this hypocrite you know it I know it and the prophet only judges by appearances he does not go into the people's hearts and that is why when KH told him about a man from the let me chop his head off why because he stood up in the crowd when a prophet was brought by a piece of gold and he distributed it between four of the newly Muslims H and all of them were enemies of Islam but he just accepted Islam so he gave it to them so that they could he could you know attract them more to Islam one of the and he's the leader of the stood up and said Muhammad be fair this division is not fair and you did not intend Allah's face with it this is something outrageous the prophet got so angry and said if Allah trusts me on Earth those this or who he he is in the heavens trust me on Earth who would be fair if I'm not fair so KH immediately the sword of Allah took his sword and said just give me the word and I'll chop his head off the prophet said people would not speak or talk that Muhammad kills his companions I cannot do this I can allow this and in another narrations maybe he prays KH said a lot of people pray and do bad things he said being a person who pray this makes his blood Haram for us uh in short the prophet sallallah alai what saying ah yes and om said you how do you ask for forgiveness for this hypocrite so Allah revealed this verse ask Allah for forgiveness or don't ask Allah for forgiveness if you ask Allah for forgiveness 70 times Allah will not forgive them what did the prophet sayam had I known that Allah would forgive him if I asked him for 71 I would have so Allah said 70 which means that if you ask for 71 logically it should be accepted from this we learn that the Arabs used to use the number 70 to exaggerate so when they say 70 times this means that are so many than 17 that is why some of the scholars said that seven are not intended they are more than that but the majority say no they are limited to seven not six and not eight why because the Hadith when jel revealed the Quran to the prophet in Medina he supplicated to Allah and said oh Allah this is difficult for my people add me one more har and Allah added a a third and the prophet Prophet is asking for more a fourth until he gave him seven and we will come inshallah to explain this so they are seven not less and not more this is understood inshallah and they are all from Allah why do we say that they are all from Allah because there are Scholars that said these are linguistic so they ch change according to the people of Arabs according to the tribes they're not from Allah ald it was revealed one but the Arabs manipulate it some say ald or differently or so on so this is according to their dialects and this is not true these are from the Quran and they are from Allah clear inah like we move on now we are walking in a mine field so we have to be careful then we do not step on a mine and it explodes it was revealed to make it easier to recite and memorize where do we get this from from the Hadith the prophet asked Allah to make it easier for his followers for his um and that is why he's asking to increase in the number of and this brings us to the interpretation of which is dialects so some find it easy to say others find it easy to say some can say and others say and the lamb the L either or and so on thirdly the difference in recitation and not in meaning so the meaning is one we cannot have har saying left and another har saying right because this is different if it had it been from other than Allah they would have had a lot of differences in it but it is from Allah so it cannot have a lot of differences what is this difference initation and not in meaning Authority this is something uh from the people who arranged it the hadiths on are and Beyond doubt so no one could say the issue of is not clear I don't believe it is from the Sunnah and I would reject it no it is not it is not M it is it is overwhelming so there is no way for us to reject it so we have to believe in the existence of of the seven now understanding how it is materialized this is inshallah what we will try to do we also have to believe firmly that the Quran is preserved by Allah why do we say this because if you get any doubt throughout this session saying that this is is strange you know I cannot understand how this happens and how this is recited and how this is written I believe that the Quran is unchanged it is unchanged yes but you saying different dialects someone recites it different to what I recited the meaning is the same what is different I don't know Tam so I cannot give you an example but in Arabic we say na other one says in the Eastern Province they say p and it's the same thing if I go to Morocco I would not understand their language they speaking Arabic and if they come to Saudi Arabia they will not understand our Arabic so it's a different dialect so you have to understand the seven are from Allah and Allah has preserved the Quran so don't have doubts over this okay the interpretations as mentioned reach 40 different opinions and the reason behind that is that there is not a single explanation clarification clear narration from the prophet Alam or from his companions or from the s def defining these so how can we explain it we can't the only way to explain it is to make isad personal reasoning and to go to the different narrations of the Hadith and to see the different and try to come up with a conclusion and that is why we have 40 different opinions but having said that this led some of the scholars to call the and this we will come to discuss later on there is and there is Allah clear CLE and unclear Allah mentioned this in now you have to explain this in English I don't have internet otherwise I would have written it uh mainly Allah revealed the Quran to the prophet among these verses that were revealed are they were made clear and perfect and also there are unclear verses and wordings that cannot be understood except by Allah and those who are firm on knowledge and the reciters differ whether to stop except by Allah so only Allah knows the meaning of them or by Allah and those who are firm in knowledge and I'll give you example though although this is speaking before the time of this uh chapter when you talk about something that everybody understands so when I say be kind to your neighbor nobody doubts what's the meaning of your neighbor be kind to your neighbor this is understood but when I say this is why because Salat in Arabic means Dua prayer well prayer prayer and Sal is the same supplication so when I make Salat I make I'm asking Allah for forgiveness and it also can refer to the five prayers we pray so this is also Salah so when Allah says what does that mean this is this is unclear I have to understand it through the other verses or the other and that is why some Scholars said that are M we're unable to understand it as it is because there isn't a clear Hadith stating that these seven are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 there are General Hadith where the Prophet says that as long as the meaning is okay as long as you do not replace a verse of punishment with a verse of Jenna and mercy this is okay but then again you have to understand this in context and and as it was revealed the seven which we will also inah come to discuss are not the seven they are part of some of it but they are not the same and that is why Ahmed IB mujah the famous abak Ahmed mujah he's the F he's the prominent scholar who collected all the and made them under seven which are practiced now the scholars blamed him and they said the were more than 50 when you came and compiled only seven why didn't you put one more eight or deleted one and made it six so that people would not confuse the with the and we will come inshallah to discuss about this later on what are the ab may Allah be pleased with him reported that the prophet said jel recited the Quran to me in one and I recited it back to him but I requested him to increase the number of har of course the numbers of har are not from jel and there is a an authentic Hadith where he said and I asked Allah and he continued to increase it for me until we stopped at seven and this was reported byi so again this is a it's beyond doubt you have to believe in it as you believe in the Quran and then we have it's the focus is okay okay one of the great Companions and one of the great reciters of the Quran also heard two people reciting the Quran in the Masjid he heard two people reciting the Quran in a different manner from what he had learned from the prophet and this is you know he is the chief and he asked people to go and learn from him and now he's hearing two people reciting the Quran differently so so after some discussion with them each one said I took it from the prophet what about you I took it from the prophet that's strange three of us took it from the prophet and we recite it in a different manner not one is saying blue and the other one is saying green as I said the difference is not in meaning the difference is in the dialect it itself so they all went to the prophet and recited the the same portion to him the same ayat and the prophet approved every one of them and at this point ubai says may Allah be pleased with him there occurred in my mind a sort of denial and doubt that did not exist even in the time of Jah now when the prophet said approved approved Shan came to and said as he's coming to us now what is this and this I did not even find except in J and when the messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam saw how I was affected and how astonished I was he struck my chest he hit me in the chest and whereupon I started sweating and felt as though I were looking at Allah in fear he realized ized the gravity of the whispering ofan then the prophet said oby a message was sent to me to recite the"
