  "transcript": "all right sh so basically I should have asked you this question the first time but changing the age in it and of itself is permissible or not I think this is going to be a habit that you continue to ask me and stalk me on Twitter on my website on ask zad I told you the answer changing the age is a lie when you say I am 21 and when you're 18 yes or no is this a lie the answer is yes so yeah but I want to get married and the legal marriage is regardless this is lying so not only that you want to bribe officials might as well bribe them to get you a discount on the wedding and maybe do this or that this is the prerogative of shatan to take you little by little away from Islam by if not breaking the rules bending them a little bit so put a lead on it stop asking such questions and move on with your life and Allah Knows Best"
