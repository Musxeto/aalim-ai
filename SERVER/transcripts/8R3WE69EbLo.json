  "transcript": "can a woman cut short her hair that is yes whether it's damaged or not whether she wants to have a new look this is up to her cutting the hair is permissible for a woman providing that she's not cutting it short so that people would think that this is the hair of a man this is haram and she's not allowed to have haircuts that are only done by the kaffir any Muslim women do not do this so if a woman almost shaves the side of her head and having the other hair grown and long this is totally prohibited because this is the haircut of a kafir of a disbeliever but if it's the normal haircut whether it is as they call it Princess Diana's haircut or something similar to that which all women do it whether here or there there's no problem in that insha Allah and Allah knows best"
