  "title": "Is it obligatory to untie braids before ghusl for Menses & Janaba (Hadith?) #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I have a question regarding a human goel in general after her creation so it was written in a book that some Scholars have said it's obligatory for a human to antie her hair if it is braided for the gel after the menstration but it's not obligatory to do it um for a Gul to remove the state of Chaba the evidence C is the Hadith of AA sari what wasallam said take water Lotus leaves and undo and come your hair so they say that it's clear that you cannot come hair unless it's undone so is the auto understanding correct because African women have very curly hair and often keep it in in bread sometimes very small ones so it will be very difficult to untie it um before it goes and we prayed them afterwards the most authentic opinion of Scholars backed by Hadith of mother AA may Allah be pleased with her when he she heard that it's an issue of dispute of course when she heard that Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father used to order women to unraid their hair whenever they're doing uh uh for um menstruation she said she said as an objection why wouldn't he ask them to shave their head as well so the most authentic opinion in to my recollection this is the opinion of and is that it is not mandatory to unbid the braids of a woman when she's doing Gul whether the rul is for her mensis or to uplift a major ritual impurity due to janaba she doesn't have to do this it's not mandatory she must soak her braids and ensure that the water reaches every single hair and in her scalp as well and that's all and Allah Knows Best"
