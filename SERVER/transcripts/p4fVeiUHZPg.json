  "title": "Is it permissible to memorize the Quran only by listening to it? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so Sheikh I'm just starting to learn Arabic and I memorize the Quran simply by listening to it so my question is is it permissible to memorize the Quran by listening the Quran initially was learned by the companions may Allah be pleased with them by listening and this is the best way of learning it to listen to mimic to duplicate what you have heard and this is called a talakti where you learn through reception receiving the Quran and duplicated and recite it similar to how you've heard it so there's nothing wrong in that at all insha Allah"
