  "transcript": "stomping perfect with no pleasure other laws of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of life Islam he's away of all praises due to Allah we ask Allah to exalt dementia and grant peace and send his blessings upon the prophet muhammad sallallahoalyhiwasallam his companions his wives and all those who follow them on their path of righteousness until the end of time brothers and sisters in Islam welcome to our new episode yet a continuation of our previous discussion on marriage we have with us today brother abdul rahim green brother Suleiman REM brother awesome al-hakim a new host of almost our watch they are carry so reproduction it's a very heavy term and has many connotations and that's one of the things which we did not elaborate on yet and perhaps sure Hassan we could begin by elaborating somewhat on the idea of reproduction in slam please Sheila hura Haman Hamdi laughs a lot of Salama a lot of so Allah who are you so happy today me Hoda and my back reproduction is encouraged not only in Islam and we're not talking about the production of cars or of movies that were not in Bollywood we're talking about having children having offspring we've stated that this is the Sunnah of the prophets and messengers of Allah and Allah mentioned this in the Quran that they had offsprings we mentioned also that the Prophet Elisha encouraged the Ummah not only individuals he carries the Ummah to reproduce and the hadith of math believe me Assad melodies with him he said that the man came to the prophet or a sorcerer and he said that Oh prophet of Allah I found a woman who is of noble lineage and she's beautiful but she does not bear children so can I marry her and the answer was negative so the man asked a prophet again are they soul of a sermon the Prophet said no and the man asked the Prophet I saw for the third time insisting come on this is a catch she is of noble lineage she's rich she's beautiful what kind of man asked for more but she does not bear children which means that she was divorced and she could not bear children and the Prophet again said no marry those women who are fertile and loving and caring for I will boast with your numbers on the day of judgment this is the advice of the Prophet or is this a prohibition from him well it's a good thing that you've asked because because there might be some yes sisters this is harsh for me the Hadean relates to someone who was not married before who has no children but no one in Islam says that it is prohibited to marry a woman who does not bear children no one says it's prohibited if you do not have children yourself it becomes not recommended hmm but if you have children definitely as a recommendation yes you can go and marry someone who is so I mean the emphasis of the hadith here is about like this do you know yes and that the Prophet stated this in a very eloquent way marry the woman who's fertile and loving and caring not only for time the issue is not in reproduction alone it's a long term relationship yeah you marry not only to produce but to have a sustainable and beautiful life with your spouse this reminds me of another hadith when the Prophet SAW sell him on the night of ascension when he sowed the great multitude of people the crowd and he thought that was his Ummah they told him no this is Moses and vanilla eat but look to the horizon the whole horizon is covered you can't see that is your own so the Ummah of the province of assalam is going to outnumber all the nations on the Day of Resurrection so so this wish of the pop / alum has been fulfilled and will be fulfilled inshallah but every Muslim should try to fulfill this wish for the prophets Allah Allah there is usually fear of being able to afford it seriously is there an ayah or are there some references from the Quran which address this issue in regards to the people who worry about financial you know obligations and few provision since of Han a lot the Arabs before Islam used to kill their children out of the fear of poverty so Allah subhana Allah revealed regarding that well attack to a Lada come in Imbler the attire minimally nanu nanu kuku Maria the other ayah will add up to loud the conga she attack in love not new nor Zhu Tao way a command see the beautiful and the about this - I add the first ayah will add up to the oneida come do not kill your children mean Imbler because of poverty poverty exists na hoona Dooku come we provide you and he mentioned the parents first because the human being a selfish by nature so I want to survive with the child I no problem this the native so Allah addresses this is a national do pokum will provide for you and as well for your children then the other ayah is addressing the whole issue from a different angle well a doctor or a lot of community monopolist Cargill it is killing I think this one is my question - out of the fear you have money now but maybe in the future I will become poor so Allah is saying no when attacked allow glad to come here in la out of fear of poverty nah we provide them the children as if the child comes along with his he brings his risk with him so we Muslims we should not think or what that worried about the issue of the risk and the issue of your life is span your life two things they worry a human being death and religion and these two things are in our lives happened nothing is quite interesting as well shift these are in our lives hand and Allah because he knows that many of us are doubtful he gave us the assurance with his semi eros don't have to heartily this is enough in Heaven's in the skies or in the clouds is Urist and whatever is promised this is enough but Allah then gave more occurs for war abyss cemre it will come our swearing by himself by the Lord of the heavens and the in now Allah it is the truth with lemon and comfortable in the way that you articulate the way you utter you are sure when you are talking that you are talking there is no doubt so your risk has been guaranteed when you are still despicable drop of semen in your mother's womb so first of all I would like to point out that actually this the idea that we are so overpopulated we can't feed everybody is a myth there is plenty of food in England just England alone we throw away enough food in a year to feed the whole of effort in England alone we feed enough food in a year to feed the whole of Africa so what Gordon Brown the probably the former prime minister was saying this I mean and then we say we don't have enough food to feed it's not a problem of there's not enough food it's a problem of justice and distribution and many other issues and and I think so it's not only a personal issue people feel you know personally but also collectively there's this paranoia that or how would we feed the human beings know the provision is there it's not that the provision is not there there it's just the weak human beings not I'm not distributing it really equitably and I think the other thing about kids do we think we should talk about it's just the you know the edge of the benefit or having kids because this is still for me one of the great benefits you know there's a psychological benefit you talked about when you come home and Marshall you see your wife yeah but before I see my wife I saw personally before I even get to see my wife I have to go through the kids and but for me this is the thing the moment I open the door it's like a bar and the tree they scream you know especially the little ones and they come running and you know it's the for me this is my sunshine you know your whole day could be so stressed and I see those kids you know and mashallah all the worries they just go and I'm just smiling and you know playing with them and this is just fantastic and so there's that just beautiful thing about marriage as well as the the rewards because this is maybe a lahu island one of the most amazing things about marriage in terms of the benefit because every child you have you teach them Salah you teach them Quran you bring them up in Islam you get rewarded for all the good things they do without their reward being taken away and then when you die they are making dollar for you they can do other things for you and so Marshall like the chef of the hadith you if you'd like to quote it on that something only benefits there yeah but the hadeeth of the three girls three daughters as one has three daughters that just takes him to the Jannah mashallah yeah three dosa and you bring them up Islamic Lee and you take care of them that's the guarantee for you and two and two and two and two and the companion said if the Prophet said would have said one he would have said yes yes the grace of Allah I have 13 of them so I hope we shall ah I will be protected from that the girl specially but generally your love spring is a comfort to the heart yeah this feeling item when I got married ages ago I had my first daughter and I said you said to my wife well I remember it as if it's yesterday so remember that when will the time come when my little infant child will grow up to be 6 or 7 years of age and whenever I come to the house she'll take my bag and him and hugs me and and and cuddles me and that was yesterday now my daughter Michelle she's doing her master's in Islamic studies in the university of Medina masha'Allah and she has two children of her own yet she still is the love of her daddy Moshe let Hamdi left and it's a it's a great blessing but not only that the hadith you were referring to the Prophet said that is a lot of sand when the son of Adam dies and yeni Abu Musab knows this hadith we can't go on I perhaps it would be advisable if we address it after the break gonna have a short break and just so we can give it its due right and Charlotte I'll adjust after the break so I stick around we'll be back soon said I'm a deacon Salah I said I'm rally kumara Hatzolah here but I catch a welcome back yes you were gonna say something and I about a hadith and I had to interrupt you so please go ahead we know that our cause reason for being on this earth is to worship Allah Azza WA JAL and eventually either go to Paradise or to help me a lot so that prevents us all from and the viewers from going to help so one would assume that it would be normal and logical to do everything that gets you closer to paradise and as far as possible from Hell one of the reasons for getting you closer to paradise is to have good children and if you have one the possibility is less than when you have 10 for example why because the Prophet erase all of Sam said tells us that when the son of Adam dies his good deeds are interrupted are over because he's not able to pray he's not able to fast except of three things the Prophet tells us as Salaam a continuous charity sadaqah Angelia like digging a well building a message it supporting a TV channel Islamic that is on Islamic TV channel printing a book this is part of the thing that people would circulate among them then the Prophet says our in mint fr Bay knowledge form of science that people who come after you will benefit from so we pray to Allah so that our discussion here is one of that and this is one of the greatest motives for us to have as many because we know that when we are in our graves and people are watching it not only they have a laugh but it shall endure benefit out of it and this is the reason that drives us to do it and thirdly the Prophet says our son for what I did sorry hint you drew the whole a righteous offspring of his whether boy or girl cuz well it in Arabic refers to both genders hmm well whether the inside had drew level that supplicates to him now if you don't have children intentionally you don't want them and you're working not to have them you'll miss this great branch of good deeds and reward if you are tested by Allah not to have them this is from Allah Allah so Allah will reward you if you have the intention to have children for this reason and the more you have children the better it is and for the one who Allah decrees is barren then the person should understand the ayah very well why santa croce inherently comas and to have osha in Hashanah come Allahu Alem one term allah tala moon perhaps you may hate something in there is good for you perhaps you may love something and it is evil for you and Allah knows and you know not so these issues because sometimes they create a problem in al Qaeda we have to understand that for that particular individual its mercy from Allah that they don't have children and for that other individual its mercy from Allah that they have children Allah knows and we not and it's a test no ultimately and that is why having a lot of children is beneficial because their job Rahim mentioned if he imagined that your children you taught them and this is what one of the scholars emphasizes on he said whenever your child is growing be the most careful person to be the first one to teach him the Fatiha why is that he says because from now on every time he decides the Fatiha in his prayer you'll get the reward unfortunately I'm the first one to neglect this because I depend on my wife who is more capable of teaching them and she has a more patient intolerance and this is one of the advantages of choosing a righteous and practicing woman because she does everything for you and sometimes she gives you more than what you asked for so like brother brahim said imagine these children viewers whatever they pray you've spent so many long years as you old parents no awaking in them up forfeiture and it is horrendous but at the end of the day look at the fruits they professor on their own they prayed over our mother Aisha they offered voluntary nawafil prayers they fast they do this all of this because you taught them this oh there are other issues which we wanted to address as well in terms of the benefits and we also promised the viewers that we will be dealing with some of the rights of the husband and the rights of the wife and things of this sort so are there any additional points in regards to the benefits of marriage that you wish to tackle now or shall we go ahead and move on to the interesting topic of what does the husband get out of this and what does the wife get out of this and are we actually fulfilling each other's and they duties towards each other or do we have some shortcomings and what I you think that we should address and I'd like the feedback of the brothers of course and yours as well we always get this negative impression that the Muslims are overpopulated and they are focusing on quantity rather than quality so and I've heard this from so many people you know criticizing me from my relatives they say you have so many kids you're not taking care of them you don't even know their names and this is not true but they criticize the fact that we have so many kids and they say instead of having so many of them have one or two but work hard on making them in a good quality like fashion I don't know you've ever heard this before and I don't know if you have many times many many times especially from mostly from my non-muslim mother she keeps bringing this topic up again and again mashek I found actually the opposite is the case I found that having many kids in the house actually increases the quality I don't find academically or spiritually or even financially I don't notice this deficiency at all in fact what I've noticed is martial of the kids are generally very happy in a way that I have not seen I said to my mother I asked you one question I said did you see a ham a family as happy as our family no she didn't know what to say because you find anyone who comes to my house you see the kids they're all playing with each other they're all sitting teaching each other so the big ones teach the little ones they all really beautiful at school in high school not the school it's good without the bad things so I mean the this idea of you know quality not quantity actually you find that often kids in small families they get lonely they have many problems that you don't find in bigger families I don't know if there's any hard and fast rule but this is my personal experience what's your experience sharing their facts in life I mean for example I recall now that in our family I mean the the parents they are illiterate and their children he was calling the high schmuck over the country okay and mashallah they are doing well in their life so this is has nothing I mean they are illiterate they don't know anything okay so it is relevant and we should not be in I mean intellectually brainwashed and accept and buy such a stuff these things quality quantity resources are limited no because Allah is the provider we Muslims really as Jeff mentioned that allah subhana wa ta'ala and this plan is sufficient food yes there is a famine in this area or that area but what is the main reason it is a test for those who are well-off sure it is the greed and the same times you see they are dumping millions of tons every year into the ocean to maintain the price of the wheat and then they say there is poverty and there's another interesting thing I don't want to spend too long on it but I think every you know the viewers might be interested about this topic that in Europe they have adopted not as a policy just as their culture to have one or two kids now it's actually become a very big problem economically because if you think about it statistically you need more children in order to fill the future generation so that there are people working and so that they will be able to support those people who are now young when they get older so you need a constant renewal and you need it's not you need to have more than two children because if you have two or less than two it's not enough to renew so basically what economists have figured out is that if I think it's about was something like this if thirty five percent of your population reaches the age you retirement age of 65 you're the economy of your country is no longer viable you your your economy will not be able to sustain itself and it's very interesting that in Italy and in many Norwegian countries this is exact the problem that they have Jimmie's exactly that the people are refusing to have more than one or two kids they're refusing because why in the West now they have indoctrinated everybody that if you're a woman you have lots of children you're a mother you're a housewife you're a slave you're you know and all for what don't I don't know one should be imagining that this is for the liberation of women no that's rubbish and that's lies its economic all they thought is we've got half the population not working not contributing taxes not buying and selling let's get them into the workplace they can earn money and we'll be richer as a nation this is what it's about but they didn't think ahead and think oh if the women are all working and don't have kids what's going to happen to the future retirement age used to be 60 this is why this is the why this is the reason why okay because this is the only way they're fighting and England is one of the countries that doesn't have a problem because we have a lot of immigration but the countries they don't can't keep up with the immigration their economies are on the verge of collapsing but they'll never say this because it exposes the full sort of their ideology zakaral affair for the input this will not be the end Charla there will be more episodes pertaining to marriage and issues of marriage and children in particular circle ahead for tuning in and we hope to see you or you hope that you see us in the near future salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah etiquette we live life the way of life away"
