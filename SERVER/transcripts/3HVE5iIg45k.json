  "transcript": "uh Chef I just wanted to ask a question regarding the mic prayer if I wake up at night intending to perform the photocardium then I concluded with Destiny and then I get up and I pray one more intending by that Wicked can I make my intention for that prayer Wicked and tired or is it just with it by itself so first of all when you say that if you intended to pray night prayer for raka as I'm assuming that you know that it is not permissible to pray for continuous rakas at night due to the fact that the prophet said the format of night prayer is to be prayed to then you conclude with salaam another two you conclude with Salaam so you can do that indefinitely and the sky is the limit this is what the prophet said as for which a prayer you can pray it in different formats one single raka or two separate trackers with salaam then another rakash of the total is three or three continuous rakas only sitting in the third or five continuous rakais only sitting in the fifth and then offering salaam of course or seven only sitting at the seventh or nine continuous rakas sitting in the eighth then standing up and then sitting in the ninth and offering Salaam these are the formats of Witcher whether you intend separately to pray for rakas tahajud and then or you already have determined that when you woke up I'm gonna pray five two two by one or you had this open intention nothing predetermined it doesn't matter Allah knows exactly what you want and he will register this for you without any doubt be in Allah"
