  "transcript": "La Boheme hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu sallim wa barik ala aalihi wa rasuluh he nabina muhammad in Wahiawa sahbihi ajma'in amma back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we have hadith number 82 with us and it's a long hadith with a lot of points to be learned so who will read it to us screaming aisha radi allahu ta'ala anhu reported the messenger of allah salallahu alayhi wa sallam used to begin prayer with the beer that is saying Allahu Akbar and he began the recitation with al hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen that his praises be to Allah the Lord of the universe when he bowed he neither kept his head up nor bent it down but kept it between these extremes when he raised his head after bowing he did not prostrate himself till he had stood erect when he raised his head after prostration he did not prostrate himself again till he sat up he peace be upon him at the end of every two rakahs he recited the ahijah and he used to place his left foot flat on the ground the hey at that is huh thank you because in Arabic the Hayyim is Salam Salam salutation but the hat it's a plural which we all know yes go ahead he recited yet the head and he used to place his left foot flat on the ground and raise up the right he prohibited the devil's way of sitting on the heels and he forbade people to spread out their arms like a wild beast and he used to finish the prayer with it asleep Jessica la jolla now this is a description from one of the greatest scholars and companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam mother aisha may allah be pleased with her and with her father she stated that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam would initiate would start would begin his prayer with takbir and what is the ruling on takbir it is a pillar of prayer and that is why it is extremely important when you come and the imam is in the rock position you come late and you go a lot of the Muslims make the mistake of saying Allahu Akbar and bow and if you ask him what was this he said bowing to create for bowing this prayer is invalid you must say Allahu Akbar as takbir a telegram to begin your prayer now if you intend in one takbir to join the two this is permissible but if you say Allahu Akbar and then Allahu Akbar this is also better and permissible as well likewise that be returned Rahm has to be done when in the standing position a lot of the Muslims two or three steps before the row when the Imam is doing record they say Allahu Akbar and they're walking and this is not acceptable it has to be when they are standing in position so it's a pillar and it's important thing she goes on to say that he used to begin his recitation with al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen and this means that he did not begin his recitation with bismillahirrahmanirrahim as it is the method of Imam Shafi the three other schools of thought say you do not recite bismillah r-rahman r-rahim loudly only the Imam Shafi is school of thought say that you do this and what is the most authentic opinion by far it is definitely the opinion that states that you do not recite it loudly because the Prophet Adam did not recite it loudly neither Abu Bakr nor Ahmad Northman or re the Companions of the Prophet who prayed behind all these four said once in hadith my son by Allah neither the Prophet nor Abu Bakr nor Amin or admin or Ali ever recited bismillah r-rahman r-rahim loudly and is it part of the Quran of the Fatiha is it part of the Fatiha or not it's an issue of dispute among scholars if you open some of the must-haves you not all of them some of the copies you will find bismillahir-rahmanir-rahim one and then you go to al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen arrahmani arraheem manikyam indeed he cannot budva can assign a hideous salat or mustaqim verse number seven sirata al-ladhina and I'm telling him blatant Eluga anymore Abdali so they say now these are 7 ayah but in other schools of thought and other copies of the Quran you will find this military man Rahim without any number like all the other sewers of the Quran would use you come to al baqara do you find bismillah r-rahman r-rahim 1 alif-lam-mim - no so in other schools of thought they say that it is al hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen number 1 al rahman al rahim allah kiyomi Dini eeeh cannibal do a year canister in wattle Mustafina sirata al-ladhina and I'm telling him like it is MacDougal a human appalling so which is the most authentic the most authentic is the second it's a letter why simply because the overwhelming evidence is support that in the hadith the Prophet said are in salatu salam Allah the Almighty says I've divided prayer between me and my servant into - ha if he says al hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen Allah says my servant has praised me al Rahman al Raheem my servant has complimented me Maliki owe me did my servant has glorified me eeeh can our buddhaya can stain this is between me and my servant you know sirat al-mustaqim masala Dina I'm sorry m'lady model very model believe allah says this is for my servant and my servant will get what he asked for so the point is the Prophet said Allah said I've divided the salat which is a fatiha into two part and he started with al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen and this is one of the greatest evidences that bismillah ar-rahman rahim is not part of the fatiha so what is bismillah r-rahman r-rahim callers say that bismillah ar-rahman ar-rahim is a separate ayah he's a separate ayah that differentiate between Ashura and the one that follows it with the exception of Torah - Toba so how many times do we have bismillah r-rahman r-rahim in the Quran a hundred and fourteen times because we have 114 surah yet in surat enamel we have bismillahi r-rahmani r-rahim so torah the Tomba does not have bismillah alrahman alraheem in its beginning moving on she pointed to us how the prophet alayhi salat wa salam used to bow and she said that if he bowed his head would not be pointing up and it would not be pointing down and we have other hadith telling us that the Prophet when he bowed sallallahu alayhi wa sallam his back would be straight to the extent that if you put water on it it would remain now I've seen a lot of the brothers especially athlete who think that they are doing their warm-up for their karate or Taekwondo when they bow they do this almost touching their heads to their knees and this is wrong and I've seen arrogant brothers when they bow they bow like this you know the thing doing this honorable what are you doing this is not bowing and the sunnah is to be like this 90 degrees and your head should also be in the same level of your back it shouldn't be going up and it shouldn't be looking between your legs should be at the same level this is how the prophet sallallaahu Selim used to do it and she tells us that the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam whenever he raised his head from ruku he would not prostrate until he stands erect this is a sunnah that has been abandoned by a lot of the muslims they say semi allahu liman hamidah and they don't stand erect I've seen people utilizing so they think utilizing the time of Prayer so they say instead of doing it in ten minutes we can make it in seven I see how he said we utilize how do you utilize it look I'll show you subhanAllah the audience of handling subhana Allah send me our love with him in her media Allah Akbar so by the time he's standing straight his knees fall to the ground he says I saved like 20 seconds Baraka instead of saying semi l-'alamin Hamid ahead weight and then go for to hood know as I'm raising my head my knees collapse and I go down to the prostration and this is not acceptable his prayer is invalid some of them even go like this seminar Lord him and Hamad Al aqua they don't go just touch and go like an airplane you know that when they try to go there and their training flights they call it touch and go because the most important thing in flying is the takeoff and the landing this is the most important this is true this is to do with pilots the most important thing and the most dangerous thing in flying is that the takeoff and landing so that why they do like seven eight nine touch-and-go they call it touching goes and this brother is like this is touching go he the minute he says sir my love how many he goes to prostrate in the Sunnah what is mandatory is you stand up erect until every bone goes back to its place and then you say Allah Akbar and you fall on your knees and hands to prostrate to allah azza wajal she tells us that if he raised his head from prostration we have a position where he sits between the two prostrations right she says that he would not prostrate again until he sits erect meaning all the bones are back to their places he feels ya need the tranquility of the prayer before he falls to prostrating again we have a short break stay tuned in sha allah we'll be right back assalamualaikum and welcome back I assure me Allah be pleased with her goes on to say that the prophet Alastair between every two Rakas he used to offer at the Hat so usually after the second raka there is a position where he sits and he offers that they add the salutation of the Prophet irresolute Salam known as after here - lillahi was-salawatu wat-tayyibat assalamu alayka o assalaamu island nabi warahmatullahi wabarakatu a ceremony navara by the la sala he ash-hadu anla ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh in some narrations a shadow a la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah wash and muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh so after every two Rakas generally speaking and why do i say generally speaking because there are incidents where we do not sit after the second record when is that it's when we offer Whitten so the prophet adam used to offer one rocker as Whicher for three records either praying to and concluding the MU salaam and then praying the third and concluding it with salam so it's two different units or praying the whole three but not sitting in the second rock as he does in the mother hip but he stands up and finishes the third recurrence it's in the third rocker and offered to jihad understood so it is forbidden to pray witr prayer similarly to the McRib sitting in the second and sitting in the third the prophet prohibited this and told us do not pray it like Maghrib so you pray too then salaam then another one separate or you prayed three but you do not sit in the center car not only that mother I used to say that he used to pray five fracas with only sitting in the fifth and offering Salam not only that she said that he used to pray seven records with only sitting in the seventh so old seven like as continuous only sitting in the seventh and offering Salam and finally he used to pray nine Jacques as whitter but he used to sit in the eighth offer to jihad and stand up and then offer the ninth and sit for to jihad and concluded with Salam but this is not our topic which is Witter so we go back to our topic which is the prophets habit and Sunnah is to sit after every two Rakas and offer diet as prescribed earlier and then she says that whenever he used to sit he used to sit on his left foot erecting the right foot and this is known as in Arabic and if Talaash meaning that he's making his left foot as if it is a mattress to sit on so this is the way he used to sit when there are two Rakas and throughout the whole prayer except when there is a third raka as in the Maghreb or when he sets in the fourth raka and the final raka as in Lahore answer or Asia then he would use another way of sitting which is known as at a world look and what is at Tobruk at Tobruk is derived from al Wilke which is the hip so the Prophet so - Salam in the last raka when it's a third or fourth raka in the prayer he used to sit on his left hip or buttock and he would put his left leg under his right leg this is the way of sitting and this is followed by Ali ma cherie and other schools of thought as well this is the Sunnah yet this is not mentioned here but I mentioned it so that it would be clear to you that it would not confuse you throughout the whole prayer usually he sits like this how he sits on the left foot and elects the right foot with the fingers going towards the Kaaba this is the sunnah and if a person's right foot is tired or he has a sports injury or he's unable to erect it there is no problem if he does not elect it and leave it either to the side or pointing to the back he did not do the Sunnah but it is not affecting his prayer what affects his prayer is the forbidden way of sitting and the hadith is the Prophet used to forbid us from sitting like the devil like the Shaitaan and how did the Shaitaan sit this is an issue of dispute among scholars some of them considered erecting both feet and sitting on the heels to be the forbidden way of sitting and some scholars considered it the Sunnah way of sitting so in Arabia for example chair members embarrass I mean other scholars consider this to be the forbidden way of sitting shekel Albani say that this is the Sunnah way of sitting and it's a difference of interpretation of how to sit also they say part of the forbidden way of sitting is a posture or a way of sitting I cannot do but only the children my children I've seen them they enjoy doing it and that is they sit on their buttocks with the legs beside them and this is very difficult and if I tried it I might not be able to stand up we usually put our legs like this no they spread their legs to the sides and they sit in the middle and this is very difficult scholars say that this is also forbidden to sit and I do not advise you to try this at home and finally she says that the Prophet item also forbade a man from spreading his hands or arms as a beast and the Arabic text it says that you do not make your arms as if in the case of a mattress on the floor so we know that the Sunnah is to make a part to make it as wide as possible and leave your arms away from your sides this is a Sunnah when you prostrate because this is a posture that gives strength and agility and it means that you're awake but if a sleepy person is there what would he do he would like you know you've ever seen a dog sitting how does the dog he puts all of his arms on the ground and a lot of the Muslims put their elbows when they prostrate and this is Haram this is what the Prophet our Islam forbade from you have to do this but if you do this in congregation depends who's stronger you will be you know giving this man a right elbow and a left elbow and that is why the Companions complained to the Prophet al-islam that they're harming each other so the Prophet said that Salaam use your thighs meaning that instead of doing this put your elbows on your thighs but do not by any chance put it on the ground as this goes against the teachings of the Prophet Allah so Salaam and it's also not a part of the proper way of praying and then he concluded his prayer with Salam how many salams the most authentic opinion is that you offer to salams some schools of thought said that the first one is mandatory the other one is Sunnah but we don't have authentic hadith to back this up and the way that the Prophet used to offer salami Sam was always reported to us that he offered them twice except in the funeral prayer he offered it only once to the right hand side in the remaining time do you think we have any questions masha'Allah Tabarrok Allah let's take the brother salam where should one place his site when he's offering ruku as the gesture or the posture we have stated you should do that to the place you put your head in because if you're having your head in the same level of your back this means that it falls exactly on the place where you will be putting your forehead but if you look between your legs your head would go a little bit down so the normal thing is to look straight down not up not below and this would fall in the place of your prostration yes brother I have ready now hadiza I have heard from someone the last business Elohim used to perform two types of Salaam that is a Salam Salam aleikum wa rahmatullah a ceremony called Allah and another type was a Salam alikoum and a Salam aleikum o Allah no no if I'm not mistaken it is a ceremony Kimora Mutulu hvala Kyoto assalamu alaikum WA Rahmatullah there are Hadees to back this up and some scholars say that they are so hadith but they are not the norm the norm the Prophet used to have them equal in American philosopher Marc Morano 2 lakh so those who authenticated this hadith the insertion of barakato say that it is permissible to do it and those who do not consider to be authentic rather they consider it to be Chad Chad meaning wield only one reported it but the others did not so they considered this not to be part of the Sunnah either way if you simply limit yourself to saying it assalamu alaikum salam ala everyone says that you have done a good job in on large Dajjal knows best I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time for Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
