  "transcript": "is from he says that I see people from meaning that the people who innovate in Islam they claim that they see the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in their dreams and they also claim that they also see the Companions and other Pious people in their dreams why is it so that people who innovate in religion of Allah most sees uh see the prophet Alat uh the most first of all not everyone who claims that he had seen the prophet Alam is telling the truth so he might be telling the truth and he might be lying so people of innovation people of deviation it is easy for them to lie to make up stories and to claim that they had seen the prophet alai in their dreams and this is one of the major sins of Islam to pretend that you have seen something which you did not not only the prophet wasam any dream that you make up and you tell someone I saw so and so and you did not see it actually this is a major sin so lying is not that bigger sin in their uh uh favor they they innovate they deviate they fabricate things in Islam so it is normal for them to lie but there is a possibility that they are telling the truth and if they say that they had seen the prophet Alat wasam this and this is truthful and they're not lying they could either have seen him or not see the prophet told us whoever sees me in his vision in his dream then he had seen me which means that he would also this individual would see the prophet Alat on the day of judgment and this is one of the interpretation of whoever sees me then he will see see me uh when he's awake not in this word world because the the the the whole of the scholars the majority of the scholars say that it is impossible to see the prophet wasam alive again in this world this is preposterous but they interpret the Hadith as to mean that you will see him on the day of judgment or that you have a special meeting with him on the day of judgment if you had seen him in your dream but there is a very important condition that has to be fulfilled and that is that you should see him and be able to describe him so if someone says that I've seen the prophet Alam and I've heard a voice telling me that this is a prophet but I did not see his face or I saw his face yet the description does not fit the prophet's description sallahu alaihi wasallam so if someone tells me that I saw the prophet Alam and he was short and skinny or he had he was black or uh he did not have a beard or he was this or that that does not fit the description of the Prophet Alam then he had not seen him yet whoever is fortunate to see the prophet alham as he was described to us in this case this is a glad Tiding inshallah that on the day of judgment he will see him but this does not mean that the way this individual is doing whether he's uh uh uh one of the followers of the Deviant sects or an innovator or someone who's not practicing this doesn't mean that his way is correct maybe Allah Asel would guide him through this Vision to become a practicing Muslim"
