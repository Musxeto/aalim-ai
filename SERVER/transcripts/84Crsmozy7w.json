  "title": "Can I repeat the Fateha if I did not focus properly while reciting - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "right hand from the Emirates says that if she did not concentrate on the Fatiha while in prayer can she repeat it the answer is no because then you will open the Pandora's box for Shaitan Satan will see the opportunity to mess up with your mind in every single thing so did I say takbir to ashram no so let me do it again and again and again I once went to a Masjid in Syria that was like 30 years ago and a man came next to me and I finished the prayer and he did not start yet he goes oh boy Akbar while we were praying and then over a sudden and he keeps on doing until we finished the congregation and he still did not pray this is when you open the door for Shaitaan he would enter with his entourage he has no problem that so you read this Fatiha that's it it's gone I didn't concentrate try harder next time but do not repeat it"
