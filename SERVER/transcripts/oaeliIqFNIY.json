  "title": "Is it sin to gift only one child? Must gifts be of same price What about necessities assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I bought my oldest child a gift when he started praying am I sinful for not getting the others a gift and does each child gift have has to um has to have to be uh of equal price so the answer is yes giving a child a gift because they got good grades or because they started praying or as a an achievement as an award is not permissible because this is a gift and specifying that child with such a gift would favor him over the others and this is what Islam prohibited when giving a gift they have to be all equal and does the price must be as uh the same in giving the answer is yes gifts are different from what what children need so a child needs a surgery I don't have to pay the others the same cost of the hospital a child is grown up and goes to college and needs a car I buy the child a car in my name not in his and the one that goes to kindergarten does not say I need something equivalent no because they are different and likewise and Allah Knows Best"
