  "title": "Sinful if I teach hanafi book in which there's innovations like wiping neck in wudu? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is um so if a person um is working um as a Quran teacher and Islam studies teacher for children and um the person the the head teacher that employed this person didn't bother looking at the qualification of this person rather he just trusts them that um they know Quran and um the the Islamic Studies that this person is supposed to teach is is from hanfi book and sometimes there's um things like um wiping the neck in wo sometimes like bleeding BS you will do and some contradictions in that book but parents don't care or they genuinely believe in this so is this person sinful working like this is his income Haram if he teaches these things and there sometimes stories and Series in there the person doesn't know the details of s to know that this is wrong or right he just knows the um basic um Knowledge from s so as long as the main points are right can he teach first of all a teacher is obliged to teach a syllabus so he's doing his job he's being paid for it now the problem is when this is related to Islam either the teacher is someone of knowledge a student of knowledge a scholar in this case it is his duty or her to correct whatever mistakes they encounter and to explain it to their students bearing in mind that each and every school of thought whether it is hanafi Malik shaf or have 85% to 90% authentic information so the hanfi school of thought is filled with correct information there is a margin of error between 10 to 15 maybe 20% due to the fact that it was not based on Quran or Sunnah rather on on opinion onad and the same goes for Maliki School the Shafi school and H school so if you are a student of knowledge who has the ability to filter such material and pinpoint what is right and what is wrong and give them the alternative that's a win-win but if you're a Layman if you're someone who doesn't possess this knowledge then you're not sinful for teaching what is in the hanfi uh uh books or the hamali books because this is the best of your ability and knowledge same goes for the S if you don't know otherwise and you're teaching what's in the syllabus trusting it there is no sin on you and Allah Knows Best"
