  "transcript": "he said I took the Shahada when I was 14 I'm 16 now he said I didn't tell my family for some time but when I told them they started threatening me and to the extent that even the school the people at school were difficult with me he said I was sent to a monastery because I thought that I needed checking I needed cleaning in that sense he said of course hamdulillah they after a time knew that he was steadfast in his Deen up till now he says I'm having difficulty in my house especially trying to hide my faith he says what shall I do shall I leave my house shall I leave my family alone because I feel my salami threatened by my family well I as I recall when I heard this question and when I heard Nikolas talk to us I was overwhelmed frankly speaking I sincerely felt and wished and hoped that I was in his shoes because to have so much power to have so much belief he reminded me of the companions of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when they used to endure and tolerate all what they used to get from the enemies and from their loved ones from them they're very very close families my advice to brother Nikolas is that he should remain as he is strong in his faith and belief but but he should be also tolerant he should not be violent he should not misbehave with his parents which are the most important people in his lives life and he should seek knowledge because the only way that he can remain a good strong believer a good strong Muslim is by acquiring knowledge of the Koran and of the Sunnah to answer his question should he stay or leave he has to be his own judge unfortunately in some cases people would be very quick to say leave them go away Allah Allah will provide you in this in a sense it's true but at the same time if your faith and belief is not as strong as you may think but you were intimidated by your parents and your loved ones so you had to go unfortunately in some cases it backfires in the sense that the brother finds himself alone doesn't have enough to eat or it cannot go to school and no one is taking him in so unfortunately he rejects Islam and then he starts to complain if his faith is not strong and this happens a lot with poor in faith Muslims they say why does Elijah really put such calamities on me why not my neighbor I pray five times a day I do this I do that I did Hitler for Allah and this what happens to me so they start to question a lot judgment and they reject Islam without them knowing that that therefore necklace you are the judge the best judge of yourself if you think that your faith is strong and there are people who can take you in and take care of you sincere good Muslims that would teach you and support you until you are on your feet the end at the same time you find it impossible to live with your children with your parents then in this case I advise you to go but if your parents now are more tolerant than they were a month or two ago and they're accepting it and they in it in a sense they're living with it then I advise you to stay with them as long as you're not threatened in the sense that you're not afraid of rejecting Islam stay with them give that way for them try to behave as a real Muslim in showing them what Islam calls you to and inshallah this would all end up to the best"
