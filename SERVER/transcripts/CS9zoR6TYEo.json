  "transcript": "well I see if it is something related to only work and it does not include any socialization any joking you are serious and he so he is and this is for the main purpose of taking care of this website which has a lot of good into it because it relates to the Quran and to the Hadith you only post what is permissible and what is in on uh in line with the Quran and the Sunnah I believe that for you to limit your communication with the opposite sex as much as possible this is advisable but if you have to then it is like talking to a doctor or talking to um a Salesman you want to buy something from the shop and you have to consult him but beware not to go into personal things not to exceed a minute or two Administration can be done through emails can be done through texting without going into how are you how's your father and mother how's your siblings what did you do at school tonight or or yesterday or whatever all of these are not permissible so you have to draw the line and again it is a necessity that that simulates and that is similar to the necessity of a Hungry Man Who starving and is about to die he is allowed to eat from a dead meat or from pork the amount that would make him sustain his uh uh living that would make him remain alive not to have a feast and to invite people to that likewise your connection your relationship with this um admin person should be to the very minimum and Allah knows best question"
