  "transcript": "jahed says can a Muslim boy look at a girl with good intention because I have to tell it to friends please give references from the Quran Allah asael ordered Muslim men to lower their gaze inah and he also ordered Muslim women to lower their gaze hence it is not permissible for a to look at a girl or at a Woman except for a legitimate reason now having a good intention or a bad intention this is yeah I don't know what justifies the good intention oh she she's my schoolmate and she's sitting next to me so I look and talk to her like friends this there's nothing like this she's my cousin there's no good intention in that because Shan awaits the proper moment and Haram will happen eventually maybe not this year maybe not in five years but it will happen and even if it doesn't happen Allah tells us that this is prohibited so the prophet Alam when one of the companions said to him I proposed and I'm engaged to this woman the prophet told him did you look at her and the man said no the prophet said go and look look at her which means that the people in Medina were all covered up even if she's walking in the street they would not look at them because they're covered they cannot see them so for the purpose of marriage if you want to marry a woman it is permissible for you to go it is recommended for you to go and take a look at her speak with her in the presence of her guardian in the presence of her father for example this is Hal now to casually look and have good intention as people say there's nothing as such we don't know of anything as such except for someone who has a problem with his hormones so yes if you say no she I feel okay I have no problem they are my colleagues I've been working with her for 10 years at the same office sitting eight hours a day and we have no feelings against one another what is this what are you talking about if you don't have any feelings there there's a problem with your hormones because this is human nature nature that Allah has created in all of us so the answer to answer your question definitely this is not permissible and you may not have such a good look or even such a friendly look with good intention unless it's a legitimate reason if you're a doctor you have to look at your patient but only at the place where you want to treat if you are selling someone and you want to know that person she may uh unveil her face or if it's already unveiled you may look at her so that when she comes in a week time and she says that there's a problem with the goods you can identify her Etc other than that the answer is no farat"
