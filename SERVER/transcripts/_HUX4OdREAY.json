  "title": "If a woman and a man are in closed room, is it slandering to say they committed zina assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign to the house would they be slandering her if I say she fornicated without bringing four Witnesses of course 100 slandering if you see a woman with a man and they go into a closed room and they stay there for eight hours and they come out and you say that they fornicated this is slandering even if they if they spent three days and three nights this is slandering this cannot be said at all because accusing someone of Zina a fornication or adultery requires that four male Witnesses so even if there were 10 women present and they saw the actual intercourse between this non-mahram man with this stranger woman and they saw it with their own eyes and they reported it they will the ten women will be flogged 80 lashes because they are not allowed to testify this testimony must be done by four male Witnesses and not a single woman among them and Allah Knows Best if"
