  "transcript": "we continue to study the book or the chapter that deals with funeral prayer and we have hadith 156 narrated and i was in the second or third row buhari this hadith is similar to the previous hadith yet it states that the prophet alaihis salatu had a number of rows though in the muslim you could have one row yet we know that the sunnah is to have at least three rows when you pray funeral prayer even if each row consisted of only two people it's okay but you have to have three rows and what happens if two are praying only on a funeral on a dead person scholars say that the imam is in front and the person next to him goes behind him so that they would make two rows and this is only prayer where we have the follower the mum standing behind the imam alone usually he stands next to him but in this prayer no funeral prayer he has to stand right behind him and we've stated that the more people who pray funeral prayer the higher it is as a possibility for him to be forgiven and allowed accept their intercession and that is why a lot of the muslims especially in saudi arabia they write in their will that their funeral to be taken into mecca so that imagine how many people pray funeral prayer on them two hundred thousand three hundred thousand but what is the ruling on transporting a corpse from one location to the other the most authentic opinion as al-imam and now he stated that it is forbidden it is not permissible to transport corpse from one place to the other unless there is a real urgent need for that such as there isn't any graveyards for muslims so where can we bury him can we marry him with the disbelievers with the non-muslims no muslims have to be buried in their own graveyards in their own cemeteries they cannot bury others with them and they cannot be buried in other cemeteries with non-muslims and scholars say that it is not permissible to transport a corpse from one city to the other as in the case in transporting it to makkah or to medina because the prophet sallallahu salaam ordered us to hasten in preparing the funeral and being buried in any location does not add any value so people when they think that being buried in medina is beneficial to the deceased being buried in mecca is good for the person who died this is baseless there is a hadith that encourages us to die in medina but not to be transported and to move the corpse to medina after death after death there is no use of that the prophet says whoever among you can die in medina he should do so which encourages the people to live in medina and to die there but to be buried there without dying has no significance and no reward at all on the contrary it adds more burden to your family is not sufficient for you that you're dead and they're sad about you you add to that that you make them struggle to move your body somewhere that is far and this would cost money and this would take a lot of time no this is not permissible and it is not uh recommended we've noticed that it was the prophet salatu salam who conveyed the information about the death of the najashi to his companions however we also know that the prophet alaihis salatu forbade us from declaring the death of people and this is called nigh so how can we combine between the two it's very simple what is forbidden is that you go on top of minarets on top of roofs and shout so and so has died so and so has died and you go in the roads in the markets carrying a bell or just shouting informing people of the death of a person this is haram because this is part of the actions of the people of jahiliyyah but if you're calling someone to inform him that so and so has died this is permissible as some scholars say but they say that this is permissible because of the fact that it is permissible when you want them to help you in burial when you want them to help you in seeking forgiveness when you want people to pray funeral prayer this becomes permissible but to call on the people in the streets in the markets so and so has died or like they do nowadays in newspapers you find big big pages of newspapers of the disease who has died he has moved into allah's mercy and forgiveness how do you know that he did not go to allah's wrath and anger we pray we hope but publishing such things or putting advertisements that so and so has died this is not part of the sunnah that the prophet islam encouraged us to do likewise it is not permissible to go and compliment someone about things that are not in him especially when we hear about rulers who died or about dignitary people who died after their death we know that they were robbers we know that they embezzled public money we know that they stole from the treasury but then we find all these praising of them and compliments to making them as saints all of these are lies you can't after the death of a person who was almost a criminal who was known to be bribed every single day you claim that he has so many good deeds and that he had done this and then that these are all lights and these are all forbidden in islam moving on to hadith 157 pray son said that the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam observed prayer over a grave after the dead was buried and he recited four takbirs over him this hadith we learn from it the ruling on preying on a person who has been buried why because some scholars say that this is not permissible at all to pray in the graveyard and anyone with all due respect who says this we tell him that the prophet did it allah so this means that it is permissible but we're not offering normal prayer what is forbidden for muslim to pray or to offer in the graveyard is any normal prayer mandatory prayer voluntary prayer all of this is completely prohibited to do between graves why because you're prostrating and this is means of shirk so you want to pray go outside except the prayer of funeral in this hadith the prophet alistal went into a grave and offered funeral prayer and likewise the woman the black woman who used to clean the masjid a woman who is unknown we know nothing of her not her name yet we only know her by her actions she used to clean the masjid and when she died she was buried at night and the prophet was asleep and when he woke up they told him he was very angry and he said why didn't you notify me they said because you were asleep so the prophet went and asked where her grave was and offered funeral prayer there so those who did not offer funeral prayer it is permissible for them to go to the graveyard and offer the funeral prayer there some scholars said that providing this is before one month is over after his burial why this is because after one month he would decayed and his body was changed but again this is baseless you don't have any restriction of a month a week a year so it appears that if you did not offer funeral prayer that you can go and offer it whenever you are able to do so however how do we offer funeral prayer it's very simple it has no bowing nor prostration it consists of four takbir and there are a number of narrations that make the reach as far as nine but the scholars say that only four or five are authentic and the rest are not authentic so four or five is permissible so how to do it we're going to take an example of offering four tech beer because this is the majority of scholars agree upon you offer the first sec beer allahu akbar and you recite after you finish you may recite another surah if the imam is still reciting you will recite quran any other short surah once he finishes he says allahu akbar and then he offers the prayer on the prophet sallallahu salaam we don't have any explanation whether it's the short one or the long one but the majority of people who pray on funerals offer the long ones then you offer the third tech beer allahu akbar and what do you say afterwards this is what we will find inshallah after the break and welcome back as stated before the break funeral prayer consists of four takbir first one fatiha second one you offer salah to salaam on the prophet third one you supplicate for the deceased what do you mean by supplicating for the disease there are a number of supplications that we were taught by the prophet and so on so all what you do is you supplicate for the sake of the deceased that allah enlarges his grave that allah makes it a garden of paradise and that allah washes him from his sins as the though or the garment is cleaned and cleansed by washing it with water snow and you go on asking that allah substitute him with better family and better house than he had here and then may allah grant the patience and tolerance to his family who lost their loved ones and you ask allah azzawajal to make him steadfast in this life and the hereafter with the right word of the kalima and you ask so many things all for the sake of the deceased and then you offer takbir the fourth tech beer and you do not say a thing a short pause and then you go assalamu alaikum warahmatullah to the right only this is the format that the majority of muslims worldwide do it it's very easy but sometimes people forget a lot of the times when we have funeral prayer people because they don't offer it they say what's after the fatiha after the second tech beer what do you do i don't know i forgot and they get confused so what is the ruling if i miss few of the tech beers so i come to the imam when he's offering the third tech beer says i say the first one i recite the fatiha when he says allah but the fourth assalamu alaikum i say allah the second muhammad allahu akbar the third allah no one would relate the second and the third with the name of allah and then i would offer the dua as long as the funeral is still there and i offer salam after the fourth takbir and this is approximately what may be regarding the funeral prayer do you have any questions here yes brother the father and the short surah is to be decided loudly or silently no the fatiha should be recited the whole prayer is a silent prayer there are some narrations that some of the companions raise their voice only to teach those behind them that they are reciting and he said this clearly that i did this so that you would learn that there is fatih had to be recited here but yes the norm is the whole prayer is prayed silently yes brother is regarding the deceased the cops um in today's time if we see if we donate an eye of uh of a person or if he for that matter even sell it we get a nice prize if you see so is it allowed to donate or if the family is poor can they sell the disease organs it's an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion whether in life or after death the body is not yours and hence you're not allowed to use or to donate anything of it while you're alive scholars differ and some say that it is permissible for you while you're alive to donate something that you do not need in your body for example if someone needs a liver transplant and of course they're not going to take her liver but some one told him i'm not sure you have to go to a surgeon or to a doctor to verify this they take a piece of the liver which grows afterwards so if this is the case and this would not harm me i can donate my liver kidneys is a different issue altogether some say that we have two so we can donate one to me this is not applicable at all because allah gave you two and you never know when you need them so if you donate one to work with one might be very hazardous for you and you may need this now donating after death is a complete different story because the prophet said allah the breaking of a dead bone of a dead person's bone is as severe and as forbidden as breaking it for a living person and the prophet allah forbade us from mutilating a dead person's body and what is more mutilating than having his kidney his heart his eyes as a spare parts he's being used as a scar's spare part this is not permissible he has to be honored he has to be buried with dignity one would say okay what about the living the living are going to die so prolonging it couple of years more by doing such forbidden acts is not a solution so this is regarding a person who goes missing uh like you know for many years like about 25 30 years that person has gone missing or was picked up by someone and nobody knows where that person is and that's well past the normal age that people live so in that case uh what are we supposed to do i mean supposed to pray the funeral prayer what we are supposed to pray the funeral prayer only if the judge the muslim judge rules that he is now considered to be dead and by this they don't do it by five months time or a year time usually it takes approximately like four years time or so it differs from one school of thought to the other but once the judge rules it then he is deemed to be dead he is given funeral prayer and also his wife stays the red of death which is four months and ten days and the inheritance is being distributed only when the ruler does this suppose a man and his wife go for raj and the man dies so should the woman complete the hajj without a mehram or return back and complete the the woman is obliged to leave because she does not have a mahram and she has to observe her preda and by completing her hajj she is not doing so analyzer knows best because of the ignorance of many people of how to govern in the player would be appropriate on the part of the person who reads the player to indicate to the people the modality of praying and if possible during the course of the prayer through whispers like in the father like is it appropriate this is possible this is possible and it's being done in a lot of the masjids and even sometimes when i pray funeral prayer i indicate and teach the people and i say before starting the prayer it consists of four takbir after the first fatiha the second you offer salutation the third you we do this all the time now regarding of the whispering part this might become a reason to distract people from praying because you are the one with the microphone so if you are whispering and i am also trying to make dua i'm confused because you're saying and i'm saying something else so you're confusing me so most likely no you're not supposed to raise your voice or whisper so that people would know it's sufficient it's enough for you to tell them that the prayer is composed of this and this and this and that is all inshallah the brother with the red shirt though you should change your red shirts because red shirts are not permitted for men to wear gum shake one uh what are the people who work in the ships they stay for years uh in the oceans in the ship so if they die they have two reasons if they send the body back to the home which takes few days or they dispose the body in the ocean so what should be no they should not dispose of the body in the ocean especially nowadays the furthest you could go is couple of days or three days and then there is a city there is a country there is a land that you can dock in and you can bury the body you don't have to wait until you send it back home again if i die in india my will is that i'm buried and where i die why is it why should i go back to saudi arabia if i die in uk i would like to be buried wherever i die and this is the proper way of doing it and it was reported that her brother of ishmael appears with her died in the valley of abyssinia and they brought him to medina and she said by allah if i knew i would have instructed them to bury him where he died because transporting a corpse all this long is not a part of the sun i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today until we meet next time allah foreign"
