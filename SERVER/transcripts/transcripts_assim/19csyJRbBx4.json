  "transcript": "the first question is how many times do you have to wipe over your face your arms your feet during will do how what how many times do you have to wipe okay your face or your arms but you know we do we'll do when you wipe your arms how many times do you have to do that for we'll do like one time or two times or okay how many times second time as well for your arms and so Abdullah from Canada has his first question was what's the ruling on he used the word sorry asadullah I apologize I wrote it Abdullah I I said the last question was what's your ring on wiping you do not wipe during wooden you wash so just pouring the water on your arm is sufficient now what is the ring on rubbing and this is not wiping because the water is there so you just add something which is rubbing the face the arms the feet the rubbing itself is recommended Sunnah it known in Arabic as a delq but it is not mandatory so if I wash my arm and hand and there is no spot unwashed Tolleson it does the job if you'd like to rub on it this is good the sooner I should do it once the soon let's you do it twice and the sooner is to do it three times the Prophet did all Ali salata sir so the max is free the minimum is 1 and which ever you choose is ok so if I were to wash my face three times and then decide to wash my arms and hand once and then wipe on my head once and wash my feet twice no problem three two one one two three all three all twos or once this is up to you the sky's the limit"
