  "title": "Should I divide charity over last 10 nights of Ramadan or give it in one lump sum? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "when it comes to giving in the last 10 nights can one intend to give a certain amount each night dividing the amount in intention but donating a lump sum or even each night no this is a an innovation there was a circulation of a whatsapp message that sheikh maharaja of the haram imam of the haram said that every night you have to pray two raka's so that it would be this and that you have to give charity so it would be this and that oh this is all not true and not authentic you when you want to give give immediately the whole thing don't divide it you will not be certain if you're going to live after tonight or not and there wasn't any recommendation from the prophet allah islam or one of his sunnah that every night he used to give a date or he wish to give food or used to give charity so trying to divide your donations over these ten nights is an innovation that is baseless allah knows best"
