  "title": "Should Ameen be said loudly or silently after fateha? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "should the Amin be said loudly or silent silently in loud raucous it has to be said loudly because this is the Sunnah of the Prophet s awesome whenever in a loud raka he finishes the Fatiha he used to say Amin so that the row behind him and behind them can hear it so it's a Sunnah to say mean and what is the Sunnah to prolong it by saying mean this is not Arabic is not Arabic is Arabic so lengthening it prolonging it in the beginning this changes the meaning because there is a word that Arabic is mean meaning going in the direction of and this is a part of a verse of the Quran mean al-masjid al-haram for longing the last part of it is permissible so you can say me but to prolong it to long is not from the Sunnah just prolong it enough to know that there is a med in it mean this is more than enough in sha Allah"
