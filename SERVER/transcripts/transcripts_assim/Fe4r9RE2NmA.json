  "title": "Is memorizing the chain of Narrators of Hadith Mandatory Knowledge",
  "transcript": "Rock clip from Bangladesh Chef my question is is it a part of mandatory knowledge to learn and memorize the hadith's narrators of hadith's incidents that took place in the hadiths ETC and so on or is it simply enough to learn and memorize the context of the hadiths this depends if you want to become a scholar of Islam not like us if you want to become someone who is a scholar you have to rely on memorization this is what all Scholars say a student of knowledge who's dedicated to serving Islam has to memorize at an early age because when you're my age you tend to forget things and even your understanding for things would be hampered while your memorization of the things you've learned early on in your teens or when you were young remain with you till the end of time with the grace of Allah therefore they say a student of knowledge must see a concise book of for example that has been authenticated and approved by a school of thought let's say hanafi school of thought so the the scholars of the hanafi school of thought they say that this is an authentic approved um concise book and it has many explanations it was explained by many scholars in different books so that whenever you're in a dilemma you can find what the scholars had said about this issue memorize this concise book and you should do that on at the hands of a scholar in that school so when you finish it you would have accomplished a great deal of knowledge now you can expand and maybe study other books of the same school and then go to other schools of thought and compare school to a school and go to see the evidences they've used and start developing and evolving as a student of knowledge but for someone like us normal people who are not interested or who are unable to become real Scholars in this case memorizing the narrators of the Hadith and going into small details is not going to add a lot of value for you or to you what counts is is the Hadith authentic or not it's authentic study all the other hadiths that talk about the same subject so that you can have an understanding and not leave any man behind as they say don't leave any Hadith un uh studied and now you have full knowledge of the topic you can look into what the scholar said about it and you can come with a conclusion and this is the thing that counts this is the conclusion I've reached that would allow me to meet along the day of judgment feeling comfortable that I did my due diligence and I did my best but to go into details about the narrators the incidents where it did happen the time Etc this may be for you and I something above our pay grade and a waste of time"
