  "title": "Hadith Proving that Shia are wrong about Ali being the Successor - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "hope to file one of the tab Irene said that ID even ABI talib may Allah be pleased with him was asked did the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam grant you something special which he did not grant to anyone else so he said no he did not specify us with something other than the general public except to what I have in my sheath and this is where you put your sword so it's like something that you put in so he took out a piece of paper and in it was written may allah azza wajal curse those who slaughter to other than Allah may Allah the Almighty curse those who change the landmarks of the land may Allah curse those who curse their parents and may Allah curse whoever gives shelter to my death and we will come to mention the special law first of all what do we learn from this hadith we learn that the raw field while being commonly known as a Shia Roffe Allah is the name the actual Islamic name o ma sha allah is referred on some system Rafaela are the shia who go to extreme in their acclaimed love of Ahlul Bayt and this is a total fabrication and a lie they do not love a debate they are a big chunk of hypocrites trying to undermine Islam and the Sunnah of the Prophet array salat WA Salam it their religion is based on total lies and we can have a long discussion from their books proving that but this is not the time so why do we say that this hadith exemplifies illustrates that they are liars because they say that Ali has an Hussein and those descendants of them have knowledge of Islam that no one shares with them and this is why this hadith is very important to us because we believe that ID may Allah be pleased with him it is seeded number four in the best of the companions so Abu Bakr Omar Othman this is their ranking in Islam Adi is their fourth without any doubt so he was asked do you have anything specific should I pose or do something okay so he was asked do you have anything specific that calls you to be more distinct than others he said nothing everything you have I have except this that I have registered in my paper so one would think that it's a registration of a land piece of land only for him or special powers or that he is the successor after the Prophet and something special and when he brought the paper there are four things in them and they're all cursed so they are about sins"
