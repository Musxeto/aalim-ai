  "transcript": "Mujtaba says when we meet our elders we meet and greet them by bowing down a little out of respect and they put their hands on our heads is this permissible if not then advise me on how should we greet elders this Mojtaba includes bowing which bowing is arribada is a form of worship to Allah as the hwachun Muslims do not bow do not prostrate other than to allah subhana wa ta'ala because this is a form of worship which cannot be diverted or redirected to any other than allah azzawajal therefore bowing down even little for the elders and for them to put their hands over the heads and i'm presuming it's the same gender or it's Muharram this is not permissible because this shows a great deal an amount of submission so you are submissive to this uncle or to this grandfather and you're bowing your head and you're waiting for the blessing of him touching your head all of this is not permissible so what to do Sheikh if we don't do this they become angry this makes it even worse see kissing the hand of a parent is totally legit kissing the hand of a scholar is permissible if it is a form of getting closer to Allah not a form of praising this scholar the scholars say such as in a now Ian and others if the person you're kissing his hand is giving you his hand to kiss like some of you know the officials and the big shots they expect everyone to kiss their hands or to kiss their ring if someone does this becomes more prohibited for you to do that you should not do this even if he becomes angry because then this is a form of humiliation he's humiliating you by you kissing his hand so what do you think about someone who expects you to bow to him top what about the Japanese it's a culture in Japan and maybe I don't know if in Korea or somewhere where they just you know bow down encourage walk this is not permissible it's a cultural thing but when Islam comes it transforms you inside out so whatever is permissible in our religion you have the green light if not then you have to refrain whether people are angry or happy this is not our problem my problem is that Allah would be happy with me"
