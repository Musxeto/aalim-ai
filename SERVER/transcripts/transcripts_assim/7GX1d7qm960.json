  "transcript": "can one take things on installments is it permissible the vast majority of scholars say that buying things in installments is hella some scholars say that this is not permissible and among them is shekel albani but the vast majority and share the same Tamiya said that this is permissible BIM Basma they mean the whole nine yards providing that there are two conditions to be fulfilled condition number one that you buy what you're buying from the owner because nowadays if I come to you and I say I'd like to buy this mobile from you and you said I don't have the mobile but I can get it from a third party and I said okay how much and you would say this mobile costs a hundred pounds I'll sell it to you over the period of two years for a hundred and twenty-five pounds I said that's fine that's cool with me instead sign these contracts these contracts are binding and you're obliged to transfer this amount to my back account done deal done deal I go and buy the mobile phone and I give it to the customer and hamdullah this is haram why because when I sold you the mobile I had no interest in buying or selling my interest is in giving you a hundred pounds loan and getting it back to 125 there's no risk on me of these of this mobile be I'm being stuck with it I can't sell it to anyone and I have to go maybe below a hundred pounds maybe a little bit more there's no risk this is haram you must buy in installments from the owner so I can do to justify this is when you come and say I'd like to buy this mobile phone and said come after a couple of days I go and buy the phone and I bring it in my shop two days later you come and say did you get the phone and said yes here's the phone I'll sell it for you for 125 you have the option to say no that's too much tell you what I changed my mind I'm gonna buy something else I have no right to say hey I bought this for you now I'm stuck with it no this is selling I'm buying there is the risk of making a profit or making a loss so this is condition number one so okay I'm buying it from the owner the second condition is that the final price is fixed and done so when you come and buy this and I tell you okay I own the phone I'll sell it for you or to you for 125 pounds you should agree so I give it to you and you start paying in installments a couple of months down the line you call and say listen okay I I'm in deep financial problems and I think I'm not gonna be able to pay you for that installments for a couple of months so please can you bear with me and I said no I can't if you got a delay by two months you have to make it 130 pounds so I will add to it for the delay and you say um okay this is RIBA likewise if the final price and this happens in mortgages is fluctuating due to inflation due to the interest rate so the agreement was that I buy the property for a million six seven months he says well now it's a million and 200,000 a year later is a million and three hundred thousand what is this this is totally prohibited and this is RIBA that is not accepted"
