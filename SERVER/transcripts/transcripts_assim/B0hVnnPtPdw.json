  "title": "Can we make Wudu with water  that is colored with rust? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "from saudi arabia she says that sometimes due to not impurities due to mud in the water tank when we get water from the faucet it is colored it's a little bit murky sometimes due to the corrosion in the uh pipes iron pipes that we get these uh water with color in it so can we perform wudu can we wash the toilets can we perform muscle dancers yes this is water the change in color does not render the water unusable unless the change of color was due to an impurity and a jazzer so if the color in this glass or this cup the water changed with an impurity a drop of urine some pieces of feces then yes this immediately becomes nudges because one of the three characteristics of water color taste or smell change due an impurity but if the character characteristics change due to something that is pure such as flower such as mud or sand then it is still called water and the change of one of these three characteristics does not impact its purity"
