  "transcript": "Yunus says if I have something stuck in my mouth while praying and I swallow it will my prayer be broken well let me add to that with my fast be broken as well see the things you've got stuck in your mouth in your teeth either they are so negligible that you cannot touch it you cannot take it out it's like saliva it's dissolved in your saliva like the taste of orange juice after drinking a glass of orange juice so even in the salat you can find the taste this is something that is inevitable you cannot avoid so swallowing this does not have any impact on your prayer or your fasting but if you have a small piece of meat between your teeth and you do this all the time while praying or fasting and all of a sudden it came out and it sit on your tip of your tongue you can easily take it out while praying or fasting but you say to yourself oh this is too small let me swallow it your prayers becomes nullified it's invalid and your fasting has been broken because this is considered to be eating even if it's negligible as long as it's a particle that you've swallowed intentionally then it's void now if it got out you tried the level best to take it out but you swallow it swallowed it instead mistakenly you tried but it's out of your control that you had swallowed it the answer is you're fast and prayer is intact and still valid"
