  "transcript": "we continue to study this blessed book of um and with the grace of allah we finished 84 hadiths of it which is an achievement that could not have been possible had it not been to the grace and blessing of allah azzawajal all praise be to him and we have two hadiths that revolve on the same topics that we mentioned last time we met so we have to read it and say if there is anything to be highlighted so that we would be considered to have read the whole book and finished a whole metin or a whole text of knowledge as it is known among the students of knowledge hadith number 85 yes brother narrated whenever allah's messenger stood for salat he said allahu akbar on starting the prayer and then on bowing on rising from bowing he said and then while standing straight he used to say rabbana so this is two narrations is one of the narrators of the hadith he used to say takbir on prostrating and on raising his head from prostration again he would say takbir on prostrating and on raising his head from prostration he would then do the same in the whole of the prayer till it was completed and on raising from the second rakat after sitting for atahi he used to say hadith number 86 yes brother narrated abdullah imran bin hussain and i offered the prayer behind ali ibn abi talib when ali prostrated he said the takbir when he raised his head he said takbir and when he got up for the third raka he said the takbir on completion of the prayer imran took my hand and said this ali radhi allah made me remember the salah of muhammad sallam he said he led us in the salah like that of muhammad sallam now these two hadiths are similar to the ones that we've read before and there is no extra knowledge in it except scholars say that the emphasis on takbir between pillars and that is why scholars differed what is the ruling on such tech beer some of the schools of thought stated that it is mandatory upon all whether imam follower or individual to say that before moving from one pillar to the other when you bow when you prostrate when you sit from the prostration you always have to say allahu akbar they say this is mandatory and among them is they say that this is mandatory other schools of thought said that it is sunnah it is recommended yet the difference is very important why because if it's sunnah if i go to the bowing position without saying allahu akbar if i just go like this the schools that say it's okay make my prayer okay but according to imam ahmad and to the imam of the school they say your prayer is invalid if you did that intentionally and the most authentic opinion is that it is mandatory to say the takbir before moving from one pillar to the other and to say semi allahu liman when you raise your head from the bowing position this is the most authentic opinion simply because the prophet said allah pray as you have seen me pray and this was all the time done by the prophet hassam not left out a single time so it means that it was mandatory now if you look at prayer you would find that glorifying allah azzawajal is throughout the whole prayer what is the most frequent phrase that we say in prayer allahu akbar and we seem to neglect that allah azza is bigger than anything that crosses our mind imagine how many times do we hear them say allahu akbar throughout the day and night i will not let you calculate 50 times 30 in the adhan and 20 in the hammer so 50 times you repeat behind the imam allah well 30 times for the adhan and you hear it 50 times not only that in a single unit in a single rakah how many times you say allah when we bow when we prostrate sit prostrate and stand so in a prayer of four rakah at least if in the five daily prayers with the sunnan you would probably do 120 130 give or take you as an individual after you finish prayer subhanallah allah three times multiply by five you do the math before you go to bed allahu akbar 34 times when you offer sabato eid allah seven times and five times so takbir is everywhere in our religion to the extent i would not be exaggerating if i say that this is brainwashing but it is a positive brain washing form of brainwashing why when you all the time repeat allahu akbar allahu akbar what does that translate to allah is greater than but you never seem to mention what allah is greater than you simply say allah is greater than so is he greater than my father who instructs me to do bad things and forces me to sin yes he is is he greater than my teacher or my headmaster yes he is is he greater than my wife who keeps on nagging and demanding and wanting this and wanting that yes he is is he greater than my boss who i think has the ability to give me a bonus or to kick me out yes he is so when i stand in prayer and say allahu akbar i actually feel what this great word means and that is why the prophet whenever he attacked a city or a villager allah whenever they went up a mountain they would say allahu akbar and they would praise allah whenever they went to a valley so saying allahu akbar is something that is great and it is the essence of our prayer to glorify allah azzawajal to praise allah this is what prayer is used for so this form of brainwashing it's a positive one because if you want to sin you always remember and likewise if you watch for example like so many people do if you watch wrestling a lot of the muslims are so into wwo w w i ww whatever they have so many names and i've seen the children in saturday we are wearing t-shirts with wrestlers on pictures idols they don't know that this is a form of brainwashing why because the more you watch it it's embedded in your brains that these kafir or these disbelievers or these non-muslims are strong are so powerful they hit them with the axes they hit them with sticks they hit them with chairs with ladders with boots nothing happens to them i accidentally run into the door i start bleeding all over then these guys are superman and this makes us afraid intimidated makes us feel small and weak why because we are brainwashing ourselves they think we think that they are the strongest but they're not allahu akbar so that is why when we contemplate and believe in that allah is greater than anything else we learn our religion we perfect our salah as well we move on to hadith of al-bara and who will read it to us yes brother al-barrah even reported i noticed paid careful attention to the salat of muhammad sallallahu alaihi sallam and saw his qiyam standing his ruku bowing and then going back to the standing position after bowing his sajdah prostration his jalsa sitting between the two prostrations his sajdah and jealous between taslim salutation and going away all these were nearly equal to one another muslim the roku bowing of the prophet as well as his subjugate prostration sitting bayina detained in between the two frustrations and the standing when he raised his head from bowing but not qiyam standing in the prayer nor kunud sitting in the prayer used to be approximately equal in duration okay this translation again is a little bit different to the text itself of um it is much less in um than this because this was taken from the original books of bukhari and muslim we have a short break and afterwards inshaallah we'll be discussing the lessons to be learned from this hadith so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back this hadith of barack be pleased with him is to be looked at in its totality he is describing how the prophet islam used to pray beside the quran bow raise his head from bowing prostrate sit prostrate and stand up and then sit for tahiyat or for the final sitting where he makes the shahood and he said all of those were close in duration now one would say this is not possible because we know that the recitation of the quran and the sitting for the shahood is not equivalent to sitting between the two prostration for example or for standing erect after bowing scholars say yes in totality the bowing the raising up from the bowing the prostration and the sitting between the two prostrations we're alike this is the sunnah of the prophet salallahu salaam unlike what a lot of the lazy people do because a lot of the lazy people when they raise their heads from semi allahu limah they pose for few seconds and then prostrate and when you tell them why do you do this they say because raising the head from prostration and standing it's a minor rooken a minor pillar so there is nothing much to say is it there is a lot to say the prophet when he raised his head used to say allah how long would this take if you say it in a normal voice a lot so this is the sun of the prophet joseph so these should be in approximate same duration but standing up and the shahood they should be also in similar duration however they can never be the same because the recitation is always longer than that the shahad which are few phrases or paragraphs that you read if you notice how the people pray you find that there is no relativity in the sense that a lot of the muslims when they bow they tend to think that this is an easy pillar so subhanallah three times when they prostrate they prolong it why because it's a place of dua and this is wrong it should be all equal some of the imams go even to a further mistake when they prolong the last frustration so the last prostration they prolonged it so long so they make duas and then they say allahu akbar and they sit for the final to shahood and this is wrong this is not part of the sunnah the duration should be approximately equal to each other throughout the whole prayer if you prolong the first prostration prolong all the frustrations the rucour should be also similar to the prostration moving on to hadith number 88 and with it we will conclude inshallah and take your questions yes brother the great scholar of reported on the authority of anas i will not fall short in making every effort to lead you in the prayer just as i saw the messenger of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam leading us in prayer heath habit said anas used to do something which i do not see you doing when he lifted his head from bowing he stood up erect straightening his back so long that one would say he has forgotten to bow down in prostration and when he lifted his head from prostration he stayed in that position so long until someone would say he has forgotten to perform the second prostration all muslim fabital bhunani was one of the close tabirin to anasavit malik and that is why he reported a lot of his hadiths and he is saying that anas once came and said i will pray the prayer of the prophet alaihis was as he used to pray it so he is teaching them by example and this is one of the best methods of teaching the prophet isam he himself used to do this when he used to pray he used to climb up the mimbar the podium and he used to pray when he wanted to offer sujud he used to go down and offer to judge so that people would cite this and see it and be able to learn from him so annas is doing this and therefore if a mother or a father pray in order to teach their children this is permissible one would not say oh this is shirk no the companions did it the intention of prayer is for whom for allah but with also another intention that people would learn the sunnah so it would be yani to or twice or double the reward and thabit is describing he's saying the thing that i've noticed strange than what we pray nowadays which means that we've neglected and abandoned the sunnah is that when anas raised his head from bowing saying he used to stay erect standing for so long that we tell ourselves i think he forgot that he has to prostrate maybe he's thinking somewhere else and when he sat between the two prostrations he sat for so long that we thought that he forgot what does this mean it means that those who raise their heads and prostrate immediately they are not following the sunnah anas is describing the sunnah of the prophet and to our neglect to our own ignorance we do not know a lot of the supplications that the prophet used to say alison if we learn them then you will be able to prolong the standing position after bowie and to prolong your sitting position after prostrating and both positions the prophet used to say a very simple word and repeats it 10 20 30 allah how many he used to say this is after raising your head from the bowing and in the sitting between prostrations he used to say rubber fairly rubber fairly rubber fairly and repeats it so how long can you say this as many as you want but to prolong your prayer so it would resemble the prayer of the prophet we take your questions now yes we did not cover this question that was where to place your hands during the salah in the qiyam is it on the chest or is it on the navel or below the navel okay this is a good question while in the crm where do i put the right hand over the left hand is it on my chest on my stomach or under the navel the hadith of may allah be pleased with him he stated that the prophet said putting the right over the left hand on the chest is sunnah of the messengers of the prophets and he used to put it on his chest now the chest is here so if you put it here if you put it here it's okay not here this is the neck some people pray like this and this is not part of the sunnah sunnah is to pray like this some people in some countries have noticed they do like this why are you doing this says i put my hand on my heart this is good for sure what about if you have a deformity and you have your heart or your right you will miss everything in the row this is not part of the sunnah this is an innovation the right thing is to put it generally standing in a normal position right over the left on the chest now what we have not mentioned because this is not as i said detailed text how to put the right hand on the left there are two ways either to put the palm on the palm like this and part of it comes to the arm or you hold your wrist like a fist you hold your wrist doing this is not part of the sunnah because this is in between either do this or hold it as a fist what people do like this is wrong because this is putting your hands on almost up to your biceps and some of them put it on his waist like this and this is forbidden in islam so you have to understand that the sunnah came to put the right on the left like this or to hold your wrist like this and to put it on your chest putting it under the navel is not backed by an authentic hadith at all though a lot of the followers of the school of thought of hanafi madhhab do this yet it is not backed by an authentic hadith and some even go like the followers of maliki madhhab are not putting it all on the chest they just simply put it down having said that is there salah accepted or rejected this is a sunnah so whatever they do it is accepted but they have abandoned the sunnah and they've lost the reward i'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
