  "title": "Can Women pray with niqab on in front of Non Mahram Men, praying with Face Mask(Covid) Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "arisha or archie says we know that it is not permissible to pray with our face covered however if women are praying in public or in front of nan mahram men is it permissible to pray with niqab on the answer is yes this is a legitimate reason that allows a woman to cover her face while praying due to the presence of nan mahara men and just before shooting and starting this program one of the brothers a cameraman came to me and said we prayed maghrib just now wearing face masks so is this permissible and i said to him in islam it is makru to pray while putting a a a a piece of cloth covering your face we we call it litham so it is not recommended and some say it's not permissible because this defies the purpose of praying in humility to allah azza but in the presence of the fear of covet 19 or being infected or infecting others this becomes mandatory for you to wear and wearing it does not impact your prayer and allah azza knows best you"
