  "transcript": "is says what is the ruling on a sunni man marrying a shia woman shia are not all alike some of them are muslims like us but they have a problem in the hierarchy of the muslim caliphs so they say we love abu bakr we love umar but we love ali more than we love earth man and this is how they should have ruled some of them go a little bit extreme and they say that ali is better than all of the other three some go way too extreme when they curse abu bakr and omar on earth man and the rest of the companions all of them except a handful of companions such as ammar nyaser salman etc some even go further to slander mother isha and accuse her of zina and being among the people of hellfire as hafsah the mother of the believer as well the daughter of omar mahatab so you can't paint them with the same brush but the vast majority of shia who are noun who are now known to be the shia are those from iran those who are following the imamiyah and these have strong issues according to our akida as a sunnah we can't nullify a person's islam without concrete proof so as we are not talking about a specific individual we're talking about a belief this is easier so we can easily say that anyone who slaunders mother aisha and says that she committed fornication or adultery and by that he would be falsifying the quran where allah proved her innocence in the quran in surat and nor such a person is a kafir for rejecting the quran so all those who curse abu bakr um and the rest of the companions they're actually cursing this the religion they convey to us and they are falsifying the hadith where the prophet said that they are all in jannah so such people it's definitely not permissible for a sunni muslim or for any muslim to marry from these are apostates blatant kafir disbelievers now we get people coming to us and say sheikh the woman i want to marry doesn't curse the companions and she does not slander mother aisha the only thing that differs with us is that she follows the of al-jafariyah which is different than ours and in terms of akida she loves ali al-hasan and hussein okay we all love them yeah but she prefers them more than the the rest but she respects the rest and says that they are companions of the prophet so in short that individual is a muslim however marrying a shia with such a belief would negatively impact your children because she sits with them more than you and not only that their uncles maternal uncles and aunts would be from the shia so they will have feelings towards shia and the worst thing of all is if she's using which is lying in order to protect their beliefs as it is part of the beliefs of the shia and she's saying this to you so that you get married to her and then she shows her other face this is even the worst of all so in short i would say that it is not permissible to marry someone from the shia sect due to what you have heard earlier and allah zogel knows best"
