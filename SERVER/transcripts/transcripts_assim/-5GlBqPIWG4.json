  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Singapore my question is uh \ncan a new reward uh pre-seller while wearing   headphones because he keep on forgetting his uh \nAl-Fatiha can he wear can he pray wearing what   wearing earbuds or headphones okay so a new revert \ndoes not know the Fatiha can he put earpods or   headphones and plays the the Fatiha and says Imam \nor the reciter says in his ears he says and the   guy says this is permissible this is totally \npermissible and it would have been much better   and less distracting if he were to get a written \npaper or from his iPhone where he can read it   that's less distracting than hearing it \nand sometimes the Imam or the reciter May   read two three ayas and you missed one eye \nand how to rewind how to go back that would   be a lot of hassle that would make you \nforget the Salah and not enjoy it rather   than recite reading it from a piece of paper \nthat is more convenient and large Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
