  "transcript": "thirdly Malika says that what is the ruling on washing the thobe that was licked by a dog the hadith that refers to this in the Sunnah relates to licking utensils the Prophet said that is awesome either well of Al Calvo FINA I had to come if the dog were to lick in the pot in the vessel in the plate of one of you he should wash it seven times in a narration eight times one of them in a narration the first one of them is by soiled so this is the hardest and most extreme form of impurity urine if it's it falls on my table or what I have to do is wash that spot once or twice until the urine is gone that's it this is normal Natasa any impurity is done likewise with the dog in this in the pot or in the vessel and the plate it has to be washed first of all with soil sand from the from the ground and then 8 or 7 times with water seven times now what happens if I'm walking and a dog comes and sniffs my trousers or licks my trousers or my fob or my abaya etc some scholars say you have to do the seven times plus the soiling even with your clothes and this is the map of the humbly school of thought but this is a weak opinion the most authentic opinion is that soiling and washing seven times is only for utensils that we eat in the clothes are washed normally analyzer gel knows best"
