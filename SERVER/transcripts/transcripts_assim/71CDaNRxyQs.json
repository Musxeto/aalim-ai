  "transcript": "the Imam went for work or before I could finish my Fatiha in a silent prayer what should i do well this depends if you are usually slow because everyone else went into the core which means that either you came late or you are usually slow in the way you recite then you have to correct yourself reciting the Fatiha normally takes 2 to 3 seconds so even if the amount goes for Rikuo I can say blimey no matter how many human ear can I believe I can say you know dinosaur Tom stop himself alladhina I'm charlie writing about the very model in Allah end of story if you have a problem in say Shaykh I can't recite it like this I have to go alhamdulillah here oh man am i will finish the prayer you did not finish your fatiha what are you doing be moderate not tooks too slow and not too fast but if the imam goes for record and you did not finish you fatiha you must finish your fatiha if you're not exempted meaning if you entered with him in the beginning so finish your fatty has quick as you can if he says semi Allah him and Hamidah and you did not go for Rukh or you can follow him in ruku though he did not wait for you you can catch up even if you miss a pillar or two because you had a legitimate reason which was he was too fast or you did your best to catch up with him and there's no problem in that inshallah but if you have a problem meaning that you are too slow then this raka is invalid you have to pray another rocker after his Salam"
