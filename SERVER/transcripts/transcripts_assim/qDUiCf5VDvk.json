  "transcript": "my school wants me to do to post pictures on the school platform where I was helping the community and doing good deeds by you know I don't know if I was doing something good with the community helping them okay they wanted as a school project their project is it permissible to do this or is it exposing my good deeds okay first of all Allah azzawajal says in the Quran interview if you show and expose your charity that's good and if you conceal it and you give it to the poor then Allah would forgive your sins so the higher level is that you conceal your good deeds so that no one knows about it but it depends if you're a person who's looked up to like a shared scholar a one of the dignity in the community and you know that the moment you do show your good deeds not to impress others this is between you and Allah you're doing it for the sake of Allah but you know that you would be a role model and people would follow you then you should do that remember the Hadith in the sahih people from mudar the tribe of mudar a an honorable tribe of Arabia came into the Masjid must their clothes are torn and worn out as an indication of their poverty when the prophet saw them his face changed so he climbed the pulpit the pulpit and he praised Allah o facilitation upon the prophet Islam and recited encouraging people to keep a visor or a um a screen between them and hellfire through charity then he encouraged them to give charity no man moved they heard the sermon good speech whoa nobody acted until one of the companions rushed out of the Masjid came back with a big bag of food and clothes barely able to carry it and then he placed it in front of the Prophet is the moment people saw this they woke up and immediately they went out home brought whatever they can and brought it in front of the Prophet salaam piling up a mountain of food and clothes the prophets face lit and whenever he was happy it was like the Moon when it's full so beautiful and then he praised what the first man did and he said whoever does something good where people follow him he will be awarded exactly the same amount of Good Deeds all of those who followed him had gained without deducting or reducing any of their Good Deeds wow just because he initiated it imagine if this first sahabi this companion did not pay heat to what the prophet said and he said no if I go and get the food and the clothes people would say oh what a show-off and I would be exposing my good deeds I'd rather wait until night time and then give something discreetly on my own imagine if he had this thought Crossing his mind like so many of us do this is what shaytan does this is what Satan does he tries to put you down put you off what am I putting people down I don't know he tries to put you off things and not to encourage you to do good deeds now if these posts let's assume in Ramadan you did iftar for the the poor in the Masjid or you went to poor neighborhoods and gave them food or clothes or helped in Sheltering the that's excellent and a good deed if you know that you've done this for the sake of Allah and they want you to post it so that you would encourage others and in these photographs or posts you don't have women's pictures it's only men and you don't expose the poor unfortunately like so many people do when they go to refugee camps and they take selfies them giving them food money clothes and you can see the faces of the poor this is inappropriate you could at least blur it I know some of the brothers ancestors would say we've taken permission from the refugees and they said they're fine they have lost everything this is not the end of the day rather they would feel that they would be encouraging others to help and donate yeah this is fine but generally speaking avoiding it is best so I see there is no problem in doing that brother Yusuf and Allah Knows Best"
