  "title": "Should we Raise hands to make Prophetic Dua Sayyid al Istighfar",
  "transcript": "Ashiq, Ashiq from Saudi Arabia. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Can we raise our hands when making duas that are reported from Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam such as Sayyidil Istighfar? The answer is no, because when the Prophet told us Alayhis Salatu Wassalam what to say in these forms of dua such as Sayyidil Istighfar, he did not tell us to raise our hands and he did not raise his hands himself. And therefore whatever is prescribed of the adhkar of the morning and the evening and at night time, we say it as it is without raising the hands. But if the time is a time of answering dua such as between Adhan and Iqamah, or when the Imam sits between the two khutbas and you raise your hand and make dua, there is nothing prescribed here, you can do that without a problem. And Allah knows best."
