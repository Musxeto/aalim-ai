  "transcript": "so the question of halima is can a woman be in seclusion alone with a man in when she's in need for that and she gave an example when a woman who lives in an apartment or hostel and she wants to go to another hostel and this is a social worker that she has to sit with and explain why she wants to relocate the answer is no this seclusion has to be broken either by bringing her relative by bringing her friend because the prophet alaihis stated that no man would be alone with a woman in seclusion except the third person with them would be satan now what would satan say to them fear allah remember allah make the care of course not he would do things that he was made to do this is his job description and this is why the prophet salaam is warning us from doing this prohibited thing so we have to formulate our lives around the sharia so what the shariah says okay we do it what the sharia says stop we have to refrain from it and not the other way around"
