  "title": "Is rejecting a Hadith or thinking its weak KUFR? Spitting 3 times in prayer for wiswas?",
  "transcript": "Akaris from Kazakhstan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh If a man mocks spitting in the Salah, you know, and he thinks it's a weak Hadith, is he a Kafir? If someone is what? Spitting in Salah, spitting Spitting in Salat Sweetened, sweetened Yeah I don't understand. Are you talking about spitting saliva in front of you while praying? No, about Waswas Oh, so when you are praying and you get Waswas, you do, A'udhu Billahi Minash Shaitanir Rajeem, like this? Yes, and he thinks it's a weak Hadith and he mocks it No, this is not Kufr. See, Kufr is rejecting something that is known by default from religion. Someone who rejects that wine is Haram, he's a Kafir. Someone who says that taking Riba over loans is okay, he's a Kafir. Because this is mentioned in the Qur'an, the Sunnah, the consensus of the scholars. But someone who rejects something that can be not certain, not mutawatir, not known from religion by default, and he rejects a particular Hadith, but he believes in the rest and the whole entirety of the Hadith, he's not a Kafir, he's sinful, depending on his background, and Allah knows best."
