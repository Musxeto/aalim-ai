  "title": "Is my friendâ€™s lack of focus in prayer & rushing through it for worldly matters a punishment?",
  "transcript": "Farhan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh my friend doesn't concentrate in his prayer and he always worries about worldly things deliberately. He doesn't even try to remove those thoughts and he also shortens his prayer to do those chores and works. Nowadays he's failing at everything what he used to handle very smoothly. Is this a punishment from Allah for not concentrating in Salah deliberately and shortening it? JazakAllah Khair. What do you mean by shortening it? Yani he does not prolong it or he prays four rakah two rakahs? He prays four rakahs as four rakahs but he does not pray it like how good Muslims pray. Okay first of all again once a person prays and fulfills the mandatory acts of prayer meaning that he does the ruku, he does the sujood, he recites the Quran but he does not take his time. He just does the bare minimum saying Subhana Rabbi Al-Azim once in ruku, Subhana Rabbi Al-A'la once in sujood and the likes. He has done what is mandated but he did not do what would get him closer to Allah Azza wa Jal. And this is why in the hadith when a person prays Allah says to the registering angels, look how much my servant has acquired from his Salat. So they write one half, one third, quarter, fifth, sixth, seventh, until the tenth of it and they create a credit it with that only due to as you've stated shortening the duration of the prayer, doing the bare minimum, not concentrating, not having khushur, not reaping the benefits of the Salat and tasting the sweetness of it. And one tenth of the Salat is ten percent. What is this? So Allah with his mercy and generosity says look whether my servant has voluntary prayers so that you would compensate and complete the missing parts of his fard prayer. Therefore the bare minimum is to pray the fard prayers as I've described earlier. But once a person, a intellectual smart person doesn't want to have the bare minimum because you don't know if the bare minimum is sufficient or you're below that and you will have to do time in hellfire for that. So he tries his level best to perfect, take his time in his fard prayer, does it with khushur and he tries his level best to pray voluntary prayers before and after according to the prescribed sunnah. So it would compensate whatever is missing in his Salat. He would offer duha prayer, he would offer night prayer, he would offer witter, he would offer as many good deeds so it would complete what is missing. Maybe then Allah Azza wa Jal would reward him the highest levels in Jannah. Is what's happening to him at the moment a punishment from Allah for his flaws and shortcomings? This is only in Allah's knowledge. However any one of us would attribute any calamity or any problem in life to his own flaws and shortcomings and sins Allah knows best."
