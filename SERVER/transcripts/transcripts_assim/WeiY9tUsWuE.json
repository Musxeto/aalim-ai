  "transcript": "uh I have been dealing with the certain uncertainties regarding my parents who are Catholic I was born into a Catholic Family and I had recently converted and something that they I have been struggling with is their values regarding my prayers I have a local Moss that I can walk to in less than 3 minutes and they happen to have a problem with me being on time to my prayers because they feel like they have more authority over me and uh over my faith and how old is he I am 17 sir and do you tell them every time you leave the house and take their permission yeah I say I'm going to the mosque you shouldn't you shouldn't you just leave go and pray and come back they they throw I understand sir but they throw such a attention my fathers comes from a background of street value and all this so with his grumpy background and all this and that coming around it seems that and my mother as well you have to you have to understand the following number one there's no obedience to any human being in disobeying Allah the almighty If the message is 3 minutes far or 3 minutes away you time your workout or going to to shoot some Loops Hoops or whatever they call it playing basketball or going to the gym so time it so that you go and be able to pray your prayers in the Masjid while doing what you've convince them that you're going to do that is com hitting two birds with one stone be diplomatic be uh um polite and obedient but don't be weak don't show any weakness be firm on your religion while going out of your way to please them and to make them happy and laugh and to respect them and Obey them obey them but not when it comes to concessions in your religion never give concessions in Islam so you have to walk a very thin line with such a family with such parents but at the end of the day what pleases Allah must Prevail and Allah Knows Best"
