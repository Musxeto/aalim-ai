  "transcript": "Ana from Uganda Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, do Arabs come from Jews? And if yes, then is it from the story of Hajar and Ismail? If yes, then please narrate for me just that part. I did not understand your question. Do Arabs, what? Come from Jews. Okay, and what's the second question? If yes, then is it from the story of Hajar and Ismail? If yes, then please narrate for me just that part. Okay, you asked many questions and we only answered one. But for the benefit of the doubt, Arabs are definitely not from the Jews, and the Jews are not from the Arabs. Ibrahim, peace be upon him, had two sons. He had Ismail, whose mother was Hajar, and who was born in Mecca, in the Arabian Peninsula. And he had Ishaq, whose mother was Sarah. From Ishaq, there was Yaqub, Jacob, who was also a prophet. And from Jacob was Yusuf. And from the descendants of Ishaq, or Isaac, were the sons of Israel, the Jews. As for Ismail, peace be upon him, who was a messenger and a prophet, his descendants were the Arabs. And among them was our prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him. So they are cousins, but not from one another. They are different branches. So anyone who says anti-Semitism, when he attacks the Arabs, he's anti-Semitic. As well when he attacks the Jews, because they are from the same root, which is Ibrahim, peace be upon him. Hijr Ismail, not Hajar, Hijr Ismail, has nothing to do with the Jews at all. Because the Jews had nothing to do with Mecca. So your question is irrelevant, and Allah knows best. Thanks for watching!"
