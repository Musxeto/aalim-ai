  "transcript": "what does maintaining ties of kinship mean how often must we meet our kins and what if they all live in different countries and cities is text messaging considered as maintaining ties first of all kinship is your relationship from your father and mother's side so the relatives of your wife or your in-laws are not your kinship second of all there is no specific time limit to connect to your kinship in islam so in never you will find it it telling you uh one week is okay two is okay four weeks is a lot now you're severing your kinship and there is no form of way whether it's a text message or a phone call or an email or a normal postage letter or face to face meeting so this is all considered part of what al rurf dictates what is the norm in the community in your society in your tribe in your family so sometimes i call my cousins like once every couple of weeks and they're okay with that actually they don't call me usually i'm the one who initiates the call and that's fine because as long as our hearts are pure and we have nothing no grudges no no hard feelings it's not a touche i call you you call me no it is something you do for the sake of allah they have a lot of engagements and i'm a free person i don't have as much work related material to stop me from calling so i call them every couple of weeks maybe 10 days sometimes every week and i call my relatives like this sometimes i get involved a lot and i forget so i call them once every month and they're fine with that and some of them even if i don't call them the whole year and we meet only for eight they are totally fine with that and some of them if you don't call them for entire yani life your entire life they're fine with that they don't actually care whether you call or not they think that this is a materialistic thing one of my cousins i used to call every week and once he called me said listen awesome if you're calling me and this is exactly what he said and the guy prays the guy is a muslim but westernized he said if you're calling me to score a point with your lord don't call me but if you're calling me because i'm your cousin then yes you have no problem with that this is how some people think may allah help us so there isn't anything specific in the sharia you can do that you can call them according to what is the norm however if someone is in need financially and you're able you should help if someone is in need of physical help to carry things or move out physically and you can do that you should do that if you know someone that would help you introduce him to that person if they would require you assisting or at least coming to their weddings or their funerals then you should be there physically and insha allah this answers your question"
