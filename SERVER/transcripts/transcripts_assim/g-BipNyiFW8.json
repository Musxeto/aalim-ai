  "title": "Reward for praying 12 rakahs Sunnah Prayers: A house in Paradise... Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says is the reward of a house in jannah for praying 12 raqqa daily for someone who does it all his life and there will be one house for him or is it one house for every day it means that the day we pray we get one house in jannah and the day we don't offer 12 rakahs we won't get any a house this is an issue of dispute whether the hadith where the prophet says whoever prays 12 rakhas other than default prayers per day and night allah will build him a house it's an issue of dispute among scholars whether a single house is intended throughout your life or that every day you offer these 12 records you'll be offered a house and there isn't a clear cut logic mandates that it is a single house how many houses would you need allah's mercy and generosity dictates that what's wrong in ten thousand houses in jannah allah azza can afford it subhanahu ta'ala because he owns everything everything is his and it's he's the most generous so either way we shouldn't go into the details secure these twelve raka's every day and night and inshaallah you'll be more than satisfied in paradise with the grace of allah you"
