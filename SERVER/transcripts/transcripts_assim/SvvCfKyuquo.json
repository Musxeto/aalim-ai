  "transcript": "can you just elaborate to us on the hadith of the prophet sallam on the concept of the youth okay the prophet has some said that three will not enter a paradise and he mentioned two of them one of them is a woman who is masculine and a man who is the youth so the youth was explained in another hadith where the prophet said al-islam it is a man who approves filth and misconduct upon his women folk so what does that mean if a man knows that his wife is a stripper but she earns a lot of money that's okay everybody does the poll so what the heck if a man knows that his wife has connection on facebook on twitter with her all college male friends and maybe while walking in the mall she goes and hugs a man he said oh he used to be my friend in high school masha'allah being civilized he said oh nice to meet you sir yes why did you join us for dinner what are you doing come on we have to be civilized we're living in a cafe country and if we can we can't live other than that if he endorses or at least accepts her going out in miniskirts revealing her skin and showing her aura and he doesn't budge yeah this is a society i trust my wife i trust my daughter i raised her i know she's a good girl but sharia or whims and desires definitely williamson desires not sharia then this is not the right thing to do so that the youth is a person who endorses and approves things that are immodest immoral to be committed by his woman folk"
