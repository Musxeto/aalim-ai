  "transcript": "sh I have to attend out of necessity a lot of places where I talk with the boys and unfortunately some of the relative women come and greet me and I accidentally look at them and I to reply the greeting so since I accidentally look at them am I sinful for that momentary gaze at them Muslims are obliged Ed to lower their gaze as mentioned inah Allah says oh Muhammad say to the Believers to lower the Gaze so it is mandatory upon us as men to lower our gaze however sometimes it's not practical in the sense that if you're walking down the streets you need to look in front of you and probably a woman would pass by and you cannot simply look the other way because there's another woman and the other way is there another woman and if you look down you're going to hit the light pole so what to do Allah has made it easy but controlled so the prophet saidat to the person who asked him about looking accidentally he said lower your gaze and then he said to another companion you have the first look meaning that you're Exempted from the first accidental look but to look again and to check her out and to uh um socialize this is or this becomes under the prohibition so if mothers of the children that you're dealing with come to talk about their children and to uh negotiate their um education system or whatever of their Affairs you can communicate to with them but you have to lower your gaze and not look them in the eyes and the face and smile and socialize because this is all Haram Selma"
