  "transcript": "I mean ossama hassanein mobile economy he wore a suit here I mean nabina muhammad in water he was like oh man it'll be handing me with cinders in Italy it Iove me embargo we move on to our seventh session which is about an acid Wolman su and essa in Arabic means right and that is why what I say I'm going to answer this thing I think you exactly write it as it is and it also means to remove and to change from one form to the other and that is why we have what is known as NASA cannon man Seuk and this is abrogation what is the meaning of abrogation is surah number two verse 106 man answer me niacin I wouldn't see her naughty betrayed in me huh I'm Charlie Sheen buddy so Alonzo gel is clearly stating that whatever verse we forget so is this possible yes because from allah azza wajal then allah will substitute this in with something better than it similar to it also allows audiences in chapter 16 verse 101 waiter but then I attack Makara I attend Allah Allah will be - Delgado in Antrim of town when a touhou Diana moon and if we change verse in the Quran in place of another Allah knows best what he sends down to its Oprah Allah Zilla don't argue its Allah who sends it and who Allah who changes it then they would say the disbelievers for Muhammad you are but a forger kingdom and doctor you're lying how can it be from Allah Azza WA JAL nay but most of them are ignorant and NASA for this is a definition of it it is the obligation of a ruling by a ruling that was revealed after it so there are two rulings is gone the ruling of it is abrogated and that is why the first ruling is called ailment shoe and the ruling that came after it is called and in there I put between brackets so the definition of unless application is the abbreviation of a ruling which is called a mess you caused this with what applied why another ruling which is an acid that was revealed after it now scholars different regarding a to see Allah Inessa some of them said that there are more than 200 cases of NASA and the Quran and some limited it in two to five or six cases look at the big difference and the reason of that is that some scholars used to call the seas as NASA now what is the process making it specific show abrogation is removing the whole verdict the whole ruling it's gone it used to be halal now it's Haram this is abrogation completely wild Aziz is limiting some part of a ruling and not the whole ruling and that is why the C's is taking out an item not the whole thing an item from general concept for example fish from dead meat what is fish from dead meat a large audience says hareem Italia kumal mayita this is a general read meat is forbidden for us to eat and the Prophet says that I salatu salam forehead let learner make the turn it was made permissible for us to dead meat the fish and the locust so what should I do is this obligating the verse of the Quran no but it removed one specific incident or item from the general let's look at the same verse program at alaykum all mater is every mater Hara with exception of fish every make this hawa yes all the time unless in the case of necessity so this is this obligation because of the case of necessity this is the cease and that is why the biggest difference among scholars some of them when they look at the cysts they say its obligation one who she had heard he kill I are together it was obligated by this but it wasn't abrogated holy it was part of it an item of it so this is the difference why maybe a lot of them made 200 and why some made only as little as 5 or 10 abrogation is applied only in laws meaning that we cannot have a surah about musa alayhis salam well abrogate what the sooner that history is in history so it obligates only loss Helen why Jim mokuba these are the loads that can be obligated laws for example one of the things that were were abrogated it was in the sooner that if a person breaks his fast and sleeps during the night time he immediately becomes hostile so what does this mean yeah i need- time I broke my past and I was tired and I took a nap or 10 minute I woke up the for Asia I'm fasting I cannot eat anything until sunset of the following morning this ruling was applied and one of the companions may allah be pleased with them came to his house from the farm dead tired because they worked before Fajar and he sat down after Maghrib he ate few dates and his wife says I'm going to bring the food and she went to in both the food in the drivers you know dead horse thing and she said what are you doing you did not eat anything so he continued to fast until it was like 10 11 o'clock in the morning the man fainted he could not move for us he was dead tired and Allah revealed the verses of the Quran in song which says that you can eat from sunset until the breaker for Kulu washer Abu had get away in a locum afraid to lie be alumina high to a sweat mineral measure this was revealed later this is past Bible module one of the things that were revealed later it was be withheld for kulamish Abu had a dairy another common trait will I be up men on Titan last word and that was it I think a Manhattan may Allah be pleased with him his father is how to apply who's how to apply one of the most generous arabs ever to live you hear the tales and the poetry that was said in him the guy is crazy but he died as a non-muslim id7 hurt him when he heard this verse he used to sit in his room he puts one thread black red and one white thread and he sits in the darkness and he eats and drinks and eats and drinks the fudge it is called the people are praying in the guys eating and drinking until it is really daytime then he can differentiate between the black hand and other white thread and when he went to the prophet alayhi salatu salam the Prophet smiled and he said this is a strange way of understanding Allah revealed mineral Hodja from dawn so now they knew that the black thread from the white thread of dawn the white rate of Roger dawn from the black thread which is the darkness of the night what yeah I can see it probation abrogation applied only in laws so this is one of the laws that were abrogated the man who came to the house and it was the ruling that he should not eat anything if he went to sleep at nighttime this was abrogated so this abrogation is applied only in laws and things that you should do or you should not do they cannot be applied to stories to other things that are not laws abbreviation can only occur in the Quran or in the Sunnah if someone says the consensus of scholars on this is that it is forbidden we cannot say but it was abrogated by this if someone makes PS so drugs we can compare them to intoxicants to wine and alcohol consumption no one can come and says yeah but drugs now are abrogated it's okay to smoke marijuana this is what they're doing now in Europe in America they're trying to legalize marijuana and now people they're asking in that an Islamic country what do you think should we go with this it's going to be legal Hamas that's legalized it better than it will never we will never fight it this is coming in and Arab wars in Egypt and Syria and Lebanon they're trying to convince people of legalizing it because it's legal in Holland America is thinking of legalizing it Europe is also doing this so publication does not come except for the Quran and for the sinner and it is extremely essential do you know the time because without knowing the time you cannot determine obligation how can you say that oh this is abrogated how do you know when you obligate something you completely annihilate and cancel the ruling so I can come to the drawing of the field and say until it was abrogated why because I want to shave it as simple as that what's this cancel it no you have to know the time and that is why I'll give you an example of the cup we did not get well we have to do because that is what you base your religion on there is a hadith where the Prophet says Allah saw Salaam whoever touches his private part must perform ooodle and there is another hadith where the Prophet says that is a sir it's part of you so you don't have to perform a loop which one is which some say this one obligated this one and this one was obligated by this one do we have time we do not have time can we tell whether it's obligated or not yes because there is a very fine rule and Phil fundamentals of Phil it's called albama a - and Asli what is Alvarado honestly it translates literally to the real innocence and how become a la what is a real assets are you speaking English yes on touching this device does do I have to perform Moodle why this is perilously anything I touch I don't have to perform although it started everything we see is part anything I do does not notify my booboo because this is the norm so Albert lessly is the norm this is the normal thing to be followed so when I look at the two heads one of them says o prophet of Allah that's touching the private part nullifies my will do the prophecies it's part of you it's like touching your nose your hand your arm so this is barato mostly the second Heidi removes this ruling when the Prophet says yes you have to perform Moodle so this is a new ruling so this obligates the previous one now does this mean that we have to perform Moodle if someone touches its private part there's a difference between scholars up an opinion some say yes some say depending on the intention when you do it if you have intentions then yes if not then it is part of your body and it's an issue you need to be dis explained later inshallah when you come to studies up so it is essential to have the time before without the time you cannot know if it's obligated or not examples I hope I have it's right Prophet Muhammad SAW Allah this verse is Surat Anfal allah azzawajal says yeah are you Hannah be how will me Nina Adil Peter what does this say urge the believers to fight religion of terrorism this is to fight in defending Islam in spreading the word of Islam we have three options embrace Islam pay jizya masa lama this is only when the Muslims are strong practicing and able to make Dawa if not as we are now today kuku idea calm refrain tolerate have tolerance make Dawa make jihad only by your tongue and by writing but when a Muslim country is a real practicing Muslim country they have to do this strong they strong to spread Islam not to fight we do not fight for the sake of fighting we do not love to get injured or to die or to kill people this is not part of us our religion is the religion of fairness of completeness there is balance we have love we have care we have tenderness and we have dignity we have honor and we have fairness so it soul has to be balanced and coming back to one of the brothers asked me about why doesn't the government of the two holy mosque promote Islamic channels and pay money of the oil that you have to spread Islam and so because yesterday I said or the day before this is or some day why don't I see Muslim channels so he's putting the core the ball into my court why don't you first of all I'm handle I'm at the custodian of the Two Holy Mosques this is a grace of a great of any grace of Allah I am NOT the ruler and I'm not accountable for the shortcomings of the rulers exactly as I'm you are not accountable for the shortcomings of your neighbors or your rules I cannot come to your neighborhood and say why your neighbor thinks alcohol and fornicate and Rob's and does this and does not pray you are comfortable who you are you not second of all it is the easiest thing to throw the blame on others instead of throwing the blame on ourselves we have to appreciate the work that is being done by others and we have to encourage them but to sit back and say it's their mistake it's the oil money that you have I don't have money if I had well money wouldn't be here I would be somewhere else stop you're allowed to believe I was joking so there are people who are paying a lot and a lot of money for tower from Saudi Arabia I'm not defending this because I'm sorry I've seen this there are lots and lots of people paying money for Dawa in India and in Pakistan they are doing this but do they have to raise the flag say look at me no does this mean we don't have any of our shortcomings we have a lot are we doing our best definitely not that even 1% of our best but still we're trying to handle a there are lots of channels Islamic channels you know who the channel this is financed by Saudis how many advertisements have you seen in it those who watch it does anybody watch who they're here right how many advertisements have you seen none for four years it's being sponsored by Saudi for Allah not one single advertisement is not having income nobody praises this nobody says mashallah why they're doing this there are lots of other channels so we have to encourage and we also have to pray for them but it is the easiest things thing brothers and sisters to point out mistakes this thing I can sit here all day long and talk about everybody we have to guys from Alka Singh do you know I see it's the hardcore place of Saudi Arabia there are this fundamentalist Muslims this is a decision in Saudi Arabia and in it there are two famous cities in Asia and breda or ASA what should be a Tamia was Breda is the very very hardest and thoughts so one two of them were sitting together one is a brush it and one Abu Saleh so Abu Saleh was talking to oh gosh it is saying do you know that the Islamic world is the only way of survival to this earth is correct so much corruption so much good for the only way out is this Islamic world and I says you're right and then Abu Saleh goes a brush it if we look at this slant world we find that all the countries are corrupt you have India you have the worship camels cows and dogs and you look at Pakistan you look at Morocco you looked at Egypt everything is corrupt in there the only countries that are you know all the Islam are the Gulf areas and a brush is it right and then he says a rush it even the Gulf areas look at quit so much corruption women drive look at they are kissing the legs and the feet of Americans look at Emirates image is not Arab anymore it's all expatriates look at this look at that the only country remaining is Saudi Arabia nobody said you're right then goes up right and then Abu Saleh says a brush it but if we look at Saudi Arabia you know Jada the women are unveiled Eastern Province in the Iran and Hobart is all Americans it's also corrupt only the central region"
