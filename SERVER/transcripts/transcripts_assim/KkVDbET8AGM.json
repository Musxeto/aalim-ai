  "transcript": "Abdul Malik from France Hello Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, my blood boils whenever people like apostate prophet and Adam Seeker disrespect our Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Sheikh, I become very much angry. I don't know what to do whenever they disrespect our Prophet ﷺ. Sheikh, what to do in these kind of situations? First of all, you have to understand that if your blood does not boil whenever the Prophet ﷺ is insulted or the religion of Allah or the Qur'an or anything related to Islam, then you're not a real Muslim. This is a natural reaction to any insult of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala or the Messenger ﷺ or the Qur'an or any part of our religion. But as Muslims, we have to evaluate our reaction in accordance to the results of such a reaction, the consequences. For example, when some of the hypocrites at the time of the Prophet ﷺ would say something that was offensive or inappropriate and the Prophet would be angered by it ﷺ, some of the companions used to stand up and say, Oh Prophet of Allah, permit me to go and decapitate him, to take his head off for what he had done. Listen to the answer of the Prophet ﷺ and remember, the Prophet ﷺ is the Messenger of Allah. Whatever he does is by the command of Allah Azza wa Jal. So if he would have said to this companion, go ahead and kill him, that would have been pretty normal because he, the Prophet ﷺ, is executing whatever Allah is telling him to do. But he would never do that. He would say, No, I don't want people to talk and say that Muhammad is killing his companions. Out there, the people don't know the circumstances, the reasons and the justifications of your action. Therefore, they would jump the gun and they would say, Look, this is what Islam teaches his followers. It's a religion of violence, it's a barbaric religion, it's this, it's that. And this is what the media is doing due to an impulsive reaction. Yes, the guy says, I'm hot-blooded and this is why I did what I had done. But this does not justify your action, my friend. You've already tarnished the reputation of Islam. You've caused more damage than the previous insult. What did we benefit? Nothing. What did Islam benefit? Nothing. Who benefited? Only you because your blood was boiling and you wanted to calm down so you did what you had done. But this heinous act of yours is unjustifiable. Therefore, always weigh the pros and cons of your reaction. And if it meant that you play it diplomatically and safely so that you turn the tables on their heads and show the whole world how bad people they are and how good people we are, this is excellent public relationship. And this is what Islam promotes and Allah knows best."
