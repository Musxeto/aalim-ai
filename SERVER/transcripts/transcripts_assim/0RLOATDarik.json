  "transcript": "Misbah from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Sheikh, sometimes, most of the time, when I'm praying sunnah in my home, my little child is 10-11 months old, often crosses in front of me. I try to stop him with my feet or let him play somewhere else, but he keeps running in front of me. What should I do? Is my prayer valid? Yes, 100% your prayer is valid. There's nothing wrong. A child crossing and playing in front of you does not interrupt your salat. If you can pray in a place where to play would go behind you, that's good. If you would do like the Prophet used to do and approach the wall in front of you or the chair so that he would not be able to pass in front of you, there's no problem with that. And if you let the child go in front of you, there's also no problem in that, inshallah. Al Fatiha."
