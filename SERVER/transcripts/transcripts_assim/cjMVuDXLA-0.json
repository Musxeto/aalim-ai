  "title": "Ruling on breaking Nafil fasting",
  "transcript": "her second question is that on the ruling of breaking NE fasting is this allowed so I have the habit of fasting Mondays and Thursdays and I started fasting this Monday and all of a sudden I thought that I have a something to do or someone invited me to a very delicious meal and I I just want to eat it so can I break my fast the answer is definitely yes you can when you're fasting voluntary fasting you are the leader of your own self you are the ruler or the Amir of your own self whether you continue or you break it this is voluntary and this is what the prophet used to doam he used to go to F prayer and he comes back when it's about 9 or 10 o'clock in the morning and he would ask his wife is there any food today if she says yes he says bring the food I want to eat it and if she says no Then he says well okay in this case I'm fasting today so a person offering voluntary fasting he has the choice to change to fast to continue not to continue this is up to him inshallah"
