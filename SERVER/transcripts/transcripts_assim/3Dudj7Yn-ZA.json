  "transcript": "Safiya from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is lots of people say that for every word you read in the Quran you get rewards I like to know even if you read fluently but you're getting some mistakes would you still get rewards? Allah the Almighty one of his beautiful names is Al-Kareem the most generous and his beautiful names include Ar-Rahman Ar-Rahim the most merciful the most compassionate the most beneficent Al-Ghaffar Al-Ghafoor the one who forgives frequently and Al-Tawwab the one who guides people to repent and he accept their repentance. Now if you acknowledge these beautiful names of Allah understand them embrace them implement them and you will find wonders. Among these wonders that the Prophet said to us Alayhis Salatu Wassalam those who recite the Quran and they are perfect in their recitation without any mistakes are with the angels and those who recite the Quran and make errors make mistakes and find it difficult to fluently recite it they will have two rewards, rewards of reciting the Quran and the reward of their struggle. So definitely Safiyyah if you recite the Quran with the intention to do it perfectly but you make mistakes throughout the way Allah Azzawajal will accept it and Allah will reward you for it with his grace and favor."
