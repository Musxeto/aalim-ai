  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the UK my question is so this \nmonth my period lasted for like 15 days because   I was having hard time determining my purity \nand because I've seen I'm some discharge at   the end when I was expecting my Purity but then \nthe discharge was a bit more yellowish than the   usual one but it wasn't majorly yellow yellow like \nreally thick yellow and I was having symptoms of   like infection around that time and so I completed \nlike the whole 15 days and then I took ghusl and   now I'm gonna have like I'm getting spottings \nwhich means that I'm gonna get my period like   so very soon and it's not even 15 days after the \ntime I took ghusl so if I get the flow of blood   right now before 15 days finish will that be my \nperiod will that be istihaada first of all you   should have inserted a tampon when the flow of \nthe blood ended and if it came out with nothing   or with light yellowish color that is similar to \nyour normal vaginal discharges then this would   have been your sign of Purity you should not \nhave waited 15 days unless it was brownish or   real yellowish discharge that is associated with \nuh your menses however the scholars say that in 30   days you must not have more than 15 days of Menses \nand it seems to me that you have miscalculated it   due to the fact that you've prolonged it without \nmaking certain that this is your infection or this   is your period or this is your normal vaginal \ndischarges so yes if you have the flow of blood   you should consider this to be your normal Menses \nproviding that it has the same characteristics   and features and only wait until the flow of \nthe blood stops and you get these yellowish   discharges you should follow what I had told you \nearlier about the tampons and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All foreign"
