  "title": "Dice haram? Can I write numbers on paper & use electronic generation devices instead Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay um there was a narrated hadith from writer rodriguez that the prophet saw of longhua usallam said whoever plays with dies it is as if he were tipping his hand in the flesh and blood of a pig so if whoever whoever does what uh whoever plays with dice an item of playing games and stuffs yes okay um so if we're peter to play a game with our common people or friends is it permissible to play such games but we substitute the dice with other methods like write writing numbers on papers and stuff for okay i will answer inshallah the question is a well-known hadith and it's an authentic hadith prohibiting playing with dice and the dice are cubes numbering from 1 to 6 usually used to select a number so you can pre pray with them um you can gamble with them in in some games you can play monopoly you can play snake in the ladder you can play different many games bagan with them because once you toss these cubes it gives you a number and according to the number you do your movements or you win or lose whatever the game is based on the hadith clearly prohibits it now the scholars went two different ways a group of scholars and this is one of the methodology is that they follow the hadith as it is the prophet says stand up you stand up he says sit down you sit down it doesn't require you to be a rocket scientist to understand this other group of scholars said no everything has to be logical it has to have a reason and a justification so we know that drinking intoxicants is prohibited because it wastes you it puts you in a condition and a mental condition that hampers your choice selection etc blah blah blah so everything has to be justified so what is the justification behind prohibiting playing with dice maybe because it was predominantly used for gambling and this is true usually it's used for gambling some say because it's a selection of luck and there is nothing as luck that muslims rely on we rely on facts and other scholars gave different justifications so those who stick with the hadith they say no dice is haram but if i were to have a random electronic device like a computer and i just push a button and it randomly gives me a figure so i program it to give me a figure out of six and i multiply that by two so i press the button it gives me six five i press it again it gives me one four and i act upon that some say okay this is not dice it's permissible if a teacher does this on pieces of paper and they make the selection from one to six and you choose this is not dice so this should be permissible other scholars said no no no this is like the jews when they were prohibited from working on the sabbath they started fishing by digging ditches next to the shore on a friday so that uh uh on when the fish comes through the tide on a saturday it gets caught up so they catch them on a sunday and allah transformed them into uh monkeys as a punishment as mentioned in uh chapter seven surat al-araf so this is not permissible because you're twisting the rulings and of allah azza and of islam i am not a scholar i cannot give you a clear cut fatwa it seems to me that the dice itself is prohibited for itself why i cannot tell there is no clear logic as in the case of intoxicants as in the case of prohibition of pork etc there is a clear medical reason for that and i relate to that but what about dice i don't know it's like when we say that gold is haram for men to wear can we say that because it's expensive because it breaks the hearts of the poor you can say whatever you want but at the end of the day only gold is haram i cannot cascade this and say okay for me it's prohibited to wear a diamond ring because diamond is more expensive no it's not it is totally permissible for a man to wear diamonds or rubies or emeralds or whatever precious stones he wishes to wear because only gold is haram for him so i am nowadays inclined to say that if it is generated randomly by an electronic device or by pieces of paper inshallah this is permissible dice as dice is haram and may allah forgive us and may allah overlook our sins if we made the wrong ishtihad"
