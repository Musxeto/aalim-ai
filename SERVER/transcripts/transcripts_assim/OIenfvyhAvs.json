  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the UK Sheikh um I took um I \nhave one friend who who is a Muslim and who is   not that practicing but better than being a friend \nwith a non-muslim I took him as a friend and one   day he made fun of one of the companions of the \nProphet I immediately told him and I explained him   through the verses of Surah and how this is kufr \nand everything he didn't pay that attention to it   and he ignored it so my question is am I sinful if \nI still continue to be mixed with if I continue to   mix with him because I go into the same University \nas him and it's impossible to like not not see him   so I don't know what to do so if I should I can \nif I continue being friends with him or like if   I meet him am I sinful in doing so if he were \nto make a joke about your mother or your sister   an inappropriate joke would you still be friends \nwith him no I think this answers your question now   when a person makes fun of one of the companions \nwe don't say that he has become a kaffir   because this is a major sin but it does not \nreach to the level of kufr yet would I be   realistic to still stay a friend of such a person \nthe answer is no only Allah knows what is hidden   in his heart that may come out later on and \nwould impact me negatively so definitely I   give him advice and tell him Akhi this is \nnot permissible and I show him the ruling   if he's defiant or is still insisting then \njust uh ditch him and look for other friends"
