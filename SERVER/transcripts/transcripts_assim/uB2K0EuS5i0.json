  "transcript": "So, if you have knowledge that would ward off doubts, if you have religious commitment that would ward off lusts and desires, it will protect you because you have fear of Allah. Why don't you, why aren't you tempted? Well, I'm a family man. If you push me too far, I just might. No, I have deen. I'm not a family man. I have religion that protects me. Okay, that's good. Thirdly, that being here is for a legitimate reason. I'm here to study. I'm here seeking medication and medical treatment. I'm here to do business. I'm here to do something that I can't do in the Muslim world. Or I'm running away for my life. I'm being prosecuted and blah blah blah. Okay, this is a legitimate reason. So, this is the best remedy to protect your family from fitna. Fitna here is way far greater than the fitna in the Muslim world. We don't have fitna in the Muslim world? Like hell we don't. We have a lot. But compared to what you guys are having, it's peanuts. It's nothing. It's huge fitna here. You can't even reprimand your child. Can you? The Prophet says, order them to pray when they're seven and beat them when they're ten if they don't pray. Can you do that? Yes or no? 9-1-1. How can I help you? Dad is beating me up. Psh, khalas, five seconds. They're in front of your house, your son is gone, given to a Christian family, and you yourself, you're either going to be in jail or deported. Subhanallah. So, what kind of more fitna would you like to have?"
