  "transcript": "is leaving the west and he wants to go to the gym but unfortunately he's living in the west and there's most case music and free mixing which is not a surprise and he has a plan like that to avoid music using headphones instead is listening to halal audios like machines and so if the text also held and by avoiding free mixing and looking to women he lowers his case and go to place as as much as possible where there's no woman and if it's not possible and he looks away is it okay or is it still haram i would say that this is not permissible cd if you block your hearing from listening to the music this is fine there's no problem in that but to go to a gym where women are in inappropriate attire you know sports bra in shorts leggings and whatever and in indecent pauses pauses in front of men and you say i lower my gaze actually the whole gym is filled with matters what lowering your gaze and those who go to the gym to work out it's human nature shaytan is always there you know we always walk like this and when we see someone who works out with us or someone who does bodybuilding and we want to greet him we flex our muscles and we straighten our posture mashallah arnold schwarzenegger and the minute he goes we go back again to our posture why this is human nature we have to beautify ourselves we have to look good so going to the gym working out you know that you can only bench press a hundred kg now because there are women yes i'm not looking i'm lowering my gaze but i bet they're looking so let me press 120 kg just for the sake of yani this is shaytan and it's not an on your priority list you can work out in the house you can do cardio in the house you can uh go to the park and jog and and do whatever exercises you do not as efficient as in the gym but this is not a legitimate reason for you to be in the gym and allah azzawajal knows best you"
