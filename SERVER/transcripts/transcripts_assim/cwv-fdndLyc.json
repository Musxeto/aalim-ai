  "transcript": "uh wahidah says i broke a fast intentionally during ramadan at around noon time some people have told me that i must keep 60 fasts to compensate is it true what's the kafara for intentionally breaking an obligatory fast like oath fasts ramadan fasts or while making up ramadan fasts there is no kaffara for breaking a mandatory fast there is only sin so you are sinful for doing such a thing but is there any kaffara no there is no kaffara except if you break the fasting of a day during ramadan with or without doing intercourse so you break your fast by eating around time noon time and after an hour you said i broke my fast i'm not fasting anymore you have intimacy with your spouse immediately both of you have to give the expiration of one freeing a slave which is not available two fasting two consecutive months if you're unable to free a slave you have to fast two consecutive months three if you can not fast to consecutive months then you have to feed 60 people that's the only time you have to feed or to fast as an expiation when you have intercourse during the daytime of ramadan whether fasting or not fasting if you're not fasting because you broke your fast not because of a legitimate reason a traveler may skip fasting in the day time of ramadan and there's nothing wrong in having in or being intimate with his wife during the daytime of ramadan if both of them are travelers or if he's sick and his illness allows him to break his fast there's nothing wrong in that insha allah and i hope this answers your questions"
