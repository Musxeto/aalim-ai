  "title": "Held at gunpoint 2 utter words of kufr, suicide if he doesnâ€™t utter or is he martyr? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign if I am not wrong when a Muslim is held at gunpoint and asked to utter something against our religion then it is permissible to utter it for the sake of escaping what counts is what is in the heart my question is if one doesn't utter what the kuffar say and get killed will it be counted as a suicide as it was permissible for him to utter it or the one will be a matter as soon okay I will answer inshallah so basically akbar's question revolves around the issue of taking the concession found in Sharia when compelled under gunpoint or when there is a real threat to your life or to be tortured that you may say the word of kufur in the Quran has permitted us to say the word of kufur if there is a chance to save your lives in the Hadith please with them which he has mentioned earlier that he was oppressed tortured tormented to insult the prophet Allah and out of compulsion he did he came to the prophet crying and the prophet told him how do you find your heart and Ahmad said it's filled with Iman I have no doubt in you and I have no interest or desire in insulting you at all so the prophet said if they go back to torturing you go back into saying the word of kufur without any problem as for the the Hadith may Allah be pleased with him when he was brought forward to be executed in Mecca he was asked but not given the choice he was asked do would you like to be among your family and your children back in Medina and the prophet would be in your shoes here to be executed so he said I would not want to be in my house in Medina among my children my wives and the prophet is being harmed by a thorn or a prick where he is in Medina let alone to be executed or accumulated here so he was not given the choice he would just ask a random question and he was executed may Allah be pleased with him so the question is if someone at gunpoint was tortured or forced to say the word of blasphemy and he doesn't say it knowing that he's going to be killed is he committing suicide the answer is no he's not committing a suicide he's not committing suicide he's not killing himself but he is rejecting the concession given to him and this is why it's best for him to accept it and say it and prolong his life and live a longer life to do good deeds and rather than to die on the spot but if he does that wouldn't be committing suicide and Allah Knows Best"
