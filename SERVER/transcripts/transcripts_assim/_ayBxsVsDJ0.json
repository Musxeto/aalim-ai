  "title": "Accidently stood up in 2nd rakat of dhur instead of sitting for Tashahhud assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Anas from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So when I was praying maybe Dhuhr, and I was at the second Raka'ah, I stood up for the second Tashahud And when my back was almost straight, I sat back down When I sat back down, before I sat, I'm not really sure, I'm doubtful whether my back was 180 degrees like the true state Or 175 degrees or a bit more, I'm doubtful And when I sat down, and I sat down to do the Tashahud, is my Salah valid? And usually when does the Zoom meeting start? If you knew that you're not allowed to go back from the second Raka'ah to the Tashahud, the first Tashahud Because standing up for the third Raka'ah is a pillar And going back and leaving this pillar to a mandatory act, which is the first Tashahud, invalidates your prayer If you knew the ruling, and you did it deliberately, your prayer is invalid If you were confused, did not know, were ignorant of the ruling, then your prayer is valid, but don't do it again www.mooji.org"
