  "transcript": "a question is about a sister from the US who's asking about a woman activist called so and so who says that hijab is not compulsory in these times and that hijab is actually cultural it was for those times of the Prophet Alam and not these days and she wants to know about the woman's right concerning the Hadith about when a man calls his wife okay these are two different questions so the first question a woman activist in the USA is talking rubbish and nonsense so what does this have to do with us this is a problem when we get such with all do respect nonsense from countries like the US pertaining Islam from people who are not qualified to talk about Islam alhamdulillah we have Scholars of Islam people who had spent their entire life studying Islamic Sciences I'm not talking about students of knowledge or diis or I'm talking about real Scholars who are acknowledged as Scholars don't look at someone like me giving a seminar here or a workshop here and he's considered to be a scholar this is nonsense Scholars are those those who are well versed essentially in Arabic in Quran and its and it Sciences in the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam in knowing what was abrogated and what was not in knowing in knowing the itself and the different fatwas of Scholars so that they can apply all of this and they are acknowledged by other Scholars to be Scholars so this individual a sister coming after 15 centuries of Islam after the consensus of all Muslims that hijab is mandatory upon women and she just sits there drinking her her her latte probably and says hijab is a cultural thing and you're wasting our time asking us such a question to refute it this is pathetic this is baseless and this woman with all yeah du respect to where she's coming from has no knowledge of Islam this is why muhammadin may Allah have mercy on his soul the son-in-law of Abu and one of the great said that this religion or this knowledge that you acquire and learn this knowledge is Dean it is religion so observe and scrutinize who you you are taking your religion from it's not sufficient to Open YouTube and watch a clip of XY Z saying any rubbish on his mind it's not acceptable for you to listen to Tom Dior Harry writing an article and being articulate and saying so many things that you don't have knowledge of but because of his convincing way you think that he's a scholar there are so many deviant sects around you there are the super sufis there are those who are RAF there are those who are secularists and liberal those who are actually these are the modern names the actual real names is Hypocrites who undermine Islam through what they say so they come to you and they throw and cast doubts over your religion and at the end of the day you come and ask such a question now if someone tells you that well this was at the time of the Prophet but there are probably more than one God what will you do if someone comes to you and says well Salat is not five it should be three because of this and because of that the Quran itself they can do whatever they want as long as those listening to them are ignorant if you don't possess certainty and conviction in your religion if you don't have the means of referring to the scholars and asking them you will be like a feather in the wind taking you left right and center and this should not be know who you take your religion from USA is a great country there are a lot of good students of knowledge that I know of mashallah and they're doing a lot of good work but there are also some phony school students of knowledge they may charge per a seminar or per a lecture $20,000 plus tickets plus it's a business to them so may Allah make it easy for them but for you to acquire your knowledge you don't acquire your knowledge from this uh uh uh lady who claims that the hijab is something that is old Subhan Allah as if Allah did not know that it was limited to time Allah's religion is not limited to time tomorrow someone will come and say listen drinking wine at the time of the Prophet was Haram because people did not have any locks on their doors and they could get you like waste it and kill people or rape others now alhamdulillah we have locks and we can control ourselves we're social drinkers we just have a a glass or two just to be in the mood and nothing happens so it's Hal these people want to change your religion so I hope that answers your questions her second question"
