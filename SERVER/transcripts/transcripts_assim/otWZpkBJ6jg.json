  "transcript": "we do no one worships the Kaaba then why do you prostrate to it why do you pray to it well it's not a God it's just a structure it can be demolished and rebuilt it can be renovated like was done couple of years ago people can climb on top of the Kaaba they can walk inside it they can walk on top of it no one does this with this God so it is not a God that we worship but we were ordered to pray to our God to Allah in its direction that is it you"
