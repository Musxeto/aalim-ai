  "transcript": "foreign so I live in Germany and at school we sometimes in German class we sometimes read like novels and things like that which um which have cool fruit things um it's not about like it's not um talking bad about Islam or something like that but it's just things which are covered and if I would be sitting there and not leave in this class would I be um one of them first of all the verse you're referring to is verse 140 chapter 4 Surah alaikum is to the end of the verse and this verse talks about willingly sitting with Hypocrites that are slandering Islam cursing Islam and the Muslims and the prophet in the Quran and not doing anything about it this is not the same case with you and other students in schools so in order for them to get a degree which entitles them to have a University degree and have a job and be able to function where they live generally speaking we're not going into details they have to undergo such studies so in their school a curriculum there might be novels literature scientific theories that go against Islam studying those would not be endorsing it or believing in it you may study some Greek myth or something about their novels or you may study Darwinism and you don't believe in that definitely but you have to pass your biology test otherwise you flunk and get dismissed so what to do there's no problem in going all the way with them while resenting and abhorring this kuffer and this nonsense because this is a necessity that one has to um take and undergo in order to pass the exams on Allah Knows Best"
