  "title": "Specific times that determine the reward of sacrificing a Camel, Cow etc for Friday - Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "our first question comes from the email thighs says if the hurt time starts at 12:21 p.m. and the hot bus starts at 1:15 and prayer itself starts at 137 when should I attend to get the Feb that is the reward of sacrificing a camel how should i calculate that time of the first hour - the sixth hour now brother fiers is referring to the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam where he highlights to us the reward of being early in attending the friday sermon and we know that this is a one-week if every one week event and it is one of the most important prayers around it is the whole prayer but friday prayer takes its place on every friday so muslims around the globe pray this special prayer with the special format of having two sermons in the beginning in two rakahs where the imam recites loudly unlike the world where it is for records and it's being recited silently the Prophet erase our arm highlights the reward of attending early for that purpose and he says whoever goes in the first hour as if he has sacrificed a camel and whoever goes in the second hour it's like sacrificing a cow if he goes in the third hour it's like sacrificing RAM if he goes in the fourth hour it's like sacrificing a chicken and if he goes in the fifth hour as if he has offered an egg which is negligible compared to the camel and when the imam enters the masjid the angels fold their books where they write those who came in and their reward and said to listen so now phase is asking about what is a specific timing for me to come and attend to get this reward of sacrificing a camel scholars have differed regarding this interpretation of the our division some say that it is immediately after the break of dawn so when it's really dark this is when the hour starts the majority and this is the most authentic opinion they say no it is after the sunrise when it is permitted for you to pray which is about 10 to 15 minutes after the sunrise so you divide the time between the sunrise until the time of the Imam enters the message usually it's approximately between five to six hours a little bit less a little bit more so when the Prophet says some whoever comes in the first hour he doesn't refer to 60 minutes he's referring to a period of time so the word hour in Arabic essa refers to a period of time that may be 60 minutes or less more depends so this to answer your question phase is the most authentic opinion there is a third opinion which is a man Malik's a point of view which is very weak and the majority of scholars say that we have to ignore it which says that it is after the wall so it is actually these five hours are counted after there's a wall in this is too little because the Prophet Alastair Sam used to sometimes as in the hadith of jihad Allah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father used to come to Friday sometimes half an hour to an hour before the time of war though the majority of his time used to be around over times the wall time which is when the son leaves the Meridian and goes a little bit declining to the west and you would have this shade pointing East words this is the time of the whole so the most authentic opinion is that these five hours are actually close to the 60 minutes a little bit more or a little bit less depending on the time"
