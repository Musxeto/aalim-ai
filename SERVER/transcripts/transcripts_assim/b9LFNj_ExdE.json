  "title": "Can a Man take advice from his Wife? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "firuze question is quite common men do not listen to advice from their women they feel that they are inferior so they're not worthy of giving advice and this is totally false our prophet alayhi salatu salam sought the advice of his wives and acted upon them as in the famous story of sole holiday bia and umm Salama when he told his companions to shave and slaughter their sacrifice going back to Medina because they were prevented from entering Mecca and making Umrah dairy they declined they could not believe that this was an instruction as they are wearing the haram how can we take off her haram shave our heads slaughter our sheep and we did not even reach Mecca to perform on our Umrah so umm Salama advised him to not say a word go out call the barber get his hair cut or hair shaved and slaughter his camel his sacrifice without talking to anyone and this is exactly what the Prophet did Allah salat wa salam and all the Companions followed suit immediately so it's not manly not to listen to your wife especially if she's giving you a sound advice"
