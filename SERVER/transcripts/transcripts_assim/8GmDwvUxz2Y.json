  "transcript": "you can see it in real life that it's just a one-night stand why did he do that he was i was under pressure you know i had to work in some other city and she was there and well in case of makeup so i'm sorry so she does the same and this is what allah does not want to happen that's why that is why he puts these restrictions now if you still insist that you not have any bad intentions then you have the only thing you have to do is to stick to the quran sunnah in the quran in sunnah we are told you're not allowed to intermingle with females you are not allowed to mix with them because their temptation is so great that allah wants to protect you and to protect her so you must not have any friendship with the opposite sex because it does influence your heart maybe it doesn't influence it now but eventually when it clicks you're going to have sleepless nights you're going to keep on thinking and contemplating and and not being able to focus on your studies because of that particular girl and definitely it's not going to be the right way of you know proposing and getting married and this does never ha it never happens they all what you see is a boyfriend taking a girlfriend going out together for a couple of months a couple of years it's adultery it's not you know they say they they make it sound nice well i'm going i'm going out with uh my girl i have a girlfriend we go out together don't say we go go out you say we we do adultery which is a major major sin and you may not if you accept it for yourself you may not accept it for your mom you would not accept it for your sister definitely you would not accept it for your daughter and if you do then that's a big problem as in in non-muslim countries that is a big problem but even in non-muslim countries still males husbands fathers brothers do possess some sort of jealousy and they do not accept this to happen to their loved ones a sister a daughter or a wife i think this answers your question we will take a short pose here and we will be back in sha allah salaam i'm rios ansari from the united states and you're watching peace tv and welcome back to youth talk we are talking about the pure influence and we will the open the floor is open for any uh suggestions or questions yes sir my name is ayman i have a question also about criticism i get criticized you know of course i have a lot of friends from school time and very close friends and they're very good people but the problem is by time when we entered college some of them will start drinking some of them would start actually wanting doing drugs but basically they're very good people and i know them for a very long time i don't know should i continue with them or what's the situation what should i do this is a common problem but to bring it from the very beginning you've said that they are good friends how do you define good see it's an elastic word so i could have uh someone that does everything that i ask from him and classify him as good although he helps me in getting my drugs he helps me skip school he helps me do the bad things that i want to do and won't be able to do it without his help so i would classify him as a good friend and at the same time if someone tells me come and pray or let's go for umrah or there's a poor man that needs money let's help him i would classify him as bad news because he's boring he's not a good friend every time i sit with him he says hell and heaven do this don't do that allah says in the quran the prophet said in the hadith every time i sit with him whenever i want to say a good joke well that good good to me back to him uh if i want to say a good joke he says no this is haram you're mocking of people this is it has sexual implications and it's it's forbidden for you to see such a thing so we have to know who is your good friend and how do i determine if this friend is good or bad but i think i understand what you mean because you mean by saying a good friend is a person although away from his religious uh belief he is a person that stands by you when you need him that gives you a helping hand whenever you need one that a person that you could trust with your secrets so if this is your classification of a good friend assuming that it is if they do sin in front of you if they abuse drugs or if they drink or if they fornicate or if they do any of these major sins you are not allowed to stay with them while they are performing these sins i know a lot of people that do not drink but whenever they go out with the friends and the friends drink they sit with them and they don't drink they only take soft drinks now they think that by doing this they have not committed anything that is haram on the contrary they have done a major sin because the prophet islam said that it is not lawful for a person who believes in allah and the day of judgment to sit on a table where wine any time form of alcoholic drinks is turned around though he is not drinking um i have a comment like and uh one of the previous episodes we said that uh that allah is most merciful and there's a saying also i'm adam and i once i asked you about this i guess and you said that if i'm sitting in a place and my intentions are good like i'm there i'm not because you know i'm not there because of the drinking and you know all that i'm just there to have a good time or i'm there to sit with my friends so he said that allah is most merciful so i was just wondering about your feedback or what do you think of this did i ever say that guys then you misunderstood me and i hope the brothers there that watching this program did not misunderstand me i said you cannot have good intention with bad deeds and i gave you an example i think and i guess as you did i gave you an example of someone going into the discotheque to dance a drink socialize with the intention of calling that nice blonde girl to islam i told this is this is not acceptable at all even if this guy's has the clearest intentions of all it does not justify you falling in sin so this is not acceptable at all you may have the best time of your life providing you do not sin but to go without with people that drink and you know party and they're having fun and you don't drink but you're partying with them being there is a a a reason for curse and doom from allah and it's it's it's the same thing as being with the good guys so as in the hadith the prophet told us that the angels come back to allah after visiting a place of vicar of remembering or calling allah a group of people calling allah studying like we're doing now telling the hadith the quran so allah asked him where have you been and he knows but he is asking them just to show the the his uh creatures about this this situation so they told him that we passed by a group of people calling you and remembering you so he said okay bear witness that i have forgiven that i have forgot forgiven all of their sins so they say but there is this person among them who did not come for calling you or remembering you he just came for a reason you know he had he wants to borrow some money from this guy so he just said sat there and said yes he's just faking it you know you just want the money from that guy so allah almighty says that include him with them include him forgive his sins because the that group and that place they're sitting in is a blessed one so whoever it comes in that place will be governed in that uh blessing of allah this is an honor a gift from allah but if you reverse this the same thing applies if you go in a place of sin and you sit there and maybe you're not having a good time you're just sitting there you know i'm there why don't why don't you leave well then my friends you know then my buddies and my you know i i can't leave them if you stay there the curse the dam of"
