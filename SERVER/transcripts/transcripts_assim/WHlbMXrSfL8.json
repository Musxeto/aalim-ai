  "transcript": "as we know that power has to be done in the state of purity that is wouldl and then he asks about someone who cannot maintain his rule first of all it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that wood for performing tawaf is not mandatory and the evidence is that claim to be mandatory are not used in place now I know that the majority of scholars say that it is mandatory but they don't have proof though they are the majority and hence those who say it is not mandatory they are the luckiest with the evidence so the most authentic opinion is that Pawar does not require Woodill and hence if you break your Woodill continue and your Tawaf is valid as as for say also say the consensus of scholars that it does not require moodle so why did they say to off requires really because they said that there is hadith that states that in a powerful salat that verily Tawaf is prayer so they said that we know that we you need moodle for prayer then hence you need willow for tawaf but this is not correct because for prayer you need to face the Kaaba and if someone walks sideways like a crab and facing the kaabah his tour fees invalid because the condition is that you keep the Kaaba to your left all the time when you're doing the Tawaf likewise in salat if you speak to someone or reply to his salaam verbally your prayer is invalid while we know that during popov you can reply to people salaam you can talk to them you can ask them without any problem and so on"
