  "transcript": "Salam Alaikum. So, generally speaking, such generic questions without examples, it's difficult to identify. But, because it's a generic question, you get a generic answer. If a ruling is part of the Shari'ah, and once you apply it, you feel that your Iman is being reduced, you have no choice. A woman says, I just learned that hijab is mandatory, so I'm wearing it. But I feel that I'm intimidated by the people's looks, and my prayer is not on time, and I feel a lot of hardship. So, is it best for me to take off the hijab? The answer is no. Even if your Iman is reduced, this is reduced due to other factors and not to implementing Shari'ah. This cannot be. When you obey Allah and implement the Shari'ah in your life, this cannot reduce your Iman. This is attributed to something else, and Allah knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website, and you will find counseling sessions, and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me, and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
