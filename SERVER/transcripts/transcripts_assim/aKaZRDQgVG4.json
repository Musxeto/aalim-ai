  "transcript": "see the issue of Performing prayer after uplifting a major impurity this is not to be done ASAP in the sense that no you just have a full bath and go and pray as long as the time of prayer is extended you have no problem let's assume that a woman a woman saw her Purity at nine o'clock P.M Russia ends at 11 30. so from 9 to 11 30 she could do whatever she wants she can even postpone her Russell until 11 o'clock it's not that no you have to do it now there's nothing that would support this but if Russia is about to run out of time so she saw her Purity at 11 20 or 11 10. in this case there is very little time we say to her yes do your mandatory Russell without shampooing without taking any extra care of your Hair Etc and do offer Eurasia and then you can come back and do whatever you want"
