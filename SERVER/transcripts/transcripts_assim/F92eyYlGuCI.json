  "transcript": "foreign myself a good so I work with gold in electronics so I use gold as a connection between wires I read that German of Scholars say that this is like using vessels of gold and silver so say prohibit making use of gold in things other than jewelry so my question is is it okay to use gold in working with electronics and is my money Halal from this is exactly the same as I said to you yesterday it's totally Halal to work in it it's Ultra Halal to sell it and those Scholars who said that it's not permissible to use gold and silver except in jewelry they're totally wrong there's nothing wrong in using gold and silver in other than jewelry for example in making plates it is prohibited to use and eat in Golden or silver utensils but there's nothing wrong in keeping them as forms of decoration you have to pay his account of course there is no harm in using little amount of gold in swords or in uh weapons of uh in arms that is with a certain degree when needed if a person has the need to put a golden tooth in replacement for his uh teeth this is permissible for necessity and it was mentioned by the jurors and the scholars in old times before uh uh porcelain and and the likes that we use nowadays so there's no problem in that insha Allah Faisal"
