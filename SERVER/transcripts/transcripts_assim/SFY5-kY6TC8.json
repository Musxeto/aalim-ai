  "title": "Making up fasts on behalf of a deceased parent | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "what about fasting well fasting is a separate issue because there is a hadith where the Prophet says Aslam whoever dies while having fasting to make up then his guardian or his relative would fast on his behalf so a person falls sick and he continues being sick for six months unable to make up for the missed month of Ramadhan and he dies there is nothing to be done no feeding no fasting on his behalf a person falls sick this is scenario number two and he recovers but before he makes up for the missed days which he is capable of doing and before Ramadan is due he dies in this case his relatives fast on his behalf so if he has ten day ten sons and daughters each one fasts three days this sufficient for the whole month of Ramadhan a person falls sick and then continues to be unable to fast for three four five years because of his old age or illness in this case it should have fed one poor person for every day missed had they because they did not do so they can do it now or fast on his behalf and I hope this answers your question"
