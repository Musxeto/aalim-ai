  "transcript": "Mahmood from Bangladesh Sheikh I have heard from your expert that we shouldn't say about our past that I shouldn't do that shouldn't do that or this if I did that it would not happen but at the same time after committing anything we should repent from our heart so while repenting there is a difference there is a difference between objecting to destiny that oh if I did not do this and that none of this would have had happened it's already predestined and divinely decreed live with it it happened nothing could have changed it accept it embrace it this is different than falling into sin and then saying oh I can't be remorseful because if I'm remorseful then I'm going against the divine decree no you've done a sin you've done a mistake rectified it and corrected by repenting by pledging not to do it again by having deep remorse this is different than saying oh if I didn't call this escort agency I would not have fallen into haram or if I did not drink this bottle of wine I would not have been intoxicated no this stops you from repenting and asking Allah for forgiveness instead you're just whining and you know what no this is not the right approach don't say if I had not done this this would not have had happened because this opens the gateway for shaitan and Allah knows best"
