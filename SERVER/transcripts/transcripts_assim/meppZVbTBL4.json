  "transcript": "my question ising compion of praying and congregation in my area most of the mids have and is approximately 150 M away the people in the mid don't start to feed and the IM makes Dua to every first prayer so am I OED to pray conation can I pray me and what about like I don't I don't understand your question your microphone is not clear if you're asking about praying in a dandi Masjid or a brv Masjid you pray in the Masjid where the Imam does not commit shik if you know that thei Masjid the Imam commits clear sh and says that the prophet is H nazer and he controls the universe and that he's created from Allah's no and light this is kufur and Sh you cannot pray there you may pray in the DUI m if you do not hear any statements of shik making congregational Dua is a but it does not prevent you from praying there not putting their feet next to one another again it says against the Sunnah but it does not invalidate your prayer"
