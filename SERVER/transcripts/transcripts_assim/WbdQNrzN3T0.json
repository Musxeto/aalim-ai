  "transcript": "allah from canada chief i have a question about pictures i know that keeping pictures statues and dogs at home is prohibited um sheikh i have a prayer mat that has small pictures of flowers on it uh my question is for the pitchers um is a prohibition just for animate and living creatures like humans and animals or is it also for inanimate pictures of flowers trees in the regarding images that are prohibited we know that the prophet said the most severely tormented people on the day of judgment are those who draw portraits meaning they create images they make sculptures statues they draw portraits of human beings of living creatures of animals so all of these will be the most severely tormented people on the day of judgment he says he has a prayer mat that has flowers no flowers do not have a soul that living creatures have yes it's an it's alive but it doesn't have a soul like human beings like birds like fish like animals like insects so it is permissible to have drawings in your home you do it yourself whether of trees or flowers of mountains of rocks of rivers of oceans of the sky of moon the sun all of these are totally permissible and the evidence is the authentic hadith where when a man came and said to even abbas may allah be pleased with him i am a sculpture i draw people so this is my living this is how i earn money so is this permissible he said no this is totally prohibited he said this is my only source of income he said if this is your only source of income in this case draw anything without a head so it becomes like a tree and also in the hadith of the prophet islam when he was waiting for jibril to come in and jibril did not come in so the prophet wait went outside the home and he saw gabriel standing there he said why didn't you come in he said we angels do not enter a house that has a dog a portrait or a statue so order the dog to be thrown out of the house order the portrait to uh be painted on and order the statue to be decapitated so it becomes like a tree without a head and this is the answer to your question inshallah"
