  "transcript": "from the u.s uh what is the ruling on car insurance okay from the u.s says what's ruling on car insurance insurance in general whether it's property insurance whether it is life insurance whether it is car insurance whether it is education insurance whether it is assets insurance i'm a footballer i put a policy of 50 million dollars on my feet as an insurer all of these fall under the category of haram major sin because it involves two major sins gambling which is a prominent factor and interest reba the gambling is like lottery so i buy a ticket a lottery ticket for a dollar and i may get and i hit the jackpot and i win 300 millions or maybe more maybe less and i like the millions of people may just end up losing my one dollar ticket this is gambling we play tape we play tennis the winner is bought a a lunch as a treat from the loser this is gambling either you win all that is eating or you lose all that is i have to buy you a property or buy you a lunch so all types of insurance is prohibited and it's haram to work in a insurance company now having said that sometimes the laws of the countries you're living in mandate that you have an insurance specifically when it comes to car insurance so the vast majority of countries in the world unfortunately enforce car insurance the majority of them enforce third-party insurance which means that if i bang a car and it's my fault my insurance pays to fix his car my car is my own responsibility i have to fix it so the insurance company pays for the damages i caused to a third party not to my own car or to those with me and they make it mandatory and if you're caught without it you'll be fined the scholars say in regards to such insurance that this is permissible due to necessity likewise if i travel to europe or or anywhere else maybe a particular country enforces that i pay health insurance during the duration of my stay in that country for a week for a month or whatever so this is mandated it comes with the visa i can't go and enter a country without it this is permissible due to necessity while resenting it while abhorring it with my heart i can't do anything with that so the minimal requirement required by the government is what you can opt for so if they say you have to pay two hundred dollars third-party insurance a year okay i pay that but to come and select said no no no i'd like to have the best insurance policy you have i said okay we have this policy that you have to pay fifteen hundred dollars a year where whatever accident you're involved in we'll fix it for you in the car's agency the the dealership and we will make it the best repairs needed etc no this is haram because now you're opting for something extra not what is mandated by law which you have to do it due to necessity so i hope this answers your question"
