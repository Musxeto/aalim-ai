Number one, the intention. It's not sufficient just to strike the ground and do whatever you want without the intention of uplifting the minor or major ritual impurities. So you have to have this in your heart. It's not something that you verbalize, rather it's an intention. Number two, you have to wipe your face. Number three, you have to wipe your palms and hands. And number four, you have to have this sequence. And this is an issue of dispute. But the majority say, the majority of schools of thought, you have to have the sequence of wiping the face, then the hands. Though there are reports that the Prophet s.a.w. said, wipe your hands and then your face, which caused a confusion. The verse of the Qur'an clearly states that to wipe your faces and your hands. And some of the hadiths in Bukhari states that you wipe your right hand and left, then you wipe your face. So how to make them work? One way of doing it is to follow the majority of the scholars who followed the Qur'an and be safe. There's no problem in that. The other way is to say that alhamdulillah, the best is to wash your face, to wipe your face and your hands as per the Qur'an and the majority of scholars. But if you do the other way around, the Prophet s.a.w. had done it, which means that this is permissible as well. But as I said, better safe than sorry, follow the Qur'an and the majority of the scholars to be safe. So this is the way of doing it. To strike the ground once, wipe your face and then wipe your right hand with your left and then your left with your right. That's it. You don't go all the way down to your elbows, you know, you don't wipe your forearms, it's only the palms of your hand. This is the way of doing it. A lot of the Muslims ask, Shaykh I wake up one minute before sunrise and if I go to perform wudhu, the sun would rise and I would have missed Fajr prayer. So can I take a shortcut and do tayammum? And the answer is no, this is not permissible. Even if the sun rises, you cannot perform tayammum for this reason. You have to perform a full-fledged ablution or wudhu. How to perform tayammum? We discussed this briefly. Your fingers have to be apart, don't do this. So they have to be apart from one another and this is recommended. If you do this, it's okay, but it has to, it's best to be part away from each other. You strike the earth once, not twice, only once and then you wipe your face with it and then you wipe the back of your hands with your palms doing this. So it's just a normal process once. And if you are unable to use tayammum, how could that be? Someone is unable to use water and he's unable to use tayammum, but this is not possible. You can't be flying on air where you don't have any earth to touch. Everybody has air. Well, this is hypothetical. Let's assume someone is tied up, may Allah protect us, in chains and is unable to use neither water nor the earth. In this case, you have to pray as you are. Without wudhu? Yes, without wudhu. Without tayammum? Yes, without tayammum. Even if there are impurities on my body, I'm not clean? Yes. Prayer does not fall in the sense that no one is permitted to skip prayer for any reason. As Allah azza wa jal says, fear Allah to the best of your ability and this is the best of my ability to pray in the seirah I'm in. And this is what we should address those who are bedridden in hospitals, for example, for a couple of months, three months, and they have a bag of urine next to them and they feel filthy and dirty. Some of them, unfortunately, Satan manages to trick by whispering in their heads that you're not clean, you're not fit to pray, so they abandon prayer all their stay and some of them, unfortunately, die in that state of not praying for two or three months. May Allah protect us all. So what happens if we find water? Well, it states that there are three types of situations. Number one, if I make tayammum and before I start to pray, I find water. In this case, you can't continue to pray. Yes, but Sheikh, when I started to do my tayammum, there was no water. Just as I was going to say Allahu Akbar, I found water or someone brought water to me. In this case, your tayammum is broken automatically and you need to go and perform wudu. Number two, if I were to pray with tayammum because there was no water and after finishing my salat and doing my salam, someone brought water to me. In this case, my prayer is valid 100%. I'm not in need to do wudu and redo it again because this is the sunnah as the Prophet said alayhis salatu was salam. Number three, if I'm in the middle of the prayer in the state of tayammum, I didn't find water so I made tayammum. While I was praying, it started to rain or someone came in with a bottle of water. In this case, I have to break my prayer and perform wudu to be able to pray again with wudu or in the state of wudu. Okay, so now I am in the state of tayammum. What breaks my tayammum? Number one, finding water or being able to use water. So the moment the reason you can't use water is uplifted and now you can use water, such as in the case of having a surgical plaster and it was removed and the doctor says now you can use water, immediately my tayammum is broken. I have to perform wudu. Number two is if I were to break my state of purity with whatever nullifies my wudu, the normal things, so defecating, urinating, passing of wind, sleeping or eating camel's meat, all of this breaks my wudu. Therefore, it breaks my state of tayammum as well and Allah Azzawajal knows best. In the presentation of Sharia knowledge, the academy of Zad.
