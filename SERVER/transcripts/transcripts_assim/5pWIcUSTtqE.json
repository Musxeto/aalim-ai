  "transcript": "[Music] foreign to purify the hearts of the people the prophet tells us Allah that I was merely sent to perfect the moral conduct the characteristics of people which means that when the prophet Allah was sent to us there were traces of moral conduct of good behavior of and he was sent to perfect this not to bring something that is new so Islam comes to purify the hearts why because Allah azzawajal looks at your hearts the prophet says and the Hadith inside Muslim Allah azzawajal does not look at your bodies or your wealth but he looks at your hearts and your Deeds so if you are of a particular nationality has no difference if you're tall or short if you're fat or thin if you're black or white has no difference if your bank account is big or small if you don't have a bank account to begin with has no difference Allah looks at your heart not only that he looks at your Deeds why because so many times people think that they have good hearts so when you come to a person who works in a place that serves alcohol and he is the bartender and you tell him this is my heart is good yes but your Deeds are bad so Allah looks at both your hearts and your Deeds and they have to go and coincide together and that is why Allah azzawajal wants us to purify our hearts through means of protection and through means of Good Deeds that cleanse and wash the hearts this life we're living in is a temporary phase as we stated before we're not here to stay we're not here forever it's a transitional period and this life is a stage of testing it's a life of trials and tribulations it's a life of calamities why because it's short yet in accordance to what we do in it Allah would either reward us or punish us on the day of judgment and I pray to Allah that he reward this all Allah azzawajal says in the Quran it's in black and white you can read it you can understand it and you can know the purpose of your existence Allah says but as for him who feared standing before his Lord and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts verily Paradise will be his Abode it will be his shelter it will be his house when when you fear standing in front of Allah azzawajal when you fear your position in front of Allah on the day of judgment and you forbid yourself from the lusts from the desires that dwell into your heart Allah promises you agenda a paradise not only that in another verse Allah promises you two paradises as and for those or to him who fears the standing before his Lord there will be two gardens so this is your reward this is your bonus if you pass the test if you pass the exam one would say alhamdulillah I have no problem I pray I fast Ramadan I even go and make Umbra once or twice a year so I've got it made I have passed the test well not Yani fully the prophet tells us that the biggest and most dangerous tribulation on Earth would be any answers women time the tongue okay women the tongue the biggest Revelation ever did not come yet it is however under the digital immediately comes women and the sisters are preparing their tomatoes and the empty bottles to throw on my head you chauvinist male Pig no yeah wait wait wait let me explain these desires are two ways so when the prophet tells us Allah in the Hadith and this Hadith was narrated or reported by buhari and Muslim so it has the highest level of authenticity nothing is more authentic than it except the Quran the prophet says Allah I have not left behind me any fitna there is Temptation more harmful to men than women and this goes without any you don't have to elaborate every man fears this temptation right that is every man who has his hormones level correct if you don't have hormones then you're in the wrong place every normal person has this in him and not only the ummah of Muhammad also in previous Nations the prophet tells us the first temptation of bani Israel the sons of Israel the first Temptation was in women so this is what shaytan works on this is one of his greatest tools and shaytan is smart isn't he he's devious he's very smart if someone tells me she's awesome can I see your resume I'll give him two to three pages of all the courses and the position I assumed in private sector in this in that different department when shaytan comes and you ask him for his resume it's going to be like millions of pages I managed to seduce this and I managed to have this one kill and this one to Rob and this one to make kufur and this one to make sure he has a lot and it goes back to end since the time of Adam peace be upon him so his experience is not like hours you know in 10 years it's in hundreds and thousands of years and he is is also patient he's not rushing things so it doesn't matter for him if you take a lifetime to fall into sin or you feel fall into sin immediately he has all the time and that is why he never comes to me and say for example you love women come on let's commit adultery what will I say you're crazy what is this go away he will start by step by step so he will come to me and say how about watching this movie they say it's very nice okay nobody's watching let me watch it and I see beautiful women wow this is gorgeous this is beautiful this is lovely I wish I could have have one like those after a while he goes on making it easy for me to listen to music and then I hear songs that talk about love and I look at my wives and say what is this compare this to this wow and I hear songs about love and about emotions and stories I wish I could have those but I'm still away from sin and then people introduce me to this magazine this picture celebrities following the stories of this and that and my heart is hardening and I'm getting a little bit further from Allah I'm still praying I'm still fasting and then I am cornered in a situation where a woman non-muslim extends her hand for me to shake and I'm thinking um islamically Haram but I'm doing it for the sake of Allah because then she would hate Islam so how are you how are you feeling and then why don't I invite her for dinner for dawah only for that don't get me wrong I'm trying to do my work for Allah azzawajal and then it's dinner and then it is Allah knows what and now he's ready for falling into sin this may take few years no problem shaytan is waiting he doesn't have anything but better to do so if you know that these are the steps of shaytan Allah tells us oh you believe do not follow what the steps of shaytan this is how shaytan comes to you unfortunately we do not find out we cannot figure it out until it's after it's what after it's too late unless you have someone that allies of your sense to you to guide you watch out don't do this this is going to take you into the wrong place that is why Allah wants us to purify the heart how we love women and this may not be the same with women loving men but it is there the passion and the love of men to women is far greater than the love and passion of women to men why because men are a little bit you know lousy their eyes goes left right and Center their heart can accommodate for wife by Islam but a decent woman can only love one man by Nature she cannot love more than one man this is Allah how Allah created them and they're more chaste they're more honorable and men they only have their hanky-panky ways may Allah have mercy on us all and that is why some argue but I'll give you an example if you have 20 righteous men or at least any people who look to be decent and honest and you put uh one of the most you know bombshells in in the movies the most beautiful woman what will happen to them to the 20 men maybe 18 of them would wow and to say stuff for Allah right now turn the tables have 20 women and put the most gorgeous and handsome man in in the world in between of them maybe one or two will look and the rest they won't why because this is the nature of men and women men may Allah have mercy on them women are more protective masha'allah in in these terms that is why Islam came to put a barrier between men and sin between women and sin why do have to have and protect This Heart of ours if you look at what Allah has made forbidden anything that leads to fitna anything that leads to Temptation Allah had made forbidden Allah says in the Quran what is the meaning of those who know Arabic don't go close one would say and assume I would have expected Allah to say Do not fornicate do not commit adultery no this is the last stage Allah says do not come close to Whatever Gets you close to that major sin so anything that gets you close there Allah made forbidden on the top of the list sending your gaze looking freely the majority of Muslims if not all they consider lowering the gays to be any something that only nerds do we have evolved now we are sophisticated we're educated when I go to the hospital and I speak to the nurse and I look down everybody's looking at me are you sick why are you talking to the nurse and you're looking down is something wrong with your shoes they look at my shoes and yeah you have to lower my gaze actually she's beautiful she's 40 years of age she's ugly yeah he's ugly and halal subhanallah so people now do not lower the Gaze Allah instructed both men and women to lower their gaze why because it's the first Arrow of shaytan and you don't see shaitaan and you don't see his arrows but nowadays if you talk to someone and tell him he lowered your gaze they'll laugh at you you say and and some of them even justify this by nonsense they say yeah I want you to how do you want me to walk in the street I'm driving there is a woman driving on my in front of me on the right and the left I'm gonna have an accident because I'm lowering my yeah come on you joking are you serious Allah told you to lower your gaze you have to comply but the prophet told you how Allah he told you that the first gaze is yours the second is against you it's a sin so one says okay I watch movies and I do this it's the first case I'm not blinking and I can watch the whole thing Allah knows what you're doing who are you fooling Allah and why doesn't Allah want you to look around look at beautiful women why what will happen will anything harm Allah nothing it's only for your sake for my sake I enjoy looking at women I enjoy Beauty I enjoy figures and I enjoy colors and I enjoy everything in a woman how would it harm me yes it would harm you it would corrupt your heart remember my wives who I'm always comparing this is part of the corruption it corrupts my knowledge it corrupts how I see things not only that Allah says doesn't Allah know who he had created the only one who knows his creation is so when he tells you don't do this it's for your own sake Allah is not going to lose anything he owns everything so he is doing this for your own protection tell the believing men to lower their gaze and tell the believing women to lower their gaze this is an instruction to purify your heart not only that the prophet said that whenever a man is in seclusion with a woman who's the third one with them shaytan you know this right how many of you went into the elevator and this beautiful woman comes in he's alone with her and elevator what do you do well I've been there it took me 10 floors to know the hukum until we reached the ground floor then I thought yeah this is Haram or something like this it is not permissible yeah we're in a hotel we're in a big building me and Herbert there is cameras subhanallah Allah is watching you you're not allowed to be in seclusion with her don't you have Islam she's with me in the car but there are windows all over so this is not seclusion it is seclusion a lot of the sisters go with the driver alone and they say we are in the streets yes but what goes between you and the driver well I have seen this in Judah a woman wearing the veil and the man in front with the driver of course not related to her and he is speaking and laughing I can't see the woman's face but I'm assuming that she is replying to his what he's saying and they're laughing against subhanallah and I was shocked a stranger exchanger laughter people say so doesn't a woman have the right to laugh and have humor and socialize we will come to this insha Allah later on so you do not look and this is part of honoring the women you do not stay with them in seclusion and you do not touch them because shaking hands with Anan maharam woman is forbidden in Islam even if she's my sister-in-law even if she's your sister-in-law even if she is my uncle's wife she's like my mother she's 90 years of age even if she's 90 years of age it's Haram the prophet tells us in the authentic it is best it is better for a a man to be stabbed in his head with an iron nail rather than touching a woman that is not permissible for him to touch and that is why the prophet Allah did not touch a woman when he went to Mecca on the eighth year of when he conquered Mecca and the women came to accept Islam and to give the Pledge of Allegiance they said give us your hands so that we can shake hands with you and he's the prophet he has things he has he has exemptions more than we do what did he says I Do Not Shake Hands with women now how are we today how are the Muslims today we don't shake hands but we kiss yeah the prophet said touching I'm not touching I'm just kissing and she's my sister-in-law so actually this is Hell huh this is punishment this is something that you should be scared for uh uh from and usually people don't think about this because it's from one side so a brother sent me an email today saying Sheikh what is the ruling on having friends of women on Facebook chatting with them sending them and exchanging but they're not mahram I said okay if you if you allow this to your wife and sister and daughter it's okay why do you allow it to yourself and make it forbidden to others the ruling is one but I'm a man you're allowed to do Haram and because they are your your women your wife your sister it's Haram no it's the same thing all together and due to the attraction aspect in women is far greater than their attraction aspect than men made it more difficult and emphasized on the importance of women taking care in how they speak and in how they look and appear Allah addressed the wives of the Prophet Allah and they are our mothers does anyone marry his mother does anyone have ill feelings towards his mother no yet Allah tells them in the Quran if you keep your duty to Allah then be not soft in speech B naught soft who he's addressing zainab he is addressing Habiba do not be soft in speech why lest he in whose heart is a disease should be moved with desire but speak in an honorable manner this address Cascades down to all women of the Muslims so does a woman with soft voice affect men yes does it the majority say yes that is why they choose women to be in call centers that is why I get two or three calls every day from marketing agencies I look at my wife and I say I never heard my name so beautiful before I could not use my right eye for three days but the fourth day alhamdulillah started to open after she smacked me on my eye never tell your wife such a joke ever they use this this is what they do because the voice of a man no matter how muscular his voice is you will never find a woman says Ah I love this voice but men are captivated by such beautiful soft nice voices and that is why Allah tells them do not do this do not speak in soft voice when a woman stalks to a man she has to be honorable and serious go to the point don't start you know communicating how are you fine how's the kids yes I'd like to do this or that you go to the markets and you find women negotiating the price bargaining with the uh the salesman okay make this for 10 years just for me for you what are you doing sister and she's wearing the rub and the gloves this is an unacceptable at all she has to speak in an honorable and a good way Allah instructed them not to show their adornment not to show their uh uh Xena except to their maharam so a woman must not beautify herself except to her husband or to her maharams and so many complaints I get from men saying that we buy dresses for our wives only to see them wearing them when they're going to weddings or to parties but they never wear anything for us in subhanallah you find the woman was staying with her husband and does not put anything on her face before she goes she spends two hours in front of the mirror putting makeup and beautifying herself why because people will be impressed with her rather than the husband and the slightest thing that me trigger the Temptation in a man's heart Allah makes it forbidden even while walking imagine Allah says and let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment so if a woman wears something on her leg or on her foot types of jewelry that makes a ringing sound this is forbidden and that is why so many times yeah you go to malls go to malls and watch the men I don't watch women watch only men and laugh your head off you find people respectable people walking decent people married people and the minute they hear the high heel sound immediately you find heads turning it might be a man wearing a high heel but the sound itself ignites something so subhanallah shaytan Works in strange ways his job is to tempt you the prophet Allah went further to forbid women from wearing perfume even if coming to the Masjid peace with him so a woman nothing and he found a beautiful smell a beautiful scent coming from her incest and he asked her where are you going yeah the slave of Allah the almighty where are you going Masjid she said yes she he said to her go back and have a full shower because the prophet said whoever goes out wearing perfume going to the Masjid Allah would not accept her prayer until she goes back and has a full shower because of that perfume and biologist tells us that they've discovered recently that there is a gland in the in the nose of men that provokes uh sexual desire not only that the prophet says whoever there is a woman whoever wears perfume and goes out of her house and passes by men so that they can find the perfume smell she is committing an act of fornication or adultery imagine and the prophet instructed Allah is also some women when they come to the Masjid to come without any sort of perfume to the Masjid How about if they're going to which is what is the Masjid the prophet tells us the most beloved peace of land to Allah is the Masjid and the worst and most abhorred piece of land to Allah is that's what the markets and how do our women go to the markets have a bottle of perfume what are you doing yes I'm a Muslim I have to show people that Islam is beautiful and Islam smells good yeah but you're doing it on the wrong place you should do this but you don't do it because this has more a harm than good and immorality in our community is something we cannot bargain with and that is why the prophet protected the community even if you are leaving the community the prophet says it is not lawful for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without Haram so full stop where is she going she's going to visit her parents in our home country is she does she have any Muhammad her no it's Haram it's forbidden she must not her father is dying send someone from her country to come and pick her up I don't have money she sits her father is dead she sits it is not permissible at all for a woman to travel type for Hajj for Hajj which is a pillar of Islam if she doesn't have a mahram she's Exempted she cannot even if she is the richest woman on earth I'd like to know her maybe I have two slots to go no no I'm just joking a even if she was the richest woman on earth she cannot travel without a mahram and this is the beauty of Islam that she has to be accompanied by someone who would take care of her in the Masjid we have to protect the community we have to protect the morality of the Muslims the prophet tells us the worst of the rose of the men is the first the last and the worst of the women's role is the first why because Allah wants them to stay as far as possible even in places of of worship now I'm shocked when I go to Islamic quote unquote gatherings and I'm giving a lecture and I find the women intermingling with men so this is a problem nowadays the issue of Morality In a Muslim Community nowadays our stands the way we look at these things has changed drastically people are so engaged in these Haram things knowingly or unknowingly and they find the problem because everyone watches movies TVs if you tell someone lowering the Gaze is a must he laughs at you yeah yeah lowering the Gaze in the street in the in the office but watching TV why is it wrong I cannot touch it a lot of the brothers say I cannot touch it so what's wrong in that I said okay watch pornography why is it haram if you cannot touch it he said no no this is okay where is the line yeah showing the size is okay Malaysia wedding a song is okay where is the line where we say no this is Haram it is Allah tells you to lower their gaze whether on TV or on the street if you look at the Muslims they're shaking hands with Nan mahrams they're chatting They're laughing they are uh having this affection towards the opposite sex and you if you tell them this is Haram what will they tell you this is honest and any pure friendship is there anything honest and pure between a wolf and a sheep when I see a wolf and a sheep walking together and I say that the wolf stay away from the ships honest is my body we're going training what do we what do I tell him there isn't anything such as that if you look even at the one of the strongest and most advanced advances in the world the president who had a beautiful wife cheated her with an intern who was half his age working in his office cheated her and a big Scandal was spread this where is the friendship it was a friendship only cigars but again this is"
