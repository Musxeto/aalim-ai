  "title": "When is it Permissible to Disobey the Parents? (They don't let me do some Sunnah) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the uae you know that if you are playing voluntary prayer if our parents call us we have to respond to them it is very important so what about if they are following a strict opinion based on their belief and conviction which is not true but this inspect in fact of giving evidence they are not uh ready to follow so if for example if they say not to move fingers in threshold or to wear cap or related to following a miles such as reading yes for asking for that if you disobey them is it considered to be disobeying them i've mentioned this before fahimbai that not everything that your parents order you to do that you have to comply with it and i've said this not to make you rebel against them and start you know rejecting whatever they say to you no you have to be diplomatic if your parents ask you to stand for two hours and not sit you're not obliged to obey them if they ask you to finish the food on your plate when you're full you're not obliged to obey them or to eat something you don't like you're not obliged to obey them but when i say this i'm not saying it to encourage you to rebel and to fight and pick up a fight with them no they're your parents at the end of the day and you have to be diplomatic beautiful obedient respectful so you have to walk a very thin line here so if they tell you to not abide by the sunnah such as moving the finger in salat or raising the hands you mentioned wearing the cap wearing the cap is not from the sunnah so you can obey them in that because this is not part of the sunna at all if they order you to abandon such sunnis you're not obliged to obey them but you have to be diplomatic so if you know that they don't want you to move your finger don't pray in front of them pray in the masjid if they your father is in the masjid and he watches you and he orders you not to move your finger when you pray next time pray somewhere away from him at the end of the day if you're stuck and you're put in a corner and you can't avoid it either do it or skip it you have to weigh the pros and cons if you think that maybe i skip it for a month in order to build confidence in his heart towards me in order to make him love me and respect me and acknowledge that i have knowledge in the quran the sunnah that i'm following the correct path maybe i should skip it just in order to have a long-term investment rather than a short-term investment you have to be wise in deciding according to the consequences what is the best course of action and allah azzawajal knows best you"
