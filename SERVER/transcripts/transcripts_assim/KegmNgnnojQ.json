  "transcript": "my school when I which I go to I cannot uh pray like on on lessons they do not allow pray I can't go to the toilet because then they like become suspicious and like I am really struggling to pray because they're like the barely no Muslims there and there's like some Hood guys uh Imran prayer is not something that you ask permission for if you are at a school and you are in the west and in the so-called Democratic country like Sweden or Germany or any else uh place else as Muslims we don't go to the authorities and say excuse me can I have five minutes to pray no I just find any location that is empty and I start praying nobody would dare and stop you so go ahead and pray a don't ask for for permission yes they have the authority to not allow you to go out of the school during school hours to pray in the Masjid for example this is logical and uh understandable but no one can stop you from praying you're allowed to go to the toilet to answer the call of nature you're allowed to skip classes sometimes you're allowed to go and play in the gym who cares what they say don't even bother ask have honor and pride in your religion and do what you have to do without caring about these disbelievers and what they say and what they permit you to do pray you're not harming anyone you're not offending anyone they have the audacity to burn the Quran and to authorize it through the highest courts in their country and that's okay and when it comes to you praying alone whether if you want to tap that dance nobody's going to say anything if you want to strip out of your clothes they're going to clap you and say keep up the good work but if you want to pray they're going to criticize you the hell with them with all due respect"
