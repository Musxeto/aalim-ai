  "transcript": "ald by now I believe alhamdulillah you're saturated withed so mallah now after yesterday's lecture inim is something in your DNA in your bloodstream but to reemphasize the importance ofed the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that the Jews were divided into 71 sects and the Christians were divided into 70 two sects and his um the Muslims will be divided into 73 sects all in Hellfire except one and the prophet saidat identifying this saved sect may Allah make me and you among them they are those who are upon my footsteps and my companions these are the one or this is the sect that will be saved now when we say 72 sects do we mean h Shafi hanafi Maliki and the likes no these are not sects these are schools of thought the sects relate the 72 to AA to conviction and belief so so the ra is definitely from them 100% the grave worshippers are from them the amount of innovation because B is divided into two types B that takes you out of the fold of Islam and B that does not take you out of the fold of Islam but it's a major sin and you're sinful and you'll be punished in tormented in Hellfire because of that so among the 72 there are those definitely who committed bid that nullifies their Islam those who deny Allah beautiful names and attributes this is kufur those who also deny the predestiny the divine decree those who deny that Allah does not create our evil Deeds like the jabri and thead and the likes they come and say Allah does not create our evil Deeds who creates it there's only one Creator are you crazy Allah created everything in this universe Allah says in the Quran Allah created you and what you make and do so this is takes you out of the fold of Islam so definitely it's part of the 72 sects and those who do B but remain within the boundaries of Islam they're committing a major sin and they're part of the 72 sect but they will not be in Hellfire for eternity they will be purified in Hellfire until they consume all their bad deeds and bad Innovations once they're purified Allah with his mercy and Grace will take them out of Hellfire dip them in the River of Life restore their physical characteristics to be normal and then admit it to may Allah protect us now having said this the fight between and has been ongoing for a very long time since the time Allah Asel created this Earth and what's on it when Satan decided to take the side of shik and kufr and disbelief and went against Allah's commands and shik continued and will continue until the day of judgment when Adam descended to the Earth peace be upon Him people were upon Islam for 10 centuries as the prophet saidat whether these centuries are 100 years each or a generation that we do not know how long it is it doesn't make a lot of difference for us and the Muslims are so fascinated by details that they are distracted from the men Target they say she just tell us please were they 100 years or not the dog that was with the youth in the cave that Allah mentioned was he a German Shepherd or a duberman or maybe a Chihuahua a why are you asking these questions said no no no we have to know this planet which prophet ibraim showed his people that he cannot be a God he saw a planet this is my God no it's too small this is a plan the Moon is is my God no it's too small and it goes away the sun is my God no it faded away my God does not fade away so she tell me please this planet was it Venus was it Mars was it Uranus cover Uranus don't don't mention these things here this is a family show so what was it it's none of your business Allah did not tell us about it it has no importance to it so why should you care therefore 10 centuries where their Generations or a thousand years they were all upon upon Islam until the time of n peace be upon him his people were misled by Satan big time and this is how Satan Works Satan is very very patient he's not in a rush like me and you he's willing to wait a year 5 10 a Century 10 centuries but once you fall you will fall hard and you have to understand how Satan works if you want to save yourself from falling into FNA from falling into Haram but this is not our topic because we have a specific thing to address I just woke up so I'm enjoying my time and drinking coffee so after 10 centuries there were five righteous men that worshiped Allah guided people good Scholars when they died the People Fell very sad and this is how we feel when our Scholars die we feel regret and sad there used to be a beacon of light that we used to seek in the middle of the night now they're dead so they felt sad so Satan whispered in their ears why don't you build statues so that whenever you see them you remember them and you go and offer night prayer and you fast and you do good deeds like they used to remind you they looked at one another said that's a good idea and they uh uh asked D Vinci not to make the monola before the Mona to make these uh uh beautiful sculptures on their graves so people mashallah for 100 years they see these sculptures they go and pray and make VI and and and go attend Circles of knowledge after this generation died a new generation came and they said hm these cultures why are they there Satan said because they are the reason you are getting rain you have to go and worship them you have to sacrifice for them you have to always ask them and make Dua for them and this is when sh started on Earth Allah says in the Quran and they' have said You shall not leave your Gods nor shall you leave nor nor nor nor these are the five Idols that they used to worship and hence in our religion it is totally prohibited to make sculptures to draw living things sh do you think I'm going to worship Mickey Mouse yeah what's wrong in having sculptures or this and that this is how Allah this is how sh this is how our Prophet protects the borders ofed not even to get close to somewhere sometime we see this in Old soap opras Arab soap opras when someone dies the wife comes to his portrait with black cloth on the wall and he said my husband you don't see what the children have doing to me people want money from me and she speaks to what to the dad and this is only a portrait how is it to be if it's something more and more and this is why Allah asael prohibited making of sculptures for the sake of the fight has been going on for the sake ofed no took his stance peace be upon Him 950 years he's calling his people what kind of patience did he have I give dawa for 5 minutes to an atheist he gives me allegations I feel Fed Up said you're right go go to hell literally go to hell I'm not old enough to speak with you that long my life on Earth is very limited I have little time I can't waste imagine 950 years giving Daw to people who are not willing to listen or obey him at the end what did they say they accused him of being insane the people of n denied before them and they denied our servant and said a mad man and he was repelled Allah says and not only that they extended their threat into assassination by torturing him and hitting him with stones until he dies they said if you do not deest oh no you will surely be of those who are stoned for the sake ofed ibraim peace be upon Him took a stance when he was a young man in his teens stood in front of everyone in his tribe and Country because he had the backing of Allah he was revealed to I don't want any of the youth now standing up and saying said I am like ibraim I'm going to kill I'm going to destroy I'm going to blow up places hey wait wait I'll put you in jail what are you doing he said no ibraim saw the evil and he fought against it he said ibraim was given the message of Allah do you have a message of Allah no but Shan is giving me these IDs then you have to pay for it no this is not permissible ibraim for the sake ofed stood in front of all of his people to the extent that they built a huge infero a huge fire a big furnace they say that birds flew way up in the sky and fell barbecued because of the heat so horrible and they threw him in the fire was he frightened never what did he say good morning peris what did he say sleep drink coffee huh means Allah will suffice me I don't need anyone when is the one I trust and rely upon so they threw him in the fire fire but what did Allah do Allah says in the Quran they said burn him and support your Gods if you are to act we Allah said oh fire be coolness and safety upon ibraim for the sake of accused their Prophet Prophet Hood peace be upon Him of being insane we only say that some of our gods have possessed you with evil Insanity for the sake of they wanted to assassinate Prophet who's the tribe of prophet Sal who's Sal this is problematic anyone is a messenger of Allah who was his people thud and before thud there was ad and their messenger was named Hood so remember these names hood and they are messengers of Allah for that they wanted to assassinate Sal and Allah says they said take a mutual Oath by Allah they're Idol worshippers they're disbelievers yet they say to one another take a mutual Oath by Allah that we will kill him by night he and his family not only him we will assassinate his family and children as well for the sake ofed Musa peace be upon Him tolerate ated the Injustice the abuse the ridiculing of pharaoh who accused him of being unable to speak fluently unable to communicate well and accus him of being insane he says or am I not better than this one referring to Musa peace be upon him him who is INS insignificant and hardly makes himself clear he accuses him of not being eloquent and cannot speak fluently and then Pharaoh said indeed your messenger who has been sent to you is insane and so many messengers of Allah were accused by so many bad things all combined in our prophet's fight against shik for the sake ofed our Prophet sallallah alai wasallam suffered equivalently to all what these Messengers had suffered before him they he was accused by being a sorcerer a liar a soothsayer a mad man and that what what he had brought them was nothing other than Legends and they say Legends of the former people which he has written down the fight between and shik between truth and falsehood will continue till the day of judgment and each and every one of us would have his share in this fight but we may not see it visibly we may may not see the Border Lines clearly because shik and kufur is so intermingled in our societies and communities sometimes in our own household that we don't notice it unfortunately we're so indulge in this life that we fail to see what is obvious so many times there will never be victory for the Muslims imagine if they just Cote this and they put it on the media the she wahabi she says there will never be victory for the Muslims no don't don't please edit this huh for the cameras there will never be victory for the Muslims unless they go back toed look at the Muslim history failure after failure loss after loss this is what we see however there are shining years and events where the Muslims were the head of the whole world and this will happen again this is the promise of Allah to you providing you establish listen to this beautiful Ayah Allah has promised those who have believed among you and done righteous Deeds that he will surely grant them succession to Authority upon the Earth just as he granted it to those before them and that he will surely establish for them therein their religion which he has Preferred for them and that he will surely substitute for them after their fear security how Allah says for them they worship me not associating anything with me this is Allah's promise in the Quran you believe Allah Allah will grant you this Victory Allah will grant you this security Allah will grant you this sovereignty over the whole earth because it's his and he is the most powerful unfortunately look at the Muslims around you if Satan has succeeded and managed to infiltrate them big time in their religious Affairs until they Associated others with him while thinking that they're doing well Allah says in the Quran and most of them believe not in Allah except while they associate others with him we believe in Allah but unfort fortunately we associate others with him this can be clearly found in grave worshiping in believing in the AIA and their ability to control the universe in believing in the prophet being able to control the universe like he controls the palm of his hand this is a sect found in is in in in the Muslims and attributed to Islam this might be hidden the shik when we pray and we beautify our prayer so that people would mashallah his recitation is good mashall is there is much we play we pray in our homes from 0 to 60 in two seconds faster than a Tesla but when in the Masid doing and you hear the bones cracking and mashallah what is he doing is he flying this is no this is showing off you're showing off because there are people watching you this is minor sh and it can get bigger and bigger depending on your Iman and on your knowledge and this is why and most of them believe not in Allah except while they associate others with him today as Muslims if you see someone killing someone or stealing his money or consuming Haram intoxicant or doing drugs people would not stand still they will interfere and they would speak against this evil and they will try to force it to stop which is a very very good thing alhamdulillah we still have have some Iman in our hearts but all of these things are not considered to be a big thing when compared to shik and I hope you agree all of these things can be forgiven if you kill someone you will go to hell but this sin killing intoxicant fornication all major sins that we know that are major sins and eventually you will be tormented in Hellfire to expiate your sin all of them fall under the Divine will on the day of judgment if Allah wills it I forgive your sins go to Jenna no hell no this is in Allah's hands you can never know if you're going to have this favor or not but if if you come on the day of judgment with a grain of shik this is not forgiven at all and nowadays people when they see people doing major sins they fight against them and they stand in their faces but when they see them doing shik may Allah guide them they don't try to stop this shik you don't you don't see people giving advice to grave worshippers or to those who make by the prophet or by the righteous deceased or aah or Allah asael says about those who invoke the dead and who could be more astray than those who call upon others besides Allah others that cannot respond to them until the day of judgment and are even unaware of their calls whoever commits shik even if he were to be a messenger or a prophet he will abide he will go to Hellfire Allah says indeed he who Associates others with Allah Allah has forbidden him paradise and his Refuge is in fire and if you look nowadays where we do not have prophets and Messengers anymore you would find that there is a similarity between our times and the times of the messengers and the prophets peace be upon him the same rhetoric the same ridiculing the same labeling that was done with the messengers of the prophets is done today with the righteous followers of the prophets and The Messengers they accuse them and they label them with so many things righteous practicing knowledgeable Muslims upon the of what are they accused of oh they are extremists they are fundamentalists they are from the Stone Age es they are wahhabis why simply to discredit you there is no sect on Earth called wahhabi there is nothing as wahabism nothing it does not exist but people lie and they believe their lie so at the end of the day said oh you are a wahhabi why because you don't go to Graves because you don't rub righteous people for Baraka it's not a magical lentil or or something a genie would come out people say it's white now look at it it's black wash your hands at least use a sanitizer so what is this concept it is the concept of shik whatever you oppose it you will be labeled like The Messengers and Prophets you're a Wabi you're a fundamentalist you're an extremist you're not sharing the B with us you are this and you are that this by the way is the test that Allah gives to everyone on Earth each and everyone on on edit this please okay let me repeat again this is the test that every one of us is going to get on this Earth each and everyone is going to be tested and this test is mentioned in the Quran Allah says do people think once they say we believe that they will be left without being put to the test we certainly tested the before them and in this way Allah will clear clearly distinguish between those who are truthful and those who are liars this is cascaded throughout history and the test has to be hard and difficult don't think that the test will be easy if I am a rich billionaire and someone comes and says she we have a madasa we have a school we need a bus to take the orphans and the students to uh uh their quarters and I give him 200 300 500 1 million ring is this a problem for me no it's not a problem there is no test in it there is no test in it because I have a lot of it my test would be if I wake up half an hour or an hour before F and I feel like I have to spray tahajud as a billionaire I'd rather pay sheh so and so he pray tud for me no the test is for you to go and make W and pray to fast Mondays and Thursdays oh fasting I have a business meeting I have a luncheon I have this and that I love eating this is your test so Allah tests each and everyone with what is a test that is difficult that is hard a Muslim woman would be DET tested with a horrible husband who's abusive who's rude who never sends her love messages who never complements her beauty who never connects to her family this is hell to a Muslim sister this is her test I could say the same to the men but then the sisters would hate me and I would not think that this is appropriate at the moment because the fight is between andik not between man and wife so the idol worshippers at the time of the Prophet Alam they disbelieved him and accused him of lying like the previous Nations before Muhammad Sall alai Al wasam why do they lie why do they disbelieve why do they reject the truth what is the messenger calling you to do give him money no he's not asking for anything for himself he's asking for right righteousness for goodness for high moral conduct for everything that would get you and bring you goodness in this life why are you rejecting him number one because of arrogance it's the arrogance in the heart Allah sent you couldn't Allah find anyone better than you arrogance Envy No No it should have been me not you that's why I will never never ever believe you like Abu sufyan said or sorry Abu jahal said Abu jahel along with two other Idol worshippers used to stay at night listening to the prophet Alam in meca reading the Quran in Salat and when he met with the other two they said you're listening to you're the head of the disbelievers and you come stealthly at night to listen he said yes M this is is the truth what he's saying is the truth Quran is the truth and they were shocked why don't you believe he said how can we believe my tribe and Banu ABD mb's tribe the prophet's tribe we were competing for hundreds of years they give money we give money they give charity we give charity they give water and food to the pilgrims we give water and food to the pilgrims we are like racing horses competing for honor and pride but now one of them comes and says I get Revelation from the heavens how can we compete with this no wah I will never believe in him this is envy that is found and this is found till date unfortunately there is this collaboration between the Jews the Christians the secularists the Hypocrites the orientalists all of other forces than Islam collaborating on you because you support the side of to and they support the site of kufur and and likewise the people of the people of thud they had done the same thing do you know the people of AD who's their messenger huh I don't know what you say I need a crystal clear name H mashallah what a good lecturer I amallah very good so their Prophet Hood came to them now a small lesson of History the First Nation after the people of no was so whenever you get a quiz maybe you get 100 ring prize remember me so the people of AD came after the flood and Allah gave them so much and favored them with huge bodies with civilization with engineering ability that was way way before their time yet they were Amazed by their own civil ization so they rejected Allah's favors and blessings Allah says in the Quran then do you wonder that there has come to you a reminder from your lord through a man from among you that he may warn you this is addressed to the people of quray and remember when he made you successors after the people of N and and increased you in stature extensively so remember the favors of Allah that you might succeed and this was addressed to the people that took extensive measures to boast about their power Allah asael says do you construct on every elevation a sign amusing theirselves and take for yourselves constructions places and fortresses that you might abide eternally these people used to build houses on the top of mountains not to live in it just like something to be amazed of when you come and pass you say wow what a huge building that is in mountains how did they carve it how how did they build it how did they reach that place they were giving offsprings they were giving wealth they were giving Gardens everything was perfect for them yet they continued to disbelieve and to associate others with Allah and when they persisted in doing so Allah Asel sent his wrath upon them to annihilate all of them and so Allah says and as for they were destroyed by a furious bitter wind which Allah Unleashed on them nonstop for seven nights and eight days so that you would have seen its people lying dead like trunks of uprooted palm trees their huge bodies that was that was almost 60 foot High imagine people being 6 foot high that's nothing lots of people are 6ot high they were 60 feet tall 60 and some of them reached the height of 90 how many stories how many buildings you know this height this is how they were and for seven nights and 8 days this cold terrifying wind came to them and you could see them lying dead as for samud this is the tribe that came immediately after them after who was their messenger Allah sent to them kept on asking them to believe in Allah look at the tribe that was before you look at they're recently close to you you can see what happened to them and the tribe of samud were known to be great Architects and you can still till see till date their Heritage carved in mountains when you look yeah we can't do this with our technology today we can't at all do this laser and bombs and nuclear bombs nothing can do this man magnificent art magnificent art yet they used to do these houses and they lived in them when it was Winter and cold because no rain could affect it and in the summer they go to The Valleys where they can farm and trade and live as they wish so he came to them reminded them of what did they say no not interested he said what do you want me to do I'm just telling you to worship one God one Allah they said listen you want us to believe you look at this rock and there was this huge rock this is their bread and butter rocks and mountains so this rock we would like you to blow it up put your explosions or whatever we want you to get out of it a she camel a big beautiful wonderful camel not only that it has to be pregnant and we would like to drink from its milk so he says and if I do this would you believe me said yes sure come on do it do it and they're making fun of him and he took pledges from them and Oaths that they will believe him and they will worship Allah he asked Allah for this miracle and Allah Asel made that rock split into two and there came this wonderful beautiful amazing she camel that was pregnant these guys said whoa this is too much this is not what we were bargaining for man the guy is saying the truth now here comes the condition he says you want to drink from the co from the milk not coffee sorry you want to drink from the milk Allah Asel says one day you do not drink water from the well this day is entirely reserved for the camel it drinks from it the whole day but in return you get to milk the the camel and drink and keep and store whatever you want the whole entire country City Village tribe on that day they milked and they put in pots and they put in their refrigerators and they stored a huge amount of milk and milk is milk something that you can feed upon for ages not needing anything else and the other day they can drink water normally and business as usual that's a fair deal for something like this a miracle after a couple of weeks said nope not interested we want water we don't want milk okay what about the pledges the Oaths they said no we don't want this so they kept on in defiance and in disbelief and in kufur and shik until they they went and plotted to slaughter that Camel Allah told them do not touch it do not harm it yet they did not comply and they went and slaughtered it when they did this his their messenger told them well the you are about to be annihilated and tormented and Allah asael sent upon them and this is not the time but again sent a warning for three days and nights and then they died by the shout that had the sound of a thousand Thunders and the trembling of the earth and they were over as if they did not exist a whole nation was wiped off the Earth but Allah kept their homes as a trophy as a reminder for us to see it however the prophet saidat whenever you pass by you should not go in because you will be tormented like them if there was no other way then pass by quickly and swiftly while being in the state of fear that may the punishment of Allah fall upon you and you don't want this to happen I will conclude with the last story of today if you're still awake and this story is not by a messenger but rather by righteous people like you and me in Muslim may Allah be pleased with him narrates that the prophet once was telling them a story of people those who were before them there was a king and this King had a sorcerer the sorcerer got old so their HR Human Resources was quite good so the sorcerer came and said my king I think I need a successor and this is in HR called succession planning so the king said okay look for some good candidate that to take your place so the sorcerer looked around and he found a young boy and this young boy was smart clever so the sorcerer started to take him in and teach him his tricks every day from the way of the boy's house to the sorcerers office the boy passes by a monk now again people say she was he Jew or Christian what was the religion of the monk what was his maab what was his manh yeah it's none of your business Allah did not tell us about it move on so he used to sit and listen to this monk preaching toed what is the monk going to teach nothing but the Oneness of Allah and he said W this Monk's words are very captivating they're very nice I like listening to this this is natural but whenever he went to the sorcerer he was late so the sorcerer would beat him up you're late and you're my student and he beats him up so the boy complained to the Monk and he said every time time I come to you I get a good whipping so what should I do the sorcerer said no problem when the sorcerer asked you why you were late say to him my family kept me for some errands and when you come late to your family and they ask you why you were late tell them that the sorcerer kept me from some homework and it worked so he kept learning from theed of the monk one day while walking he saw a beast whether it's a lion it's a Tiger It's a dragon I don't know it's a dragoner nearby so he said today I shall know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk he took a stone a rock from the ground and he said oh Allah if the monk is more beloved to you than the sorcerer oh Allah relieve the people from this beasts evil and he threw the Beast and the Beast was dead so now it was cemented in his heart that the monk is on the truth and the Sorcerer is telling false falsehood so he started increasing in his powers till the monk said when he heard about this story he said my son I think you've reached a level that is much higher than mine and your pay grade is way above mine so if you became if you were to become famous please don't tell people about me that I was your teacher because then I will receive some form of torture and torment the boy said inshallah allahim as his reputation grew mallah the this story is captivating and people are awake mallah that's good that's good as his reputation grew big everybody came to him he's a righteous man he's a man of God the blinds came to him he said bah he cured them the leopard came to him please help us he said I don't help you it's not in my hands but if you believe in Allah I will ask Allah to cure you they say we believe in Allah he said bah and he rubs on them and they become well again so he became famous and the clinics went out of business one of the escorts of the king a minister or something he became blind so he went to him and he said oh Master these are gifts and wealth and gold and silver if you cure my blindness it's all yours he said I don't cure anyone it is Allah that cures people do you believe in Allah he says I believe in Allah he said bah and he wiped his eyes and he became able to see now the logical thing to do is take the money and run the escort did not do that he went to the king you know what the king wants from you what are you doing it's like when watching horror movies and the kids go into the barn and you know that the Killer is there he said don't don't do that but they still go go and they still get killed so the escort went to his king and the King said whoa you can see now and the man said yes he said how was that possible he said alhamdulillah Allah cured me and the King says I killed you look how stupid the king is he said I cured you he said no no Allah my God and he said you have a god other than me torture him so they started beating the heck out of him until he confessed and said the boy cured me with the will of Allah so they brought the boy and they started beating him until he said the monk is the one who taught me so the brought the Monk and they said to him are you the one who believes in Allah he says yes the king said do you believe in me the monk said no so they brought a saw that you cut woods with and they put it on the tip of his head no anesthesia nothing it's not it wasn't even electrical it was manual it said okay B one two and they started shipping him into halves and until he died and fell and he would not leave then he did the same to the escort huh blind man now you're not blind are you willing to go back and believe in me he said no and they did the same and he was cut into two halves and not rejecting his faith then he went to the boy but apparently he felt a little bit sorry for the boy so he said to his soldiers a bunch of Commandos take him and climb the highest mountain in our country once you reach the peak tell him will you reject your God and believe in our King if he does not comply toss him off so they went up up up up and then when they reach the top and they wanted to toss him off the boy said sh oh Allah suffice me with what you will save me from them and protect me with what you will and the prophet says this is in in Muslim the mountain shook they all fell from the top of the mountain except The Boy The Boy climbed down and he walked to the Palace knock knock who is it it's a boy come in so he went in and the King was shocked said hm where are your companions where are the Commandos said Allah sufficed me this is ridiculous bring another Squad they brought another Squad take him in a boat until you are in the middle of the ocean and toss him let the Sharks Feast on him they went and in the middle of the ocean he said and the boat trembled and capsized the all drowned and the boy came walking to the Palace the boy had a mission he could have run away he could have taken money with the powers he have and lived a luxurious life but this is the fight between andik when the man saw him he was outraged where are your companions said well Allah sufficed me and got rid of them the guy was out of ideas the boy his name is Abdullah he said listen I'll I'll show you a good way to kill me if you want to kill me gather all the people in our town in an open area and put me next to a tree either crucify me or just time me I'll be a target for you and and take an arrow from my quiver put it in the bow and say loudly the lord of the boy and shoot me in my temple and if you do this I will die the King was out of his mind he just wanted to kill so he did exactly what he was ordered to do he gathered all all those who believed in him to be God and they're listening and seeing Oh this is the boy that was causing problems and chaos and rioting what is the king going to do with him oh he's tying him up oh the boy is being a target for the king's practice oh the bo the king is taking a an arrow but not from his own quiver Royal quiver no from the boys and the King said loudly bah the lord of the boy and the people were shocked there is a lord other than you what is this there's something wrong and he shot the boy it fell in his Temple he didn't die the boy placed his hand on his Temple and he died the moment the people saw this said we believe in The Lord of the boy the companions of the king said whoops Houston we have a problem what is this what you were afraid of happened the whole country is Muslim now what should we do he said dig ditches in the ground and fill it with wood fire and put the fire on and whoever from the whole country refuses push him in let him burn and those who believe in me save him so they started to do this and the whole people of that Village willingly walked into that fire that led them to J willingly accepted to die rather than turn back to kufur and shik because how long will you live 60 years 70 years 90 years then what then death to live with your head held up high with to live fighting for your beliefs to live with honor and dignity W is better than to live forever without any in your heart so they kept on pushing people and burning them and killing them until a woman came with her infant child and you know how much a mother loves her infant and when she came into the fire she hesitated not for herself for her child and Allah made the child speak the infant spoke and he said oh mother be patient you are on the right path and she threw herself in the fire to conclude I think I've taken too much time but at least I got you awake to conclude the fight will continue till the day of judgment everybody is anticipating when is mahi coming well I don't have his ATA but he's coming when is Jesus descending he's coming when is the day of judgment why are you so eager about the day of judgment when you you die your day of judgment is done but if the day of judgment comes you never know whether you will be among those steadfast on the truth or you will go and follow the deal so now you have a chance to learn your religion to abide by it to call people to it and to be patient on Whatever May happen to you because of that I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among those who live upon toed and die upon toed and be resurrected in the highest levels of upon muham"
