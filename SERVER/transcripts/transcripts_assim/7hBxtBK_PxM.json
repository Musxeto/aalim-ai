  "title": "My husband hits me for not doing household chores, is he justified?",
  "transcript": "The next question is, my husband hits me when he forces me to do a household task immediately, which I can't do sometime later. I feel humiliated by this and I cry. Is him hitting me justified? Is he what? Is him hitting me justified? Of course not. He's a beast. He's not a real man, because he is beating a woman. You think you're man enough? Come beat someone your size. He would never dare beat another man, even smaller than his size, because he knows he's gonna get his backside whipped. So the problem is, the Prophet said, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, the best of you are those best to their wives, and I am the best to his wives. He, Mother Aisha said, never laid a hand on a woman or a child, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam. And, Ya Akhi, be a real man. For not doing home chores, you beat your wife? What kind of a man are you? Seriously, a man who beats a woman is not a real man. Wallahi. And if she was not a decent wife, she would have told her brothers and father, and they will beat the hell out of you. Seriously, then you would know, now you know, huh? Now you recognize, but because she's a decent woman, she's afraid for her house, for her marriage, for her husband, reputation, for her children. She's not doing this. Sometimes you have to put an end to it. A psycho like this must not be tolerated. Yes, if it's once every blue moon, and he apologizes, and he takes you to the Maldives to compensate for it, it's okay. No problem, I agree. But if it's on a monthly basis or a weekly basis, la wallah. You have to do something before he kills you, or harms you, or breaks a bone in you. Such a man is not a real man. And Allah knows best. you"
