  "transcript": "Sino from Austria Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is that I feel that my Islam is invalid because I can't understand the concept of Qadr. Like I believe that Allah is all-wise, all-knowing and just and He created everything but I don't understand how can we have free will and at the same time Allah is it who decreed our actions or am I misunderstanding something? Please could you clear this topic? Okay, pre-destiny is related to knowledge. Allah's knowledge and Allah's Qudrah, ability is displayed in the pre-destiny. Now you say how could it be that Allah has written my destiny and I have free will? So I ask you, do you have free will? Yes or no? The answer would be yes, most likely because you can't say no, you don't have free will. Otherwise I'll put you on top of the highest building in Vienna and ask you to jump and you have no other choice but to jump because you don't have free will. Definitely you'll say no, I'm not gonna jump. If I bring you a burning stone, a burning piece of coal, it's burning and I say grab it with your hand. No, I'm not gonna burn myself. You have free will. The issue is, do you know what Allah has predestined for you? The answer is no. Do you know when Allah predestined that you will die? The answer is no. Do you know what Allah predestined that you will get as provision? What will you make in your next exams? How your career path would be? Who you will marry? How many children you will have? Or maybe no children at all? Do you know any of this? He said no. In this case, why not sit home and wait for it to happen? He said no Sheikh, I have to study in order to get a job and I have to work in order to earn and I have to earn in order to get married. So you're doing it, this is your free will. But you don't know what Allah predestined for you. Therefore trusting Allah because Allah's knowledge is not like our knowledge. Our knowledge is limited to three dimension, to what's in this studio. I don't know what's out of the door, outside of the door of the studio and no one knows. But Allah knows what had happened and what is happening and what will happen in the future and what would not happen in the future. If it were to happen, how would things be? So Allah's knowledge is unlike anyone in this universe because He's Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. So feel the content in your heart and don't allow shaitan to mess up with you. You don't know what will happen in the future. But thinking positively of Allah, knowing that Allah is all wise, all fair, all just, all knowledgeable and possesses everything, that He will not be unfair to any of us at all. you"
