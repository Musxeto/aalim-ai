  "title": "Can we make dhikr instead of changing spots or speaking to someone after Fard prayer",
  "transcript": "cd from germany he says we know that the sunnah which states that after praying for prayer you must not pray sunnah or voluntary prayer unless you speak or change your position so would making vikkar after fart be considered as speaking it's an issue of dispute some scholars say yes i'm inclined to the opinion that says no you have to speak to an individual because when someone vows like um al-imran did uh i've vowed or he came to his people said that i'll not speak for three days he vowed so does this mean if he makes thicker he broke his vow that's of course is not you"
