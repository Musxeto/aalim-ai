  "title": "I pray all my prayers loudly so I can focus, is this permissible? Are prayers valid? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign are you praying alone or with the congregation this is permissible but it is against the Sunnah in silent raka meaning if you do this in the Fajr Salat this is the Sunnah if you do it in the first two rakas of this is the Sunnah but if you do it in Asar or or the last urakas of Russia this is not from the Sunnah does it have any impact on your Salat and the validity the answer is no your prayer is 100 perfect and valid should I continue the answer is no why as long as my prayer is valid because this is a loophole where Satan is going to come through after a while he will not make you satisfied by doing this alone he would say hmm you should say subhanallah Allah loudly so the whole prayer would be said loudly is this enough no after some time he would say I'm still not focusing tell you what let me turn off all the lights so it's totally dark in the room after a while let me turn off the air conditioning so I would not hear any sound and little by little he will totally make you crazy and insane what to do Sheikh put your foot down and follow the Sunnah no matter what Whispers he puts in your head and say that the best is the way of the prophet and I'm following it and after a few days it will all go away with the grace of Allah"
