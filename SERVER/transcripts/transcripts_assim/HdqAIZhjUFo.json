  "transcript": "uh some people use the concept of a global village and that right now when it comes to these issues like shaitan knows no boundaries right there's no more you know our culture used to be i think about when i became muslim almost two decades ago there was still the east versus west or like this is the east it's the west and so on are we could we say that the culture so different now or is it now becoming more uniform and more homogeneous so again it depends shaytan and this is what i always give an intro into my counseling session straight on looks at an individual if an individual is inclined to religion to the quran he loves allah he loves muhammad ali prophet he is so meticulous about washing the arms did i cover every single aspect of it um is there a drop of urine so he's very keen very careful when it comes to issues related to halal and haram food this type of person shaytan works in a different way by extremism by extravagance by inflating a small grain of sand in his head into a big mountain as big as the himalayas and this goes into depression extremism uh despair of allah's mercy until he floods and flees the the religion of allah i'm going to hell both ways so who cares the other type is the negligent ignorant type doesn't care about halal haram doesn't care about salah never praise maybe shaytan doesn't focus on extremism or extravagance no he just simply opens the gates of dunya focuses on desires and lusts on sins how to party all night long how to make him fall into ribba into being wasted zina etc until he which is the vast majority of the muslims until they don't relate to islam anymore so now coming back to the global village this is what the media is doing at the moment they want everyone to be in this melting pot not to be of the first individual the one who's so keen on islam no they want them all to be negligent of deen and religion and to fall into sin after sin until they don't know what islam is and this is what we're having look at europe look at the americas you will find that people pretending to be muslims but they have nothing relating them to islam none whatsoever you"
