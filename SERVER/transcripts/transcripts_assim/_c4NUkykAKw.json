  "transcript": "Nasha, it says if we are not fasting due to menses and if small children ask us why we are not fasting, what should we say? Well actually, this is a proper time to explain to the children that there are differences between men and women. So in general sense, a woman should say to her child or to her younger brother that women have a particular time in the month where they cannot pray and they cannot fast, unlike men. Men do not have these excuses and this is something that Allah created women with. Without any elaboration, just give them this notion so that they can understand that there are differences between men and women and that there are no third gender as the trend is ongoing nowadays. And with this inshallah, this does the job."
