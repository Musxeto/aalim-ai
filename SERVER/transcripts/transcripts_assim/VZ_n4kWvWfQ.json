  "title": "Can we watch halal videos but the person is doing haram, like eating with left hand or eating pork..",
  "transcript": "so I didn't understand how to know uh if a video that like have Halal content but uh there is a person in the video that is doing Haram like eating with the left how to know if it's permissible to watch or not the content of the video if it is all in all Halal and it is not propagating or endorsing anything Haram it's okay to watch so someone who is presenting the news and telling us what is happening in razza and while doing this he's clean shaven he doesn't have a beard this is a sin but his sin is on him not on me so I can benefit from the content which is halal to watch and learn and benefit from if someone is giving a cooking show and showing me how to cook salmon with this sauce or with that and in the process he eats with his left it is Haram for him not for me but if he is for example drinking wine and saying that we have to drink wine with uh uh emel cheese after dinner or whatever whoa we have to stop here because this is a major sin and he's endorsing it it he's calling us to do it so I hope this makes sense"
