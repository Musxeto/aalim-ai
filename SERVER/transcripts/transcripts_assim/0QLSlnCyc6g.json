  "title": "Bought property with mixed haram and halal money, how to cleanse revenue",
  "transcript": "Uzma from India My question is if a woman purchased three houses on installments but these installments were paid from her local income mixed with bank profit amounts and it is not known whether the local amount was dominant or the unlawful was dominant at the time of payment of installments. So the houses were purchased over a period of time now and there are tenants in the house which pay rent to the woman and now can the woman consider this rent totally halal and use it to give us zakat on her gold or should she separate any amount from it? If a person buys a property from mixed income, halal and haram, the property is his but the amount of haram is still haram. So the revenue he gets is still mixed revenue because it originated from halal and haram origin. What to do, you have to calculate how much haram was involved in such properties and intend to cleanse it by giving it out from your halal money in order to have the whole property halal for yourself and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
