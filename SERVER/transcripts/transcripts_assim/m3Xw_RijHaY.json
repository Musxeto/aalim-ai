  "transcript": "Muhammad from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh my question is regarding voluntary zikr or dua so if someone has chosen a particular time of the day like in the morning or evening or in the noon and he does some certain types of zikr or dua at that time not just out of convenience because that time suits him and he knows that it is not trying to attribute anything to hadith or anything like that. Is it allowed or is it not allowed? It is not at all a problem to specify a specific time for your zikr which are general which are not related to your belief that this is more convenient or this is closer to the sunnah no it simply is more convenient for you to do them at 10 o'clock to 10 30 because this is the time you have break for example or the time you don't have anything to do or the time you work out in the gym or any other reason it's not related to religion so this is a time of convenience and it's not related to another form of worship there is no problem in that inshallah you"
