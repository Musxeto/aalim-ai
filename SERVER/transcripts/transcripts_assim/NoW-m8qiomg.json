  "transcript": "mentioned here in the book it says that it is recommended to be paid for the unborn and this is not mandatory this is oh this was suggested by sayyiduna Northman even our family are very pleased with the third caliph and it is a recommendation but the vast majority of Muslim says that it is not mandatory because it was not mandated by the Prophet as salam but it is still something that is considered to be negligible for those who can afford it and hence giving it would be something beneficial so"
