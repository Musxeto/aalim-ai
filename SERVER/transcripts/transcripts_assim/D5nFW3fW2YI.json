  "title": "Should I also pray 4 rakat sunnah between the two athaans in the Hanafi Khutbah?",
  "transcript": "Burak from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, in the masjid in my city, the Jumu'ah prayer goes like this. And the imam gives, first of all, the imam gives a lecture. After that, when the time for dhul, when the time for dhul arrives, then it's being called and then almost everyone stands up and prays for the car of sunnah. Then the event is being called again and then the imam starts the khutbah. Now my question is, should I also pray four raka'a between the two events like everyone else? Or should I just pray two raka'a because I hear that between event and qa'amah there's always a sunnah prayer? Or should I just sit and do dhikr or dua until the imam starts the khutbah? Jazakallahu khairan. What they are doing, akhi, is not from the sunnah. So the lecture that the imam gives, this is usually done by the Hanafi and they call this bayan. And they usually do it so that they would elaborate on different topics and then devote the khutbah, the two speeches of khutbah al-Jumu'ah, on trivial things that, or just dua nobody cares about, which is totally against the sunnah. Nevertheless, the first adhan and the second adhan, there is no sunnah prescribed or had been ever performed or done by a prophet alayhis salatu was salam. So praying four raka'a or two raka'a is totally not from the sunnah. So you just better off sit and continue to read the Quran or do dhikr and do not follow them. Al-Fatiha."
