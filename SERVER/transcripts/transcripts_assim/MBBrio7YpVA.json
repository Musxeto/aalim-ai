  "title": "Daee claiming if Umar was alive today & was given a test in Aqeedah, he would fail! Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the uk he said that there is a day who said that if umar may allah be pleased with him where to be alive today and was given a placement test in atida he would not have passed it now i know where this brother is coming from and this is his way of expressing that knowledge in its academia and its technical form has evolved in a way that was not known to those who came before us not because they're ignorant rather because they do not know the classification that to hate means that allah is existing and there is they don't know this categorization yet they know what it means or entails they know definitely what everything means but they don't know that they are for they don't know that the conditions of seven and they start listing it because this is something that came afterward their time so i know what the brother or this quote unquote darya meant when he said such a thing that probably he was frustrated with all these tests and questions and akida related issues that he may think that would segregate the ummah which is not true however if we give him the excuse to listen to mis express himself we do not give him the excuse to mention the name of umar may allah be pleased with him with such disrespect so this is something that was a mistake if the brother came publicly and apologized alhamdulillah nothing no one is perfect we are all uh fallible we all make mistakes this happens welcome to the club but the biggest mistake is when you continue to insist on your mistake and try to justify it this is wrong disrespecting umar may allah be pleased with him is totally unaccepted or any of the companions no matter what good intention you had you have to come up in the open and apologize but at the same time it is not appropriate that we make a witch hunt out of it and simply say that this is the end of the world if the mistake was done out of um sheer mistake with good intention an apology would do insha allah and we all know that no muslim would disrespect any of the companions the least so we have to be fair and not overreact like so many people do and they have their uh uh own private vendetta that they would like or agenda that they would like to see coming to life may allah protect us all"
