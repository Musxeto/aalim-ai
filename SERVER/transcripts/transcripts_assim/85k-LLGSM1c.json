  "title": "Is Dua of a Fasting person is accepted, if He Doesn't Forbid Evil and Enjoin Good?",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing from qatar my question is we know that the fasting person is accepted so what if such a person does not with the evil and enjoying the court then what is dua cannot be accepted so you're talking about the dua while fasting yeah like the fasting person but he but he doesn't like forbid evil and enjoying god so then is it like is it i have a dilemma the dua of a person while breaking his fast is answered this is backed by a hadith and there is a threat from the prophet allah that you should enjoin righteousness and virtue and forbid evil and vice otherwise you may and this is a possibility ask allah and he does not answer your dua so he's saying if a person does both he's fasting but he does not enjoin righteousness and virtue so how can we combine this is in allah's hands this is not in yours and mine allah may accept his dua for one reason or the other and allah may reject his dua for that reason so this is something we cannot give a decisive answer upon but we are hopeful in allah's forgiveness you"
