  "transcript": "uh neha says is it permissible to buy replica sports shirts shoes replica designer dresses handbags etc of big brands this has two uh um ways to look into it one way is the ruling of selling counterfeits so what's the ruling on me bringing fake brother or louis vuitton or a rolex it's counterfeit can i bring it and sell it the answer is no this is totally prohibited and my money is haram because this is equivalent to cheating now the other way of looking at it is i am a consumer i go to the market and i find these replicas i ask the government and they say that we don't have any uh agreements or treaties with the original companies or countries so you can buy this this is halal it was imported they paid customs they've cleared it everything is legit in this country or that so as a consumer as a customer can i buy it some say if you buy it you're buying a halal thing because it's there for sale and you're not doing anything others say that this is not permissible because buying stolen goods when you know it's stolen is prohibited for you and you are not permitted to buy it just on the account that the government allowed it in so any stolen car any stolen watch that you know it's stolen and the country allows you to buy it so you cannot buy it because this is haram for you and beside only fake people buy fake brands and allah knows best"
