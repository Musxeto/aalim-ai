  "transcript": "belly from Bangladesh sh you said white discharge doesn't break Udu but Islam Q says it does so I'm confused what white discharge white discharge okay uh it says it does it doesn't break U but Islam says it does break Udu okay so what who are you asking I follow Islam because are you this is very awkward if Islam Q&A says something and I say something and you trust Islam Q&A follow it you want to make your life difficult I have no problem with that so what's the problem H and I follow Islam only because you said to follow it otherwise I follow you more that that doesn't make any sense if I tell you to follow it and then it says something that is not following me either you follow me all the way or follow them all the way but you cannot keep on hopping from one place to the other and cherry pick they have their opinion I have my opinion and my opinion is based on the LA the latest of she's fatwa on that and this is what logic implies and this is what ease of Islam implies if you want to check every couple of hours and renew your wo every Salat and change your nickas or do whatever you want to do every single Salat be my guest but it is not logical to come and say oh Sheik so and so says this and you say this follow the she don't follow me"
