  "transcript": "We have a caller from Canada, a raise. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, I have a question. What is the sunnah of following, what, how do I follow the sunnah of using a miswak and what is the reward? Jazak Allah Khairan. The sunnah of using a miswak, this twig is called miswak and it's very nice, very useful. The sunnah is to brush your teeth with it whether sideways or upwards depending on what's more convenient to you and it is highly recommended when you enter your home so that your spouse would find a good smell before you make wudu, before you offer prayer and after a meal for example. So using it is something that is beneficial and it is highly rewarded because the Prophet said Alayhis salatu Wassalam, had I not feared that I would burden my ummah, I would have ordered them to use this miswak before offering prayers and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
