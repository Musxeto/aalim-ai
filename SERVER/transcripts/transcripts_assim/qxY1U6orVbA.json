  "title": "We have Two Friday prayers in same masjid, I know its not permissible but what 2 do? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is that we know that holding two or more Friday prayers in the same mosque is not permissible but in my school since there are many students the school waits for the second one to finish in the Masjid then once thermostat is empty they conduct a third year now the first the first jummah that happens takes place when the students are on lunch break so I could I could I could ask the school to especially let me pray the first two months but I highly doubt that they will allow me as there are chefs in the school who have more knowledge than me and the problem is that I will have to confront them and I will not be able to convince them as I don't have enough knowledge to debate in this model so what should I do foreign q a and also attributed to the major Scholars of Islam in Saudi Arabia and the vast majority of jurors in schools of thought say that it is not permissible to repeat the jummah twice in the same Masjid now this is the fatwa that has been issued and this is what has been circulated among the school so the scholars and the schools of thought I personally asked one of the major Scholars here in Saudi Arabia because this is above my pay grade I don't have a say in it and he told me that this is the fatwa that we give but for people living in kaffir countries like Europe or Australia they have to refer to their Scholars they know best about their country but the ruling in schools of thought according to the major scholars in Islam here they say no it's not permissible so to me if I were in your shoes though my feet are a bit bigger than yours I would say that as long as these people who are in charge of your school and the scholars of your community say that this is needed due to necessity especially in a cafe country where we do not have the facility to pray outside the Masjid and there are no open places I believe that this is inshallah acceptable for you in your case where your Scholars say that this is okay and Allah Knows Best"
