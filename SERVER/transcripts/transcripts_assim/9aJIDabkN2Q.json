  "transcript": "[Music] let s from The Prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by alhim dear brothers and sisters in Islam Al IM Muslim in theah reported that Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam addressed us once and said six are the duties of a Muslim over another Muslim the companions may Allah be pleased with them said oh prophet of Allah what are these the prophet replied when you meet him offer him greetings when he invites you to Feast accept it when he seeks your counsel advise him and when he sneezes and says all praise is due to Allah alhamdulillah you say May the mercy of Allah be upon you and when he falls ill visit him and when he dies follow his funeral we talked about offering him greetings which is the first d duty of a Muslim over another Muslim the prophet then moves on to the second Duty and that is when he invites you to a feast accept it now is this a general Feast that any invitation you get it is a must upon you to answer well the answer is no Scholars say that the feast that you're supposed to answer is an Islamic Feast something that is based in the religion such as a party or a meal of marriage or a meal of which is the sacrifice offered when a person is blessed with a child this is what is known as a legal or an Islamic Feast but if someone for example is having a gathering of old friends and he calls you to come and have dinner with them and you don't want to come well this is up to you this is not an Islamic Feast that you're obliged to uh uh attend and reply too and the prophet Alat wasam made this one of the duties of a Muslim because it makes the host happy and joyful when you answer his invitation and that is something that Islam places great importance on and that is to make people happy to make them joyful and we have to bring to the attention of our brothers and sisters that it is not permissible to answer invitations that would include sins even if they were Islamic invitations to an Islamic meal for example unless you attend so that you can change these sins for example so many times we are invited to to weddings and when we go to these weddings we see the people sinning we see them doing a lot of wrong unlam practices if this is the case if I know that I'm invited to such a party it is not permissible for me to attend it so if I know that this particular wedding has the habit of smoking what is known as the shisha the Hubbly Bubbly it is not permissible for me to stay with them if they are watching something that does not please Allah or listening to something that does not please Allah I have to leave that place and in the first place if I know that such sins would be there I must not accept this invitation likewise with women when a lot of the sisters complain that the weddings they attend include people taking their pictures uncovered with video cameras or with normal cameras and this is completely out of the question and it's prohibited for sisters to attend such weddings they also complain of weddings having inappropri roate dresses and costumes women exposing their bodies though all those attending are women yet there is a dress code that must be respected in Islam between a woman and another woman if they do not respect such a dress code in this case it is not permissible for them to attend such weddings and they would not be sinful and in both type of invitations or weddings if there is a lot of extravagance it is forbidden for us to attend so if I know that there there is a lot of money being spent a lot of food being wasted just for the sake of showing off it is not permissible for me to attend such a feast or such a party and unfortunately it is the habit of Muslims nowadays and you can know this when you read the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam when he says that the worst meal is the meal of the WIA of the feast a person is invited to and he justifies this by saying because those who do not want to attend are invited meaning the rich and those who want to attend are prevented meaning the poor nowadays people focus only on those with influence those with power and those who are rich and they neglect the poor the needy those who are weak because they add no value to us a proper meal is not like this at all the Muslims choose to feed those who are believing those who are practicing Muslims not those who are sinful and arrogant the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam advised us by saying do not accompany except Believers and do not have your food eaten by other than the righteous and this is very difficult but this is what the prophet Alam advis us of don't have your friends except from those who are believers and don't invite to your food except those who are righteous and who are filled with the fear of Allah because if you Circle yourself with such people your life would be a happy one as they will guide you to to whatever pleases Allah the almighty I'm afraid that this is all the time we have so until we meet next time lessons from the prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim [Applause] alhim"
