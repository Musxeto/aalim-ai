  "transcript": "abdul hamid from the uk yeah yeah um the question is uh i just need an advice or something um in my family i handle i attempt to be the only practicing muslim however i created a strong islamic presence amongst my family so much so that i made them understand that bad days and first days uh not islamic transition so i'm trying to pass this on to my kids and my wife or obviously my wife's a but my kids i don't want people sort of wish them happy birthday and taking them out for birthdays i just need a hikmah or advice on how i can stop this uh because i'm just building a strongest presence in my family basically so your first question is how to convince your children that birthdays are not islamic uh yeah yes okay no problem inshallah abdul hamid from the uk he says i'm the only one practicing in my family and i'm trying to push sharia inside my own family and i'm doing a good job insha'allah however i find it difficult to convince my children and i don't know what's the most appropriate way to convince my children not to practice birthdays especially my parents my siblings may congratulate them may send them gifts may try to throw a party which i totally disagree with this requires a lecture and a couple of weeks ago i did a lecture for one of the islamic sentence in holland and it was about how does a muslim practice his religion in the west in non-muslim countries so it's on my youtube you can find it there inshallah and it should be beneficial in a nutshell all the disbelieving countries have one target one objective in mind and that is to get you out of your religion as allah azza mentioned in the quran in many places so we don't have to establish this because this is already an established fact now their severity of such attempts differ from one country to the other nevertheless their main objective is to strip you out of your islamic identity and this is obvious when they fight the hijab when they fight anything that seems to indicate that you're a muslim when they force co-education and prohibit segregation when they fight any teachings of islam even in masjids in your own houses of worship they come and confiscate it and close the masjid and do whatever they want with the imam why because he's teaching the quran or the sunnah this is blatant enmity and hated to islam this is a well-known fact so what to do your number one priority is to instill an insert an implant in your children's heart the muslim identity we are different we're not like them we're muslims we worship one lord we believe in muhammad ali we have our honor we have our dress code we have our set of rules that we embrace and implement in our lives when they know that they're different when they sense that they're different they would refrain from being melted in the same melting pot pot they'll have their own identity and they'll be proud of being muslims they fast when everybody is eating and drinking they halt whatever they're doing to go and offer the prayer and come back and people identify them due to their identity when you succeed in doing this when you tell them that birthdays is not part of our culture it's part of the disbelievers culture and way of life it makes things much easier and more uh closer to their common sense they relate to it because okay okay if it's against my religion i'm fine with that unlike when they are with everybody else everybody else is pr is celebrating it why not us why don't we have a cake why don't we have candles why don't we have happy birthday to you now they can relate to this and understand you"
