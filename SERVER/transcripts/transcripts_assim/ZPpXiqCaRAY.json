  "title": "If my parents die as disebelievers, is it permissible for me to take their house?",
  "transcript": "permissible inshallah um abdullah says i'm a muslim and my parents are christians if my parents die as disbelievers it is is it permissible for me to take the house in which they've lived before if they leave it verbally to me as a gift first of all the prophet said al-azam a muslim does not inherit a kafir a disbeliever and a disbeliever does not inherit a muslim so this hadith the majority of scholars all agree upon it's authentic there's no loopholes here or there you cannot go anywhere else however the scholars say that there is a difference between inheritance and a will a will is in the same category of a gift so if they write in their will that after our death this much of our money goes to our muslim son or our muslim daughter this is permissible some scholars limited it to one third because in islam we you cannot write a will to someone who is not inheriting you for more than a third of your possessions anything that is more this is void anything that is one-third and less it's okay so scholars say that if this disbeliever parent of yours did not have anyone to inherit from their own religion in this case it is permissible for you to take the whole will if they write everything to you not as an inheritance but as a will if they did not write a will you cannot inherit a single penny of them because the hadith is crystal clear now in your case um abdullah says that they verbally had given her the house and the gift cannot be materialized until it is taken and possessed by the one given to so as long as they did not register to you the house and said that yes the house is yours and we are writing a registration and and transferring it to your site as long as it's verbal then we have to look into it whether it is a will or it is a gift as a gift it's not permissible because they did not register it and they did not give it to you to possess as a will we have to see if there are witnesses or not because each one of us could claim that yes my father gave me this or that if the authorities in your country non-muslim country do believe you and take your word for it and you are saying the truth inshallah this is valid and you can go ahead and take it"
