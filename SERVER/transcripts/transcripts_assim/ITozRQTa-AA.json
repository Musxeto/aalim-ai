  "transcript": "[Music] asked the prophet to teach her about something to say during the prayer and he told her told her to read um but 10 10 times um uh during the prayer so the one of the Sheikh taught us that we should recite them before the salaam in the tashaud subhanallah but ten times all these three have cut ten times before saying the Salam so is this correct or should we cite after the after the after seeing the Salam first of all I have to go back to the Hadith my memory is not as strong as it was although I did Muslim The Fortress of the Muslim alhamdulillah and it's on my YouTube channels on Huda Channel I think it's also on that TV channel I forget the subhanallahu Akbar ten times is authentic as ascar after the Salat is over and now I've always said this so many times we can say subhanallah alhamdulillah 33 times and then we say this is one version or we can say subhanallah 33 alhamdulillah 34 which is similar to what we say before we go to bed or we say subhanallah ten times there's also another one saying it 25 times all of these are different variations and it's all alhamdulillah acceptable and valid but this specific vicar is it to be said before the Salam no I don't know anything to be said before the Salam as such is it to be said to be said as afkar of inauguration of the Salat after the first takbeer I have to revise this and go check it out because as I said my memory is not as it used to be alhamdulillah"
