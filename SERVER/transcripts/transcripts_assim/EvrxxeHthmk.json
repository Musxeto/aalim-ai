  "title": "Due to muslims being targeted in India I fear 2 pray at school Can I combine prayers assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "you know very well like last year whatever happened regarding hijab and North so alhamdulillah consider religion as my first priority but uh clear in India we Muslims are being targeted and I study in a kafir university so during the time of Zohar I am unable there is no nearby Masjid so that I can go out in interval and pray and if I pray in corridors it is like some lecturers may look at me and they may Target me or they may punish me or they may suspend me something like that so Sheikh due to this necessity can we combine our prayers and apart from this I apologize for the tweets which I made uh in this week sorry for that okay first of all dream the issue of necessity is defined by the true need to do something someone is starving I didn't have a bite for about four hours whoa that's a lot and I'm really starving and there is no food available except ham chops pork chops in the shop next to me so can I consider this as a necessity the answer is no a necessity is measured by the true need someone who's starving and is about to die about to pass out in the desert and there is nothing to sustain his life except to eat from a dead dog saying okay you can do that but not to Feast on the dog and starts to make a special dishes Etc no no you can take one or two bites cook it and eat and wait until Victory comes from Allah azzawajal and Allah shows you a way out So when you say to me this is a necessity I said no this is not a necessity what you're afraid of is probable not inevitable you are afraid that maybe some of the lecturers would see me and put me under the radar and harm me and maybe make me fail in my subjects I hear your name is an Islamic name so should you change your name from Muhammad into a Komar of course not so don't put barriers and don't imagine things that are not real alhamdulillah there are over 200 plus million Muslims in India and if they all hide their Islam and put their tails between their legs definitely they will become extinct in couple of years time no be proud of your Islam don't be in confrontation with them but nobody stops you from doing your prayer on your own in one meter by one meter area in four or five minutes and going back insha Allah"
