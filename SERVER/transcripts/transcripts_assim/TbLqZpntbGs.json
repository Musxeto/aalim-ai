  "title": "Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) or Pulling the Plug | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Naf says one of my friends son has been in ICU since last October so basically saying that can we pull the plug and this is problematic because a lot of the people say when we are admitted to hospital we put or request a DNR do-not-resuscitate and the person who for example drowns and you take him from out of the water he's not breathing if you do not resuscitate him by doing mouth-to-mouth and and then I don't know what they call RCP pcr whatever if you don't do this he'll die but if you do it he'll come back to life and he's stuck breathing so if a person can be revived this is a must if the child's possibility of living is there it's a must you keep he could keep the machines but if three trustworthy doctors muslims' stated that brain is totally damaged and he is like a vegetable in a vegetative state he would never come back to life he is brain dead and the machines are just keeping the heart pumping and the lungs working in this case yes it is totally permissible to pull the plug so this has to go through the doctors who are Muslims and trustworthy and to prove that this child is totally hopeless - coming back to life regaining his consciousness being active again because the drain at the brain cells are totally dead and not functioning and would never be restored again in this case yes there is a possibility and permissibility for pulling the plug may allah azzawajal grant all our children health wealth and steadfastness on Islam"
