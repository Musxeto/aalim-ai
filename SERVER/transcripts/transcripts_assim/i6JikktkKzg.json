  "transcript": "um so you said we cannot go out with a women that don't wear like Tab and my question is like um how proper does like the hijab like need to be because for example once I was like in a moss and like an Auntie asked me to like take like drink something with her outside and then but like the thing is for example she didn't have like a long dress so I wasn't like I'm not sure if that would be like the proper hijab you know first of all when we say that it is not permissible for a hijabi woman to go out in public with a non hijabi woman we don't say this because in a sense that it is Haram we say this because it is something that would not add any value to the hijabi it would probably tarnish her reput ation for associating herself with a or a woman who is thirdly it would endorse the sin of the Noni as if it is something normal to be with and to hang out with and to accept her sin open sin like that not that it is a sinful act in the sense that you will be S sinning for doing this because non hijab is are everywhere where but we say that it is inappropriate for someone who is abiding by the Sunnah who is uh um showing her pride in the religion of Allah to be associated with such people therefore going out of the Masjid with a hijabi old Auntie who is not wearing the proper hijab maybe wearing a a sh sheral kamis and maybe just covering her hair or putting something on her hair this is totally permissible inshallah"
