  "title": "Who should lead the prayer, Hanafi father lead prayer & made Hanafi Sujood As Sahu",
  "transcript": "Saad Khan from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Today my father led me in prayer and his recitation has some mistakes. I told him some mistakes so he could correct them and told him to try his best. But in third rakah he rise up from ruku saying Allahu Akbar instead of Sami Allah Hulman Hamidah and I asked him so he also didn't say Subhana Rabbiyal Azeem he said. I heard a whisper or very low voice that he said Sami Allah Hulman Hamidah and I was so confused at that time. I said Sami Allah Hulman Hamidah and Rabbana Walaqal Hamd and I did the Sujood and I followed the Hanafi Sujood As-Sahoo as he did it. So he follows the Hanafi Sujood As-Sahoo and I also forgot to tell him that how to do the Sujood As-Sahoo which is non-Hanafi. First of all it is not permissible for a person who does not know how to recite the Quran correctly without mistakes to lead someone else who's better than him. So if you can pronounce the letters correctly in the Fatiha which is the most important pillar of the Salat better than your father then you must not pray behind him even if he's your father because failing to pronounce it and like those who say Sirata Al-Lazeena, this is unacceptable at all. You cannot say Al-Lazeena, it's Al-Ladheena. Si is similar so there's acceptance in some of the differences but such mistakes that change the Fatiha you cannot pray behind him. Thinking that he said Subhana Rabbi Al-Azeem and finding out that he didn't does not impact your Salat because during the Salat you thought that he said it, it's a silent thing to say so you could not have known whether he said it or not. Saying Allahu Akbar instead of Sami'allahu liman hamidah, this is leaving part of the mandatory acts and obligatory things to say in Salat. If he did it out of a mistake or forgetfulness the prayer is valid and the compensation for it is by offering Sujud Al-Sahw. If he offered Sujud Al-Sahw according to the Hanafi Madhab which is totally wrong, it's 100% wrong and not accordance to the Sunnah of the Prophet and the way of the Prophet and you followed him because he follows a respected school of thought, your prayer and his prayer is valid insha Allahu Azza wa Jal."
