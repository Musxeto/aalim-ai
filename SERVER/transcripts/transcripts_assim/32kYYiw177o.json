  "title": "Can we take a shower while fasting? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "nor says can we take a normal shower in the afternoon or in the evening when fasting some people say it is not permissible to take a bath after particular time when fasting okay the rule of thumb is that we refer everything people say to the Quran and the Sunnah so it's not logic that we apply meaning that hmm taking bath like an hour before sunset is really really relieving and it's cool and it's fun this breaks your fast or if I am taking a hot bath and there's so much steam and I'm inhaling this steam this nullifies my fast it is not logic that you apply it is allah allah allah says allah rasool the prophets are solemn says so when someone gives me such a claim that taking a bath taking a shower taking a dip in the swimming pool affects my prayer if it's after a particular hour meaning after noon this is baseless I would ask them bring me your evidence if they don't bring me evidences from the Quran or from the sunnah or from the logic of the scholars not of the laymen then i would not take this seriously and it was reported that the companions went travelling and they're fasting they used to swim to cool off some of the companions used to fill his his bathtub and he used to dip himself inside of his home to cool off there's nothing wrong in that alhamdulillah"
