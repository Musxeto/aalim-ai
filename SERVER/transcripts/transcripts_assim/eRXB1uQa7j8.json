  "transcript": "is it permissible to consume shellak um it's uh the secretion of lack bug but bits of the bug itself can come into it when processing shellock is usually you used in sus first of all the conspiracy theory the rumors the allegations do not play into Islam and to is our Islamic belief so many people say oh sheh toothpaste contains pork Pepsi contains pork coffee is made of Haram this that the bones of the Dead is used in this and that and they make and making sugar they make everything Haram the rule of thumb every everything is halal by default until proven otherwise so such rumors and claims are baseless secondly it is not permissible to consume insects at all to buy them let alone the secretion I hope I'm pronouncing it good let alone their droppings but if it is under gone if it was to undergo a vigorous process of changing its physical and chemical characteristics like in the case of gelatin or glycerin in this case it becomes a new substance and this new substance is not related to the old one and hence it becomes Halal so by default old sweets are Halal until proven otherwise and if we are certain that it contains such ingredients then if it went through this process of changing it from such a specific substance into another substance in this case it becomes Halal inshallah Andel Knows Best"
