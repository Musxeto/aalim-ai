  "title": "Some Muslim women tie their Hijab in the form of Kufi, is this imitating men?",
  "transcript": "as it resembles kufiya, but their parts of awrad are closed. Is it considered to be like a man? I have no idea. I need to see how this isâ€¦ What do you mean by kufiya? Is it what I'm wearing? This is kufiya. In our local Arabic, what I'm wearing underneath the cap is called kufiya. So I need to see an image of it in order to identify whether it is imitating men or not."
