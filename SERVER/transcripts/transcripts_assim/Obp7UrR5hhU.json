  "transcript": "Sofya our third question from the email she says can you tell me if Hitler peace be upon him is a prophet or just a righteous person and what is the significance of the event that took place between him and Musa alayhi salatu wassalam it's an issue of dispute whether Hitler was a prophet or not in the most authentic opinion that he was a prophet otherwise one of the greatest five messengers of Allah still would not be ordered to go and seek knowledge from him and if you look at the events he says in one of them that I have not done it through my own will meaning that it is allah azza wajal who wanted to do this and allah revealed to me to do what I had done and about the significance there are so many lessons to be learned among them is that this incident took place because Musa peace be upon him was asked by the sons of Israel is there anyone more knowledgeable than you and he said I know no one who is more knowledgeable than myself so what's the significance of the story will hazard first of all you have to acknowledge the fact that you do not know everything and that is why the only instruction in the Quran that Allah is Odelle ordered his prophet salallahu alaihe salam to ask for more his knowledge buckle rugby Sydney relman there is nowhere in the Quran where Allah orders His Prophet to say o Allah increase me in health in wealth in power etc only knowledge so Allah is telling his Prophet say increase me O Lord in my knowledge so this is something that we all have to acknowledge that our knowledge is in significance it's very little and we have to keep on pursuing asking and learning and teaching people secondly whatever calamities take place there has to be a wisdom behind them there has to be a reason so if I could not Hach the person who's responsible for this I would take this as a the will of Allah Allah he ordained it upon me and I know that Allah does not preordained upon me except what is good and this is only for the believer so when the ship was a little bit harmed and when the boy was beheaded and killed though he was still young and when they were a little fixed the wall that was about to fall there was a wisdom that Moosa could not understand but al-qaeda did that because he was a prophet and Allah ordered him to do it so one of the biggest significance of this story is to appreciate a Las gift to you through calamities even a calamity is considered to be a gift and a blessing from allah azzawajal you may find the wisdom behind it you may find the justification and you may not but both ways you have to trust Allah Azza WA JAL who only chooses the best for you yeah you have out the young law how healthy of my soul our only Lambrini whom"
