  "transcript": "Shake if I only pray for the prayer for example two for fa for for and only for prayer and no sun no na and also in Juma only the two raat congregation prayer and nothing else nothing before or nothing after am I sinful a man asked and posted a similar question to the the prophet Alat wasam when he came and said tell me about Islam among the things that the prophet told himat he said that Allah mandated that you pray five times a day and the man said nothing else and the prophet said nothing else unless you want to do voluntary prayers so the man concluded his presentation by saying by the one who sent you with the truth I will do exactly what you told me without increasing or decreasing from it meaning I will only pray the five F prayers when the man left the prophet saidat wasam if he's telling the truth if he abides by what he committed himself to then he has succeeded this means that what we're obliged to do are the five five F prayers that's it and whatever you do more this is for your benefit but if you don't do anything else you're not sinful now having said that no one in his right mind mind when asked would you like me to give you 10 lakh rupees or 10 Rupees only no one in his right mind when giving the choice would say oh no 10 Rupees is sufficient everybody would say of course 10 lakh if you can make it 100 lakhs that would be even greater why would it come when it comes to Salat you say oh I only want to pray the five F prayers okay no problem there's no sin on you but if you know if you were to know that praying the five F Salah would put you here in Jenna if you ever enter it while if you pray the 12 Ras in addition to the F prayers it will place you here and if you pray night prayer it will place you over here would you not offer them of course not you would in addition to that when you pray the five daily prayers only definitely there will be lack of concentration some additional movement being mind absent and these all reduce from the reward of your prayers as per the Hadith Allah orders the angels to write half of it 1/3 1/4 1/5 until 1/10th of the prayer is registered and 9/10th are thrown down the drains then Allah says to the angels search and look if my servant has offered any voluntary prayers to compensate for such missing rewards and if you do have voluntary prayers it will compensate it and Elevate its level so you should consider that and Allah Asel Knows Best"
