  "transcript": "Imran from Sweden Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So while watching your broadcasting I got weird thoughts and I thought and because you look so unfamiliar and like I don't see people looking like you Do you have a question Akhi? Don't go into trivial details, go to the question. Do you have a question? Yes, yes, so and I thought and I think like I don't know if I'm mocking Islam because I think I saw Sayyid something like Maulana or something I don't know because I heard it on some other video and my intrusive thoughts were on, have I committed Kufr because I'm mocking a person or like I don't know So this is not Kufr to say someone is Maulana or to say Sheikh or the likes, this is not Kufr"
