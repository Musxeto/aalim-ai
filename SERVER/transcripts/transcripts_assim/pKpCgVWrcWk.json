  "title": "If Allah gifted Prophet ﷺ‎ his good deeds why must we love him & not love only Allah assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is before I studied Akita I used to believe that self-amagement is halal and that the credit of my good deed goes to me why should we love Muhammad if all the credit of his Good Deeds Goes to Allah our Good Deeds are gifts from Allah all the good deeds of prophet Muhammad were gifted to him by Allah so if Allah is the one who gifted him why should we love Muhammad shouldn't we love Allah instead of loving him if Allah tells you to love him what are you going to say I have to obey him so what Yeti this question is a clear manifestation of how shaytan is messing up with your head and if you're studying Akida and you come up with such a question you are studying something wrong or you're setting out on your own not with not with Scholars this is dangerous if it takes you to this level Allah tells you to love Muhammad and Allah tells you if you don't love Muhammad you will not enter Jannah and it is one of the pillars of Islam to believe that Prophet Islam is Allah's messenger and servant and this entails that you believe him in whatever he tells and that you refrain from whatever he tells you to refrain and to do whatever he ordered you to do and not to worship Allah except with what he had ordered you to do and if you don't love him then you will not be a believer as the prophet said no one will become a Believer until I that is Prophet Muhammad is more beloved to him than his wife his parents his family his wealth and himself so this is the essence of Islam to love Allah and to love those whom Allah told you to love and on the top of the list is Prophet Muhammad Ali his Salah to assalam bhima"
