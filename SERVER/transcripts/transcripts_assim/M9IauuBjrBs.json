  "title": "The Beauty of Jannah - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] this internet connected i was asked to speak about the beauty of gender we have good news and we have bad news which do you want first badminton bad news i haven't been to jannah yet but the good news is that our prophet salallahu described it to us the unfortunate thing is that such a description by itself is not sufficient for us as humans because the only mutual thing between the things in jannah and the things we know of the only mutual thing is the name so allah says in the hadith i have prepared for my servants that which no eye has seen no ear has heard of no heart or it did not cross the heart of a human being and allah and the prophet says and recite if you wish no person knows what is kept hidden for them of joy as a reward for what they used to do so when we describe the beauty of janna it is nothing even close to reality but it is something that would make us look forward try to imagine try to sense the beauty of jenna if we would like to describe jenna from the outside the premises as they call it the property itself well for architects its soil the buildings the month it is made of the prophet said in an answer to a question what is zelda built off the companions are asking now if this question was inappropriate the prophet says would have said you should not ask such questions you should just believe if gender was metaphorical and not real the prophet would have said something down these lines but this is not what the prophet said he addressed and answered the question by saying it is a brick of silver and a brick of gold so they alternate the buildings the mansions the palaces the walls a brick of silver and a brick of gold and the cement between them is made from musk and this musk is so strong in smell and perfume that you cannot imagine what about the pebbles on the ground that we step on the pebbles are made of pearls and emeralds and the soil the sand the mud is made of saffron that has beautiful scent what kind of premises is this do we need to clean it do we need to hoover it something that you live in this smell beautiful spell you don't have to add anything to it okay but what about the buildings themselves well the prophet had told us about the rooms in jenna the rooms are mind-blowing when i enter a room i enter it to be concealed to change my clothes so that people would not see me the rooms in jannah the prophet said the inside is seen from the outside and the outside is seen from the inside uh excuse me i'd like to change then why do we have rooms each individual will be in his own quarters there won't be people perverts like we have today going from house to house in genesis looking in and peeking with the binoculars and trying to see you this is not found in general still i'd like to have some privacy you will have privacy because the closest neighbor of yours is like here in the sun it is you are in total privacy no one can see you besides even the women in the homes allah describe them that they lower their gaze and see only their husbands and by default the husbands will not go down to the market and try to pick up a random woman there is chastity there is love there is privacy all over in in paradise something that you cannot imagine here so these are the mansions or the rooms that the prophet told us the prophet told us about the tents okay if we have rooms and we have mansions why would we have tents well this is part of the bonus you will get what about the tenths the tense the prophet tells us that it is 60 miles long made of a hollow pearl and in it a stem believer a man has wives and families no one can see one another and here we get sisters saying what do you mean yes a man has more than one wife in general minimum is two the maximum allah knows this is not fair jesus we've been here on earth with this man who smells rotten looks rotten has a big belly and his teeth are not fixed his hair is allah he earns little his bad attitude abusive he loves his mother more than me and now you tell me in jannah i only get this thinking person no you will not get this thinking person definitely you will get a brand new person but he has the same name and he has the same cast yet everything in him is changing yet why have one man why can't we have more because women are made only to love one from allah azzawajal and they have the guarantee of allah to be happy to be pleased to be satisfied and not to have envy not to have hatred and not to have grudges do you believe allah then you will be more than happy but many also will be happy but no one will ever envy one another or feel depressed or feel sad there are mansions palaces we know about the palace of ramallah the prophet saw in a vision a very beautiful palace and saw a woman beautiful woman making wubu so he asked whose parents is and the angels told him this is omar's palace so immediately he left allah said why he said i remember your jealousy [Music] and in a vision and humor started to cry [Music] where are our men today where is their jealousy when they sit in their home and tell their wives you go and work you go and earn and you go and spend a week and for 10 years she does this on the 11th year he gets married again you are unable to support your own family and you go and marry again so be careful you have to have the jealousy of being men to protect your women to care for them to provide for them and to keep them in their homes queens undisputed now we know that in jannah there is a tree a rider takes how long 100 years to cross the shade 100 years and i'm writing if i'm walking maybe it may take me 700 years so this is one tree how big is german allah tells us in the quran that the west not the length the white of the jannah is as big as the heavens and the earth but without due respect i lose track i don't know north from south i seriously don't know anywhere anything in canada so how can i reach my home do i need a gps google maps take me to paradise home 101 is this like this no the [Music] more than you know your house in dunya if i tell you go home you go blind in jannah you know your home more than that if you go inside the homes what will there be a living room a bedroom a terrace what is it well the prophet described some of the furnitures in our homes allah all of this we hear every jumuah where the imam recites here so allah azza told us that there will be beds couches carpets different types of curtains different types of uh things pillows that you lean on made of gold silver silk pearls things that you cannot imagine sometimes we are fortunate to enter the house of a multi-billionaire and when you walk in you feel wow what is this nothing i was once invited to a palace and never ever go to rich people's places because they don't invite me other than that because i don't like going there it makes my heart hard not that i'm impressed of it but we went into this big house mansion driving over carpet this is how filthy it is he is he doesn't have marbles or cement or normal pavement he has carpets for the car to drive over and i would like i was not impressed i was feeling sick how many people would discreet and this person is wasting it on showing off subhanallah would you go in your grave will you tell them to put carpets inside as well and maybe a split unit ac nothing you will go to your grave like everyone else if you want to deprive me from this as well it is not something that you will be deprived of it is total enjoyment it is enjoyment that has no end the prophet told us that sleep is the brethren of death and there is no death in jannah and likewise there is no sleep so you will keep on enjoying your whole life for a thousand years no a million years no a trillion years no infinity [Music] [Music] and people shaytan comes to them and says oh that's boring boring stay here i take this i'm happy to take this aki there is nothing called boring in general there is no day and there is no night but they can see light coming from the bottom of our to indicate that this is evening and this is morning but it's all 24 7 360 days all light what is the color of paradise if you come to saudi the color of saudi is sand it's all desert if you go to jannah the color that dominates it is green why is that because the g's are everywhere and they are green and sometimes a bit black because when the plantation is good sometimes it's so good that it goes black because of the beauty of it and this is why in surat if you recite it you would find that allah says [Music] and this is because of the trees coming next to each other so it's almost dark sometimes you go into a garden and if you were fortunate to go through some of the beautiful areas on uh earth you will see this if you go to kashmir may allah liberate it and and give the muslims uh their freedom in kashmir they say it's the jannah of allah on earth these places have so much greenery that you think allah this is beautiful but if this is like this how is genna it is mind-blowing how does it smell by the way sometimes you go to countries and you find smell of horses smell of oranges depending on what's dominating what the prophet told us that it has a fragrance that you will find and smell 40 years distance 40 years i haven't reached it i still need to travel 40 years and then all of this you will find the smell some of the brothers have odour when they sweat and go in your city with us some brothers have oh dear not older it is horrible in general there is nothing like that everything smells to the extent that the beauty of the whole ring not the humans not the human women the human if one of their scarves fell into earth it will fill the whole earth with perfume this is one earth then what about the scarf of the human because the humans are of a higher level because of what they had done sure allah created them they didn't do anything they were not tested human women were tested and they went into trials so their reward is far greater than this do we have animals in jannah yes or no those who say yes raise your hands few those who say no raise your hand even fewer and those who do not know welcome to the lecture yes we do have animals in general the most common question i received on my website i have a cat and it died can i ask allah to be with me in jannah i love it so much i visit the grave once every week what happens if her mother dies nothing but the cat is different so they ask do we have animals yes we have animals but do we have our pets this luxury is something that not everyone can afford we have horses to do what men love horses by nature maybe they will be able to get something else to write but the prophet was asked do we have a horse or prophet of allah and the prophet says yes if allah admits you to jannah wherever you want to travel allah would immediately create a horse of red marble how can a horse be from it's alive it's red it's made of marble and shaytan comes to your head oh it is made of marble i will slip and fall and maybe break my leg how am i going don't think of the details why engage in the details believe there will be a horse yes made of red marble yes how will i ride on it if don't put so much thought into something you cannot even imagine it will take you any way you wish are there camels yes the prophet told us there are big camels with a nets that is so uh big sorry there are birds that have necks like camels alma says this is very nice you have birds like camos camel meat is nice but what about birds it's even nicer eating it is even nicer so don't you know rush things wait and you will have it the prophet also told us that the sheep are among the animals found in jannah and we know that you will have fruit of your own choice and you will have meat whenever you desire what kind of meat don't go into details some of the books that have seen says that whenever you see a bird you look at it you desire it it falls in front of you uh barbecued one says i like uh um fried chicken chicken i don't go into details fried grilled boiled raw you will have this but you have to believe in allah azza virginia as for the trees that we spoke about the trunks you know the trunks poverty is made of gold and all the poor people like you and me think okay then i can have you know like an axe and take the gold and take it back home and have a big bowl okay you don't need money you don't need you are there i cannot comprehend this do we have bags so can we take leftover of the food and give it to them so can i put it in the fridge there's no need for a fridge this is jenna don't compare it to your own life here [Music] creating a new narrative"
