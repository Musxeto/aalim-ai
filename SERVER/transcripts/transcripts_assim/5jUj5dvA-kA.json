  "title": "Allah forgives who have mustard seed of Iman in their hearts but who don't pray are in hell forever?",
  "transcript": "rashad from tunisia he says i have a confusion and this confusion is you said that a person who does not pray will enter hellfire for eternity and we have another hadith where allah tells the angels to take out from hellfire who's got a mustard seed the weight of a mustard seed of iman in his heart so how can we reconcile between these two hadiths there's no problem first of all i didn't say that whoever does not pray at all will go to hellfire this is what allah said in the quran when the people of paradise the people of the right look into hellfire and address the people of hellfire and say masala confisakar what made you enter hellfire so the first answer would be we were not among the worshipers those who pray so the first thing that qualified them to be in hell that they did not pray and the prophet said allah the pledge between us and them the non-muslims is prayer and another narration between a man and shirk or kuffur abandoning prayer whoever abandons prayer is a kafir or committed kufr and this is the saying of the prophet wasallam and another hadith the prophet tells us about those who come out of hell fire when the muslims intercede for their brethrens when the angels get them out they recognize them by the areas of sujud because fire consumes everything in the body except the areas of sujud where they used to prostrate which means that they used to pray and these are the last people who come out of paradise of hell and are admitted to paradise and they're called el juhan nami they are the people of johannes they identified in paradise by the the late people who came out of hell and they were burnt like like coal so all of this proves that a person who does not pray at all he has breached islam and he is a kafir those who have the weight of a master seed in their hearts of iman used to pray but they may have used to pray on and off that's why there are signs of prayer on their faces that they're identified by and they're taken out of hellfire because of that and allah knows best"
