  "transcript": "Char from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, can you hear me? I have two questions. I can only answer one, unfortunately, because the list is too long. Okay, I'll save the second one for next time. This has to do with investments. I've been a student of Islam since 2010. I was born in America. Before investment retirement, there was medical marijuana that was legalized, and I had put, I had invested in the stock for medical marijuana to be used as medical. And I did my research and all that, and the stock fell, and as it fell, they switched, they changed, this is out of Canada, they changed to recreational, and then purchased a bunch of liquor stores. So as the stock fell, it went from what I felt was halal, downed quite a bit of money, and now it's like I'm trapped. And I'm stuck because I feel like now this is for sure haram, and I've lost money, and I have to wait another year if I want to sell to even break even. Do I sell now and trust that he will fix the mistake? I don't know what to do, and I feel sick to my stomach over this. I made a mistake. My intention was to save money to make Hidra to Medina, which it's all, things are going good on that, but now I have this issue. I would appreciate your consulting, and also you're appreciated very much by many, don't listen to the critics. This by itself makes my day. The critics are a lot, alhamdulillah, but yeah, inshallah I have a thick skin, and it wouldn't inshallah bother me a lot. Akhi, you do trust Allah, and you are a student of knowledge for 13 years, and you want a noble cause to go to Medina, and Allah Azza wa Jalla will make this happen soon. Don't worry about that. Rizq is in Allah's hands. Yes, when you did your research, and medical marijuana at the beginning was legit. Now it's shifted into recreational marijuana, and to be sold in liquor stores, and a lot of the states have permitted it to be consumed by the public for recreation in specific dosages or weights. Now this becomes haram without any doubt. So my advice to you is to sell immediately, and whatever you lost, Allah will compensate it for you without any doubt, but waiting for the prices to go up while knowing that without exaggeration, 80% of the income is haram because it's used for basically recreational purposes. Nobody uses it as a medical substance except maybe 15 or 10, maybe 20% at most. The rest would buy it for recreational purposes. Then I would suggest that you bail out, and Allah Azza wa Jalla would compensate you for that without any doubt."
