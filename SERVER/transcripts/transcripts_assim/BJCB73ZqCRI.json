  "title": "Is the fast valid if you prayed Fajr but slept the whole day? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hasson says if someone is fasting and sleeps throughout the day after praying Feder and wakes up just before Maghrib then prays the missing prayers which is the harasser and then he does iftar he breaks his fasting then he prays Maghrib and Isha both in the Masjid will his fast remain valid first of all there is no connection between his fast and his prayer his fasting because he intended to fast before dawn and he actually fasted until sunset though he was asleep most of the time or if not all of it yet the fasting still is considered to be fasting is valid missing Lahore and the sort prayer and as it seems that he prayed answer just before sunset which means that he prayed it in time missing Lahore if this was due to a legitimate reason meaning that he had overslept and they tried to wake him up but he wouldn't and in this case he's not sinful he's sinful for staying awake all night he's sinful for that because he missed these prayers in the messages as Allah ordered him to do but this isn't a different issue so the fasting is valid now I understand that he prayed motherly been message it and then he prayed Asia along with the taraweeh as well so this is applicable and again there is no problem in or any connection between missing the prayer of Lahore Nasir and the validity of his salat and Allah and of his fasting and Allah knows best"
