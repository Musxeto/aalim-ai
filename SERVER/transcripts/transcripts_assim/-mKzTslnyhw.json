  "title": "Father earns Riba, when I advised him, he says don't be a Mulana!",
  "transcript": "Rajab from India Sheikh, my question is my father earns haram income from two sources. One is from riba and the second is from betting in games. So when I told him not to do this, he told me to don't become such a maulana and go live in a masjid. Don't tell me what to do, etc, etc. And told me to mind your own business. So what should I do? Mind your own business. It's very clear. You gave advice. He's not willing to listen and his income is from haram. Mind your own business. Whatever money he brings to the house, you can eat from it, you can use it, you can benefit from it. And the sin is on him, not on you."
