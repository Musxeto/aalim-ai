  "title": "15th of Shaban, Shabe Barat - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as for the 15th of Shaban I think they call it the Shah Bharat or something like that there is a lot of dispute among scholars and the reason of dispute is whether the hadith is authentic that highlights the favors and the blessings of this night or not and if we assume that this is a blessed night well the following question should be are we instructed to single it out to specify this night with any type of deeds or the day itself with any type of fasting etc as for the first question the most authentic opinion that this night has no authentic hadith showing its favour or that it is a blessed night the best or the most authentic that might be there is that Allah Azza WA JAL forgives the sins of all those on earth except those who are disbelievers those associating others with Allah all those who have are having grudges with their Muslim brethren but again this is an issue of dispute whether it's authentic or not even if that night is blessed are we allowed to offer any type of good deeds can we pray night prayer specifically for that night though I don't pray that prayer at all or should I fast that day the 15th of Shaban though the whole of the month I did not fast any day of it the answer is no why because the prophet alayhi salat wa salam it was never reported the he had fasted this day or asking us to do so or the companions of the prophet Alastair Sam ever favoring this day with any type of good deeds and this is a sufficient reason for us as followers of the Prophet Alice of Salem to not innovate a prayer such as solitude Tessa B for example and insist on praying after Asia until for like some of the brothers from Pakistan India or Bangladesh decide to do on the night of the 15th this is wrong and yes your intention is good but the way is wrong your prophet did not do it at least a lot of Salaam who do you prefer to follow the Prophet Allah was a little Salamone all your share how your Imam or your culture so this is not a cultural thing this is a religious thing analogical knows"
