  "title": "If we walk on impurities najasa, does walking on the Earth purify or clean our shoes?",
  "transcript": "uh ishraq from singapore uh you're familiar with the hades where a female sahabah asked the prophet about catching impurities as she used to walk through the streets to the masjid yes can the same be applied to the bottoms of our shoes for example if i were to step on let's say some urine and i continue walking does the shoes get purified afterwards yes the answer is yes and i think i've mentioned this yesterday in our uh ask zad episode but i don't maybe you you did not see it i said that the prophet islam indicated the hadith to women dragging their abaya and passing over in ajasa what to do with that he instructed the women to keep on walking as the pure areas of land afterwards would purify this impurity that may have been attached to the end of their abayas or skirts or whatever dress they're wearing and the same goes for shoes so if a person is praying in his shoes before prayer he must look at the soil of his shoe at the bottom of his shoe and if there is an adjacent he should rub it on the ground if you were to pass by an area where there was urine or sewer water or you stepped on an adjacent dog poo or whatever walking afterwards whether on grass on soil on cement or on the pavement or fault this would hopefully render your shoes to become pure again and if you were to look you would not find any traces of impurity and if there were traces physical phrases of impurity then this means it did not purify it yet but usually walking does the job and allah knows best you"
