  "title": "Can a nurse attend male patients & wear a shirt & trouser as a uniform? | Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "a sister says um a nurse and wanted to inquire if it is okay to attend male patients and we have to wear shirts and trousers as our uniform is it permissible attending male patients is permissible due to necessity when there is no male nurses to do the job in the vast majority of hospitals and clinics it's always such a position occupied by female so as long as she's not alone with a male patient because this seclusion is haram as long as she limits looking at the area that needs to be examined and as long as she tries her level best not to touch except with the barriers and they usually do this with a a a rubber glove or whatever in this case due to necessity this is permissible inshallah now wearing the uniform is totally out of the question there's nothing in islam that permits a woman to expose her aura to wear a shirt and trousers and not cover herself properly or islamically one would justify this by saying oh everybody is doing this in the west and they're disbelievers they're disbelievers but i am a believer i'm a muslim i'm not allowed to expose myself even in muslim countries even if the rules and regulations mandate this i wouldn't do that i would not compromise my religion for any uh such thing so this is totally prohibited know"
