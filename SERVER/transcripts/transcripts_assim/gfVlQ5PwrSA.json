  "title": "Fortress Of The Muslim (26) Dhikr after (salam) completing the prayer (2) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] so we finished particular set ofar to be said after the Salam and concluding the prayer what else well the Sunnah is as everybody knows to read the what are the MU they are chapter 112 113 114 the last three chapters of the Quran known as the last three why because they begin with [Music] and so theah is to recite each once after all five daily prayers oh can we reite them after voluntary prayers the Sunnah prayers nope only after the F all thear we've mentioned earlier in the previous episodes are to be mentioned after the f you don't mention them after Salat janaz the funeral prayer or the ra the voluntary highly emphatic recommended prayers or uh the Witter Etc these are only for the five daily prayers what else we also recite Sur or ayat Al what is a oh it is verse number 200 and 55 of chapter 2ah Al Bak what is a significance of it it is the best Ayah in the entire Quran the best Ayah yes this is what the prophet told us which indicates that the verses of the Quran veryy in their importance the greatest of them all is aat so what's the greatest of all chapters of the Quran is chapter number one Surah fa so what is as you can see [Music] Allah none has the right to be worshiped but he the everliving the self sustaining and the sustainer of all no Slumber can seize him nor sleep to him belongs whatever is in the heavens and the Earth on and on Earth who is he that can intercede with him except with his permission and he knows what will happen to his creatures in this world and in the Hereafter nor shall they Encompass anything of his knowledge except that which he Wills his Coury extends over the heavens and the Earth and he feels no fatigue in guarding and preserving them and he is the most high the most great this is known as aat what does Kur means this is a very important thing and it's related to in Arabic can have the meaning of a chair but we don't refer to the Arabic when when we have evidences from the Sala explaining it and the best one to explain it is Abdullah Abbas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father the cousin of the prophet and The Interpreter of the Quran he said that Al is the foot stool is the place of the of the feet the foot stool it is different totally and totally smaller than the Throne of Allah and this is something unfortunately people of ignorance May confuse and they think that the Cy is a throne or which is not at all as the size compared to the throne is like a ring tossed in the desert the size of a a ring compared to the desert is negligible and the kury compared to the AR or the uh uh foot stol compared to the throne is the same way what is the benefit of reading this Ayah the prophet said whoever maintains reciting aat after each and every one of the five F prayers nothing would prevent him from entering Paradise except death I want to enter Paradise now wait you're not dead if I I continue to recite after each F if I die I will be admitted to Jenna this is one of the greatest rewards and unfortunately a lot of the people a lot of the youngsters and some of the elders as well do not know this beautiful Ayah so unfortunate they don't memorize it they don't know the benefits of it because their parents failed to do so among the things that we should say and this is to be said after and so it's not part of thear of the prayers rather it is part of the morning and evening AAR and if you associate it with and that would be also great the prophet used to say none has the right to be woried except Allah alone without any partner to him belongs all sovereignty and praise he gives life and causes death and he is over all things omnip omnipotent he gives life and causes death you meet subhah and he's the one who does not die ever so saying this is definitely 10 times that is saying it 10 times not once after or during thear of the morning and the evening has great significance to us with the grace of Allah and we conclude with the following um Hadith or Dua that the prophet Alam used to say he used to say oh Allah I ask you for knowledge which is beneficial I cannot learn without him teaching me so I'm asking I ask you beneficial knowledge not any knowledge something that's that would benefit me and sustenance which is good so I need risk from Allah and sustenance provision is divided into two types something that we all know about which is worldly type health wealth power position jobs kids CH uh children and and wives Etc spouses but there is a specific type of provision that people rarely pay attention to and that is knowledge that is guidance that is the peace and Tranquility of the heart with when when filled with Iman and finally we ask Allah asael Deeds which are acceptable because there's so many Deeds that Allah rejects simply because they're not complying with the Quran and the Sunnah when you innovate when you follow other than the prophet Alam this is rejected no matter how many you do and we say this as part of thear after F prayer so it's part of the morning and not part of the evening mamam [Music]"
