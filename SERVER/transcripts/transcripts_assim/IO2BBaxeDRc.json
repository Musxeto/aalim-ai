  "transcript": "consider subscribing uh hassan from a man yeah sheikh uh when i intend intend to start wudu i find it very difficult to say bismillah i mean i try to say bismillah but it doesn't come out of my mouth and it happens when i intend to start pudu as a result it takes a lot of time for me to do so i stopped saying bismillah before buddhu i just directly start my voodoo without saying bismillah to make my life easy now i have a feeling that what i'm doing is not right because i read one hadith in abu dhabi that the prayer of a person who does not perform ablution is not valid and the ablution of a person who does not mention the name of allah is not valid so i feel like that i am cherry picking by following the easy opinion by not saying bismillah check i want to know uh is there any evidence backing the opinion of the scholars who say that saying bismillah before wudu is not mandatory okay hassan from [Music] i think a man he says that he has a problem with saying bismillah before performing buddha now anyone would relate to this question to be not normal there's something wrong with you you read the whole question without stuttering so you don't have a problem of saying bismillah no you can say in you said it bismillah bismillah three times in your question what's the problem the problem is shaytaan is messing up with your head and the bigger problem is that you're believing him imagine someone comes to me in the morning and says oh awesome you look pale are you sick do you feel any tiresome do you have any pains and i say no but yeah i'm not that you look really sick lots of the people when they're approached by others in such a manner they feel sick and false sick and this is their illusion lots of the people come to me in counseling sessions saying to me sheikh i have severe ocd sheikh i am sick sheikh i can't do this because i can i'm telling them are you telling me this are you convincing me with it um you don't have to repeat it ten times i've heard you the first time repeating it ten times mean that you are convincing yourself and this is the biggest illness you're not ill you have nothing you have no ocd but some of us feel happy when people show their sympathy and pity over them oh the poor sheikh he has ocd he is he has mental issues he cannot do this he cannot do that and when i feel that they're talking about me in such a yeah any sympathetic way i feel good i'm getting attention and this is sick your subconscious is playing things on you and so many people with the grace of allah when counseling them in one session they're done they're done they're cute i don't cure them i'm not a psychiatrist i have no knowledge in it they need someone to open their eyes and tell them what's happening and to show them the truth in their face and they've never heard this before so most likely you have a big problem and you're convincing yourself of this problem sit in your room don't do and say bismillah bismillah bismillah you have no problem go to the uh uh basin and try to make udon say bismillah i can't look in the mirror and say you can't say it don't be a chicken go ahead say it make my day and you'll find that bismillah yeah i have no problem but why was it so big a problem for the past six seven months because shaytan was messing up with your head and you were giving him headway okay please yeah go ahead yeah i'll follow so now there is no problem coming back to the core of your question the vast majority of muslims say that this hadith is not mandatory to say bismillah and it's not authentic and this is not authentic so there is no problem in doing a rudo without saying bismillah your wudu is valid because the hadith is not authentic and even if it's authentic it is a recommendation not as something that is mandatory and allah knows best you"
