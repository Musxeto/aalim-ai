  "title": "Is the glass half full or half empty? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I'm not thirsty by the way. Yeah. I always ask people, describe this glass. Some say half full, some say half empty. It's the same glass, correct? Those who say half full are the appreciative people. They always say, Ya Allah, You gave me half full glass. I know people who have no water in their glasses. I know people who don't have glasses to begin with. So they're always content and happy like those you go to and visit in poor areas. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you? Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alhamdulillah gave us everything. Gave you what? You're paralyzed, you're blind, you don't have a roof on your head, you don't have food on the table. Yes, but Allah gave me so much. This is weird. And those who say it's half empty, they're always bitching and whining. Excuse my French. They're always complaining, why? Why not full? I know brothers who have six or seven glasses. They have bottles, they have tanks. Why me? Why this empty? So they're never appreciative to what Allah has given them. When you compare what you have with those deprived, you'll always be on top and be grateful and be thankful."
