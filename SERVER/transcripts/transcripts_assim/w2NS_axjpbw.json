  "transcript": "laughs man over him alhamdulillah yellow banana mean sallallahu salam o alikum attending our demean nabina muhammad in whare ali he was happy he ajma'in my god oh dear brothers sisters islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this 49th episode of the islamic cook and today we will talk about divorce so we spoke in the previous episodes about marriage and how it is conducted the pillars we spoke about the engagement etc and today we shall speak in sha allah about divorce now what is divorce divorce is the dissolution of marriage the ending of marriage so the contract that was initially made by a word is ended by a word in order to get married there must be a proposal and an acceptance so the Guardian says I give you my daughter in marriage and he specifies which daughter the boy says I accept her marriage to myself the marriage is done if it were if it was in the presence of two male witnesses and there were no obstacles to prevent such a marriage subhanAllah whenever things are needed most Allah Azza WA JAL makes it the easiest so for example people must breathe and they need to drink their need to breathe is far greater than their need to drink and that is why air is available free of charge and there is no effort exerted to attain it while water though there is need for it but it is less in importance than air and hence it is found in some places and you need to exert some effort to obtain it now this is general Muslims and non-muslims alike but when you come to Sharia law you'll find that the same concept of ease is used in Sharia law so people need to get married and this is an essential part of their lives therefore marriage is facilitated it's very easy I give you my daughter in marriage I accept her marriage who end of story take your wife and go totally legit totally Islamic people I so in order for us to make the life circle continue we need to bury them so preparing a Muslim corpse for burial is one of the easiest things a Muslim dies we wash him in about 10 to 15 minutes half an hour at most and we clean him we shroud him we perfume him we take him to the Masjid we pray funeral prayer and then we take him to the graveyard put him in his grave and bury him the whole process would not maybe take like a couple of hours at most unlike other religions where you have a lot of expenses spent musical bands marches a caravan of cars tombstones coffins made of expensive wood all of this is a waste of money he's dead and his remains won't be as they are in couple of months he's turned into dust so why spent so much money the living are more worthy of this and if you come to the issue of marriage not all marriages go as well as we wish because this is human nature some religions you will find that the spouses are stuck with one another for for life it's a life sentence but they know that they cannot stay married they go to the church and the church says there is no divorce so they are stuck with one another and because they don't want one another we see infidelity we see cheating each one living his own private life but they are considered to be married to one another Islam is a realistic religion does not promote divorce does not want divorce but if it is required and needed then it makes a way out through divorce the hadith that many Muslims repeat which says a barato al-hilal e el allahi upon abba-abba-abba and helen the most abort Hallel things to Allah is divorce so it is halal but it is abhorred this hadith is not authentic though the meaning can be correct but the hadith is not authentic because allah azzawajal does not like divorce when it is uncalled for when there is no reason for it yes Allah doesn't like it but if there is a reason and a justification in this case Allah recommends it if not mandate it it can be mandatory and it can be recommended and it can be permissible it depends on the situation so if a man has an evil wife and she does not abide by the hijab she doesn't pray on time she hates adhering to Islamic laws and once judy bell doesn't want to obey her husband why is he keeping her you have to divorce her she's a disobedient woman and an evil one and you're not recommended to keep her but if she is a righteous woman practicing woman fearing Allah and you want to divorce her because she's wearing the knee up then you are sinful for that because this is a sin to divorce a righteous woman because she's following the Sunnah or at least she's doing something that is righteous and full of Eman so divorce as a concept is found in Islam there is a whole chapter a whole surah in the Quran called up father and the rulings of divorce were mentioned in so many places in the Quran not because Islam promotes divorce on the contrary as we've stated earlier it doesn't promote divorce but it is a necessity in some times and it is like a surgeon sometimes he has to cut people open if he does this without any legitimate reason that would be a crime but if he does it with a legitimate reason that this is something that is positive and good for Humanity so termination of such a marriage contract is something that is required sometimes if the woman initiates it and does not want to continue in this marriage and she's willing to sacrifice herself by returning the dowry back to the husband this is known as Haller but if it is the husband who's initiating this then this is known as divorce now when we talk about divorce they are formulas for divorce so is it any word that comes out of the mouths of them the husband that would impact the validity of the marriage and would enforce divorce to take place no the formulas of divorce are divided into two types clear and ambiguous so a clear formula of device is to say what indicates without a ambiguity that the marriage is dissolved so if a man says to his wife I divorce you I have divorced you you are divorced all of these are clear and straightforward divorce there is no ambiguity in it the intention is not of any importance because the statement was clear the Prophet said Ali Hassan Salameh there are three statements taken seriously whether they are said in seriousness or ingest marriage divorce and reinstatement or reconciliation of the marriage of the divorce what is this hadith if I joke with a friend and I say listen my daughter is married to your son I give you my daughter as a wife to your son my daughter is three years old his son is five years old and the man says I accept him a marriage to my son and we joking we were playing we were messing around and this is in the presence of two male witnesses so the marriage is valid yeah sure it's a three year and a five year old children yes but their parents are their guardians and they have the authority to give them a marriage but they were joking there is no joking in marriage likewise there is no joking in divorce a man loves his wife and they're drinking cappuccino together and she says something to him and he says jokingly well if this is the case then I divorce you love or you divorce my my wife what are you gonna do about it and then they continue their cappuccino they divorced sure he was joking still the Prophet said even if it were said in jokingly it takes place and likewise the conciliation so a man divorces his wife she's in her in that period and he said to her but not intending it okay I reconcile with you I get you back into my guardianship and she's happy he says haha I was joking there's no joke about it jeez back to you as a wife and you have to divorce her again or a third time and which is something you did not plan but tough bananas this is what you have done so the word that comes out of your mouth has a great weight you can enter Islam with the word Allah high Lama and you can exit Islam with a single word it can take you up to paradise and it can't throw you in hell the distance of 70 years of travel with a word that you did not pay any attention to so it is very important to know that clear and unambiguous phrases of divorce take effect immediately regardless of the intention now there are statements that do not fall on the divorce so if I say to a woman I will divorce you tomorrow this is not a divorce I'm contemplating on divorcing you now this is not a divorce any similar statement that talks about the future and some even say about the present when I say listen woman I am divorcing you and this is a continuous sense or tense some say that this takes place some say no because it has to be either a description you are divorced as an adjective or something in the past I have divorced you I have divorced you but something in the future or something in the present this is what scholars say does not take place and about the most efficient place for you to solve such problems is to go to the Muslim Court sit with the judge or with the mufti and take a verdict from him the second type of formulas of divorce are formulas that are ambiguous not clear so when a man says to his wife in anger you're free or when he says go to your parents house I don't want you anymore or word when he says I have nothing to do with it this is the end of anything between you and me all of these phrases and similar to them are not clear and direct divorce and as you've heard the word divorce was not even mentioned so what is the ruling on this when scholars say that ambiguous divorce does not take place unless it was intended so the person who said go to your parents house it's over and he says chef is this divorce or not and I say to him what did you intend when you said that phrase if he says to me well I I did not intend a divorce I just was angry and just wanted her to leave or I just wanted to frighten her scare her in this case we said to him this is not a divorce but if he says when I told her it's over whatever is between me and you is over no I intended that this was a divorce then one divorce takes place and a lot of the women don't like this they call and say sure my husband said so and so and so so I tell her tell her let your husband call she says I know I need to know the answer now said I can't give you the answer I have to ask the man who initiated this what was what his intention was I'll give another example we have something called conditional divorce so a man says well I by Allah if you go to your sister's house you divorced and the woman goes to her sister's house when she comes back the husband calls said chef Salaam alaikum I said so-and-so to my wife is she divorced are we divorced now or what so this conditional divorce depends on the intention so I usually ask him okay when you said your statement what was your intention the man usually says maluhia had no intention of divorcing her but every time she goes to her sister her sister plays and messes with her mind ordering her to demand a new set of furniture in the house ordering her to ask me to take her to holidays and to give her money and to buy her houses so I just wanted to stop all of this nonsense by preventing her from going to her sister and she doesn't want to listen so I said what I said we say to him no this is not a divorce this was said to scare to intimidate to prevent someone from doing something and a divorce was not intended hence according to him in taymiyah and other scholars and this is what she remembers and Beth a mean a fat one they he has to expiate that because it was an oath and feed Stan poor people but if the man says said her sister runs a brothel and she has prostitutes and their customers coming to her house and I told my wife you cannot go to your sister's house because she's a bad and evil woman and she insisted on me so I said to her I can't keep a wife like you who goes to a brothel and corrupt and pollute and tarnish my reputation so if you go to your sister's house who divorced and she went we say this is a valid divorce because your intention was actually to divorce so the intention is important in ambiguous divorces we have to ask the man likewise a woman comes and says chef my husband sent me a text message saying I divorce you is it valid well text messaging is a different a difference of opinion among scholars scholars say that even writing I divorce you on a piece of paper is ambiguous because the man could say I was just testing my handwriting or you were made he may say I was just giving her a scare I didn't divorce I didn't utter it I didn't say it and some scholars say well depends if there where circumstances that prove that this was intended then this is a valid divorce as in the case of a fight a big strong fight between the spouses and then he writes to her I divorce you or texts her so this is all for the Muslim judge to rule and to look into so he would be able to decide whether the divorce took place or not either way the word divorce is a very serious matter I get tons of cases of divorce all the time and sometimes in the hundreds and it is what shred pile works his entire life to do Allah mentioned intelligent in Surat al-baqarah I think it is verse 101 that the main cause and reason for black magic is to separate a man from his wife this is what evil people in sorcerous learn magic for to separate a man from his wife so divorce never happens when people are happy and relaxed it happens when people are angry when they're fighting when they're doubtful of one another this is an environment infested by a pond and he knows how to maneuver so that he would reach the epic of the moment when a man divorces his wife now there are types of divorces whenever you read the books of trouble you will find that there are two types of divorce Sunni type and biddy type what is the sunnah divorce which is according to the Quran and the Sunnah what is the Buddha divorced which is an innovative way of divorce where a person divorces not according to the Quran Sunnah so in order to understand this we have to understand what is the sunnah divorce all scholars of Islam agree that the Sunnah divorce which is valid which takes place without any doubt is the divorce that takes place when a wife is not on her man and she was not involved in sexual intercourse with her husband after her menses can you elaborate okay the wife has a menses a period of menses and then she has a period of purity and in this period of purity which is usually about 22 days 23 days she's pure her husband usually has it across with then she gets her period again the divorce that is considered to be Sunnah is when a woman has her period then she is pure she takes wuzzle she's ready now to receive her husband but he does not have intercourse with her rather he wants to divorce her now this is a valid Sunnah divorce the second type of divorce is the divorce that happens when a woman is pregnant so also this is considered to be according to the Sunnah it is a valid divorce so what do you mean sure meaning that there are two types of sunnah divorce or a divorce that is valid if the woman is pregnant and the man divorces her this is a valid divorce it counts on the spot if the woman just had her period and she had her hustle no intercourse took place and he divorces her the divorce is valid the same situation is when for example they are apart from one another so the woman is in her father's house or the man is traveling overseas and they haven't seen the one another for a whole year so definitely she got her menses like 10 times or more and over the phone they have an argument and the the husband says well you divorced and then they come knocking on our doors chef is the divorce sooner or better is it definitely salad because she was in the state of purity and you did not have sexual intercourse with her in that state of purity so that divorce is valid this is known as the worse of the sinner Allah says in the Quran yeah I knew Hannah bu in Apollo - Anissa of apollyon Nelly read that him were a Celinda Allah says o prophet of Allah when you divorce women and this of course is addressing the whole Ummah not only the prophet rights of Salaam when you divorce women divorce them with a view of their prescribed waiting period and reckon the period accurately which means that the divorce has to be done in anticipation of the waiting period and when a woman is not as we had described earlier this divorce is not soon now what it what would it be it would be a bitter divorce so can you explain to us what is a bitter divorce okay a bit I divorce is either when a man divorces his wife while she is in her monthly cycle so she is actually now on her menses and an argument takes place and he divorces no this is an innovation and you are sinful or she's clean from her menses and they sleep together for once maybe more and before she gets her following menses they got get into an argument and he divorces her this is an innovation and he is sinful this is known as a Pollock will be they innovated divorce divorce that has bida in it and does it happen or doesn't it not happen well it's an issue of dispute but there are also other types of talocan beta so what we have mentioned about innovative and the problem is that the word innovative sometimes comes to our mind as something good this manager has innovative means of marketing his product worldly Affairs this is good but in Islamic terminology innovation is a beta an innovative is not something that is recommended rather it is an innovation so in terms of time we've mentioned whether she is in her menses or she's in a state of purity that intercourse had preceded the divorce this Balam also it can be better in the number of divorces so allah says that we should calculate and to calculate is to only implement one divorce so you want to divorce you say I divorce you you don't say I divorce you I divorce you I divorce you three times or more you don't say you divorce thrice because all of this is innovation only one divorce takes place you can't have a wholesale most those who divorce especially these poor ones who follow the hanafi madhhab from the subcontinent usually and they keep on knocking on my door until they want the door to fall chef I was angry I said to my wife I divorce you I divorce you I divorce you I was very angry but I did not have any intention to leave my wife permanently this was our first incident we have ten children and now her family came and took her from the house and they don't want us to reconcile and they say that we are following her team at her and she's Haram for you this is ignorance unless it was processed through a court of Islamic sharia they have no right to take your wife and we have to go back to the mufti so that he would give us an Islamic verdict according to Quran and the Sunna not according to his whims and desires or to his mother and I have tens of stories of evil involvement of the uncles or the siblings or the parents depriving our a man from his wife because such an incident yes it is an innovation it's Abaddon but the million dollar or the million created in our question would be does it take place or not this is an issue of dispute and the reason of dispute is the hadith of Abdullah nurimaru hot pot may Allah be pleased with him in addition to the general principles of Islam where the Prophet said that is awesome every action that is contrary to this manner of ours is rejected so if we agree that such a divorce is Amida this hadith states that it is rejected which means that we should not consider it to have taken place and again this is a major obstacle and an issue of dispute among scholars on one hand the majority of scholars and schools of thought say that it is a valid divorce though the one who has said it and done it is sinful so when you divorce your wife one while she's on her and while she is on her menses or you divorce your wife in a state of purity which you had already had intercourse with this is a central divorce and innovative innovated divorce but it's a valid one so one down two to go other scholars and they are of huge and great calibre such as an imam even hasma fiery you're talking about some of the tabby named Sedna Musa here you're talking about you bent a me even though I am she's been bass Shibboleth Amy and so many many other great scholars say that his cell phone and it is a bit early Paulo divorce but it does not take place and the reason is the Haditha webinar mark when he divorced his wife once and his father I'm gonna pop melodies with him complained to the Prophet Ali Shah Alam of such so the Prophet said to omen tell him to take her back and retain her until she is clean from menses and then she has her next period and completes it then when she is clean from menses he has the choice either to hold on to her as his wife or to divorce her this is the time when she can start her waiting period and the one which Allah has ordered to be the start of divorce now the hell it is clear and obvious however in some narrations even aroma the one who is involved said that and it was not counted meaning the divorce that he had given which was a bitter which was sinful because of the instruction of the Prophet sent to retain her back he considered it not to have taken place in other narrations he said that it was counted as one so the majority of scholars followed that and said it takes place so now we are in a dilemma what to do if I divorce my wife should I consider it valid or not if it were done in a better way what we usually tell people is that such issues can only be cleared with either a Grand Mufti who's willing to take what is needed to be taken he's willing to take the fall for it and say it doesn't take place or it must be cleared through the court the Sharia based court and the vast majority of Sharia Courts unfortunately would on the spot implement the divorce even if it was innovation and when a judge gives us verdict that these were three valid divorces though the fatwa is against it the one with the authority is the judge so so many times brothers come to me and say chef I divorced my wife thrice in less than couple of seconds so the divorce a divorce a divorce and this was my first divorce we went to court and the Muslim judge issued a verdict stating that we are divorced thrice and she cannot go back to me until she marries another man so what is the fatwa share I tell them it's too late had you come to me before you go to the Muslim Court maybe I would have giving you a different fat one or I would have directed you to the Grand Mufti to give you a factor which is I know according to the Quran and Sunnah and much lenient but now after it's been done documented stamped sealed and delivered what do you want me to say no one can go against the verdict of a Muslim judge in a court of law of Sharia except himself or someone in the same court because this is the law of the Muslim ruler there is binding and you have to follow it therefore I unfortunately am inclined to go with the Jomon with the gym rule because though I sympathize with people who would like to cancel the third divorce on the grounds that he said it when she had her menses imagine the amount of divorce cases that men would manipulate and play with to the extent that maybe one out of a million divorce would take place how's that you'll end up having people divorcing their wives and coming to your said no the divorce didn't take place would have until she was on a menses oh yeah yesterday I had intercourse with her and I divorced her today so it doesn't take place and they keep on living divorcing 10 20 50 times and every time he says no no I didn't take place this is playing around sorry I cannot be that loose for people to play with divorce and divorce whenever they want allah azzawajal considered the as signs of Allah Allah that must not be mocked with already cute and therefore this is an issue for the Muslim judge to give his fatwa or to the Grand Mufti not any just Tom Dick or Harry but the Grand Mufti who would put his input in it so I think we will stop here and we will resume some of the quests answer some of the questions that we have Muhammad Basha says can we read aloud involuntary or sunnah prayers like fajr prayer that says yes if you pray the vomer Sunnah which is for raka or - raka after four raka before to refer africa after and you want to recite the Quran loudly maybe for better concentration maybe for revising for any reason this is not according to the Sunnah but would it impact the validity of my prayer the answer is no your prayer is valid and you have you have no problem in reciting it loud insha Allah Alpha Tamim says can a woman asked for divorce due to very bad jealousy of first wife the question is ambiguous is not clear either the one asking for divorce is herself the first wife and she is extremely jealous or the one asking for divorce is the second wife but she's demanding divorce because the first wife is giving her he'll do to her jealousy and spoiling her life either way brother the sisters divorce is a very serious issue and it's not something to be taken lightly so I highly recommend an advice that you have a counseling session before your divorce yes I'm gonna make money out of it definitely but not necessarily come to me go to someone who has knowledge in Islam has knowledge in marital problems and has experience and wisdom and before you divorce take his input don't throw years down the drain just like that without even taking an extra mile just for the sake of all gold good times between you and your spouse take is a marriage counseling session ask tell the counselor listen I had all these problems all throughout my life through my experience with the grace of allah azzawajal i've seen how people transform while in the session after 5 or 10 minutes talk because you open their eyes usually such problems occur because Shaitaan manages to block your sight you can see you're blinded and when a third party an external party a marriage counselor an imam of a Masjid someone who wants goodness for you here's your story and tells you his feedback gives you his feedback well like the vast majority of cases people say huh whoa we didn't know it was this bad Zac a lot American logic so I think you it is worthwhile investing in it don't just go for divorce many second wives when they vent and speak about their problems and their jealousies and they get someone wise advising them opening their eyes telling them about the many cases he had seen where women bang their heads on the wall for asking for divorce only couple of months after getting a divorce and they regret regretting it to the till the rest of their lives while the husband the following week he's got married again to a younger and more beautiful they need people to give them sincere advice sometimes yes we say no you have all the right to seek divorce this is not a healthy marriage and you must bail out this happens but in the vast majority of cases we don't advise of divorce and in the vast majority of cases women and men change their minds after a third party opens their eyes alpha says oK we've gone with alphas question Ali Hodja says can we keep dirty clothes in the bathroom that says yes this is what we keep dirty clothes what do you want us to keep them in the guest room I know that the concept behind this question is that many people say if you have clothes that you've washed from menstrual blood do not hang them after Maghrib outside the home because jinn would possess them or do something evil to them and likewise if you keep dirty laundry and clothes of your own in the bathroom this is where jinn is they will mess up with it and this is all superstitions all superstitions that are baseless all um stories of old generations that scare you from the gin and that they would do this and do that all of this is baseless and nonsense so go ahead and keep it to that any problem abdelkader since during marriage when there is no higher there's no goodness and much and there is a lot of arguing and the couple know that they're being oh they're beginning was wrong does it mean that they're arguing and displeasure throughout their years is a punishment from Allah due to the wrong steps in the beginning well I this is something I have no knowledge of it can be a punishment it can be a test if they repented from their sins their Allah is most forgiving there's no point in looking at the past and wondering the past is gone you cannot do anything about it you have to look ahead of you you have to progress forward because by looking at the past and starting pointing fingers no you said this Noah you said that shaitaan succeeds in eliminating the ways of resolving our problems through communication we're not communicating anymore we're becoming disrespectful we're becoming engaged in arguments without end and this is the usual formula for divorce so you have to put your acts together again I would advise that you sit with someone and tell him his story tell him your beginning because I've noticed that so many of us tend to believe in a concept develop it and embrace it as a reality while it's only a thought on or an idea that we had many of these marriages now the harder set during a marriage when there is no hair why is it that there is no goodness in it you say we may have had a bad beginning so the beginning was done why not improve your marital life because you are clenching to that thought that we had a bad beginning and you're developing this idea to be the cause of any problem in your life just put it on that beginning so if the food was not cooked well this was a bad beginning if you insulted your wife and she replied to you this was a bad beginning if your in-laws say or do or anything that you may dislike Shaitaan comes and said this was a result of a bad beginning and it goes on and on so when you sit with a marriage counselor or someone who's older than you are none calor something and you share with him your feelings he will easily point out said he you are the one who's making all this up you're the one who is standing in the middle of quicksand and moving a lot which causes you to drown your marriage is perfect it's all here you're the one who's doing this so again you need to think it over Jawara says is it permissible to marry two sisters who share the same mother and father at the same time that is no al-ahzar mentioned in chapter 4 surah nisa wanted Jamaa who banal octane it is totally prohibited to marry two sisters whether full sisters or half sisters or sisters from the mother side or sister from the father's side it is totally prohibited for a man to marry them both at the same time if he marries one and then divorces her to marry the second one no problem if he married one and she was and he became a widow she died and he marries her sister no problem but to combine them both at the same time this is totally prohibited and haram Ramla han says we do not celebrate birthdays anniversaries what I usually do is I only give dua to our family member on a birthday or anniversary like may Allah bless you etcetera the same way on our parents death anniversary we just share some dora like me allah bless our parents with genital Ferdowsi is it allowed to share dawn on specific days such as these or do we have to remain silent no you have to remain silent commemorating an event whether it's an anniversary of a deceased person or a birthday or a marriage anniversary with which comes annually this is prohibited in Islam we have to read and we went and explained earlier that it means to come back and it can be related to location it can be related to times so a spot that people often visit annually this is 8 and a an event that happens every year at the same time this is a and we as Muslims have only two eats so congratulating someone on his birthday no gifts no cakes no celebration just saying happy birthday this is not permissible imitating the disbelievers if you make du'a may Allah preserve and make the rest of your years better than the years that had passed again this is an innovation which should not be done and the best of ways is the way of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam Rabia says it is reported that a man came to Omaha the allahu anhu to complain about his wife's ill temper while he was waiting for omar to come out of his house he heard rumors wife scolding him and omar quietly listening to her is this hadith authentic dancer is no this is a well-known hadith it is famous in the books of SIA and the books of adapt i I think mentioned it once or twice in some of my lectures before brothers brought it to my attention may Allah reward them so the hadith where Omar came out and did not find the man so he dispatched a soldier to bring him back so when the man came and I'm gonna ask him what did you want is it there's no use I came to complain about my wife and I heard your wife saying even worse things than what my wife says so Omar said okey she flees my hair she patches my clothes she cooks my meal she takes care of my children she cleans my house and in her I find comfort at night and we have intimacy so I have mercy upon her so that Allah soldier would accept it as she's doing all of this for me and this hadith is not authentic and Allah knows best the Wrangler says I read in a message that this world is created for the prophet sallallaahu seldom is it correct to say this please shed some light no this is totally wrong and there is not a single authentic hadith that supports it and definitely nothing in the Quran that supports it and this is usually highlighted by some of the deviant sects who are not part of a hill sunnah wa l-jama'a so they have gone into extreme in their claim to love the Prophet array saw true self which is not true true love of the Prophet Isis Salam is proven by following him not by innovating in his religion and exaggerating in the claim of loving him so what is the purpose of saying that allocating the whole universe for the Prophet as I said I'm this is that this shows that Allah loves the property we know Allah loves a prophet why do you have to lie in fabricated hadith claiming that allocating the whole universe for the sake of the Prophet I saw so this is a blatant light now we know that allocated the jinn and the humans to worship Him wouldn't it been easier to mention a verse saying that and so that they would acknowledge the status of the Prophet as Salam etcetera so claiming that Allah created the universe for the sake of the Prophet a son is a blatant light claiming that Adam peace be upon him when he send an ate from the forbidden tree asked allah azzawajal to forgive him through the sake or for the sake of so our Salamone he said Allah said how did you know about Muhammad he said I rent his name written on the pillars or on the feet of the throne all of this is not authentic so you have to stay away from such deviant sex because they are full of innovation and unfortunately and sometimes they're even full of this is all the time we have so inshallah until we meet next Thursday I leave you fear allah wa salam alaykum warahmatullahi wa barik"
