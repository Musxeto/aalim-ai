  "title": "Imam makes dua, recites Quran loudly after every prayer Should I stay / leave masjid Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "basically abdullah's question is about what the imam does after conclusion of his prayer he does the athkar and he makes few duas recites the quran loudly and most likely the congregation either listens to him or repeats with him or repeats after him most likely if you ask him did the prophet alaihisalam ever do such a thing and he would say nope never so this is an innovation why are you doing this he said no no no the prophet had never done such a thing but because we are here in japan and most people don't know these atkar so i'm saying it loudly so that they can learn it now if you said this once in a lifetime twice in a lifetime maybe i would accept this but saying it after every prayer and for the entire the rest of your life this means that you're innovating and the prophet had never done such a thing nor did his companions nor did the tabarine nor did the taber at tabirin so definitely either you know more than them or you have committed a an innovation what is my role your role is not to join them and i would definitely if i were there the moment the salat is over i would stand and leave to the end of the masjid so that people would see me not being with them in this innovation if he was sincere he would have taught them one by one the zhafkar on a black board and they repeat it after him one by one not in congregation after salah no he dedicates a class to do that and allah knows best aisha"
