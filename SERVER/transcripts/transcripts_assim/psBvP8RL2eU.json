  "transcript": "alhamdulillah we begin inshallah today discussing the chapter that deals with or and this is a special payment that is paid to the poor at the end of the month of Ramadan and the prophet Alat described it as a means of purification and it is also considered to be given something to the poor so that they would not feel sad on the day ofid it would at least be a sort of compensation to them on the day of Eid because they do not have enough money to be happy they do not have enough money to buy clothes so Islam instructed us to be with them and to give them something so that at least on the day ofid they don't beg people for anything especially for food and we have Hadith 175 who will read it to us yes brother narrated Allah's Prophet sallam enjoined payment of or he said Ramadan on male and female and On free and slave Muslim muss One S of dates or One S of parley the people gave half a s of wheat every young and old individual in another narration to be given before the people go to the e prayer in this Hadith of abdah may Allah be pleased with him he called it or of Ramadan sakat Ramadan which indicates that it's to be given only in Ramadan and the one who mandated it the one who had enjoyed this payment is the prophet Alat wasam and he clearly stated that it should be given as one and we've said that the is a means of measurement by size or weight by size and ass is made of four mud and a mud is what gathers in your two hands so if I do this this is a mud the prophet used to perform W with one moodam so what type of food should I give out in the Hadith ofb Omar the prophet saidat wasam it should be either from dates or from barley and the prophet Alat enjoined it that we pay it for all whether male or female whether slave or free so there is no difference between the genders in paying this zakat and there is no difference whether it's a free person or a slave and there's no difference whether it is Young or or old the dispute among Scholars is regarding if a woman is pregnant so should I give Zak for her pregnancy as well the majority of Scholars say no but this is recommended because afan may Allah be pleased with him the third khif used to take the zakat on the pregnancy as well but it is not mandatory because it is not possible to know whether he is or it is going to be alive after birth or not and therefore no rulings follow that the following Hadith Hadith number 176 we need someone to read it narrated in the lifetime of the Prophet s wasam we used to give one of food or one of dates or one of Bali or of a dried milk or one of raisins dried grapes as and when muavia became Theif and the vat was there he said I think observe that one mood of wheat equal two moods of any of the above mentioned things Abu s said as for me I will continue to give it as I used to at the time of prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam praise and peace be upon him this Hadith is similar to abdullah's Hadith but with an extra different types of food and not only that Abu may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet at his time we used to give out of food and from this the scholars say that it is is permissible to give One S of what the people in your country consider to be food so if they consider rice to be their main dish so give One S of rice if they consider beans for example their food then so be it and so on and then Abu lists a number of different types of food that you can give as Zak he mentioned and what is it is dried milk the Arabs used to take the milk and dry it and then they can take it with them when they travel it becomes something or a food that can be taken raisins as well raisins are dried grapes and dates as we know they can be considered to be fruit but because they have have the characteristic of being dried and stored for long times then this is also zakat Abu tells us that when muaah may Allah be pleased with him became kif he addressed the people and said these types we have I see in my own opinion that one mud of wheat is equivalent to two mods of these types mentioned why because at the time wheat was very luxurious it was a delicacy it wasn't easy to find it wasn't easy to grow and once you have it it is very important and people like to eat wheat or make Breads and you know the usages of it so mu pleased with him said that I feel that Zak has to be of everything except of wheat you can have two muds or half this is his now is he one of the four rightly guided cffs no so this means that we do not have to follow his Sunnah though he's a companion one of the great Companions of the Prophet wasam yet when he goes against the teachings of the Prophet Alam we stick with the teachings of the prophet am and this is exactly what AB said he said although mu said so and so until today I will only give one and this is the right and the most authentic opinion that you give one of that now when is the time to give Z Scholars say it is a must that you give it before the prayer of ofid if you give it after the prayer ofid this is not acceptable unlike the prayer of adha if you Slaughter before the prayer ofid your Slaughter is not accepted and if you Slaughter after the prayer it is accepted so the consensus is you have to give it before prayer ofid and they differed the scholars some say you can't give it from the beginning of Ramadan others say you can give it from the middle of Ramadan and the most authentic opinion is that you can give it two or three days max before the end of Ramadan because this is the doing of abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that we used to give Zak two days to three days before the prayer ofid and this is the most likely authentic opinion simply because if you come and look at our times now just before the prayer ofid is a very little time and most likely you will not be able to find people to give them zakat so you will be cornered and you will be stuck with your zakat and you're not able to give it to anyone therefore 2 days to 3 days is permissible one may ask what about the rulings on giving it to organization charity organization or Islamic organizations that take it from the beginning of the month yet they say we will only pay it to the poor on the 28th or on the 29th of Ramadan the ruling is okay because you're giving them power of attorney to give it out on that particular day not before so your payment whether it's in the beginning of Ramadan in the middle of the year no problem as long as they give it out a day or two before the prayer or the a day or two before now one would ask and say what's the ruling on me giving the poor money instead of food some Scholars say that this is permissible this is the opinion of Al IM Abu hanifah may Allah have mercy on his soul and they say that this is more beneficial for the poor from eating this food we have a stay tuned and inshallah weam alayum and welcome back so Abu Allah have mercy on his soul says that it is permissible to give money instead of food in Zak and the majority of Scholars say that this is not acceptable why because it was the prophet who enjoined sallallahu alaih wasallam food and if you look at the time of the Prophet did they they have currency at the time they had DIN and Durham dinar was made of gold and Durham was made of silver and they used to have their transactions with it we have a number of Hadith that they used to pay and buy things with it so it is a fact that the prophet though they had money yet he instructed his companions to give food therefore if you give a poor person $1,000 on Z this would not be accepted as zakat you have to give him food why they said because this is something you worship Allah with it is not something to apply your logic and they said as you remember one is measurement of size so if I bring one s of barley One S of dates One S of One S of raisins and I evaluate each one would it be the same price would this be 10 10 10 no the value the price differs so they said the prophet Alat wasam would not order us to give the zakat in food when it's different in value you except because food is the one that you must pay there is a Hadith that the prophet said said prevent your brothers from begging on that day so the food is to prevent them from begging for food if they are really and truly needy and having said that there is no problem at all to give the food with extra cash what what prevents you from doing this so I give one on my behalf to the poor and I give him 10 R 20 r on top as S as Charity this is a good deed but to give him money without food this is not permissible now you calculate the amount of the people in your house and you give one for each and every one but do I give the whole bundle to a number of people equivalent to my family members or can I give it to one person the answer is you can give it to one person alone and this is found in Islam there are things that you must give to a specific number of people regardless of the quantity of food and there is a certain quantity of food to be given regardless the number of people and there are things that are open you just have to feed a particular number of people regardless of the weight for example in expiation when you do something wrong in in your what is experation if you do something you're not supposed to do such as clipping your nails or putting perfume or wearing shirts or undergarments the experation is one of three either you slaughter a sheep or you feed six poor people half a each half a each or you fast three days so here we have half a the quantity is designated and the number of poor is designated so if I bring half a multip by six is three I have to give three if I take three s and I give it to one poor person is it enough no it has to be six of them another example is Allah ordered us in whenever we break an oath we have to give experation what is the experation feed 10 people of the middle of what you eat or clothe them or slaughter a sheep if if you're unable fast 3 days so I have a choice now Allah told me to feed how many 10 people what what's the quantity Allah did not disclose this for me so I can feed them anything half a quarter of a a full providing it's a meal that is sufficient for them but they have to be 10 people so I can't bring a bundle of food and I give it to five people and I say that this is double two meals for you two meals for you no it has to be 10 separate people so the quantity is not disclosed but the number of people is important the last and well this is third type of it there is an experation that is feeding one poor person in this the quantity is disclosed but the number of recipients is not and that is why the scholars say if I collect Z and my family member are 10 and I get 10 SS the prophet did not tell us give it to how many if I take all of these 10 SS and I give it to one individual this is acceptable and this is acceptable if everyone gives it to the same individual but until he reaches the level where he's not poor anymore then if everybody gives it to the same poor person he's rich now so this is what Scholars say that must be done in this regard do we have any questions yes brother there asalam alaykum Salam shik my question is that can we give cooked food as can we give cooked food as the answer is no because the food that can be used is the food that can be stored and cooked food as you know you cannot store it if you don't use it today it will become rotten so it has to be the food that can be stored and it has to be the food that can be measured by size or by weight as scholar say and that's why we cannot give Zak as fruit you know you go to the poor and give him a kilo or two kilos of strawberry what will he do with strawberries this is not permissible and one would say how much is a it differs depending on the substance because if you have a size of a if you put dates it's going to weigh differently than if you put tweet so Scholars say that the average if you are going to give zakat in rice for example it should be approximately 2 kilg and 40 G 2.04 so even if you give 2.5 just to be on the safe side 2 and A2 kilos this is enough of rice on every individual alikum sh my question is that is there any nisab just as the obligat zaka lunar here is there any the scholars say who is entitled to give Zak they said anyone who has the food of one full day and has Surplus he has to give the Surplus as Zak for example if I'm a poor person and I have five s of food which is about 10 kg of rice in my house nothing else Scholars say I have to give zakat Al take one and give it away why they said because if you're poor people will give you but if I do not have except half a SI or if I have only one which is enough for today they said this is the only person who does not have to pay zaka so literally speaking approximately everyone has to pay zakat but if he's in need the one you give away you'll get tens and tens more and Allah knows best suppose we go to umah and can we pay Zak here in India the scholars differed regarding paying the zakat in somewhere that you not in and the most authentic opinion is whenever there is a need it is permissible to pay the zakat elsewhere but whenever there isn't a need the place you're in is the one that you should pay the zakat is the one that you should Slaughter your sacrifice so if you know that W I live in Saudi Arabia and the people around me are not so needy as I know them back home no in this case it is permissible for you to pay the zakat over there inshallah let's say she if someone missed paying his zakat maybe for the past 5 years or 3 years so how should he Rectify that does he go and pay or else he just asks forgiveness some Scholars say that if a person did not pay zakat on time he must pay it after the prayer but it would not be considered as zakat but rather as a punishment and a charity so this is most likely the most authentic opinion its time is gone so you cannot Rectify it but you have to pay it still as a form of seeking Allah's forgiveness and Allah knows best if we have given our zakat money to someone to give it to some he's out so we pay our Salah here but he's paying it later on what would we do at that time this is permissable his prayer is before my prayer because if I give someone the zakat to give it and distribute it in his country my Eid is on Saturday and his Eid is on Sunday so if I pray Eid and he did not distribute it this means that I did not distribute my zakat but if hisid is before me his Eid is on Friday so so he will give it on Friday or on Thursday at most and my Aid is on Saturday this is okay so the payment of the zakat should be before my Aid prayer I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
