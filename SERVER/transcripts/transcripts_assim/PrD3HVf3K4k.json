  "title": "Is masculinity part of Islam? How is it identified? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh from machida transiting into the question of of manhood and i think i i was recently talking about this and one of the main sifat of rajula that i said in in one of my lectures i said the first thing is akida i say a real man has a correct akida because people say what what does it make raju what's a raj what's a real man i said the first thing that a real man has is a is a correct tachida and a sound correct do you think that this concept you know it's been discussed a lot especially in the west now with the issues of masculinity and what is masculinity and what is not what's what you know gender roles and so on is this discussion important is masculinity or looking at it is this part of islam or is just just talk what what do you think you it is very important for us as muslims to acknowledge and to recognize that our religion is a religion of fitra of nature that allah has created humans upon so it doesn't go against our nature rather it flows with our nature and we have to acknowledge and have the firm conviction that what determines what is right and what is wrong is not the media it is not the government it is not what the majority of people as in the case of democracy state rather it is the quran and the sunnah and this is one of the basic elements of akida that islam quran sunnah sharia they decide what is good and what is bad unlike the murtazila which is a deviant sect of the among the muslims they say no the mind decides what's good and what's bad as muslims from allah we say no the quran tells us this is good we say it's good it tells us it's bad we say it's bad and i like the the issue of zoom when you do this and get an eye can you do this so i do this wow wow this is great i love technology anyhow so seriously speaking um when you come to the issue of does islam support being masculine what does masculine mean masculinity in san francisco with almost four or five million lgbtq xywx people is different than masculinity in uh mecca or medina so you have to first of all determine islam doesn't look at these words in uh a way that it's just showing off or a big bang no it looks at realities so when we come to the issue of rujula or manhood by the way this is not limited to males it can also be uh incompeting and including females so when we talk about courage when we talk about generosity when we talk about being steadfast on the deen so if a woman wants to be with these characteristics would we say that no this is only for men you have to stop no so what is first of all we have to define what do you mean by being masculine or manhood or what what is this so is it strength no a gorilla is far stronger than me a polar bear can beat 10 of me and he's not a man so this is not a the right thing so what is it then if you look at the quran and the sunnah this would take us maybe three to four hours right so one of the things you said to heed well actually it's being steadfast on the deen allah says in chapter 33 among the believers there are men who were truthful with allah to what they had covenant with so they had covenant with allah to be truthful to be faithful to be steadfast on the deep and they died on that so the prophet said no obey the law one of the ten heaven bound is one of them and he was alive at the time so the prophet indicated and pointed at him so being steadfast on dean is one of these attributes so this can be in men and women but it is characteristics that to be praised in men what else a hadith that every one of us know seven will be in the shade of allah on the day of judgment where there is no shade other than his shade and you find among them a righteous just ruler okay then anyone who's just unfair whether you are a general ruler a king a president etc a prime minister in in such countries or you are the head of a company or you are the head of your household you're you're you're a husband if you're righteous if you're just if you're fair okay you're you're the man two men met for the sake of allah and departed for the sake of allah loving one another wow so if i love my brother jibril for the sake of allah not because he uh has blue eyes and and blonde alhamdulillah i'm straight not because he used to drive a a 650 uh convertible and i love that car not because he no i love him for the sake of allah we go to the masjid together he is so enthusiastic about giving dawah going out of his way to help people okay this is love for the i'm not i'm joking i'm not saying that this is you don't get me wrong maybe maybe it is you allah so look at the love between the brothers is is not that easy to find thirdly a man's heart found in the masjid he never prays home he prays all five praises in the masjid he's attached to it wow where do we find this nowadays people trying to escape praying the message by praying together in the in in the at work in the home uh oh i had this i had i ate garlic and so they give excuses a fourth person in the seven a fourth person is a person who was remembering allah alone and he started to weep out of the fear of allah or out of the love of allah and this is the best type of fear when you are alone and nobody is watching you and we ask ourselves when was the last time we wept for the sake of allah maybe when i saw a movie scene where the heroine died or the hero killed himself or something oh i feel so sad for them and i weep but is it from from the fear of allah no so another person in the five a person who gave charity with his right hand by the way this is my right hand i'm drinking with so don't get confused oh he's drinking with his left stone him kill him no no no no yeah yeah i know i know that's and i always wear my watch in the right so indicates that i'm still on the sunnah watch out so the guy gives sadaka with his right hand so discreetly that his left doesn't know how much he spent so we can go on and the six number six whoa is a man who a woman of stat of of status and wealth and beauty seduces him and calls him to come to make haram and he says i fear allah azzawajal i'm not going to do that what is this i was teaching of 25 years ago 30 years ago in my high school and i was saying this hadith to my students and one of them said stood up and said  where is this woman we've been living so long nobody's calling us subhanallah i told him insha allah allah would give you the same sin of doing what you wanted without doing it this is something we don't even understand when you desire a sin so greatly and you don't get it you will be having the same sense without doing it so i think in in a nutshell when you come to issues of masculinity or of manhood you find in the quran it's to be steadfast it's to pray in the masjid it is to um offer night prayer in in the hadith the prophet isaiah was approached by hafsah hafsah is his wife and her brother is abdullah and their father is so hafsah said abdullah saw a dream where he was taken by two angels to hellfire and then they told him don't worry you're not among them what was the interpretation the prophet said assalam abdullah is the best of men if he prays night prayer so this is an indication of what a real man is so in i can go on by the way for so many examples but in essence when you want to determine who is the man it's not the strength it's not the biceps how big they are abdullah in masood the great companion of the prophet who took more than 70 surahs 70 chapters of the quran straight from the mouth of the prophet whom the prophet told us learned the quran from four individuals one of them what did he do once the prophet told him get me something from a tree he climbed up once he climbed up all the companions fell on their back laughing look at his feet he had very leg very narrow legs like a acoustic you know if you play billiards it's like this so the prophet said what are you laughing at and they said no problem allah look at his legs so thin he's so skinny the prophet hassam said by allah his legs are heavier on the scale on the day of judgment than mount ud this is how you judge men not by their appearance not by their bank account not by their uh contact list and i will conclude with this so that we would not exceed the time the prophet was once i saw with a companion of his and passing in front of them a man with a nice suit nice armor a good horse the only one of the high-class uh people so the prophet asked him what do you think of this person he said oh prophet of allah this is one of the elite in our society this if he proposes to a family they will give him in marriage if he intercedes they will accept his intercession and if he speaks people will listen the prophet did not comment i said a while later a man among the poor muslims was passing by so the prophet said what do you think of this one it's no prophet of allah this guy is one of the poor peasant people if he proposes nobody gives him a marriage if he intercedes nobody gives accepts an intercession and if he speaks nobody listens to him what did the prophet say also this man the poor man is better than the whole earth filled with that previous man this indicates to you what is at the site of allah"
