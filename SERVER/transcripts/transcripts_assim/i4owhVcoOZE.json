  "title": "Must women work cuz one day they might become widow or get divorced? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um there's this thing that people say you know concerning um women you know um on working so that um there are situations where by maybe in the future the lady may actually lose my husband and if she's not working if she hasn't worked all her life it be very difficult to adjust you know to start you know taking care of herself and the and the children or the orans rather so is this a good basis for a woman you know to work you know even when the husband is working so that you know um things like that when they because actually lots of issues you in the society we have orans that are abandoned you know widows that they've not worked all their Liv so at that point in time it's really very difficult for them to take up any job or any skill you know to offend for themselves and their and and and their Hans this is hypothetical a we cannot build our lives and communities on a hypothetic hypothetical situation so what is the percentage of women who get married and became mothers that they would need at one stage of their time to work because they got divorced or they become uh uh widowed what's the percentage it's negligible and from those who are Misfortune they will have families to back them up they will have parents they will have siblings so those who are totally stranded do not constitute one in a thousand for this one in a thousand do you expect us to encourage Housewives and women to work to mix with men to compromise their religion to compromise their marriages and upbringing their children just in case something that may happen in the future and it may not happen this is not logical at all and it indicates a lack of trust and Reliance on Allah and Allah Knows Best"
