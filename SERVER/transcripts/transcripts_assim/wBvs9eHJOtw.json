  "transcript": "brother Mohammed from Saudi Arabia says that if I reach the Masjid and it's like half an hour for Federer then so I pray 2 rakaats the hatin machine in order to be able to sit down that's clear now I have like 25 minutes what is best for me to recite the Quran or to pray 2 rakats two Rakas tahajud definitely prayer is better why share because while you're praying you're reciting the Quran so you hit two birds with one stone but if you just recite the Quran while sitting you're doing a very good thing but it is not like reciting it while you are praying and this is why the Prophet Isis I'm used to prolong his night prayers rather than just sit and recite the Quran because within the prayer you do the recitation of the Quran"
