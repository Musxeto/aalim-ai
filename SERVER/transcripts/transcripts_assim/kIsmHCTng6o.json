  "transcript": "our fan from the uk first question is this uh regarding the very first question is this you know in the quran there's a challenge to bring one ayat like this if you have a power and then there allah says that you cannot bring it for me i'm unable to understand this challenge when i read the translation why is it so difficult for a human being ajin not to bring an ayat like this that's my first question i'm the second person has anybody yeah i stand by has anybody succeeded in bringing such an ayah no no no not at all not at all but you are right but when i read the translation in urdu and i say hang on a second this is this is just a normal wording like allah in arabic you have to bring something that is miraculous as in as a full ayah and this is part of an ayah anyhow um question number one from erfan he says i cannot understand allah challenges the whole world the jinn the humans the americans the russians the chinese they went to mars and they have a rover showing us that it's on mars and they can't even bring one single ayah well this is a challenge my friend and the allah azza will challenge them until date 15th centuries nobody could produce because an ayah is miraculous by itself so it's not the translation that is miraculous allah is most forgiving most merciful okay that's english in arabic the full ayah that is so miraculously structured because it is the speech of allah azza it is the word of allah which is not created so allah challenged the people the humans the jinn the entire world because allah knows that no one will be able to do this yes there were attempts but these attempts were so funny that people kept on laughing until their stomachs hurt this is no resemblance to the quran and its majesty there is no impact for such rubbish compared to the impact of the quran verses that fills you up with tranquility and peace and love and fear and hope this can only come from a divine scripture which allah azza has challenged the whole world so don't let these whispers occupy your thinking as i said my first question was the logical question which is the challenge stands had anybody taken it or at least succeeded in it the answer is obvious for all of us you"
