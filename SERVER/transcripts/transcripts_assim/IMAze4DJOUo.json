  "transcript": "Bally from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I am confused about the Ibadah of Dhul Hijjah On the first 10 days of Dhul Hijjah should we say only Tahmeed, Tahlil and Takbeer or should we say Tafbeeh also? And also the Takbeer Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La ilaha illa Allah, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar wa lillahi Alhamdulillah Do we need to say this from the day of Arafah or we should make Zikr with this on the first 10 days as well? First of all, you should only ask one question And sneaking two questions is not fair And if I answer it, I will be opening the door So I will answer your first question The first 10 days of Dhul Hijjah for those who are not going to perform Hajj The Prophet said that these days are the best days of the year And doing good deeds in it is the best And nothing would surpass doing good deeds in it Except for a man who goes out of his home with his wealth to fight in the cause of Allah And he dies as a martyr and his wealth is gone And he comes back with nothing He's dead, martyred, but his wealth is also spent in the cause of Allah So this is the ultimate So doing good deeds cannot reach that level But it is better than any other thing Such as fasting Which the Prophet used to do in the first 9 days of Dhul Hijjah Such as giving charity Such as helping others Reading the Qur'an Doing Zikr Part of the Zikr is what we call Al Zikrul Mutlaq The expanded Zikr So in these 10 days, it is recommended to say Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La Ilaha Illa Allah Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La Ilaha Illa Al Hamd Throughout the day and night Not limiting it to after Fard prayer So we say this and say it hundreds of times And our tongues are moist with saying this Zikr If you would like to add Subhanallah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar, La Ilaha Illa Allah That's fine But the prescribed Zikr is as I mentioned Now, on the 9th, the Fajr of the 9th of Dhul Hijjah Which is the Fajr of Arafah Till before the sunset of the 13th Or to be more accurate, till after Asr of the 13th of Dhul Hijjah These 4 days are known to be Or the 4 or 5 days, who's counting? Known to be Takbeer Muqayyad Where we say Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La Ilaha Illa Allah Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, La Ilaha Illa Al Hamd After Fard prayers So in addition to throughout the whole day and night We specifically say it after the 5 Fard prayers Then we do our normal Adhkar And Allah Azzawajal knows best"
