  "transcript": "Uh there's this method of uh what's it called going to a foreign country which is called what's it called? uh oper where a opair where a person goes to another host family in a different country you know works for them for a year and you know is able to obtain residenc is this permissible to do I don't understand the the methodology you're talking about if you're asking about applying for a visit visa and the c the family that will take you in for a year would make you work the whole year in their home as a servant without telling the government that you're working for them. Rather, just to trick the government as if you're visiting them and then after one year you get a resident visa and you can work elsewhere. No, this is lying and cheating and it's not permissible."
