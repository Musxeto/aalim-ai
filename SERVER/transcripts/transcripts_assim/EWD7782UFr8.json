  "transcript": "lady you what come on for so I what Oh I No me wedding nominee geneseo Slava Voynov ahem al-hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen sallallaho salam o bhara kabab dehiwala zoo de nabina muhammad in wallah re hesabi esme a movado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh last time we met we talked about what allah so jeal has prepared for the believers in paradise allah says in surah tauba verse 31 verily for the moon there will be a success that is paradise both in time and in location gardens and graveyards and young full-breasted matured maidens of equal age and a full cup of wine no lihue which is dirty false evil talk shall they hear therein nor lying a reward from your Lord an ample calculated gift according to the best of their good deeds now all of this is originated from Allah Almighty and that is why allah azzawajal tells us Jezza um Rebecca alpaugh and his haba a reward from your Lord an ample sufficient gift and then Allah moves on to say obese emirati well al davina home of a man lam laquana mean who catawba this the reward is from the Lord of the heavens and the earth and whatsoever is in between them the most beneficent none can dare to speak with him on the Day of Resurrection except after his deve so who is a las the ocean who is this gift from it is from the owner the sustainer the provider it is from the creator of the heavens there are seven of them and from the earth and there are seven of them as well and whatever is in between such as great creatures of allah azzawajal the heavens the Stars the planets the galaxies the skies and everything else that we know of and these that we do not know of and Allah tells us that on the day of resurrection no one can speak without his permission and Allah would not address any one of them because it's a day of shock it's a day of fear it's a day of oh and allah azzawajal would not allow anyone to speak unless he will the cheap anna hazare gel on that day Allah tells us in I a 38 yo maya puma grew who al mellah ek2 safa lotta kalamoon Elliman adina la hora man wakulla sabha on that day the day that the roof and the scholars differ who the roof is who is that spirit and the most authentic opinion is that it is the arc angel jibreel is be upon him so that day the road gibril and angels will stand forth in rows so there a row would be for gibril by himself and another row for the rest of the angels none shall speak except him whom the most beneficent there is a la allows him to and he will speak what is right now alonzo gel tells us in so many places about his angels and we will come to discuss this inshallah in the following surah however just to give you a glimpse allah tells us that the Angels would come in a row and the number is so great that you cannot even imagine it the Prophet Alice Alice I'm told us that on the seventh heaven there is a structure similar to the Kaaba and this structure is known as el batal Mahmoud and seventy thousand angels everyday come to that place for pilgrimage never to return to it until the day of judgment and you do the math how many angels are there there are uncountable numbers of angels and on the day of judgment they will come in silence in submission they will be submissive to Allah as our gel in a row while gibril who is greater than all of them would come on a row of his own and this is a display of strength everyone is afraid everyone is in fear on the day of judgment and no one shall speak without a las permission and providing that he says what is right this is the day of the major intercession when all the prophets are gathered with the people in a big open plaza Alonso gel would gather the people on the day of resurrection as the Prophet tells us Alice asaram they will be barefooted naked uncircumcised as the day they were born and aisha me allah be pleased with her looked at the prophet and said o prophet of allah men and women meaning that would men and women be gathered naked in the same place when they look at each other and the Prophet tells her oh ah isha it is more serious than what you think in the sense that it is so terrifying that you cannot even take a glance at the one next to you because you're so terrified you don't have the ability to do so it is exactly that it's like when someone is driving a car and he sees a fully loaded truck coming towards him and he knows definitely for sure that he is going to die and there happens to be a nude woman here or there would he take a glance or he would be frozen and unable to see anything except this catastrophe coming to him this is an example and it's far far greater and horrendous and terrifying than this so no one would speak the Prophet tells us either Sam that on that day the Sun draws closer to the people until they sweat and some of them drown in their own sweat depending on the deeds and it's so close to them that people sweat and those with good deeds their sweat will reach their ankles and those with lesser deeds it would reach their knees or hips and those who were sinful and did not have good deeds it would make them drown in their own sweat on that horrific day that is fifty thousand years long the people go to Adam and ask him for intercession they say Allah created you with his two hands so don't you see what we're suffering ask Allah for reduction and for leniency intercede for us with Allah surgeon and he ejects this and he said no I ate the forbidden fruit go to New so they go to know and they say that you are the one whom allah azzawajal made you the father of all humanity after the flood and that you are the father of the prophets and messengers etc intercede for us and he says no I had a supplication and I asked a lot to destroy my people go to Ibrahim so they go to Ibrahim and they praised them and they said that you're this and you're that intercede for us and he says no I had three lies that I had said go to Moses and they go to Musa please be upon him and he said no I killed an innocent man go Theresa go to Jesus they go to Jesus and he says I'm not the one go to Mohammed so they go to Mohammed prophet of allah sallallahu ala and they tell him intercede for us and he said yes I am the one to do so so he falls on his face frustrating Allah opens his heart with praises and glorification to alonzo gel he had never thought of and he keeps on praising allah azzawajal with beautiful names of allah he did not know off until allah says to him raise your head ask and you shall be granted intercede and you shall be given and this is the time where the prophet will get Alma palm and Mahmoud this is the way sila that the Prophet would be given out it's awesome unlike what people say that Allah would make him sit next to him on his throne and this is not authentic and it's inappropriate this is the authentic hadith in the major intercession so no one shall speak except those who are given permission and this is in reference to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he would say also that which is right and correct and Allah soldier says the decal eoman haha Felicia a Tejada alarab Bajema abba so behold that is without doubt the true day so whosoever wills let him seek a place with his Lord and that is by obeying him in this worldly life we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back just before the break I 39 value kalyan will help falesha a Tejada Arab Bajema Abba that is without doubt the true day so whosoever wills let him seek a place with his lord so let us analyze this ayah allah azzawajal is telling us that this is vday this is what it comes all down to all of your desires all of your beautiful days and nights all of your loved ones all of your good and bad deeds everything that you worked hard for this is it this is the day where you will be held accountable for what you had done so as long as you acknowledge of the existence of such a day wouldn't it be wise that you prepare for it wouldn't be smart for you to be ready to what's coming to you so that day you have the free will to choose and to select what your Adobe would you like to end up in hell the sky is the limit do whatever you want be disobedient be sinful don't care about what Allah wants from you but at the end this is what's going to be your final destination Hellfire but if you want paradise if you want to be close to the Prophet are they sought asylum if you want to be with these companions if you want to be with the righteous folks then you have to do something else and that is you have to do righteous deeds and refrain from bad deeds and the choice is yours Allah says that the choice is yours now the issue of free will the issue of predestination this is an issue of confusion among a lot of the folks and the people as believers as movements as believers and Muslims we believe that there our six pillars of faith of a man and the last one is to believe in destiny to believe in the pre-ordained minh whether it's good or bad you have to believe in it so this causes a lot of confusion among people how is this and how would we have free will if a large they were gel and this is an authentic hadith the Prophet tells us how they saw salaam when Allah created the pen a lot will depend too right so the pen said what shall I write my lord and Allah told the pen to write everything that is going to happen till the day of judgement everything so if I lift my left hand it's written and if I put it down it's written if I look at my laptop it's written if I sit back it's written and this the Prophet tells us a little Sam was written down fifty thousand years before Allah had created the creation so everything you will do is written down it has been noted down so now the confusion comes and says okay if I am going to do bad deeds these bad deeds are written and it's also written that I am going to end up in Hell or I'm going to end up in paradise so where's the freewill here I don't have a free will Allah soldier has already ordained this and allah azzawajal knows that i'm gonna do this so Allah is forcing me know Allah is not forcing you Allah tells us in the Quran so many places that the choice is yours you make the choice and Alonzo gel would do this for you so the choice is yours and you have free will and the biggest example for that is if I ask you to go to a high-rise look at the highest building in town and go to the and look down to the street it's a long way down now if you're a believer take a leap and jump if allah azzawajal has written it down for you that you will fall on your feet and walk without any injury or harm it shall happen but if not you will die and end up like a pizza on the pavement go ahead and jump would you jump and earth would say are you crazy you want me to jump and hope that I will land on my feet definitely not my friend don't you believe in pre-ordained meant if Allah wills it you will fall on your feet and you'll walk away unharmed said no man this is crazy i'm not gonna do this ah then you had a choice it's your choice that you made and it is what you have chosen likewise all the things that happen our lives Allah is knowledgeable analyze wise Allah has created everything so allah the almighty knows what we will do and how things will end up but he has given us a choice now i cannot justify my sins by saying that Allah willed it I cannot fornicate and when someone comes and say sure what did you do this is how I'm so major sin and I would say what can I say Allah ordained this upon me so this is what Allah willed this is wrong then whoever says this you'll hit him as hard as you can and when he complains and says to you why are you doing this say Allah ordained it a lot with that so please don't blame me no one would accept this why because it's unacceptable you have the choice you want to end up in paradise the choice is yours you don't want to well hell is so big and huge choice is yours and that is why Allah says in the following ayah in and arnica mod Robin Arriba yo maya moore Oh macadam ikeda way a pool kaffir yeah let n equal to Taba verily we have warned you of a near torment the day when man will see that which his hands have sent forth and the disbelievers will say I wish I were dust so allah azzawajal is warning us Allah has given us so many warnings but we are heedless we could care less so much at stake I see things that I want to enjoy then I wanna have fun and what the future brings let it come well the future is not as bright as you think because you are digging your own grave and a lot is giving you a warning verily we have warned you of a near torment the day when man will see that which his hands have sent forth everything is recorded and everything will be displayed in front of you you will see all what you had done and you have no excuses and on that day Allah says the Almighty and this believer will say I wish I were dust and this is I wish that every disbeliever would hope for on the day of judgment to come true and it would not come true they all wish that they were dust and what is meant by this first of all they wish that they were dust or soil meaning that they were not created because when they see hell what good was it there is 50 or 60 years that we've spent on earth yes we partied we had fun but then what it's hell for eternity the least to be punished in hell is a person wear a charcoal a store of firewood be put in sandals from the generated by it his brain will boil this is the least to be tormented so if you smoke and Allah wanted to punish you for smoking low you pray five times a day and you fast from a bong etc this is your punishment what about if a logical wants to punish you for taking interest buying your home and mortgage doing this doing that for decay ting Kasumi intoxicants being unfair to your wife your neighbors your parents disrespectful to the elders etc well you do the math the second meaning is I wish I were dust or soil that I hope when I died and turned into dust that I was not resurrected and the final meaning would be that I wish that I were dust when Allah so jeal holds the animals accountable for what they had done to each other then Allah turns them all to dust so the kafir the disbeliever says I wish I where dust like these animals and not be put through all of this torment and agony what we learned from the previous set of ayaat that allah azzawajal holds in honor those who are righteous and practicing and the beautiful description of the reward in Jenna and remember with all this description to us in it there are things that no I had seen no ear had heard of and it did not cross the mind or the hearts of any person so it's just the tip of an iceberg it's just a reflection a description but it has nothing to do with the real thing because it is way beyond our imagination also in the set of I act the wine you drink would not make you lie I do not make you say false and obscene words and this shows you that these things in paradise do not exist and that they are aboard to Allah so jeal even in this life and a set of I at we know how difficult life is on the day of judgment and how it's difficult for those who did not do well in this life and again the emphasis on the aqeedah of death resurrection and accountability and finally allah azzawajal also tells us encourages us to do good and to stay away from sins and from evil things this is all the time we have until we meet in another surah inshallah i leave you feel manilow salam alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh buddy they do"
