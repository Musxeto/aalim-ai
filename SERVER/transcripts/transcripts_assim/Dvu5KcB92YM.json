  "transcript": "as in the Emirates they're about to open the messages for worshipers the problem is that he has skin disease and he has diabetes and other illnesses so would it be advisable for him to go to the Masjid he first of all the doctors say if you have diabetes or high blood pressure or heart problems or kidney problems you're better off praying home until the dust settles down and until this moment even the doctors themselves don't know what's going on you find the CDC saying something and the doctors saying something else you hear people saying conspiracy and others say no this is a pandemic and people saying that this drug is useful and the other side says no this is fatal and it can kill you so even the doctors themselves are confused in this time of confusion if you are afraid due to your health condition that you may be infected or infect others it is best for you to pray home there's no problem at all in praying home alhamdulillah because you have justification you have a legitimate reason for you to pray home now if this all goes away and people go back to the message and they pray shoulder to shoulder foot to foot like they used to and the doctors say that is sha Allah it is safe for you then you may go and pray without any problem insha Allah who as what gel"
