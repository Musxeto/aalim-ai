  "transcript": "the people when it comes to being dutiful to your parents are three types one is the person who goes out of his way to be kind loving and obedient he does more than what they expect of him and he never says anything bad to them so this guy is the one who's dutiful now who is the one who is not dutiful the one who is not dutiful as the scholars say is the one who does his obligations to his parents and he does not harm them this is the interpretation of what of being not dutiful did you hear me well a person who does his obligations i give my mother and father shelter i give them pocket money i put food on their table i never insult them i never speak root to them i never but this is it obligations and staying away from haram they say he is not dutiful the third type is the one who does not do his obligations and he's insultive he's abusive he raises his voice he looks at them straight in the eye when speaking to them you know that this is a sin when your father or mother are speaking to you and you look them straight in the eye so your father tells you why did you come late yesterday and you look at him he said i'm a grown-up man i can come whenever i want this is sinful you will go to hell because of this so now most of us are from category number two we do our obligations and we don't do any sins yet we are sinful for that what allah tells you to do is to be extra dutiful extra respectful more than what they expect from you then you will be fulfilling allah's command to you"
