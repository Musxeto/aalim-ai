  "transcript": "can sunnis visit karbala and perform pilgrimage as i know someone close to me who has gone is there any haram in this any any sunni who goes to karbala which is the burial ground as they claim of saints and ah lil bait etc any muslim who goes there thinking that he's performing hajj this is an act of apostasy takes him out of the fold of islam because hajj can only be done to makkah any so-called muslim goes and travel to such shrines if he doesn't commit shirk he's an innovator and making a major sin for traveling to other than the three sacred places which is mecca medina and these are the only three places the prophet permitted us iso sam to pack our bags and travel to as a form of worship so this friend of yours is not a sunni definitely he's a full-fledged shia and the concept of performing hajj to karbala is an act of apostasy you you"
