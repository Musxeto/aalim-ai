  "transcript": "canada can i pray for prayer instead of the turaka of tawba no the hadith is specifically about it that you have to pray these two rakahs and ask allah for forgiveness but we have another hadith which says that between afar is an expiation to whatever sins that take place so if you repented from major sins and you pray the father then another that would suffice as well muhammad"
