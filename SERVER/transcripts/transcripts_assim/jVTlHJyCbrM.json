  "title": "When reading a surah after Fatiha, do you have to recite the surah in chronological order",
  "transcript": "from the uk he says when i recite surahs in the in the prayer has it or must it be in the order as written in the quran so chapter number one al-fatiha number two al-baqarah number three al-imran number four should it be in this order or can i flip the authentic sunnah of the prophet sallam proves to us that in many cases the prophet did not follow the order of the quran as we see it today so in one narration he offered night prayer with one of his companions and the companion stated clearly that he recited surat al-baqarah in one raka followed that in the same rakah with suratu nisa and then with surat al-imran in one single raqqa so he definitely swiped al-imran with a nissa not according to their order in the in the in the mushaf in the quran also it was reported that he prayed once in prayer with surat uh uh walaili idayasha and in the second raka washington though the order is the opposite and so on there are a number of similar incidents and this is mentioned in the book of the description of the prayer by sh mercenary soul you can go and check it so it is permissible for you to recite in the first and in the second rakah for example though it's two surahs before it or asura before it no problem and doing that insha allah"
