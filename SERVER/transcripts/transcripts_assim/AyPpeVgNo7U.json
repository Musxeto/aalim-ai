  "transcript": "is the layered niqab or tight fitting nikah permissible what are the different styles of nikab i personally don't know what a layered nikob is or a tight-fitting nikab because i can't imagine any cob which goes around your face being loose this is not an umbrella so what an akab should be is it should cover the whole face it should not be a form adornment of adornment itself and it has to be according to islamic conditions some women wear the nikab correctly which is covering the head in the face and leaving only a small gap which is a nakaba a hole to see through so you can barely see my eyes well sir your eyes are already far eastern so we can barely see it in in normal cases nevertheless this is the proper nikop where you can't see the eyes you can't see but the woman can see her way clearly nowadays we have variations of nikap we have a nekkab where women show their eyebrows and their top of their cheeks and this beautifies even a goat if you put this type of on the face of a goat and the goat has beautiful eyes it would seduce so many sickles and psychos so this is haram some of them put it down their noses some of them show some of their hair this is not a cop who are you joking just because you need braces and your teeth are so crooked it doesn't mean it's okay to hide it with what you call in a cup this is not an impact anyhob is what i've said and mentioned everything is is covered except a small opening for the eyes this is a proper neckar whenever it is not like this it defies the purpose of hijab and allah knows best you"
