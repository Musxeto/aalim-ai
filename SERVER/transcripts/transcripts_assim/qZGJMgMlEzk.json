  "title": "Toes weren't facing qiblah in sujood, repeat prayer? What to do if we don't know ruling of something",
  "transcript": "okay so my question is um what should a person do if they don't know the ruling of something in a situation so for example if I was in sujud but my toes weren't in the direction of the Qibla and then after I finished my prayer I like search for an answer but I cannot find an answer what should I do in this situation if I don't know the ruling okay first of all a lot of the problems we encounter come from our lack of knowledge and there is a video I was blessed by Allah to publish or post couple of years ago about the description of the prayer of the Prophet it's about an hour long and in it I explain how to perform the Salat and what are the Sunnah and what are mandatory and what are are pillars of Salat if a person had knowledge he would have known that directing your toes and fingers while in prostration to the Qibla is a Sunnah so if I do this my prayer is valid if I do this my prayer is valid because I was ordered to prostrate on seven limbs the feet the knees the hands and the forehead along with the nose I was doing this but yes my toes were not totally in the direction of the Qibla and most likely not all of them can be in the direction of the Qibla because of their difference of uh um length and due to flexibility issues so your prayer is 100 valid but now most likely you will say that but what will I do in other cases if you don't have knowledge you have to ask if you don't have anyone to ask you have to act upon your gut feeling because you have no other alternative there is no other choice so I have to make a decision right now I can't call Sheikh has them I can't go to Islam q a and find my answer what to do there's nobody of knowledge around me that I can ask I have to improvise I do whatever I can and later on when I ask and discover which is right and which is wrong I can act accordingly and Allah Knows Best Nabil from Saudi"
