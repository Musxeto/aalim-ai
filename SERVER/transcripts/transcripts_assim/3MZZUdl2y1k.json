  "title": "Taking oath or swearing on Quran, Is placing hand on Quran when taking oath innovation Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "symbol says can we take an oath on the Koran if you look in the books of fik you will find that taking an oath is something of great seriousness and allah azzawajal told us that those who take oath falsely so that they can gain something of these worldly materialistic things around allah azza wajal would not look at them not speak to them would not purify them and would punish them severely on the day of judgment because taking a Las name in vain is a very serious issue in Islam so now from that if you go to kitab a shahadat for examples for example inside Albahari you'll find that in the book or the chapter dealing with testimonies he made a chapter on the ruling on taking an oath at a specific place of importance a sacred place such as maqam Ibrahim in the Harlem or al-mu'tasim near the Blackstone and he says that some scholars some of the Salaf used to think and believe that an oath at such a sacred place is far greater than any other others in Medina for example and this was reported among the Companions whenever there was a dispute over something that was big and one had to take an oath had to swear by Allah that he is not the perpetrator or he is not the one who took the money etc just to clear his reputation and to win in that case they used to say don't take the oath here at court go to the member of the prophetess I mean the message of Medina as was reported with Zaidan if a bet an Earthman a fan others so scholars some of them concluded that whatever makes the oath greater and more serious in effect is better others in a another chapter in in sahih bukhari and others he also emphasized on the time so we have for example in the quran that the testimony after hussar prayer so they say that the time also has some importance from these to the scholars have splitted some say that only the name of allah sufficient because other scholars said no you have to add more to that so the vast majority say that saying wallah he I didn't do that this is sufficient some say no you have to repeat while llahi three times well I will I will lie others say that you have to glorify Allah more by saying well lie the creator of the universe the knower of the present and the past and the future the one who gives life life and death that you praise Allah the more you praise Allah the greater the impact of the oath is so the person giving that oath becomes fearful of Allah rather than saying well I didn't do it but if you glorify Allah the giver of life and death the provider the one who holds people accountable on the day of judgment the owner and the sustainer of this universe then a person fear of Allah would enter his heart and he would refrain from lying so this is what scholars say because they've divided something saying what lies enough something no you have to praise Allah more and more and glorify him so that the oath would be of great impact this leads us to putting your hand on the Quran this was never done by the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam it was never done by the great companions of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and it was not done by the Thai being so to place the hand over the most half is not part of the Sunnah and if you go an extra mile and say it is actually an innovation you wouldn't be far from the truth though there are scholars who said that it is to emphasize the importance and the danger and the greatness of the oath by a las nay yes some scholars have said that but when we retract and look back and find that neither the prophet alayhi salaatu sam nor his companions or the turban een had ever done such a thing we know then then this is not part of the religion and one should refrain from it having said that if a person was forced like in some courts for example or it was a lie an issue or a matter of life and death and he was forced to swear by placing his hand on the must have inshallah he would not be sinful for that and Allah knows best"
