  "title": "Adding ribbons and other fabrics to beautify the hair  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the first question was what is the ruling on using fabrics whether it's wool cotton any type of material so that the hair would be beautified the scholars said that if the fabric used can be distinguished can be known that it is not hair then this is permissible like the ribbons that some women or girls use when they make their braids so their hair is black the ribbon is yellow or brown or red or blue what whatever color and it's obvious that this is a ribbon this is a thread that is used with the hair there's no problem in that the problem is when you use something that gives the impression that your hair is different so for example women sometimes tend to put a piece of cotton or wool underneath their hair and put the hair on piles on top of it so she would have like a bun at the back of her head and it looks as if her hair is way longer than it is and people would get the impression that she has long thick hair this is not permissible in Islam likewise it is totally prohibited and cursed by Allah Azza WA JAL for a woman to wear extensions so her hair is this long and she was extensions that fool people to thinking that her hair is much longer much thicker than it is so therefore this is not permissible even if it was for beautification to your husband"
