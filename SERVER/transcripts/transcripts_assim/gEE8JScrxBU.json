  "transcript": "[Music] if a born muslim begins to practice the religion after many years of ignorance should he say the shahada in front of everyone the answer is no shahadah is not difficult and i am always amazed by the number of questions people say i did so and so so and i think it's should i say the shahada how 0001 calorie there's no difficulty in it none whatsoever so why do people keep on asking these questions farzana the person who was born muslim this is the default and though he was not practicing he was never labeled as a disbeliever so once allah guided him and he started practicing there is no need to reassure the fact that he's a muslim because he's a muslim so there's no point in him saying the shahada which he says tens of times during the day and the night allah knows best you"
