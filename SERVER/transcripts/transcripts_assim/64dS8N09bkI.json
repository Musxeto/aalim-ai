  "title": "Is it ok to read & Memorize Duas in Transliteration (Roman Letters)? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Salman from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, how are you doing today? Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Allahumma Barik Sheikh, I know that it is forbidden to read Quran from the Roman script, the translation, but as I am a revert, I read all the Adhkars like the morning and evening Adhkar and the night time Adhkar after the Fajr Salah Adhkar from the translated version. And since I have been doing this for a long time and these are repetitive, I have almost memorized many Adhkar through the translated version. So should I continue like this or stop doing each and every Adhkar and wait for maybe five to six months till I learn Arabic at least to read these Duas? First of all, the problem with transliteration is with the Qur'an because we are ordered and instructed to preserve the Qur'an in its original form in the Uthmani transcription. So writing it in Roman letters defies this by all means, and it distorts the Qur'an and its writing, and this is why it's totally prohibited. This is for those who write it. On the other side, those who are reverts, who do not know Arabic, who have no access to reading the Qur'an except through transliteration, we say due to necessity, it's okay for you to read it through transliteration, providing you hear it simultaneously so that you don't make any mistakes because if you read the Roman or the English alphabet, it definitely misses a huge number of Arabic alphabets so you will not be able to say it correctly unless you hear it, then you can match things up. This is for the Qur'an. As for the Adhkar of the morning and the evening and the other hadith, this is much much easier and it's much much lenient. It's no problem in doing that, none whatsoever insha'Allah."
