  "transcript": "I've just learned recently that it is part of the sunna to take a siesta or the midday nap or as it is said in Arabic the Kula because Shan or Satan doesn't take a siesta or a midday nap what I wanted to ask you today was at what time specifically should someone try to take a siesta is a recommended Sunnah and to my knowledge that some countries may need them more than others so hot countries may require this aula or Siesta uh unfortunately some of us may instead of making it a siesta for like five or 10 minutes uh a a super nap as we call them they go on for hibernation for a couple of hours this is not a siesta this is a second night that you're spending so ACS that understanding of it is as follows the prophet Alam and his companions used to wake up before the break of dawn like at 4: maybe 3 and then continue to work until aftera prayer this long time of working and being active requires some rest and this is where the Siesta or this Kula time comes it should be before prayer or after prayer it's around this time so it's 11: 11:30 or maybe at 12:30 after prayer depending on your region and it should be like for 15 minutes uh half an hour at most and this breaks the tired that you may feel and energizes you and Allah Knows Best"
