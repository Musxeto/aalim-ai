  "transcript": "we have sharif from india look i had just one question which was that sometimes after we eat would we feel somewhat lazy so we delay sometimes during the day we feel sleepy so we deliver her please note that delaying doesn't mean that he's paying it after the time has ended he's playing it in time is such laziness haram and a sign of it okay uh i will answer inshallah sharif from india is delaying the prayer because i am drowsy though that prayer is done on time am i sinful the answer is if you're living far away from the masjid and you don't qualify to pray in the masjid as a mandation an obligation then no as long as you're praying it within the parameters of the prayer you're not sinful but if you live next to the message and you hear that then you're obliged to go and you're sinful if you don't"
