  "transcript": "Allah my question is is it true that we don't have to forbide evil on issues that Scholars have like on so if I see a man wearing shorts that exposes ties so I wouldn't advise him because there's an opinion of some Scholars that a man can expose his thighs outside of Salah the concept of relaf or dispute among Scholars is very vast and it's hard to say that there are things that don't have khilaf because these are the essentials of Islam No khilaf in wine in the prohibition of fornication in stealing and killing these are known things but all other things there are always disputable issues that would arise to say that is this is not true because if I am knowledgeable and I can advise others I know that what they're doing is wrong but it is accepted in some other school of thought if I refrain from advising people of the Quran and the Sunnah just because there is an issue of dispute I would not ever enjoy virtue and righteousness or forbid evil and vice but if we look at the issues of that are acceptable what do you mean when I come to an issue of dispute among Scholars and there is a crystal clear verse of the Quran or Hadith that is the defining line is the one that solves the dispute I wouldn't say that this is an issue of dispute let it be no if I'm going to a wedding and the bride does not have the consent of her guardian her guardian is not approving and she is coming to marry herself and she says well I'm following said yes but imamatic shafiri and and Imam Ahmed they all abide by the Hadith of the Prophet Islam who said there is no marriage valid without the consent of your guardian so this marriage is invalid she said no no it's an issue of dispute and people say don't comment it's an issue of dispute just move on so no this is not true when there is an issue of real dispute that these people have evidences and these people have as strong evidence as these people in this case I would be a part of letting it go for example someone eating at McDonald's in the UK people say this is Haram this is others say UK is a Christian country and we're permitted in Surat Almighty to eat from the midst of the slaughtering of the people of the book yeah but you don't know if they're slaughtered or not and the default is that they have slaughtered it until proven otherwise I can eat so this is an issue of dispute if I go and eat in McDonald's or in KFC or whatever and someone refrains and says no I'm not going to eat it's okay this is an acceptable issue of dispute because each one has a valid reason to back his opinion and I hope this clarifies the issue a little bit"
