  "transcript": "Samarra or Samba says my question is if a person dies in the holy month of Ramadan will he not be questioned in the grave till Judgment Day is this true no the answer the answer is no this is baseless those who die in Ramadan and those who died in other months than Ramadan are the same however in Ramadan it is most likely that there will be an edge or an advantage due to those who pray funeral prayers upon them would be much much larger in number the gates of heaven are open the gates of hell are closed so insha'Allah they are in the mercy of allah azza wajal"
