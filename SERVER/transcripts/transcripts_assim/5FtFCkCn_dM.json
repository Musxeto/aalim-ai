  "transcript": "so um my family is uh like they they're gonna celebrate my uh a birthday tomorrow and um normally when like such things happen i just stay in my room but i'm i'm thinking that um i have this one cousin who started to be like he's coming more to salafia and i haven't told him that birthday is not haram yet but it if he comes should should i what do you think what would be better if i just free myself from the birthday and either stay in my room or go out somewhere or should i when uh my cousin comes just uh stay with him and advise him but we but we would probably be in the same place as the what the birthday is happening no first of all you have to save your own self don't care about others so you want to avoid falling into sin you want to avoid the birthday celebrations and all what's attached to it regardless whether this would impact other people or not that this would influence negatively other people for doubting your choices or not this is none of your concern so my advice to you is invite your cousin and go out together somewhere you don't have to leave him but if this is not possible then you leave that occasion and you can discuss this with him later on on the phone or through a visit and explain to him why you did this and allah azza knows best you"
