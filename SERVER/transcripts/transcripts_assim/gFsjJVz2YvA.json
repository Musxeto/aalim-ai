  "title": "Can a woman delay making up missed Ramadan fasts & fast 6 days of Shawwal first? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "she says or she asks about a general problem that women face the hadith is crystal clear the prophet said asam whoever fasts ramadan meaning the full 30 days then follows that with six days of shawwal then this is as if he has fasted the whole entire year women say okay we fasted 23 days of shawa of ramadan and we have seven days to make up can we delay these seven days three four months later but fast the six days of on time the answer is no and it's an issue of dispute but i'm inclined to the opinion that says that the hadith clearly states fasting of ramadan you fasted 27 days you did not fast the whole ramadan you have to finish fasting the full ramadan whether 29 or 30 days then fast your six days off shawwal otherwise you will not attain the reward"
