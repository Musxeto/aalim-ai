  "transcript": "Uh is it uh permissible to uh in order to attain martyrdom that you purposefully endanger endanger yourself such as going to uh for example Gaza and becoming an aid worker uh and then dying in the process. Will this count as martyrdom or will it count as suicide because you knew that you will most likely die? This is not suicide. When you go for relief purposes and working to help Muslims there and the injured, this is not suicide. If you die in the process, inshallah, you'll be a martyr and inshallah you'll be rewarded for that. Fact."
