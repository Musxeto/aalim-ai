  "transcript": "from the uk so my father owns a photo editing firm and most of the photos are done with pirated software um it's not really a my contribution but i wanted to build a machine learning algorithm which is going to do the photos automatically uh is it the machine learning algorithm needs some examples of the photos to learn how to do the job automatically and it's almost like a new worker if you're bringing your worker and you need to show them the photos right so is it okay if we let the machine learning algorithm see the images edited with pirated photoshop which have already been sent to the client so that they can learn the job okay i will answer inshallah abdullah from the uk i think he abdullah asked this question like a gazillion times on twitter on my uh website and now again or there uh are other people who are asking the same question so he has a program where he needs photographs so that the program would recognize and build logarithms of a particular software he's using the original software however the photographs he's going to use are from his father's firm and his father uses in his firm cracked software where they photoshop and edit these photographs so he's saying if i use these photographs would i be sinful would my happy haram would my income be haram the answer is no the haram is on your father for the work he had done if he did something haram using software and making money cracked software violating copyrights and using and making and generating money out of that is haram because it's like stealing someone's work and making a profit out of it now for you to come and take this product which has been already fixed and edited providing it's halal providing it's about cars or about something that's not human or it's not a creation of allah per se with a soul and you use that there is no sin on you as long as you're using the halal and a legitimate software copy the haram is on your father and his team and allah knows best you"
