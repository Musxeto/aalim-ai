  "title": "Ruling on Eating Stunned Meat, The Banning Of Halal And Kosher Animal Slaughter? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sidi from Germany says, stunned meat, what's\nthe ruling on that? stunning animals before slaughtering it is\nhighly recommended by the disbelievers. The kuffar and they think they think that\nthis is more merciful which is totally bogus but they're\nkuffar, they're disbelievers they don't believe in the oneness of Allah how would you expect\nhim to believe in other than that? However to us Muslims it is prohibited to\neat what is not slaughtered, so we cannot eat\na sheep or a cow that was not slaughtered Islamically and properly. Now stunning this animal\neither would sedate it would make it drowsy so that we can\neasily slaughter it without it fighting back or stunning it would electrocute it and\nkill it, if it's the latter it's totally prohibited in haram and you cannot eat\nthat if it's stunned just to make it weaker and controllable\nand then we slaughter it while it's STILL LIVING while still alive but\nstunned in this case it is halal though it's not\nrecommended because this is a form of torturing the\nanimal before actually slaughtering. slaughtering it is the most merciful act\nyou can do for that animal but these people don't care, so if we\ndon't know Sheikh well if you don't know to be safe you have to investigate because\nat the end of the day it's not a necessity and unfortunately I've heard that\nsome European countries today only issued a law that mandates stunning before\nslaughtering. if the stunning the electric shock kills the\nanimal then it becomes totally haram and the Muslims there must object\nmust take all legal actions to fight this unfair resolution and this is\none step in many many steps that would be enforced upon them to change their\nreligion beginning with niqab beginning with their food beginning with sexual uh\norientation and education for their children so many things, the end result is you\nhave to be in the same melting pot you have to dispose of your Islam and of your\nreligion if you want to stay here and this is actually waging war against your\nreligion so you have to be civil you have to be diplomatic but take all legal\nactions possible to counter this and as I usually advise if you can\nget the heck out of here and go back to a Muslim country where you can\nlive as a Muslim."
