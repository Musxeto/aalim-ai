  "title": "Right way to Pray for Isteghfar & Shukr (Forgiveness & Thankfulness) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the next question is that what is the right way to pray for is the far and also to do sugar as four is still far there is what we call as-salatu Toba there is a hadith where the Prophet SM says whoever commits a sin and then prays to raka for the sake of a larger load forgive his sins so normal to records with intention of seeking Allah's forgiveness there is also what is known as sayyed is still far a la Mantella billah al and helped anyone Abdul ca√±ada handy covered e-commerce at art I will you becoming shadi mas or not or a community alia wouldn't be for sure be you know Alfred Nobel and this is known as the master say it at least still afar of asking for forgiveness as for sugar there is nothing to be done except to be grateful with your heart with your tongue and with your actions Allah says in the Quran he Ramallah would a chakra wah qaleelun min ibadiya sh-shakoor' a family of the would work and strive in thanking allah azza wajal so what you do is a form of gratitude to allah azza wajal and seldom of my servants would be grateful so your prayer is a sign of gratitude your fasting your giving charity being kind to people overlooking their shortcomings obeying your parents connecting to your kinship protecting your tongue from slandering and cursing and saying bad things to people all of these are considered to be acts of sugar and expressing your gratitude as for praying to records of sugar this is not authentic and in the hadith is not authentic so it's an innovation as for the prostration of sugar this is done only when a blessing happens not on a reoccurring blessing so if you get your paycheck every month you don't perform should you the sugar because this is happening every month but if your wife cooks the good meal then I was just sure but if for example your uncle is in ICU and they say that he's very dangerous in critical condition and you pray to Allah may Allah save him Ellison and then they say he's going into operation and it's very shaky and after two hours they say alhamdulillah he made and you prostrate for sugar this is okay because this is not be occurring Allah knows best"
