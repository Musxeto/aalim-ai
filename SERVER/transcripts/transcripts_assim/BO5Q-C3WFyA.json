  "title": "Man marries Christian/Jewish woman Do islamic rules apply on her (hijab, eyebrows..) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sh if a Muslim man marries a let's say a Christian or Jewish woman what kind of like conduct must the man ensure that the wife maintains like for example uh how women would have to wear the hijab Orab not trim eyebrows or other rules how would those like apply to the non-muslim life whatever we as Muslims are ordered to do the same command is addressed to the non-muslims and this issue is an issue of dispute among the scholars whether the disbelievers are addressed by the major issues in such as or even the minor issues such as the prohibition of eating with the left hand and the most authentic opinion is that the disbelievers the non-muslims are addressed by all what the Muslims are addressed to do and this is why in when the people of paradise look at the people of Hellfire and ask them why were you admitted to Hellfire the first answer would be we did not pray to Allah of course you didn't pray you're you're a disbeliever you're a cafir why would you pray five times a day which means that they were addressed by the minor and the major issues of Shar therefore when you marry a Christian woman and this is again related to where you marry her do you marry her in a Muslim country or in a cafir country because if you marry her in a cafir country sometimes it's almost impossible B to compel her to abide by the Islamic rulings so she says I am a Christian I wear minis skirts I wear tank tops I put on makeup I do the whole nine yards you married me like this so you deserve what you get and you can't do anything because you live in their country in the cafir country she could put you in jail if you try something else how however if it is agreed upfront that when we get married you have to abide by the Islamic rulings which means you don't drink alcohol in my home you don't eat pork you don't free mix you don't wear these revealing clothes and I will treat you like a queen like my wife like the love of my life if she agrees and consents that's fine but again there is no no specific eate other than you should be the man of the house you're the one who's wearing the pants so you need to make things clear and if she's willing and accepting then alhamdulillah you have no problem but may Allah make things easy"
