  "title": "Can we follow an opinion from a different Madhab if mine is too hard?",
  "transcript": "you said in the past that a layman has to follow a math hab and share picking like taking opinions from different methods is harm but for example the ramadan asks you if swallowing the saliva from the lip would break the fasting i want to hear your opinion as i am following the handbody method and according to the hanbali method and also to the chef a method doing this the liberty would break the fasting that was in the opinion of imam rahimahullah and and but this opinion can be very difficult for a person so is it permissible for a layman to follow the opinion from a different method if he finds the opinion from his own method to be very difficult whether it's an ishti had or should he always stick to his method even if he's very hard for him as long as they do not contradict with quran sunnah okay first of all habib i did not say a layman must follow a madhhab usually people quote this and forget that i give a full package i usually say a layman must not cherry pick and he must follow a trusted scholar in whatever he tells him and if you can't find a scholar then you may follow a medhab but you cannot just blindly follow a madhab without a shaykh from the madhhab guiding you around because every madhhab has two or three opinions on the same topic such as the issue of swallowing your saliva if it came out of your mouth to your lips and then you swallowed it again and by the way this is a hypothetical issue not mentioned in the quran the quran says do not eat do not drink now cascading this to licking your lip like this and then imagining that i've swallowed my saliva swallowing your saliva is i cannot show it on live tv because this is rated pg most likely not rated whatever so to have your saliva on your lip in mass in quantity this is something that is debatable yes in this case we may say oops what have you done you have a chunk of saliva on your lips and you're swallowing it that's something with mass just licking your lip like this and then licking it again like this has zero impact on your fasting with all due respect to the schools of thought that say this invalidates your fasting it doesn't imagine the quantity of water after rinsing your mouth and spitting it out do you mean to tell me that there isn't any amount of water remaining and mixing with your saliva of course there is is it something to break your fast of course not why because the prophet ordered us to rinse our mouths and to spit it out the remaining is negligible so you tell me the amount of saliva when i lick my lip like this is it less or more than the amount of water remaining and mixing with my saliva when i spit the water after rinsing it in wudhu so definitely we have to danny be a little bit logical and not make islam too difficult to practice number one secondly following the books of is difficult without a sheikh you have to have a trusted sheikh to help you navigate through the different opinion this is in the old opinion of shafiri and this opinion is the new opinion of shafir which one i take that would be cherry picking because one says right one says left okay that's uh that's that's nice i'm following the shaft i have the choice no there is the most authentic opinion of the two which you are obliged to follow so i hope this answers your questions we you"
