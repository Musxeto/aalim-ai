  "transcript": "sh my question is uh regarding the dusting off of the bed before going into it uh if you can just give like a a brief demonstration of how it should look and before you start grilling me I just like you don't have to obviously take off a garment just show us like would you turn and if you're wearing a shirt like a normal t-shirt from nowadays would you turn it inside out and how would it look first of all the prophet said that when someone wakes up in the middle of the night leaves his bed and comes back again he should dust his bed because he would not know what came on his bed afterwards dusting it would be with your garment so whether your garment is this or your long shirt or your pajamas or your robe or anything that you can you just do this on your bed if you don't have anything that's detachable on your body I'm not going to ask you to take off your T-shirt or your pajamas if you don't have anything that has an edge to it you can do this simply grab your pillow and dust your bed and Allah Knows Best"
