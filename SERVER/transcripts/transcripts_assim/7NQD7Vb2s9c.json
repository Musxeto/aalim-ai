  "title": "Must we stop everything when adhan is called? How to answer adhan & What's the reward Assim al hakee",
  "transcript": "says must we stop doing everything and listen and answer the adhan otherwise we won't be able to say the shahada on the day of judgment what is the reward of answering the event and reciting the prescribed dua afterwards this is one of the common misconceptions that people have and that is they think and they believe that when the that is given everything has to be halted so if you are working you should stop doing whatever you are doing and if you are for example um speaking with someone you have to refrain from talking if your head is uncovered if you're a woman you have to cover your hair all of this is baseless the worst of them all is those who say that if the adam is being called and you're talking to someone on your death bed you will be deprived from being able to say ashadu allah and this is totally baseless and it's prohibited to mention such things without authentic evidences from the prophet sunnah otherwise you will be lying on allah azzawajal by introducing such lies and baseless uh claims yes when that is given the sunnah is to repeat after the so when he says when he says you repeat that muhammadan offer salutation upon the prophet and then you make the dua muhammadan al-fatiha as allah is satisfied with you when you say these dua and you will gain the right of intercession on the day of judgement the prophet will intercede allah to assalaam for you on the day of judgment among other things so this is authentic but to claim that you don't speak when the then is given if you are a carpenter hold your hammer and put it down don't work don't do anything don't eat no this is all not from the sun and it is baseless you"
