  "transcript": "from the [Music] UK um I have a question regarding a Hadith from the prophet Muhammad sallam the Hadith goes um whoever recites after every obligatory prayer um nothing stands between him and Jenna except death um is this authentic yes yes this is an authentic Hadith that highly recommend that we recite a after every F prayer uh that we offer so we recite it five times a day after and and we also recite it uh before going to bed and this is a glad Tiding that whoever preserves this would eventually and inevitably enter J as long as he doesn't have have anything to block him from entering Paradise such as if he's a grave worshipper he prays five times a day he fasts Ramadan he goes to Hajj he gives zakat but he worships the graves no he will not be admitted to Jenna because he's a mush and the likes and Allah Knows Best"
