  "title": "Digital Photography  VS Image Making | Why is it prohibited to hang photos on walls? Assim AlHakeem",
  "transcript": "label's second question is about photo photographs so photography is an issue of dispute among scholars a lot of the scholars consider photography to be prohibited and to be considered as tasweer and the is image making so the prophet said that the most severely punished people on the day of judgment in hell fire are those who draw or who take a image and make images whether through sculpturing or through drawing and this is what caused a lot of the scholars to consider shooting and clicking photographs to have the same ruling because in arabic it's called toswer and it's the same concept which is image making or taking some scholars begged to differ and i'm inclined to that opinion because when you take a photograph there is no no there is no human intervention the the picture you see on your tv screen is a reflection of light it's the same that i see when i talk to a mirror or when i see my reflection on a pond of water so this is not something that i created this is the creation of allah azza and some scholars say as long as there is no photoshopping as long as there's no editing of the picture it's just as you had taken it this is permissible so label's question is okay if we say that's permissible why is it prohibited to hang on the walls because the default remains which is that ali ibn abi talib said to uh may allah be pleased and may allah have mercy on the stabbery he said to him should i sent you on the same errand which the prophet had sent me he sent me not to leave a picture without how do we say it um [Music] misfiguring it changing its features so it's not a picture anymore so if this is a statue you have to break it if it's a portrait you have to try to cover the face or erase it or whatever so this hadith in the sahih shows that it is not permissible to have any such photographs or drawings in general to be hung on the walls and i don't know of any scholar that says it is permissible to hang photographs not only that we know that a lot of the people have this problem after let's say their father dies and we see this in the public in in communities and also in soap operas and in movies where you find that there's the portrait of the deceased with black uh clothings around it and the widow comes and says and talks to him i wish you come and see what your children what your kids have done to me we have problems we have financial and she's talking to the dead through the picture so definitely hanging photographs or pictures of live creatures or animals or human beings is totally prohibited but to have pictures of landscape of mountains of rivers of trees etc there is nothing wrong in that [Music] inshallah"
