  "transcript": "Brother Harun from Bosnia has a governor Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Sheikh basically I would like to know is it permissible for me to download videos off of YouTube using third-party websites considering that YouTube has it in its privacy policy forbidding any sort of downloading I just want to download for example Nasheeds or Quran so I can have it in my car without needing internet for or you know watching the videos and stuff like this Wallahi this is an issue that some say it's ethical and others say that it is not and to me it seems that this is permissible because they are putting policies according to their own preferences not to my consent so as long as I'm not harming anyone there's no problem inshallah in doing that as long as I'm not violating anybody's copyright or taking money that is not lawful for me I hope inshallah that there's nothing prohibited in that especially if it's something like Quran which is Allah's words there is nothing wrong in that and Allah knows best"
