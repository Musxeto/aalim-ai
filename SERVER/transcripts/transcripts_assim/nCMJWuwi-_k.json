  "transcript": "[Music] what level of intimacy is allowed or not allowed between a husband and wife during fasting what is well-known among the Muslims and the consensus of all scholars of Islam that having intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan is prohibited now what draws a person closer to intercourse is prohibited as well but if a person knows himself well and he knows that he has self-control and he would not ever be tempted to fall into intercourse during the daytime of Ramadan whether it's a he or a she in this case there is no problem in any type of intimacy as long as it does not lead to intercourse so kissing hugging being intimate is permissible providing you have self-control and this is how mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her described our Prophet is salat wa salam of having great self-control and that he would not ever be tempted or fall into such a sinful act during the daytime of Ramadan and this is why when the Companions used to be asked about a man kissing his wife during the daytime of Ramadan sometimes they would say there's no problem and sometimes they would say this is prohibited and when their companions asked them why give two different answers they said that the first man was an old man so kissing his wife would not lead to anything dangerous because he's Oh he's not hot-blooded he's not young while the second person was a young man who was newly Wed so most likely if he kisses his wife things would escalate and lead to something that might put him in danger in the sense that he may have intercourse with his wife which would mean that they would have to pay the expiation freeing a slave if not possible fasting two consecutive months if not possible feeding 60 people one would say for missing one day I fast 60 consecutive days with none stop this is too much well you don't decide my friend whether it's too much or not you have committed a grave and serious sin and you have to pay the consequences now who dictated that this is the expiration it's a Lodge origin so you don't get to pick and choose you don't get to say hmm freedom 60 people is okay it only it's only 10% of my salary so here we go no you have to free asleep there are no slaves you have to fast 60 consecutive months I can't why can't you oh it's too difficult to have meetings I have to drink cappuccino and I have to do this this is not a legitimate excuse are you chronically ill no I'm fair as a horse you have to fast sure 60 days is too much this is what you have to pay because you have sinned and disobeyed Allah as what gel [Applause]"
