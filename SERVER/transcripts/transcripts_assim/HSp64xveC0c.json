  "title": "Fi sabilillah reward for voluntary fasts or only for battlefield (ribat)?",
  "transcript": "my second question is about there is a hadith which says anyone who fast for one day in the way of allah took his face away from her 70 years distance so my question is is it is it in the battlefield it is during battlefield or okay i i'll answer i will answer inshallah your question so we have muhammad from bangladesh he says there is a hadith where the prophet salallahu salaam stated that whoever fasts a day fisabilillah in the cause of allah azzawajal allah would further his face from hellfire the distance of 70 autumns meaning 70 years so he's asking is the cause of allah any voluntary fasting because this falls under the cause of allah or is it which means jihad which means on the battlefield or at the front when muslims are fighting their enemies it's an issue of dispute and the same thing goes with ayah number 60 in chapter nine the ayah of a zakat scholars differed can we give our zakat to building messages because this falls under the eighth category of fisabilillah or it is restricted to anything related to jihad so it is an issue of dispute in the most authentic opinion that the word fisabilillah refers to jihad so whoever fasts while at the front lines or when there is there's no fighting but anticipation or there is an actual fighting on the battlefield and he's fasting then allah azzawajal would further his face from hell fire the distance of 70 years and allah knows best you"
