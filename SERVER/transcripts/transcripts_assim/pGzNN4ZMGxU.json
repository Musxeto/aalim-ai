  "title": "Is it permissible for a man to work as a Taxi driver? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "had sent us an email and her email is a little bit complicated because it involves a couple of issues so she is saying that she read the fatwa which states that it is haram for men to work as cab or taxi drivers and the argument is that they should not escort females without their muharram and also that they would be helping those who go to places like pubs clubs or might be drunk so she wants to know the ruling as she rely on taxis almost daily as she doesn't drive and she does not like to use public transportation due to her health problems so these are a number of different topics combined together one of them is what's your ruling on working as a taxi or a cab driver it's an occupation it's a job like any other job however what defines whether it is halal or Haram what happens during that job so this can be cascaded at everything one says what's your ruling on studying accounting there's no problem so what's your ruling on working as an accountant we have to look at your job description if it involves registering and recording RIBA loans and interest deposited into your bank account or repayment with Reba this is Haram if it's not then it's halide so we go back to the hundreds question is a taxi drivers job halal or Haram it depends if the taxi driver is driving people to the airport to the souk to wherever they want to go there's no problem in that none whatsoever then we have to look into the things that makes it the the things that make it harm for example what's your running on a woman riding alone with a taxi driver this is not permissible what's the ruling on taking people to a place to commit Haram so someone gets into the cab take me to club 53 or to the pulse or this I know this is a place that is hollow so no I cannot take you apologize someone tells me take me to the nearest pub or to the night teenagers night club Harlem this is not permissible but if he gets into the car and says take me to street 54 house number so-and-so and I take him not knowing where that place is and when we reach there it is a pub or a nightclub or a church there's nothing wrong I did not know my wrist is holid this is part 1 part 2 for sister Cobra riding in a car alone with a man this is not permissible because being alone with the stranger in seclusion your third person with you is straight on and it doesn't mean that it has to happen now or next week or next month or next year Satan will wait anticipate and choose the right moment to attack so as a Muslim we refrain from doing what Allah so Jill had made prohibited"
