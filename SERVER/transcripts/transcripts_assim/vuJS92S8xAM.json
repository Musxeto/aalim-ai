  "title": "Does a man have less freedom with inherited property if he must spend its income on family",
  "transcript": "Abrar from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, I heard that during distribution of inheritance between the children, the son has less freedom on how he can use them compared to daughters. I don't understand your question. The question is basically, I heard that if I inherit the property of my father, then I have less freedom on it. Like I have to utilize it on my family or my wife or the children. Abrar, Abrar, when you inherited this property, did your sister inherit as well? Yes. What's the problem? You can do whatever you want in your share and she can do whatever she wants in her share. But if you're talking about managing the family property, this is an issue, a different issue. Which one are you asking about? I'm talking about inheriting the property of my deceased father. Okay, if you inherit your property and this is a plot that you take in your possession, you have the freedom to do whatever you want. You can sell it, you can cultivate it and grow plants in it, you can rent it. There is no restriction, none whatsoever towards you, your family or your property because it's your own money."
