  "transcript": "Ayaan from Pakistan. So Sheikh, I've got this problem of urine continence from the last, I think, around two to three years, which has caused me enough trouble in my life. I, it's everything, almost everything seems impure to me. So I have the question that how can I differentiate between pure and impure things? Because everything in my house seems impure to me, like the sofa, the clothes, etc. Okay, Ayaan, you have to acknowledge that the goal of Satan is to mess up with your head. All what Satan wants is to make life difficult for you. Now, is Islam a religion of simplicity and ease or a religion of hardship and difficulty? No Muslim on earth would say it's a religion of hardship and difficulty. It is definitely a religion of simplicity and ease because Allah stated in the Quran that He does not want to burden us in religion. Allah made things easy in Islam, very easy. So now my question to you, the way you're practicing your Islam, is it easy and simple? The answer is no. You'll say that, no, I find my life hard and difficult. Everything I see is najis, my sofa, the light switch, the doorknobs, my clothes, the kitchen utensils, this is not Islam which you're practicing, this is another religion. So don't fool yourself. Satan has messed up with your head, you are following and obeying him. It's your mistake. All what he does is to call you and you're responding and answering. So you have only yourself to blame. What to do? You have to stop this nonsense immediately, go back to the basics. Everything on earth is pure until proven otherwise. Do you have proof? Can you see it? Can you smell it? Definitely you're not going to taste it. If not, then it's pure. Maybe Shaykh, I think, I feel all of this is doubtful. Certainty is not affected by doubt and Allah Azzawajal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
