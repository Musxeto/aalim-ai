  "transcript": "Next question is, can we support and attend events organized by organizations that are not careful about the mannahj of the speakers? This is too generic. There are extremes. There are people who only focus on the mannahj. So all what they know is mannahj. And that's it. And there are people who diluted Islam. So different sects, cults, they're all put in a blender and mashallah we have cocktail. Akhi, you have to be very specific. Organizations, they depend on who leads them. So if they don't have a clear direction or a directive, we have to work with them, try our level best to bring them as close as possible to Quran and Sunnah. If there is clear deviation, if they are getting someone who talks ill about aqeedah, who talks ill about Allah's beautiful names and attributes, they follow deviant sects, clearly. Or talk against the Muslim ruler and call for khuruj and violence. This is something we cannot endorse or compromise. Few things here and there, we have to look at the bigger picture. Generally speaking, yes, it's always best to be with those who are clearly cut on the Quran and the Sunnah. But you can't have those. They are one in a million. So what should we do? Boycott them all? Avoid them all? No, you have to try your level best to do as best as you can, give advice. But if there is clear deviation or something against Islam or the aqeedah, which is the most important thing, not the manhaj, the aqeedah. If this is the case, then you have to step back and Allah knows best."
