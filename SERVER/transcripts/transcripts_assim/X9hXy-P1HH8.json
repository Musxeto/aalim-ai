  "title": "Participating in lucky draws offered by supermarkets and shops - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the brother is question is straightforward a supermarket is offering a draw so that it would be like an incentive to bring and draw customers so they say you buy and whatever you buy that is more than fifty reals we give you a coke pone so you buy for a thousand reals we give you like 20 coke points etc and this would you have to fill it and put it in a box and then you will participate in a draw what's your ruling on this it varies among scholars a lot of the scholars say that this is totally prohibited because this is like gambling this is like lottery buying a ticket and hoping for the best which never comes except a once in a million chances other scholars say no this is permissible totally because it is the owner of the shop that is giving giveaways so it's a present middle opinion which I feel comfortable with and I believe that it is the most authentic is that if you go frequently and usually whether there's a draw or not to that particular supermarket to buy from them your groceries in this case once they introduced this coupon and the draw a scheme which is probably a month once a year it prolongs for four weeks five weeks but once a year so if this is your usual trend likewise if you buy a newspaper and they put a draw that because you are subscribing to us your name would be automatically in a draw but my subscription is with or without your draw I'm a frequent reader or if you buy dairy products sometimes they do this so if you do it if you buy it usually not for the draw there's no problem in benefiting from the prize if you win which really it's very sell and rare but if you change all of a sudden so I usually go to supermarket eight but I read this morning that supermarket B is offering a fancy car for those who buy from them and you get a chance to take a draw to participate in the draw and there are other beautiful and glamorous and attractive prizes like a trip to Turkey my etcetera a phone whatever so you decide to go to supermarket B this is Haram and winning the prize is also Haram because now there is a probability a possibility whether you win or lose and this is why you're buying and some people unfortunately I've seen this they multiply the amount of products they want to buy so instead of buying one box of milk they buy like ten so that they would increase their chances of winning and this is totally prohibited analyzer"
