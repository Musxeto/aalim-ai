  "title": "How to regard stories we hear from disbelievers regarding the Prophets and general history",
  "transcript": "Ã§al film says we read the history of the prophets and often we see references of historian and their books and sometimes even israeli narrations so in short what can we believe and what can we disbelieve so especially when it is the history purpose like the age of early prophets the children's name and so on well confirm the Prophet Elisha lapsim answered this and the scholars categorize whatever narrations we get from the people of the book so narrations we get from the Old Testament from the Torah from the Jews from the Christians in Islam we call it s la Iliad the Israelites things coming from the sons of Israel so what's the ruling on what we hear from them well it is categorized into three types the first type is what we must believe in so whatever is in the books that fits as a glove with what is in our Islam from Quran and Sunnah we accept it and take it for granted we believe because it is actually from our Quran asunder so it coincides with it we believe in it the second type is what goes against our religion goes against our belief in the Quran and the Sunnah so we totally rejected and we would not accept it and we would say that this is a blatant lie why because it goes against our Quran Sunnah simple as that the third category is What's in between meaning that it doesn't go against the Quran Sunnah yet it does not or it is not confirmed by the Quran the sooner so in these type of stories we do not falsify and we do not believe we just refrain for example a lot of the Muslims think and believe that Ezra yield is the name of the Angel of Death Allah mentioned the name of the Angel of Death in the Quran as Malakal mode the Angel of Death and so did the Prophet erase salif's and hadith never ever they we were told that the name of the Angel of Death is Israel we know that the name of the art angel jibreel peace be upon him the name of the angel who's supposed to blow the trumpet is is revealed the name of the angel who is appointed with rain and the growth of plantation is nikkah ill so some folks would say ok it rhymes it sounds good Israel sounds good no it doesn't we do not say his name is not Azrael yet we do not confirm that his name is Israel and hence we call him as Allah has called him in the Quran and Sunna as Malik Elmo would this is what we are supposed to do so I think this answers your question in regards to the stories we hear about the prophets then ages and the sons names which comes from the Israelis stories or from from the sons of Israel but Israel we refrain from falsifying it or believing it if it does not coincide with the Quran and Sunna and it does not go against the Quran and Sunna and Allah knows best"
