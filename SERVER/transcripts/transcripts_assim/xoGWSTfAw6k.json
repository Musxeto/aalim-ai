  "title": "What is Tasawwuf (Sufism)? Is it part of Islam? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign and do we need it in our day-to-day life I understand you so Sufism is something that was innovated it was not mentioned at the time of the Prophet Sam or his companions or those who followed him from the favorite Generations and some say that it is derived from the word soof which means wool because their righteous predecessors used to wear wool all the time and they relate this to letting go of this Dunya and being modest and humble and not trying to be luxurious in your food in your dress and and all of this is not part of Islam nowadays Sufism has gone into a whole new level where it's Mystic it has serious allegations in Akida and their belief in Allah in the existence of this universe and the vast majority of the peers who lead these sects are money makers and they are among the richest in the world and I've met people from the UK and elsewhere who say to me and they name names in countries like Pakistan or India and they say we give them like 5 000 pounds a month and we're just one single family so they're Filthy Rich and they talk with nonsense all their hadiths or most of their hadiths are fabricated or weak all what they say to people are tales and stories nothing from the Quran the Sunnah usually and they Depend and rely on Visions I saw in a dream I had this Vision I and it's all bogus so it has no reality in Islam no relationship to Islam you want to become a Muslim leave these deviant sects alone leave the labels follow Quran follow the way of the Prophet salaam and understand them with the understanding of the favored three generations of the companions of the best of the the best then the tabirin then the tabiri tabern and you'll be safe"
