  "transcript": "so now I am in the state of tum what breaks my tum number one finding water or being able to use water so the moment the reason you can't use water is uplifted and now you can use water such as in the case of having a surgical plaster and it was removed and the doctor says now you can use water immediately my tum is broken I have to perform W number two is if I were to break my state of Purity with whatever nullifies my woodo the normal things so defecating urinating passing of wind sleep sleeping or eating camels meat all of this breaks my woodoo therefore it breaks my state of tum as well and Allah Knows Best"
