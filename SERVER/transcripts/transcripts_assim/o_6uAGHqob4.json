  "title": "Missed 3 Friday prayers consecutively due to traveling, will Allah seal my heart? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Uh, I've missed three jum as a result of traveling on Fridays. I want to know if there's no issue with that at all. The prophetatam warned Muslims not to miss three consecutive jum and he says that this is a sign of hypocrisy and whoever does this Allah will seal his heart. We're talking about Muslims that are obliged to pray J. Men who are residing, who are capable and healthy, who've reached the age of puberty. Of course, they're men, not male, which exempts women, slaves, children, and travelers. So of course and the sick people who are unable to attend. So if a traveler is on a journey and he misses three, four, 10 Jumas, there's no issue in that and he's not under the hadith being threatened that his heart would be sealed or that he would be among the hypocrites with the grace of Allah because falling sick or traveling is a legitimate reason to skip and allahel knows Best."
