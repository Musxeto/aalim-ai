  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Pakistan my question is about \nzakaat since zakaat isn't valid or accepted until   nisaab has reached on a certain date because \nof the ruling that paying prior to date is also   paying in advance when it is not due but on the \nother hand paying late is also a sin how should   anyone pick a date for the past number of spending \nyears especially if the person remembers neither   the day the year or the month at which nisaab \nwas reached and in case another person has the   slightest idea of the year on some basis may \nbe able to reach closer to the date on which   some gold gift were given but still it is not sure \npick how to pick a date earlier or later than the   actual would picking a completely at a random date \nbe acceptable to both cases even if it is earlier   then or when nisaab was reached first of all what \nyou said that paying the zakat before its due time   is not permissible is not true if my zakati is on \nthe first of Ramadan and I pay it couple of months   earlier this is totally permissible I'm doing \nthe poor a favor by giving my zakat a couple   of months earlier delaying it is not permissible \nif a person doesn't know when his zakat started   the month the year the date there is nothing \nhe can do but to do his level best Allah says fear Allah to the best of your ability so you \nhave to estimate and to be safe rather than sorry   make it in the favor of the poor and set this \ndate and Allah will hold you accountable to it   as simple as that if you want to say okay my \nzakat started five years ago I don't know which   date just to be safe I'll consider it that it \nstarted six years ago you can pick in a date   you want in the the sixth year the first year \nand you will be giving more than what you owe   you are giving more than what you owe to Allah \nto the poor there's no problem in that inshaallah and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
