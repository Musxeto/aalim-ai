  "transcript": "consider subscribing we'll start with the washing what did we say in the morning can i move okay if i move no problem what did we say about the washing in the beginning we said that it is governed by a general hadith washing by using water and scissors now we have the stuff with us the siddha the kung fu the mosque sundan these are all substances and inshallah after the session in the break i don't know about the sisters you provide them with a sample you'll be able to smell it to see it because it gives you a closer insight when you touch it you smell it you know how it feels and looks like from the student we have siddhil we have the water we have the cafe and generally speaking any kind of perfume now how to do this differs from one place to the other the general concept is there so if you see something is done here this does not mean it's definitely has to be cloned and done exactly in morocco in syria in pakistan in india and indonesia and america we're going to do the traditional way which is usually using the bucket and using something to pour water nowadays in saudi arabia for example i believe here and elsewhere instead of that you have the shower instead of doing it the easy way there are much easier way of doing it but we'll do the basics so if you go to somewhere and you see them using the shelves no this has been it's not permissible no it's not it is because this is part of washing the deceased how you wash him this is up to you the eyes stated now i remember you need to prepare a few things so it's best that you prepare the things that you need to washing the deceased or the dead person now for the person who is doing the actual washing what does he need first of all a pair of gloves and preferably that these do you have to have gloves no but as long as we have it it's more convenient rather than putting a piece of cloth and using it this is hygienic for washing now you can use the gloves without any cloth because you are not directly touching the body but when you if you tried washing your body with a piece of a plastic glove you'd find it very difficult therefore it is recommended for hygiene issues that you wear the gloves and then you use the piece of uh of course can we see the piece of cloth you're gonna use so this is the piece of pot any piece of cloth it doesn't have to have something to be wrapped around your wrist it doesn't have to be of a certain shape something that is convenient for you of course as recommended we have to have something to put on your face so that it prevents smells from coming to you and maybe harming you or making you feel uncomfortable now the person who's washing the deceased he's going to have a lot of water and from the body and maybe something that is not pure coming from the body coming to him so it is best to wear something of course this is a simulation huh this is for making cookies but usually in actual you would find it really covering the body like the one they use in butcher butcher houses yeah of course it's it's a different situation but because they deal with blood then with slaughtering they have to have their the cells properly covered we said that it is recommended to have big scissors uh nail clippers and a small scissor of comp we do to trim the mustaches if needed now we brought may allah have mercy on our disease after we finish what i mean okay what do we do first yeah tell me okay first of all we of course when we bring the deceased now watch out there are two methods whether we do the whole process on the same table the washing the shrouding and take him away or we have do we have two different uh we don't okay we will do it on the same one in saudi arabia we do it on a separate after washing him we remove the body to another bed which is the bed we will be carrying into the graveyard and do it but in some countries they use the same bed they wash him on top of it and then they shroud him on top of it and then they take him on the same place but the first thing to do we have the deceased he's got his clothes on what should we do we have to remove his clothes can we remove his clothes now we can't because then we will look at his hour so what should we do we should cover his hour from the navel to the knees now sometimes you may bring a piece of cloth that is this long this is not recommended because the mirror you do this everything is going to be exposed so it has to be quite long from the sides okay what do we do next no why waste money we try to remove the clothes depending on how soft his limbs are so if it is soft and it's possible we have to take off his clothes most the times it's a little bit stiff and it's very hard to bend the arms or so in this case we tear the clothes starting from the sleeves are you going to do it for freedom and likewise and take off all of his clothes bearing in mind it is no this is wrong see what you've done you've exposed the body so you have to all the time do this your eyes are not looking because you don't want to expose the body all the time looking up and washing and doing and you don't need to look and you have to be real discreet because this is something that our religion extremely takes care of we removed all of his clothes so what do we do now first thing we have to if i if i want to make wudu and i have to answer the call of nature's nature which one i do first first thing i answer the goal of nature so we have to clean his stomach and make sure that there's nothing coming out wash his private parts and clean it and then we start with the hosuh so is this in the sunnah no the sunnah says wash him so if we start by washing him and cleaning him and ensuring nothing is coming out this does the job but there is an etiquette stated by the scholars it is not a must but this etiquette has been practiced and proven to work so the first thing now of course this brother is alive if he wasn't alive you will see the limbs are relaxed and you can tell this shows he's alive even if he's asleep this is how his foot is going to be once he's dead all loosened up so we will start by cleaning his stomach and this is done by making him sit halfway not all the way and gently pressing on his stomach you can press with your palm or you can press with your arm not with your elbow with your arm yes gently going downwards and this makes whatever is not clean coming out if there's something to be released it will be released and then we bring the water so that we can remove all of this and we clean the private parts cleaning the private parts is done by separating the legs of the deceased and again without looking from underneath he goes and cleans the front and the back side of the private parts and he washes it thoroughly the water is expensively thrown so that anything that is there goes and it doesn't leave an impact on you as washing you try your best to wash thoroughly without looking now i've seen everything huh because he has lifted it highly the cover should not be lifted so even if he does this it's covered no one can see from this side point of importance who can attend this can i do this no no no no can i wash the body in an open place and people from the balconies and throwing flowers [Music] nor his son because the relatives can't stay and say i want to watch my father in my brother no you have nobody if you're not involved in the process so two would do three would do more than that it would what do i do with the cloth that i change about the part okay i get rid of it i like it and i put it in a plastic bag along with the things that have been hold on bear in mind that i use the left hand in islam we use the right time for honorary things for eating for drinking or giving things for saving things left hand is used for things that are not so honored now we begin before washing the body also we take a look at his fingernails if they need flipping it's too long we glitch him we took take a look at his mustache if it's too long we cut it we take a look at his armpit if it's too long we either it or if it's difficult we save it before we go on it is extremely important to know that these are things from the they either are mandatory or highly recommended for flipping the nails the prophet gave us 40 days and others say that not necessarily i wait for 14 days sometimes i may flip them after 10 days because they are excessively small that's the day of the day before i don't remember i i would pray and the brother next to me was praying with this [Music] they have you the master of all men from allah this is not something"
