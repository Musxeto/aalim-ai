  "title": "Niqabi women justify going to a Mixed Gym by saying ‘deeds are judged by intentions’",
  "transcript": "yaakov from turkey says that there are nowadays a lot of mixed gems and we find sometimes brothers who are practicing working out there we find sisters who are wearing the niqab practicing and working there so when we talk to them they say innam that deeds are judged by intention and this is a grave misconception that a lot of the muslims have due to the whispers of shaytan they're not breaking the rules they're just merely bending them the hadith is totally authentic and correct that deeds are judged by intention but you have to govern this hadith with another hadith where the prophet says whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it is rejected both together we come to a good conclusion so if someone says to me sheikh i'd like to go to the night club i said why he says well i'd just like to see someone who's alone maybe invite her to a drink or to dinner someone who's beautiful blonde blue eyes and chit chat and invite her to islam i'm just interested in calling to islam this is totally prohibited because what you're doing is not part of the religion it's against the religion to find a woman wearing and the proper islamic dress in a mixed gym working out maybe being trained by a personal trainer who's a man wearing shorts and like his 6'4 from brussels full of muscles as they say and she says i'm wearing my neck up but what about what you're looking at such as i'm doing cross fit and what do you mean by crossfit don't you have to bend and carry this truck wheel or do this or pull or lay on your stomach or hang uh do pull-ups and people can see your physique can see your butt your your body shape your curves as they say even if you're wearing such hijab being there with the men does it befit a woman let alone any hobby does it befit the hadith of the prophet saws where he said the best row of men is the first and the worst row of the men is the last and this is in the masjid and the worst row of the women is the first and the best role of women is the last what does this tell you you have to stay away from men so if there are no segregated gems don't go to such places you"
