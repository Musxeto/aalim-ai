  "title": "Giving Protection to NonMuslims ALL started with a WOMAN ? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Now, in the second year of Hijrah, in the Battle of Badr, Abu Al-As was captured for the first time. Four years later, on the sixth year of Hijrah, he was captured again. This time, he was in a caravan going to trade with Syria. When he and his wealth, they were abducted by the soldiers of Allah. When he came to Medina, he managed to seek refuge in his ex-wife because they were separated for four years due to difference of religion. And she heard that, Zainab, and after Fajr prayer, she announced in the Masjid, my name is Zainab, the daughter of Muhammad, and I give refuge to Abu Al-As Ibn Rabir. So the Prophet, peace be upon him, was shocked. And he said to the people, by Allah, this is the first time I know of this. I have no knowledge of it at all. So if you see it fit to send him with what he came with, that's up to you. As for seeking refuge, the minimum of the Muslims can give protection and refuge to anyone. So it was a first where a woman comes and gives protection to a non-Muslim, and Muslims all abide by this pledge of protection given by a woman. So the Prophet, peace be upon him, gave him his trade and money. Nothing was missing. And he dispatched him to Mecca. Once he reached Mecca, he gave everybody their money and their wealth and the trade. And he took all that was deposited with him and gave it back to the people. And then he said to them, have I missed anyone? And they said, no, may Allah reward you. You have given us everything that we have entrusted you with. Then he said, if this is the case, then I bear witness that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad, peace be upon him, is his messenger and servant. I did not want to embrace Islam before this time so that you wouldn't say that I kept something for myself or I did not return the money to you. As of now, I am a Muslim. And he went back to Medina, migrating to the Prophet, peace be upon him. When the Prophet saw him, peace be upon him, he was happy. And he gave him his wife back without a new contract, without a new dowry. And this is a ruling in fiqh, which is when two couples, when a couple who are non-Muslims, one of them, usually the wife, accepts Islam and she is obliged to leave her husband. She cannot live with a kafir, with a non-Muslim. But if she left him for a year, for five, for ten years, without getting married, and after that he became a Muslim, and they wanted to go back again in marriage, they can without any marriage contract, according to this story. you"
