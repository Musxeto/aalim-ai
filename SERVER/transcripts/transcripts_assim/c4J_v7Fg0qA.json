  "transcript": "my question is if does someone um have to say exactly what they want and so as an example if they want a car a house Etc but they ask Allah um just grant me um blessings in this life would that be sufficient or do you have to say exactly what you want what first of all we have only one Lord in this universe and that is Allah if we don't ask for our needs specifically from him who will we ask it from so there's no Pro there's no problem in saying oh Allah I need this car oh Allah I need you to help me buy a house oh Allah I need a better job I need an increment I need a raise I need this I need that there's no problem with that but the problem is in going into details oh Allah I need a car with a sunroof and a panoramic uh um this and that and it has to have a supercharged engine an all wheel drive Pro preferably a a Quattro what are you what are you doing this is too specific this is transgression in Dua make a general Dua of a specific thing and that would do the job inshallah and Allah Knows Best"
