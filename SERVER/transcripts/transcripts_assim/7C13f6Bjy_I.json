  "transcript": "leah was telling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters departed on the SONA he gave he be screaming after no more Amish well senior to me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome to contemporary Islamic issues on Hoda TV I'm your host are commercially in this episode we will be continuing our conversation from our episode on westernization last episode we looked at the reasons behind the Muslim communities and societies taking Western principles and ideologies and we spoke about the different ideologies that we can take from the West such as in terms the West so I wanna start off by welcoming and introducing my guests to you chef awesome Allah Hakim a cinematic when welcome to the show party come sit down what I hoped Allah and zeppola her for having me oh yeah come it's always a pleasure to have you on so in the last episode you know we have we've answered many questions very interesting as well we spoke about when the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said not to imitate the non-muslims how do we look at this hadith how do we extract from this hadith how do we apply it to our lives and we've answered many questions and we went through the understanding of the hadith now obviously we want to sort of counter any sort of negative effect that we said there's there's different types of effects of westernization some it's not necessary everything Western is bad everything Western is evil there's good as well but we said that the things that affect our religion this is what we don't take and this is what we need to counter so how can we start countering this first of all miss muhammad hamdi Laos or to someone else with 11-second that to counter something you have to first of all have full knowledge of it and its impact so to counter it without knowing the influence of westernization on your culture your religion to counter it without knowing the impact on the society on the people will be in vain it has to be studied thoroughly by scholars by social workers by reformers in to have a clear view of it and its negative impact on Islam and then you can lay down a number of measures that may help in correcting this of course the idealistic way of counter attacking it is following Islam and this is a very broad term following Islam is not easy it is something that requires knowledge it requires implementing Islam in our life in every single aspect of it and this is not easy just to say it you have to walk the talk also in order to counter-attack it you have to fix your own inner soul and this is for the population for the Muslims for the masses the Muslims nowadays as we've discussed that earlier are under the influence of the media and they feel vulnerable they feel weak they feel inferior they have lots of fear and intimidation I get a lot of questions from sisters saying can we take off the hijab we feel that everybody's looking at us what her job actually is made to prevent people from looking at you so now we're intimidated because of the Paris attacks because of these will continue till the day of judgement and I do sincerely believe that these attacks are not done by Muslims especially when we read the reports that one of the girls in the in the attack one of the attackers was a woman going to clubs and partying and having fun has nothing to do with Islam and some of them were drug dealers or drug addicts etc these are not for you Muslims so we get questions like this saying that we're intimidated we are we don't we want to blend in and this is one of the effect of westernization how to counter-attack it or how to counter it is by fixing our inner soles by feeling proud of our religion of what we're practicing by having this conviction that we are following the truth the religion of Allah we're complying with what Allah has ordered us once we have this in us in ourselves once we purify our souls then that would help a lot also to purify our minds of the so many misconceptions that I have infested it so we have to think logically think realistically and not go to extremes in doing measures that would not be approved by Allah or the prophets of Allah send them so by fixing the way we think now some people would think that to counter westernization I have to be rough with the disbelievers look down at them curse them slit their throats do things that have no relationship to Islam no follow your prophet are they so some how did he treat the Jews and the Christians oh he used to spit on them no this is wrong wrong answer the Prophet erased a lot of Sarah used to treat them well but he would not go down to degrade himself artists or some or Islam he would not feel inferior to them he always had the upper hand when they invited him he would attend their invitation there's no westernization in this because he went as a Muslim being proud of being a Muslim and no compromise in my religion a June woman invited him to eat at her place he went with his companions accepted the invitation so it shows you how the Prophet as I'm used to treat the Jews and the Christians I'd even had him was a Christian was wearing a big cross he did not have anything to do with the bling-bling's it was just a cross that they like the Catholics and the Orthodox use he went and the prophetess I'm hosted him in his house gave him a couch and a cushion to lean on and he said to him id removed this Idol from your chest this is shirk so he's inviting him to Islam into his house so you have to have the balance between the two extremes also as stated earlier that with knowledge with purifying your soul purifying your mind and logic and removing the misconceptions Muslims have a lot of misconceptions that call them to compromise they think that all my religion is maybe not correct in this aspect so I have to compromise I have to follow them rather than follow my religion this is not the fault of Islam this is a fault of that person's understanding and the misconceptions that he allowed to grow rather than go and ask the people of knowledge to clarify it for them very interesting a question that came to my mind sure was you said that the Prophet SAW Sodom attended you know when he was invited by non-muslims to their houses now this brings a couple of questions actually but I'll bring it down to one or maybe two in charla the first being that why do you think it's so widespread amongst Muslims that you know we can't go to a non-muslims house if he invites us we can't invite them over we need to you know separate ourselves in society from them why is this misconception here and is this an Islamic principle at all if the Prophet SAW son of himself went to these invitations you've answered it what you need me Fe now I'm saying what brings what brings this I and I know I'm just saying that the answer is in the question the reason that ignorance had they known that the Prophet done had done this they were thought to themselves that whoops if the Prophet did it are we more Roman than the Romans do we know more than the Prophet as I said I'm definitely not so it is a defect in them due to their lack of knowledge now it is the way of the Prophet Isis I'm to invite them to his house it is the way of the Prophet awesome to even go to their places and to the gathering places in Mecca where they used to worship idols he used to go to their places and call them to Islam the intention is to call them to Islam the intention is to show them what Islam is not to be like them be with them and blend in as they say Lacombe Tilikum well Leah Dean you have your religion and I'll have mine there's no mixing here there is separation but at the same time it is wrong of the Muslims to totally isolate themselves from their neighbors and from their colleagues as it is also totally wrong to mix with them without any barriers and take them as close friends and allies more than the Muslims and be there confident more than the Muslims this is wrong so you have to strike the right balance again you know that's that's the beauty of Islam everywhere in every aspect we find that balance there now another thing that you've mentioned and that we spoke about actually was a lot that it affects the youth their westernization and I mean in our previous episode we spoke about the WWE and WUF wrestlers that come to the Arab world and you can see how excited the youth are you can say to you know be like these people such idolization you know how can we counter such idolization so that they want to become obviously education plays a big role in it but there has to be other things that we need to do in order for them to want to be like the Companions of the Prophet SAW sanam to be like you know the the pie for Emma to be like the Islamic idols and Islamic role models how can we establish this amongst the youth this is a very big question and unfortunately it's way above my pay grade see the problem is that it is not a one-man show this needs a collaboration of the whole society and our problem is that we do not have a common mission and vision each Institute or government entity works on its own the answer of your question has to be the full collaboration and cooperation of the Muslim government of the Muslim Institute's and of the Muslim families once you have this all together then you have an identity our problem is with first of all who allows them in the country what are the forces that are getting out of their way paying so much huge funding and money to bring them and what is their agenda definitely they have an agenda and it's obvious when you look at the youth and how they are brainwashed so would you like to eat your mom's local dish no our big the Allah would love to eat the begin the golden Ark or whatever they call it so the Western culture the food the the way they look looking and talked the t-shirts are wearing the lifestyle all of this is coming to invade and this is the purpose of westernization the same idea of the colonizing powers it is now refreshing and evolving long ago a couple of hundred years ago whenever they came to Kelowna lies a country everybody stood in their faces and they fought till the death there were freedom fighters defending their countries the West has realized that this does not work this way we have to shift the Muslims from green Muslims into puppets so they started to colonize them mentally rather than physically so you prepare them into loving your pop culture loving your movies loving your music loving the way of life and the standards of living once they love you then whenever you come and invade their country they themselves will open the doors for you and this is what I actually want to get into next replacing traditional Islam with a westernized version of Islam but before that we're going to go for a short break so stay tuned welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on Hooda TV now before we took that short break we were speaking about the westernization of Islamic thought and ideology and society and we said when we get back sure who we were gonna speak about replacing traditional Islam of the traditional form and understanding of Islam with a more westernize form and understanding of Islam the religion itself so before we actually get into this topic let's speak about the different types of westernization and then we'll get into this inshallah okay there are many different types of westernization unfortunately they creep in slowly till you may not notice it until it is becoming part of your life so for example we have the religious type of westernization and a lot of the Muslims and I'm shocked to say this and I'm sad to say it also I was shocked when I went to some of the GCC countries in the Gulf area being Gulf and some of the Muslim countries all over the Muslim world and you go there in the holidays Christmas and New Year's they're holidays not ours and you find a big Christmas tree in the middle of the mall in the middle of the hotel and Santa Claus playing on the piano in the hallway of the hotel where am i Aki and I'm in a church what is this this is a Muslim country all around us are Muslims but this type of religious westernization is firmly established in a lot of the Muslim countries unfortunately when it's Halloween you find people dressed in fit a trick-or-treat what is this every we're in the middle of Arabia you find them on the 14th of fab celebrating Valentine and people are wearing red and sending you postcards nobody sends me a postcard cause this is gonna do you get a mini postcard is that how may Allah protect Asahi again we laugh about it but it's sad this is what's happening in the Muslim world and they take this for granted you know celebrating the new year is Wow where there's nothing wrong in that you go to the political aspect and you find westernization firmly establishing its roots there the majority of Muslim countries Muslim countries abiding by the Quran and Sunnah are adopting the democratic process democracy's against Islam this goes without saying yes sure why it's Aslam has this and that and they start to bring few evidences and and and cut and paste from here and there just to prove to you that democracy is part of Islam elections and it is not and they say it's the rule of the majority the majority are laymen are sinners or fornicators we put this to the ballots ok make your vote shall we permit the selling of vodka in our grocery shops or not 9550 one says ok 4/9 is not ok Halas approved what what does Islam have to do with this so again westernization in the political system when you come to for example the linguistic aspects you go into any Arab country you fight for example my name is al Hakim and I have a shop that sells cars out Kollek we'll call it al Hakim motors motors why not the Arabic word for it cars what do I used the word motors as is as if it is or al-hakim coke or Hakeem asked establishment all of these show you that the the amount of westernization found in our culture in our countries you find big signs of Western names not Arabic names you'll never go to America and find a brand that is Arabic nobody would buy it so again you you fall into this kind of westernization westernization of the media now nowadays yeah I need 2025 laptop more forty years ago when it came to listening to music which is Haram we had one famous female singer by the name of uncle soon Egyptian Egyptian and everybody around the whole world who were not practicing used to listen to it she used to repeat the same verse like gazillion times and people say oh allah ma sha allah and they're so happy she wasn't beautiful she wasn't anything properly dressed not but this was the culture nowadays we opened the TV you see various types of video clips and different types of women dancing chanting or haram of course but it gives you a glimpse of the amount of westernization Muslims are having women in bedrooms with naan mahaan in the same bed inappropriately dressed what are you doing to the society you're showing them that this is ok it's ok for your sister to do this it's ok for your daughter to go out with a man and fall in love madly with and go to the beach and maybe get lucky or whatever all of this Haram but the media is the main driver behind westernization when they bring the culture in a beautiful way out and by the way it's not only westernization yeah it's even from the east from Japan from Korea do you know these cartoons the manager I think the cola magna oh the Magna whatever it's infiltrating the society kids love it what are you watching nowadays the deviant arab channels who are known to serve the US interests and the european interest in changing the culture and the religion of the muslims they are and they first introduced the Mexican soap operas but in Arabic so even if you don't understand the culture itself is there in your own language then they introduced the Turkish soap operas lots of nudity lots of premarital relationship lying etc and now they have the South Korean soap operas what is this are you have you failed in producing your own filthy Arab soap operas no we can but this is part of the plan part of the strategy lose yourself lose your entity and identity and then we can manipulate you in any which way we want okay so I mean after going through these various types of westernization let's dive a little bit into replacing traditional form of religion itself so not culture not society I mean we spoke a lot about this let's speak about the religion itself a more westernized or lenient way of the religion Islam okay yep see again this brings us back to the issue of moderation now the westernization when it comes to religion it gives you an alternative to real hardcore Islam if you want to call it the thing that comes from an and from the Sunnah and which people label us as part of discrediting us by saying fundamentalist yeah we are fundamentalist we go back to the fundamentals of Islam Quran and Sunnah it's not a man-made religion this is from Allah so it's divine so now we go to places like the US and we find that there are speakers who have under the social pressure under the pressure of the media have given in and surrendered some of them even raised the white flag of saying okay I'm not gonna portray Islam as Islam I'm gonna try to forge and make something that would be called an American Islam so mixing men and women no problem some of that that is even come with his guitar and says that music is allowed I love music what is this and he's a diary so called dye one of the celebrities has no problem in being the special advisor to George W Bush and he's a a daddy or a scholar or whatever you call him and he's a well-known super Sufi so this kind of westernization is deeply rooted and based in these people because of their distance and living away from Muslim societies Muslim communities real Muslim communities and not being close to scholars who understand Quran and Sunnah and this is one of the biggest problem is when you have such people in such an environment where people look up to them and say you're the best around so they think that we have to like shoot from the hip we have to improvise we have to do something I can say I don't know this is a big taboo now I know everything man ask me I'll answer you there is where they fall and fall drastically so this new trend of Islam you find a Muslim woman wearing a hijab covering only her hair but her neck her ears her may be part of her bosoms show no problem I've seen this in some Muslim countries I've seen women wearing the hijab but wearing tight blouses and skirts and some of them were trousers trousers that is whatever they called him and they're walking in the middle of the street what is this oh she's a hijab' woman hey job is this she's just covering her hair because she's probably bold or has an afro big afro that she's hiding not that because of her hair is beautiful it this shows you that they think that doing right thing I've seen in countries like Malaysia and not Malaysia but some in Malaysia some in Indonesia Muslim country with the with the largest Muslim population over 250 million and you find women performing wearing the hijab in Indonesia Idol or x-factor or all of these programs again serve as a tool of westernization what do the youth look at x-factor The Voice so you can think you can dance American Idol and the list goes on all of this is part of the invasion they are doing and the Muslim population are so relaxed and they're hibernating because of this all right thank you very much chef awesome we're at the end of our program here once again we've continued this topic and may Allah SWA Allah give us the ability to act upon what we preach here inshallah dear viewers I hope you guys benefited from today's program and until next time may allah subhanho wa taala bless us all assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Oh mohammed salameh Lee you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters departed on the
