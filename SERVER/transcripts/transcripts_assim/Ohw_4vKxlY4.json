  "title": "I was verbally abused",
  "transcript": "this first question he says that is it permissible to limit your conversation with a person who verbally abuses and because that person is older there is no one who can persuade that person to stop I usually opt for ignoring and for forgiveness and advise others to forgive too but this is getting worse over the years and I've forgiven for more than a decade Islam is a religion of Tolerance it is a religion of forgiveness yet it is not a religion of weakness so your forgiveness and tolerance they originate from your strength from your Iman and hence one should not humilate himself now in the case that fim is telling us about this issue is reoccurring in so many places and times people usually complain of elderly doing this and we've addressed this before and we said that reaching such an old age is a bless from Allah Asel however it is a menace if it is not accompanied by righteous deeds and good character and that is why the prophet said Alam the best among you are those who Allah prolongs their life and excels their uh uh moral character and at the same time they offer righteous and Good Deeds so the elders who fail to have good character with the youngsters they have a problem especially if this person is one of your next ofkin and mixing all the time with them is a big problem because they verbally abuse you and they har harm you or hurt you knowingly or unknowingly so the best thing to do is to minimize mixing up with them to the bare minimum and limit that to what Allah would not punish you for so instead of seeing them every day see them once a week instead of going to them and mix with them for 2 3 hours give them a call or just sit for 5 minutes and then apologize because you have an appointment by this you would have a win-win situation inshallah n says could you please tell me about the Muslim and his self-esteem a Muslim respects himself and he honors himself without going into arrogance yet not humilating himself so you have to have confidence in yourself you have to have a positive way of looking at things and all of this falls under the umbrella of thinking positively of Allah and seeking his guidance and seeking his uh uh support because so many times we hear people say have confidence confidence in yourself do this do that without relating it to Allah Asel and this is wrong WR because depending on yourself is something that is not acceptable in the Dua of the prophet he used to say oh who is all living the sustainer of the heavens and the Earth in your mercy I seek Refuge fix all of my Affairs and do not make me depend on myself not even for a glimpse do not depend on yourself depend on Allah Asel however when once you do this you should have confidence in Allah Asel and you should trust Allah subhana wa taala and you should uh uh respect yourself and not humilate yourself and not let people look down at you but without arrogance without prejudice you have to respect yourself and be honorable and not put yourself in situations where you will be humiliated as the prophet forbid us from doing such a thing and this happens when you respect yourself so people will respect you when you are a person who honors others they will honor you when you treat them in an Islamic fashion you don't lie you don't cheat you don't uh break promises they will respect you more and more and this would build your self-esteem rosain says what is the definition of utmost piety for a Muslim for a Muslim woman can we call this lady a Pious Muslim who keeps voluntary fasts offer tahajud memorizes the Quran covers herself properly tries her level best to lower her gaze can we call her a a righteous or a Pious woman all of the things mentioned here are but few of the characteristics of a Believer a ma a male or a female yet it is much more bigger and greater so all of these Good Deeds are good but they do not qualify a person to be a a true Pious person because you lack sincerity so to be Pious you have to have the first thing on your agenda is to be sincere all of your work has to be for the sake of Allah also you have to have moral conduct the prophet Alam was told about a woman who prays night prayers and fasts daytime but she abuses her neighbors she does harm to her neighbors the prophet said she is in hell even if if she prays well and she fasts well and she gives money to the poor but because her character is not good the prophet said she's in hell and in another Hadith the prophet said the closest he said the closest among you to me on the day of judgment in Paradise are the best in their moral conduct in their character in their ethics in their so the more you are in trying your level best to excel in your moral conduct in your ethics the closer you are to the prophet Alat therefore uh uh you have to know these characteristics and try to implement them in your your life try to have them and try to be known by them and then inshallah you will be among those who are part"
