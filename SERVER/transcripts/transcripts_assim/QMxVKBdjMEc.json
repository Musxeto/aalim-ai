  "transcript": "Farhan from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam wa'alaikumussalam Sir, last time my question was unanswered. My question is, is there any punishment for disrespecting books, money or food and if there is no punishment, is fearing that disrespecting these things might affect our future? For example, if I disrespect money, some people say that I might not get it. Is this fear shirk? Jazakum Allah Khair. Wa Jazakum. There is no prescribed punishment for disrespecting these things. So there is nothing in the Qur'an or in the Sunnah that says if you step on a $5 bill or if you push books of physics with your foot that you're going to be paralysed or you're going to skip dinner tonight. And if one says that, oh if I do this, something evil would happen, this is superstition. And it's not shirk. If you believe that these things could backfire and cause you harm, this is shirk. But if you're superstitious, this is also part of shirk. As Ibn Mas'ud narrated, may Allah be pleased with him, that attiyaratu shirk, wa ma minna illa illa anna Allah hayudhibuhu bittawakkul. Believing in bad omens is shirk and none of us is exempted from that. But Allah Azza wa Jal takes it away with tawakkul, with trusting and reliance on Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala."
