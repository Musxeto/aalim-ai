  "transcript": "Sidi from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? I'm fine, Alhamdulillah. How can I help you Sidi? If someone became overweight, not because he has this sickness, but he eats a lot and doesn't go to sport. And because of his overweight, he becomes much more lazier and he has more difficulty making ibadahs like prayer, where even some people they cannot even still standing in the prayer and they need to sit. And they get a higher chance to get sickness and illness. So because of such reason, does it become for such people mandatory to go to diet and make sport so they get more fit and get more healthier and get less lazier? Well, to answer your question Sidi, I would ask you a question. Are all fat people who do not watch their diet as you have described, yes or no? No, which means that it's not a well-known fact that 1 plus 1 equals 2 in these cases. I could be overeating, I could be lazy, I could be not working out, and I enjoy eating junk food, but I'm as fit and strong as a bull. And if needed, I could fight 6 or 7 people. While other skinny people who watch their diets and do the whole 9 yards simply can't do these things. And when they pray taraweeh, they feel pain and weakness in their knees and in the back and they have to sit. So this is not a fixed case. There were many companions who were overweight or at least a bit chubby and having a big belly. This did not deter them from fighting in the cause of Allah at wars and be gallant and brave and strong. So I cannot or no one can say, oh you're sinful for being overweight, you're sinful for not hitting the gym, you're sinful for not watching your diet. No. Would it be a recommended thing to do? Of course. Everyone is instructed and advised to take care of his health. Where did you get this from, Shaykh? From the hadith of Ibn Umar. May Allah be pleased with the man with his father. Take advantage of 5 before 5. Your health before your illness. Your youth before your old age. Your wealth before your poverty. Your spare time before being preoccupied. And another thing, I keep forgetting it when I translate it into English. So there are things that you should make the best of. Your health before your illness. Your youth before your old age. So many things now I wish I picked up years back so it would have continued with me today. Now I can't do them. I'm too old. Or at least I think I'm too old. So you have to do your level best. But would I grade others who are not doing it as sinful? No, of course not. This is not sinful and Allah knows best."
