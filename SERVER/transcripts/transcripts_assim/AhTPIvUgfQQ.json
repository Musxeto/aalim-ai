  "transcript": "[Music] we begin with the first chapter of and unlike other books the compiler of the of this book started and began immediately with going straight to the topic so he said may Allah have mercy on his soul chapter one The Oneness of Allah and then he began this chapter with a number of verses of the Quran so five different locations from the Quran different verses all revolving round the just to highlight to you an a simple example of the importance ofed and after that he followed it with a narration from the prophetic Sunnah sallam so he began with the Quran he concluded with the Sunnah of the prophet and then he listed a number of bullet points that any person could find out from these verses of the Quran and from the Hadith of the Prophet so let's go through in this session in some of these verses inshallah and let's see what time allows us to uh study the first Ayah Allah the almighty said and I created not the Jin and the men except they should worship me this Ayah clearly defines the purpose of our creation Allah did not create us to eat and drink and meate like animals Allah created us for a very higher purpose and reason and this reason is clearly identified Allah subhah wa taala says that he did not create us nor create the Jin except for the sole purpose of worshiping him and worshiping Allah is definitely not isolated in prayers fasting zakat Etc it is a wider scope and much much bigger picture so even your daily routine can be part part of worshiping Allah it depends on your intention it depends on how you perform it why you perform it and if you have the good intention behind it Allah says in the second Ayah and verily we have sent among every um that is every Community every nation umah has four meanings in the Quran one of them is a group of people and it can also refer to a period of time and it can also uh refer to a man who is one of a kind like ibraim peace be upon him and it can also refer to religion so in this Ayah and verely we have sent among every um among every Community Every Nation a messenger proclaiming worship Allah alone and avoid or keep away from andot is a name of anything that exceeds its limit so the idols that the people worship are considered to Bean is considered to be B and all those who call others to worship them like Pharaoh is also considered to be B so the essence that verely we have sent among every umah a messenger so what is the duty of messengers of Allah is to call people to worship Allah alone and to avoid all types of and the third Ayah Allah says and your lord has decreed that you worship none but him and that you be dutiful to your parents to the end of the AY so this Ayah of Surah is clearly states that Allah has decreed it and he Associated subhanahu wa ta'ala worshiping him alone without associating others with him alongside being beautiful to your parents which highlights the importance of respecting and being beautiful to your parents that Allah Asel combined these two great form forms of worship together but the essence of the Ayah that the compiler brought it in here is to highlight and your lord has decreed that you worship none but him these are three locations that we've gone through there are two more locations and the Hadith of and theith of jab so I hope inshallah and pray that next time we will be able to discuss some of that and until then I leave you"
