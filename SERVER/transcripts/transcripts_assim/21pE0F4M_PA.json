  "transcript": "zainab says what is the islamic view on psychology can we study psychology in university as a a major where did psychology come from it came from the disbelievers who do not have adeb who do not have zord who do not have islamic moral conduct in their lives so they don't have something to stem out from they don't have an origin or a source that they can gain things that d and that helps them deal with one another from so all what they depend on is their own intellect and previous studies so they made up this science psychology and if you study it you'll find that it is filled with nonsense with haram and few things that might be correct it happens so attributing everything to sexual desires segment freud everything is related to a child's relationship to his mom and suckling and a girl her relationship to her father and the sexual uh uh organs etc and the subconscious all of this is lots of baloney and this is not part of islam and hence it is needed for us as muslims not to be deviated from our religion allah azza had guided us had sent us the quran as a proof as light had sent us the sharia to be guided so who was ever guided then he's guided for himself and whoever goes astray then he will go astray upon him own self therefore we must not study such sciences that would put us in danger the prophet alice islam once saw umar may allah be pleased with him the second caliph the second in ranking in the muslim ummah and he was reading a paper from the torah the jews scripture so the prophet said what is this and he said it's a page from the torah the prophet was outraged and he scolded rumar and said to him after taking that paper away from him that even if musa peace be upon him was alive he would not have any other choice but to follow me so why leave the quran and leave my sunnah to read in such scriptures and this is rumor and the scripture is the torah what about if it's me and you and reading in the filth that came out of the brains of people who had nothing to think about except sex and the likes so definitely this is not permissible however due to the changing world and due to the fact that psychology may have something may have something that relates to current illnesses and diseases that we need to address therefore there's no problem with conditions to study it and that is that a person is well-founded in sound bases has sound bases in akida he knows his religion thoroughly he has knowledge of the quran the sunnah so when he studies such things it is filtered through his iman a normal person who just passed high school and goes to switzerland or goes to austria and studies psychology is definitely not qualified and he will come to be a mold he will come to be a virus among the muslims with his corrupt ideas that he learned and he could not filter because he had no means or knowledge to filter it unfortunately we have well-known renowned professors in psychology talking about things and relating it to islam and refuting scholars of islam saying yeah yeah but this is not true some of them even went into the psychology of the prophet and this is sort of hypocrisy when he says that i analyzed the personality of the prophet sam he was depressed here he needed this no next time you go and say give him a prozac pills maybe it would fix what is this all of this is definitely on islamic and such people should be banned from speaking especially when it deals with the prophet hassam or with islamic teachings when they don't have the proper knowledge"
