  "title": "Legitimate reasons for crying during prayer - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says what are the reasons there are legitimate reasons that may allow us to cry well scholars say that crying out of the fear of allah is a legitimate reason crying out of remembering your sins or the torment that awaits you crying out of the love of allah azzawajal crying out of remembering something that is related to salah these are legitimate reasons sometimes a person is overwhelmed and he cries just because of passing thought about his late father and he cries these are okay providing they don't become too much so if someone ends up crying out of worldly matters that are not related to prayer because of loss of his job because of oppression because his spouse is abusing and and tarnishing his or her reputation and he remembers this and he's overwhelmed and he starts crying then he starts sweeping then he starts wailing this is not prayer anymore this went way overboard but tears that come out running nose feeling aggravated but still in the posture of salat this inshallah does not impact the salat"
