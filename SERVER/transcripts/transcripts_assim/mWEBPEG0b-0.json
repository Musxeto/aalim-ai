  "transcript": "foreign went into organizing medina and the relationship between the muslims and the non-muslims throughout his time in medina the people of mecca of quraysh the polytheists began to evaluate the situation and they discovered that this was not in their very best interest though those who were causing problems for them and were insulting their gods and idols were away and far from hearing what annoyed them yet they were a potential threat to the people of mecca and that is why they started by intimidating the peoples of medina they started sending them messages threatening them and telling them that it if they do not get rid of islam and the muslims that they will come with a very big army to annihilate them completely and they started correspondences with the head of one of the mushrik groups there and he was the famous obey abdullah and this man was not a muslim at the very beginning but after a while when he saw that the muslims are getting stronger and stronger he pretended of being a muslim becoming in accepting islam and he was the head of the hypocrites the people of mecca wrote to abdullah and abdullah accepted the threat and he gathered his companions the non-muslims and they wanted to go and attack the muslims and have a war with them the prophet salaam knew about this so he himself took the initiative and went to talk to these people coming to wage war against the muslims and he told them is this the best you can do the people of quraish would not have dreamt that you would actually go and kill your own brothers and sons because the muslims were among them all and there had not been one single house without followers of islam so by coming in and trying to fight islam you're actually trying to fight your own family your own brothers and and sons so with this wisdom with this nice way of logicing them they accepted it and they dispersed alhamdulillah also at the time the tribe of the people of mecca used to have their correspondences with the jews of medina and they were also threatening them that if they do not get rid of the muslims if they do not stop cooperating with prophet muhammed that they themselves will come and destroy them all together now you have to remember these intimidations and these threats were from the people of quraish they are used to intimidating the muslims they've been doing it for the past 13 years now the situation is different because for the past 13 years the muslims were ordered by allah not to attack not to fight they were ordered to be patient and try their level best to stay alive but they are not to move into to the offensive side when they went to medina this was obligated and they were instructed to fight in self-defense only those who fight them unfortunately nowadays the trend among lots of the people who call others to islam is the defensive side so they say no we do not attack except those who attack us we just defend ourselves and this is true in normal circumstances and this was the case at the time of the prophet allah in medina but but on a later stage that was also obligated and it was mandatory and obligatory for muslims to fight those who stand against islam and who stand against the spread of the message of allah the all mighty and if you compare apple to apple you will find that we're not the first now look at all the other countries in this world that wage war against other nations and cross the atlantic and cross continents for what it's always justified as well it's always justified but from their point of view yes as we can see it's a matter of wealth and oil so whatever you however you try to justify it it's at the end of the day it's for your own benefit there are some who say all forms of fighting is not justifiable but if you took fighting out of human nature then actually the world will be quite corrupt because there are people who need to fight to survive in normal societies fighting is sometimes needed to repel evil people that that's completely true and nothing would explain this better than the biography of the prophet and the seer of the prophet now people usually wage wars in order to get more room more land in power and power political reasons economical reasons this was definitely not the case in islam people in islam were not forced to convert to islam and whenever you find a battle of the muslims against the non-muslims you would find that it was not politically motivated it was not for financial reasons it was for a simple and just cause and that is to spread the word of islam also i believe islam also has uh more in its agenda when it comes to fighting it's it's also to suppress the outskirt of evil in society and islam is a you can say a group of humanity who fights for humanity without them actually realizing that because without islam in his presence most society would not understand the level of you know religion towards god and his duties okay but this is also an issue of relativity because what you see evil i may not see it to be evil so someone would bring up the allegation of saying well this is not evil to me you're trying to force me to do something that is not evil to me well islam has values and has principles and these values and principles are common among all humans now you do not come to a person who is addicted to intoxicants and try to logic him with or against intoxicants he will not be unbiased on the contrary he will always take side to what he is consuming so when you are talking about islam always try to talk about the common grounds between you and that person you're talking with and don't touch the things that he's not ready to get rid of and that is why if you look at the wars and battles that the prophet salallahu sallam took part in you will find that it was not political it was not economical and it was only for the spread of islam in the sense that this nation is a non-muslim nation islam comes to it and say you have the choice to be ruled and governed by islam in the sense that the islamic law should be applied you live your own life you don't have to fight you don't have to protect yourself we will do that for you in return of a certain percentage of the income of the land but if you convert if you revert to islam as an incentive the land is yours you rule yourself by yourself so it is not for political gain it's not for the the gain of land and more territory it's only to get the people out of worshipping idols into worshipping the one and only god subhanahu ta'ala allah and this is exactly what took place with the prophet he at that time was instructed to spread the word of islam the word of allah azza throughout the whole world and always pay attention to the fact that no one was forced to revert to islam if he wanted the prophet saw assalam could have either killed all the jews and the non-muslims or they revert to islam but the choice was there you have the choice you want to stay embraced to your own religion you have the choice to do so so it tells you that it is not if you're not with us you're against us no you have the freedom to worship allah to worship your uh to to to practice your religion if you're not a muslim but do not come against islam and that is why the prophet salallahu salaam started by signing treaties with those who were surrounding him he started signing treaties with the jews he's signed treaties with the uh pagan tribes around medina simply a treaty of understanding that we do not attack you and you do not attack us we do not assist others in attacking you and you also do the same you practice your religion and we practice ours the prophet fought many salallahu as we will come inshallah to mention but all these battles were at the side of allah and that is why it's mentioned in surah 4 verse 76 allah says those who believe fight in the cause of allah and those who reject faith fight in the cause of evil whatever islam calls for you would always find it on the positive side no one would say well islam wants to take your money take your wealth islam wants to take your lives islam wants to bring justice to humanity and this is exactly what was manifested in the battles of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam i believe that we have a short break so stay tuned and inshaallah we will be right back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you'll be muslim for 50 years or five minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day i've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people that are muslims we want to serve allah almighty with all our hearts in this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve allah we'll have studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk at hooder.tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you going back to the battlefield of the prophet we discussed before the break that all the battles of the prophet sallam and of muslims were not politically motivated nor financially they were not to gain more territory they were only to spread the message of islam and i believe you have a comment on that muhammad yeah basically you have explained the motives uh like the muslims only allowed or allowed to fight in sick of allah only what about the way which muslims they are controlled to use or basically like do we have rules in islam control over the way which we fight so we have to be stick with this with these rules and we are not allowed to pass the limit okay well this is a good question but unfortunately to answer it we would require us to move into more or less but in principle in islam we do have rules of engagement in the sense that we are not allowed to kill elderly we are not allowed to kill civilians we are not allowed to kill women or children and in one incident the prophet sallallahu alaihi passed by a woman who was in the battlefield who was killed so he was outraged and he said who dared to kill this woman who should not have been killed women are not to be killed in battlefield so they've explained to him that she was carrying arms against them so she was killed in self defense if they did not kill her she would have killed some of the muslims so this was acceptable and also forbidden in islam to kill discriminately so throwing a bomb at civilians in order to kill one soldier is not acceptable and that is why we understand and every muslim worldwide we we we have like what one point uh five six two billion muslims worldwide every single child of them know that it is forbidden for us to kill children and women and that is why when someone says that well muslims are responsible for the 911 or for the 7-7 and i don't know what our more numbers are they're bringing maybe two fives or whatever whatever something of of a terrorist activity takes place they claim and blame the muslims this is an islamic we don't have to go out of the way to to say that whoever did this that has nothing to relate to islam because it's in black and white we do not kill discriminately we do not attack children or women it's forbidden for us to demolish or attack houses or places of worship churches and synagogues and so on it's forbidden for us to kill priests and and monks and so on this is in black and white so to say or to claim that islam is responsible for terrorist attacks this is unacceptable our prophet told us allah not to do these things so whoever disobeys him he's not considered to be a practicing muslim also part of the rules of engagement in islam is that you do not torture you do not mutilate uh uh uh prisoners so if you have a person who died in the battlefield a non-muslim you cannot come and chop off his ear or nose just of sort of mutilation this is unacceptable in islam and we will go through this inshallah when we mention the battles that took place between the muslims and the non-muslims can i just say that obviously you know whatever muslims do around the world uh people you know have to have understanding that human beings are rules are not made to be broken but there are people who will break them that's why there's boundaries and you know when something is in the name of islam it should not always be demonized as islam because muslims are human beings it's not like a group of angels that's making this religion i i completely agree with this because you cannot blame an individual you cannot blame a whole sect or whole religion for the doings of an individual i cannot come and say well all christians are terrorists because timothy mcfay blew up the building in oklahoma and he is a christian so this means that all christians are terrorists i cannot say that all christians are terrorists because of the doing of the ira for example in in ireland and claimed that all christians are the same or the terrorists in the basque region in spain or the the doing of uh the zionists i cannot say that all jews are bad because of the doing of the giant of the zionists and so on so it is extremely wrong to generalize this labeling thing by taking the bad action of an individual and try to generalize this on the whole group no it's this is not the case in islam you are told and instructed to behave in a certain pattern if someone comes and does otherwise this is his fault not the fault of the religion itself now going on forward there were battles between the muslims and the non-muslims and in seerah which is the arabic word for the biography of the prophet they have a distinction between syria so usually they call syria is the regiment or the company or the squadron or the detachment that went out of medina without the presence of the prophet so they would call this sariya but while the razwa or the battle would have the prophet allah within the army now the minute the prophet saws set foot in medina and established the masjid and started organizing things he started sending these attachments or squadrons of medina to do certain tasks and also he himself went out on a number of battles and that was for three main reasons as the scholars say the first reason was to threaten the route of trading between mecca and the sham area which is syria lebanon jordan and palestine so the prophet sallam wanted to threaten the root from mecca to the sham area because this was their trav the training route they had a training route from mecca to yemen in the winter time and they had a a route from mecca to al-sham region on the summer time they had two trips as mentioned in the quran it was safe the journey of winter and the journey of summer so this was one the main reason to threaten their economic economical uh ties and benefits the second reason for these uh convoys attachments and and battles were to sign treaties with the tribes surrounding medina because at the end of the day you did not have the a wax or surveillance systems that allow you to know who's coming to attack you so you had to had such a system to protect yourself and to protect your people so he used to send his attachments to sign treaties with these tribes of for protection and for allegiance and we have to know that these tribes had their strong ties with the people of mecca because all the idols they worshipped were centered in mecca and the tribe of quraish had the upper hand over all the other tribes because they all respected them being the custodian of the kaaba which was built by the messenger of allah abraham so it had its historical roots it had its prestige that is why the prophet salallahu wanted to ensure that he was safe among the politist tribes surrounding him so that he would have his back covered and also the third reason for these battles and and attachments and squadrons and so on was to show the jews the power of the muslims now being oppressed for 13 years migrating to this new land and establishing a new system some may have the idea that the muslims are weak they didn't do anything to defend themselves and to defend the weak when they were in makkah so they may feel encouraged to attack them so the prophet had to show them his power he had to flick some muscles to show them that listen muslims are not weak they're peaceful but they're not weak so that was the main reason behind these convoys to uh the people around medina and to threaten the economical benefits of the quraysh sometimes is seen by what you can say non-religious people that that religion tolerates the fact that you must be abused and oppressed because religious people tend to be people who forgive easily and try to let things go but i find in islam a concept which is very protective by nature because it allows you to be religious and at the same time when it's called for have honor have respect and stand for what you believe in that's true you in islam it's levels the top level is if someone assaults you if someone does you harm or does you wrong that you forgive and this shows that you have the upper hand the second level is to stand up for yourself and to do to the aggressor what he did to you so by example if someone slaps me on the face the upper hand would be to forgive him and he would feel really small of course if he slaps me again and a third time then it's about time that i stand up for myself because then he's gonna step all over me but in normal cases if someone swears at me says bad things about me the good thing is to forgive him for the sake of allah not because i'm weak i can defend myself i can cause him more harm but this is allah's intention to purify my heart but if i do not forgive i may take what's mine without any aggression so if he slash me on the face i slap him in the face and do not add another slab to that one by one and and so on the topic can go on and on but unfortunately that this is all the time we have for today's program inshaallah if we have time next time we meet we'll try to elaborate a little bit more on the issue and until then um oh hmm hmm"
