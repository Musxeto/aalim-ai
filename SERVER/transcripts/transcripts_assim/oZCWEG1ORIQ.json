  "transcript": "Arshad from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatu I am often scared of death like my heart beats fast and become dizzy. I am asking Dua to Allah and seeing your videos on YouTube made me brave like you uploaded like pre-destiny when Allah said to the pen and I am getting thought like what will happen in my old age like this thought I will get or not and I am very scared of the grave punishment. Since when have you been scared from dying? Arshad Arshad Yeah Arshad No, no, no since when have you been afraid of dying? Since when? How many months? How many months? Like 6 months. Okay, have you died? No Arshad So is this logical? 6 months you are terrified of dying and you did not die. What if you live another 20 years? Are you going to waste your 20 years being afraid of something that will happen inevitably when Allah decrees it? It is insane. You have problems up there because your date of death and mine has been already pre-destined and it can't be one minute early or one minute late. Whether you worry about it, whether you bang your head against the wall every day, whether you throw yourself, nothing is going to change. You will die when Allah has pre-ordained it. Therefore be content, live a life of beauty, enjoy every moment you can on earth with those who love you. Feel motivated, be positive in your work as if you are going to live for eternity. Be content with the fact that I might die in 5 minutes. So what? But if I don't, I'm enjoying these 5 minutes instead of wasting my time weeping and, excuse my French, bitching and whining. This is not the right approach for a Muslim to deal with it and Allah knows best."
