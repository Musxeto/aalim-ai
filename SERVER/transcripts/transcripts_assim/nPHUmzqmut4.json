  "transcript": "m ald last time we discussed the Battle of and how the prophet Alat wasam with the grace of Allah managed to Siege all these fortresses of the Jews and Conquer The Village of kber and also we discussed that the small village of fedak where a group of Jews were there the prophet wasallam went to them and out of Terror and fear they themselves asked the prophet s wasallam to have an agreement with him without the need of fighting and they agreed on giving half of whatever their Farms produced to the prophet Alat wasam afterwards the prophet went to what is known as and it's a valley where Jews and few Arabs used to live there the prophet went to them as they also collaborated with the pothy in attacking Medina and undermining the efforts of Muslims to spread the dawa the prophet am surrounded them but despite the fact that news came from all the Jews that the prophet wasam was always Victorious despite the news that came from kber with all its might and power with all its brave Soldiers yet it fell in the hands of Muslims despite all of this they were still defiant they would not surrender so the minute the Muslims approached them they started throwing them with arrows and The Archers managed to kill one of the prophet's servants and his name was mam so someone threw him with an arrow and killed him the companions said mashallah praise be to Allah the Almighty he is in Paradise now he was the servant of the Prophet Alam and he died as a martyr in fighting the Jews so this is what was apparent to them yet the prophet told them sallallahu alaihi wasallam that this man the jacket or the coat or the dress that he took from the boot of that was not yet distributed is burning on his body in his grave the man though he was a servant of the Prophet Alat wasam when Allah granted to his Prophet usually no one is allowed to take anything from the booty or from the treasures they put their hands on until the ruler distributes it evenly on the army so this man Madam he took this jacket or rope without being distributed before the ruler that is the prophet gathered the booty and distributed it to the fighters and this by itself is considered to be stealing stealing treason though he may think that he has right because he fought but still he went out of the way of the Muslims and that is why he will be punished for that in his grave it was not enough that he was the companion of the Prophet Alat it was not enough that he was the servant or he died as a martyr this was something that he had to be punished for after the Muslims heard this everyone started taking out of his belonging what he took before distribution of the booties and everyone that returned something the prophet Sall wasallam told him this would have been in Hell on you if you had not returned it so whoever brought shoes he would say shoes of fire but alhamdulillah you've returned it so now you are saved when they surrounded they came out requesting duels so the first man who came Zu fought with him and killed him so they they sent another Knight another Soldier zuam killed the second one a second person and every time they kill someone the prophet Sall wasallam keeps on asking them to accept Islam he's calling them to Islam we're not here for the money just accept the word of Allah the almighty or Surrender but you don't have to fight and they still thought that they can manage and do the things that no one before them had succeeded in doing after the first two men 11 men came out one by one but this time they were all killed by Ali AB Talib on his own so the third one came he killed him the fourth one came he fought with him and killed him and escaping without being injured not even a scratch and between every killing the prophet kept on asking them to come to their senses and accept Islam 11 men were killed The Siege took place the full day the following day just before noon they were out of breath and they surrendered to the prophet Alat the prophet and his companions entered their fortresses and they gained with the grace of Allah a lot of money and treasures and again the prophet s wasallam dealt with them as he dealt with the people of kber and he agreed that they work on their lands providing that that they sent half of what the Earth produces to Medina up north there was also a village by the name of T and it was occupied by Jews but it was a bit further and as the prophet was planning to go to them an invoy came from them telling the prophet wasallam you don't have to come we surrender and we will give you half of what we produce from our lands and the prophet wasam wrote an agreement with them that there will be no betrayals there will be no deception we will be uh uh on on equal terms in the sense that we will not attack you and you will not collaborate on the Muslims alhamdulillah everything was fine and acceptable on the way back from kber to Medina it was night time so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and his companions set camp and the prophet wasallam as usual asked who among the companions would guard us and wake up wake us for fer prayer so B said I'll do that oh prophet of Allah and they all went to bed because you know after fighting for so long after traveling for so long all what you're looking look for is a place to sleep in and immediately one falls out of being fatigued and tired goes to sleep directly not knowing what's going on they have to take some rest they have to rest so B kept watching for his companions and he was their guard one man one man but more than enough because if he sensed any movement M he would have walked them and as he was watching or or as he was on his watch he leaned a little bit to the back to a camel and before knowing he fell asleep and everybody was asleep until the sun was in the middle of the sky they woke up due to the heat of the sun and the first one to wake up was the prophet Alam and said bil he woke B up what is this and bil said in asking the pardon of the Prophet Alam he said by Allah oh prophet of Allah who made you sleep made me sleep I couldn't hold myself so the prophet Sall wasallam instructed them to move on and he told them that this camp that we set in is a place where Satan was was present so let's move on and they moved to another place and then they prayed Al and they made it up and this tells us that whenever a person falls asleep and misses a prayer this means that Satan was there therefore if he wants to make up for that prayer he should change the room change the location and this also indicates to us that if this is the case in the wilderness while while the prophet wasam was on his way to Jihad and it was not intentional so how would we say to those who intend not to pray fuder on time like those who set up uh uh their alarm clocks to go off at an hour or more after fuder prayer so that they can attend their college or attend their work of course they are sinful for doing this and likewise a person should not pray in places where Satan is always present as in the case when a place is surrounded by statues and and portraits and uh uh uh pictures a person should avoid praying in an area or in a room of such description and he should also uh try to avoid praying in places where music is played or things that do not please Allah the almighty because again the presence of Satan is there and whenever Satan is in a place or whenever the devils are in a place Angels do not uh uh be present the angels of Mercy the angels that ask Allah for forgiveness for the Believers and so on I believe we have a short break so stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back we are excited to inform our viewers that the Quran in depth with shikh ibraim zidan will be

1800 GMT until 1900 GMT for the Quran in depth and welcome back the prophet sallallah Al wasallam with the grace of Allah is back in Medina and over the following few months he he kept on sending small military detachments to the tribes of gfan and nud Ned in general just to cool them down and to flex the muscles of the Muslims showing them that they are not weak and they're not asleep they're present so now alhamdulillah he got the side and the front of the Jews secured he got the front of the pothus in Mecca secured and gfan it's almost stable KFAN themselves the tribe of gfan it was not very enthusiastic in launching more attacks because they suffered a lot and they found out that Islam was prevailing so they cooled it a little bit and calmed the situation when it was the 11th month of the Islamic calendar of the seventh year of Hijra it was the time for for the prophet wasam as agreed with the poist of qur that he comes and performs his omra as you remember a year earlier he was prevented from entering Mecca and that caused the Muslims along with the pothus to sign an agreement and a truce by the name of truce alud the prophet went with those who were prevented from performing omah last year and they all went to Mecca the prophet took with him 60 camels as form of sacrifice to Allah the almighty and this is known as Ali and these are camels that you take with you as a pilgrim as a pilgrim or a person performing omra and you indicate it with signs that this is for Allah only which means that when you reach your destination and you accomplish your worship whether it's pilgrimage or then you Slaughter this for the sake of Allah and you give it to the poor the prophet also took arms with him so the AR the the those who went for omra were also armed because he was not certain that the people of quray would not deceive him or betray him he was not sure that they would honor the agreement they had and he had few of his companions uh guarding the Army when the prophet went Sall wasallam they were all in all about 2,000 men now last year they were 1,400 and now the number has increased and they had children and they had women with them all going with the prophet alham to to perform omra just before he entered Mecca he they left all their arms in a place with guards over them and then they entered Mecca only with their swords as agreed with the people of quray the people of quray themselves did not want to be present in meah when the prophet entered it so they went on top of a mountain named by that overlooks the Kaa they went there and they observed the prophet Alam and his companions perform uh performing their om as the prophet entered the Masid theam abdah and do you know abdah he's one of the Poets of the Prophet Alat wasam the prophet had three three poets abdah and Malik and we will get inshallah to know's story he has a very important uh uh role and a story in the S we will come to that later on inshallah so abdah as they were entering the Masjid was chanting with poetry praising the victory that Allah has granted his prophet and uh ridiculing of the mush of the politist who are fighting and resisting something that cannot be resisted because it's from Allah may Allah be pleased with him tried to hush him because what are you doing we are in the Haram how do you say poetry in in the Haram area so the prophet Alam told Omar leave him let him continue because his poetry is harder and more effective in the pothy than throwing them with arrows as we know that this was their the influential form of media at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam I had the language which high level that time to a level that they used to make markets for it like share markets or and and they used to be like picky to a level that whenever they see they see or they read the Poetry which is very high they hang it up on the Kaa itself there to a form of appreciating uh that kind of poetry that that is true in the time of the Prophet Alam and 100 years earlier the language the Arabic has reached it Peaks it had reached the peak in eloquence and Beauty to the extent that they used to have annual markets like Ma and and so on where people would come and buy and sell but at the same time to say poetry and they used to have what is known to be as Al the thing that used to be hang out and they used to even hang it in the Kaa in the sense that it was so honored and beautiful appreciable yes they they they appreciated beautiful language and that is why when the Quran was revealed to the prophet Alat wasam they were astonished first of all because of its Perfection second of all because of the illiteracy of the Prophet Alat third of all because the prophet himself though he was with them 40 Years of his age he never said one poem in his life and he was not even known to be able to say poetry correctly without making a mistake which meant that as Allah described him in the Holy Quran that we had not teach we had not uh uh um teach him how to say poetry and he he should not be taught this is something that is beyond his capability to learn poetry because then it would be mixed up with the Quran and Quran had to be of its kind one of its kind so the testimony that uh that Quran or those words weren from him and even sometimes they were confused sometimes they said it's from J sometimes they said uh it could be from they tried they tried to their best to degrade the Quran so they said well these are all Revelations of the Jin it's something from from the devils and some some said that he was a priest others said that he was a poet and others said that he was insane but no matter what they said everyone who heard the Quran could not help but believing in in it and some of the companions came with a a cotton in their ears and the prophet asked them why are you doing this they and they say that they told us do not listen to him because he's a magician he's a sorcerer the minute you hear him you will follow him and some of them would say I'm a sane person I know poetry and I have my own uh uh uh intellect and intelligence I can I can decide what's right and what's wrong and the minute he heard the Quran he knew that it was not from this Earth and that it was divine the prophet Alat began his with his companions and as the pothus were looking overlooking uh uh the Kaaba and watching them they started talking among themselves that the Muslims came and they're weak and they're tired and the fever of Medina must have gotten them to the ground so now they have no power they are armless they are armless it's not the armor they're taking uh concern about they're talking about their physical condition so the prophet heard about this and he requested His companion to do what we call and this is showing your right shoulder and having your garment under your arm arm and over your left shoulder and he instructed them to walk in a fast manner like the Army uh uh uh do the first three rounds while going around the in and he said may Allah have mercy on people who show strength from themselves to the polyst so the Muslims did this and the first three round rounds they were marching in in in a show of strength and the polyst from above when they saw this they said these guys are not human they are so strong look at them they came travel traveling and yet they're still this strong so this again added to the terror and fear in the heart of the pothy after 3 days they sent Tob and he they told him that tell your cousin that the three days are over and he must now honor the agreement and leave Mecca out of it so this is exactly what the prophet and the companions did they after finishing uh uh their omra they slaughtered their sacrifice near Mara and they all shaved their heads and left Mecca going back to Medina there Allah the almighty revealed the verse of the of the Quran where it says that Allah the almighty has brought the dream that you had seen to reality that you will enter the holy mosque in peace and you will shave or cut short your hair not feeding anything with the grace and will of Allah the almighty the prophet Alam on his way back married as we will inshallah also comment on that when we meet next time so until then m oh"
