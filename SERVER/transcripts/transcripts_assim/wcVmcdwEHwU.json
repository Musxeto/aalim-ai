  "transcript": "Shahana rahim and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa epidemiology in amin nabina muhammad nur Ali he wa sahbihi ajma'in assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we have with us today hadeeth number 28 I presume and who will read it for us please yes brother narrated Ana's evening Malik a Bedouin came and passed urine in one corner of the Masjid the people shouted at him but the Prophet stopped them until he finished urinating the Prophet ordered them to pour a bucket of water over that place and they did in this hadith the relation between it and the book of purity is how to deal with an impurity with an ijazah if it's on the ground now this hadith has a longer version and it's an authentic hadith this Bedouin was so ignorant that he did not know the etiquettes of Islam what is permissible and what is not permissible in the Sunan this man the Bedouin prayed with the prophet alayhi salat wa salam a particular prayer and during the prayer while he is with the prophet in prayer with the companions he said o Allah in a loud voice so everybody heard it he said o Allah forgive Muhammad and me and don't forgive anyone else forgive for Mohamed Salah solemn and myself and do not forgive the sins of anyone else after the Prophet finished the prayer Allah saw sir he brought the man and he said my friend my brother you have made a very wide thing so narrow and limited Allah's mercy is much much bigger than only to occupy myself and you after a while the man went into a corner of the Masjid uplift his skirt or his apron or his lower garment and started to urinate the companions may allah be pleased with them saw him he started shouting and screaming and wanted to attack the man the Prophet erased autosum with his wisdom with his mercy he knew that the harm has been already done the man started urinating so the Harvey is done and he measured the pros and the cons so the pros where to stop him the cons however if the companions pursued him and attacked him or shouted at him he would be frightened and instead of the impurity be restricted in one area the man will be frightened and maybe run away he will put urine on his clothes on his body and elsewhere in the Masjid while running so what is the best every says wait for him until he finishes don't frighten him so that you would not harm him physically if he has to cut himself from or stop himself from urinating after he was over the prophet called him and he said my son or my brother these messages are not made for such filth or for such impurities they're made for prayer reciting the Quran and making dhikr of Allah and then he instructed his companions to bring a bucket of water and to pour it over the place or the spot where the urine was he did not instruct him to dig it he did not instruct him to isolate it very simple just pour a bucket of water the water would mix with the urine it would go down the earth and the place would come pure alhamdulillah so from this hadith the scholars have said and concluded that we must remove the impurity in order for the spot to be clean and therefore they said if the entity itself of the impurity has been removed then the spot is being cleaned whether intentionally or not intentionally and this is one of the only things in Islam that you do not need intention for you do not need Nia Woodill do we need Nia yes or no you we do need intention or Nia for woudl if you don't have intention you just automatically do it and after you finish you remember I didn't want to do Fudo this water is invalid but removing an impurity does not need any for example I have a stain of impurity on my clothes and I have it on my bed my mother comes unknowingly and she washes it not knowing that there is an adjuster she washes it normally she brings that piece of cloth that shirt cleaned and ironed there is no trace for an impurity so can I wear it yes I did not intend it scholar says no need even if I have a shirt with Natasa hanging on the porch and it rains and it cleans it without me intending it it's ok you don't need to have an intention for that therefore the minute the entity itself of the impurity is gone the place is pure and whether it's gone by Sun by wind by any other fluid coming and cleaning it it is ok as long as it has gone and this is what happened with that Bedouin now we have to look deeper into this hadith the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was the most merciful messenger with his people the man did something extremely rude and inappropriate but how was the reaction of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam now let us look at our reaction to other muslims when they make mistakes i know people when they see other muslims making mistakes they fry them they almost try them and eat them alive why yes he made a mistake I have to make an example out of him this is the way of the Prophet any salat or sir if someone does a mistake we have to be like the doctor what would the doctor do if you are examining a patient and the patient starts to scream because of the pain if you smack him in the face are you a good doctor this is his nature he is the patient and you're the doctor you're the one who's supposed to be tolerant and taking it easy and trying to make things better for him and likewise a diary likewise a scholar and likewise a teacher always have to be with the upper hand taking care of his students taking care of his followers and in giving them the mercy they need and definitely we have to apply this hadith in all aspects of our lives it is not enough to know this is halal or this is haram you have to measure the consequences and see the advantages and the disadvantages and if the advantages are less while the disadvantages are more you have to stop then I give you example one of the examples what is the ruling on changing al-munkar changing vice and bad things it is watching is it that so but sometimes it becomes forbidden when the consequences are far worse when the disadvantages are more it is Haram for example a man is drinking whiskey and is completely wasted he is drunk you can tell by his eyes he's drunk and he's very angry and he has a gun loaded in his hand and you know that he's a Muslim so you say I'm going to go to him and tell him this is Haram you're making a major sin and you should stop if I go and tell him this I know that he's gonna put a bullet between my eyes so should I go and continue scholars say no definitely if you go and continue you are sinful why because the disadvantages are far than the advantages and this is what the Prophet did with the Bedouin earliest Oh lots of syrup like why someone is extremely sick and ill and he has to take his medication but he insists that he wants to pass Ramadan and doctor say if you fast today you will die and he insists and fast what do we say is he sinful he is sinful he has made a sin by killing himself while he should have not fasted because Allah gave him the permission and if we cascade this throughout all of our life we will be able to give the right judgement in the right time at the right place the following had a hadith number 29 who will read that for us yes from Abu Huraira reported 5 are the acts are the acts of fitrah circumcision shaving the pubic hairs cutting the mustache clipping the nails and plucking the armpit hair ok this hadith was narrated my Abu Hurairah and reported in Sahih Muslim and elsewhere the prophet alayhi salat wa salam is indicating to us some of the things that are considered to be part of the fitrah what is fitrah nature what is nature there are two aspects of fitrah mentioned in the quran the first and foremost important part is the fitra which is monotheism a to heat fit or Apollo had Latifah Puranas a layer this is the fitra that Allah created people on what is that the Prophet tells us that whenever a child is born he is born on the philtrum meaning his born on Islam how do you know he's born into Islam meaning that if he were to be left alone from all other conditions he would grow up to believe in the oneness of Allah of course he would not know how to pray he would not know how to fast he would not know how to give zakat or make but the Fatah Allah is speaking about in the Quran is the monotheism that he created people on we have a break so stay tuned insha'Allah we'll be right back what salat wa salam ala rasulillah while he also have even today be Hoda and welcome back so filtra has two meanings the first monotheism this is mentioned in the Quran and then there is the fruit VII that the Prophet mentioned to us in a number of hadith hadith of Abu Hurairah is one of them mentioning five there is hadith of Aisha mentioning 10 as a sign him a Muslim and in this hadith the Prophet says that circumcision is part of the Fatah and why is circumcision mentioned in this chapter dealing with purity because for men circumcision is part of perfecting your purity it is the foreskin that the child is born with on the top of his private part and the Sunnah is on the seventh day is to remove it entirely or most of it so that if it was not removed once urinating there will be still traces of urine because of that foreskin and circumcision is mandatory for males in Islam and this is the most authentic opinion it is part of the nature of human beings and that is why Ibrahim peace be upon him was instructed to circumcise when he was 80 years old and he circumcised with an ax or with a hammer peace and blessing be upon him and regarding female circumcision it is an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion after the gathering all information it is recommended it is not mandatory that is why a lot of the Muslims don't do it because to do it you need a professional surgeon who has the ability and the knowledge because it's a very delicate operation therefore a lot of the Muslims don't do it though it is recommended what for males it is mandatory and obligatory because it affects their purity and it affects their prayer and the funny thing is we are more Christian than the Christians as some would like to say because we love Jesus Christ we believe in his miraculous birth and we circumcised and the majority of Christians nowadays who claim to love Jesus do not circumcise so this shows you that our religion comes in line of all divine religions of allah azzawajal it is not different than it it follows the same methodology and the same law of Allah so the first thing is circumcision the second thing is removing or shaving the pubic hair and this is for both males and females this is part of the Sunnah is it mandatory or not this is an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is that it is mandatory providing it does not exceed 40 days so you can have the pubic hair you can have the armpit you can have the nails you can have your mustache without cutting it short providing it does not exceed 40 days so if it exceeds 40 days it becomes mandatory to remove these things some scholars like an imam Noah we may Allah have mercy on his soul said that even if it did not exceed 40 days if a person leaves his fingernails or his pubic hair for a week or two and then finds out that it had grown a lot and it is not healthy it is not hygienic it is not clean then he must remove that even if it's less than 40 days and most Muslims nowadays do it every seven days they shave their pubic hair as in the hadith they cut their mustache some of them shave their mustache altogether and it's a different of appealing among scholars the most authentic you do not shave it you simply trim it to the roots very little but you do not shave it you have to leave traces of it and clipping the nails and we all know that these nails if you keep them if you grow them they are bad place for keeping dirt and for keeping unhealthy things and plucking the armpit plucking the armpit for both men and women and the problem is that nowadays if you go to the gym or if you go to a swimming pool and the brothers are swimming and they take off their shirts if they raise their hands you will see the jungles of Africa people have never cleaned themselves what is this brother why don't you remove this filth and hair as the Sundays said no no no I don't want to look like women well this is not women this is the Prophet that is something you should do it the most man of all men sallalaho aleyh wassallam and he instructed you to do it so you have no excuse and most of the Muslims do this before Juma maybe on Thursday part of washing and cleaning and of their normal routine there is no Sunnah in doing it on Friday there is no Sun on removing this hair and clipping your nails on Friday but if you do it because it is a week of weekend and a holiday and maybe you're preparing for Juma I hope we show a lot that there is nothing wrong in that and we move on to hadith number 30 who will lead hadith 34 us narrated abu huraira that he made the prophet of allah in some of the streets of medina while he was you know i slipped away went and took a bath when i came he said to me who era where have you been I told him I was in the state of janaba the Prophet said Subhan Allah a believer now becomes impure this hadith shows us that a Muslim is never actually impure he is in the state of impurity he might have some impurities or Naja's on his body but in essence he is pure because he's a believer and Abu Hurairah in this hadith he was in the state of janaba so he did not want to meet the prophet or greet the prophet because he thought that being in the state of janaba you should not meet people especially dignitaries such as the prophet or Islam but the Prophet corrected his opinion and he told him no the movement is never impure even if you were on the set of janaba you're still a movement you're still a believer i can give salam to you i can talk to you i can eat with you there is nothing wrong in that however it shows us how the companions of the prophet adam used to deal with the prophet in all honor respect and dignity and we also learn from this hadith that when a person is in the case or in the state of sexual impurity he does not have to hide from people some people think that if you're in the state of sexual impurity you must not leave the house you must not eat you must not do this or do that and this is all wrong the Companions used to leave while being in the state of sexual impurity janaba they used to go for jihad to fight in the cause of Allah when they were in the state of sexual impurity as in the case of hand Allah even armour Allah seal Pasillas maniacae the one whom the Angels washed him between the heavens and the earth when he was martyred in the Battle of hood and when the prophet saw that he told them why is handle are being washed by the angels so they went to his house and checked and they found that he was newlywed a day or two ago and when he heard the call for jihad he left his wife without having a total bath so he was washed by the Angels if this rewire if this hadith was authentic then it means that even the Companions used to go out for jihad in the state of janaba so when a person is in the state of janaba he's requested and instructed to reduce it by by what should I ask individuals or you promise to wake up when a person is in the state of janaba sexual impurity he's requested to reduce that state of janaba with what would you do by performing ablution and we will come to a hadith where the Prophet our son tells us that you can go to sleep while in the state of janaba if you perform voodoo and likewise if you would like to go out if you would like to eat just perform moodle so that you would reduce the state of janaba and be able to leave so we come to the end of our session so if you have any questions any questions yes brother it is possible to read Quran and other Avada by in the state of Jammu this is a good question is it R is permissible to recite the Quran or other forms of Vicker while in the state of janaba it's an issue of dispute among scholars but the majority the vast majority of scholars say that it is forbidden the vast majority of scholars say that reciting the Quran while in the state of janaba of sexual impurity this is not permissible why because there is a weak hadith not authentic weak that Ali may Allah be pleased with him said that nothing used to block or to stop the Prophet Ali Salam from reciting the Quran except janaba so the majority of scholars use this as the evidence for not allowing people to recite the Quran besides they also refer to the in suratul baqarah lie a master who ll Muto Haroun that it should not be touched except by those who were purified and they use this ayah to refer to touching the Quran physically and to reciting it but this ayah is not related to touching the Quran this ayah is referring to the angels who have the preserved tablet they are the ones who are purified as described in the Quran the angels are the one but for the Muslims it's an issue of dispute among scholars so reciting the Quran no you don't recite the Quran because your period of being impure or in the state of janaba is very short very soon coming so it is not necessarily for you to recite it now this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
