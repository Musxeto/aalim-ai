  "transcript": "from the emirates whenever i talk to my sister we end up fighting so can i stop talking to her will i be sinful because my mom says this will be full enough ties and it'll be difficult for you to cross the pulsarat so can what should i do okay i will answer inshallah yusra from the emirates she always fights with her sister can she bycot her the answer is no it is not permissible to sever your kinship the minimum accepted amount of interaction is to say salaam alaikum so you both live in the same house you probably share some of the shores so when you wake up in the morning you go to the living room she's sitting there you just enter and say whether she replies or not no problem after that don't engage with her in any kind of communication if she says anything you just reply without arguing without defending yourself if she starts accusing you of things just give her a smile and don't even reply or defend her as if a fly stood on your hand don't be agitated or anxious don't make a scene out of it let her talk her way out of it and you just give her a smile and don't don't reply it will kill her softly by turning the table on her head by not defending yourself or arguing with her but do not fall into a major sin which is severing your kinship"
