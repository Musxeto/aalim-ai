  "transcript": "it says uh my question is if someone is admitted in the hospital maybe he's uh the full District on them they cannot get up to make will go for Salah how how can they pray in such a situation okay now let us understand this Allah says in the Quran prayer was prescribed upon the Believers at specific times this is a fixed thing nobody argues about it you have to pray on time the second thing is that offering wudu facing the Qibla and covering your aura are conditions of Salat meaning that before you pray these conditions must be fulfilled and if you don't while being able to your prayer is invalid someone prays without wudu and he's able to make his prayer is invalid thirdly if I'm unable to make wudu perfectly or partially and I'm unable to remove impurities from my body I'm unable not I'm lazy no I'm unable I'm unable to face the Qibla I'm bedridden then we fall under the category where Allah says in the Quran fear Allah to the best of your ability so if I have a this drip IV and you say I'm unable to make hudu this does not hinder your wudu process because if you want to go to the loop to the toilet that's pretty easy you just carry it with you and go and you can move around you can go buy some cappuccino and come back you're not bedridden yes this may impact the way you perfectly wash your arm but it doesn't stop you if this is the case you have to perform normal voodoo and when it comes to the area that has uh um things in it that prevents water from breaching if it is a plaster or a cast you just wipe over it you don't wash it but the rest you do as usual if you say no no no Sheikh you got me wrong I'm unable to leave the bed it's not only the strip or the IV I said okay let someone help you with a small bucket of water and you can make water on the or you can make wood in your bed this is not even possible I have Burns may Allah protect us all over my body I can't even touch water I can't do this if you are totally unable to use water in this case make dry evolution which is a small box with some sand or soil and you just strike it once wipe your face wipe your hands the palms of your hands back in front and that's it pray so alhamdulillah Islam is a religion of Simplicity and ease there's no hardship you can't stand a pray standing up pray sitting down you can't sit down pray lying on your side but never ever skip a prayer and Allah Knows Best"
