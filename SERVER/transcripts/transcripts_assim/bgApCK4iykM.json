  "transcript": "what advice would you give to the muslim sisters who constantly have to face discouraging comments from family members or other muslims we try to convince them that the nakab will be a hurdle in life and that it'll inhibit them from doing basic things like getting a decent education or just in order to live a normal life they would have to completely take it off every person on earth has his test don't ever forget this fact even the richest man on earth who is he elon musk warren buffett bill gates the richest man on earth is being tested allah did not create a human being origin without them being tested people tests vary some are tested with wealth what are they going to do with it they're going to squander it in haram they're going to earn it from haram it's their test they're going to pay for it it's only a few years and then in the hereafter when it's time for the scales to be weighed allah would hold them accountable and then it's either heaven or hell some are tested with poverty they can't pay their bills they can't pay the rent they can't make ends meet so they struggle and they suffer this is their test some are tested with health power youth and allah would see what they do with all of that and others are tested with calamities with illnesses with handicapped with diseases and allah would also test them to see whether they're patient tolerant content or objecting and complaining your test is in abusive and bullying members of your family who do not like the fact that you're being righteous practicing wearing the niqab so they try to put hurdles in front of you obstacles they try to intimidate you exactly as the plan which satan has placed for them allah says in the quran satan orders you or promises you with poverty and orders you to do vice and sins while allah promises you with forgiveness and grace so whose promise are you going to believe so these bullies come and try to intimidate you you'll never get married nobody will see you you'll never make it in school it's going to be an obstacle in you for you to get a job you'll never have a career you'll never have a life look at everybody else they're enjoying their lives they're going to disney world disneyland and having fun and and living their normal lives while you are wearing a tent over your head you're all covered like a ninja warrior and everybody is terrified from you this is what they say footnote this is what they used to say to our prophet the same abuse the same harassment but what happened what doesn't kill you makes you stronger as they say look at the companions how they tolerated such abuse and bullying and they became the leaders of the world you are on their footsteps you're walking the same path this is the road map that we all have to follow you're tolerant you're patient you're content you're giving them a big smile and not arguing with them not being provoked by what they say not defending yourself just give them a smile and don't reply it will turn the tables on their heads they'll be agitated they'll be angered by failing to provoke you and to make you react negatively and this will make you prevail in this dunya and it will make you prevail at the sight of allah azzawajal so remain steadfast on islam abide by the quran the sunnah who cares if they praise you and clap day long all day long for you or they criticize you and say bad things about you i could care less i'm doing what i'm doing for the sake of allah and i'm willing to go all the way to the end for the sake of allah and allah knows best"
