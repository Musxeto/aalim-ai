  "title": "Family does free mixing, my father gets angry at me when I avoid this, what to do in this situation?",
  "transcript": "Hamza from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Jazak Allahu Khair. You have cleared many things for me. I just want to say thank you so much. BarakAllahu Feek. My question is, I live in the U.S. and my family gets invited to a lot of dinners, iftars, and there's a lot of free mixing. No segregation between the men and the women. How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? How do you deal with that? Unfortunately, this is your test from Allah Azza wa Jal. You live in a kafir country, and you're trying to practice your religion to the best of your ability, and Allah is testing you with such a father, maybe such a mother, maybe such a community and family. So it is like Prophet Muhammad Alayhi Salatu wa Salam, when he was in Mecca, when he was trying to give da'wah and call people to Islam and to Tawheed, and every single Tom, Dick and Harry was against him. He did not budge, he did not give up, he did not surrender, rather he stood firm, held his grounds and trusted Allah and believed that whatever he does, he does it for the sake of Allah and this is why Allah made him victorious. So you try your level best, while keeping your eyes on the ball, your father is your gateway, middle gateway to Jannah, you have to obey him, respect him and be dutiful without disobeying Allah. So when there is a clash between obeying him and obeying Allah Azza wa Jal, definitely you obey Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala, this is a no-brainer. But this does not mean I have to be confronting him head to head, no. I try my level best to be diplomatic, I try my level best to be polite and to dodge the bullet whenever it is possible, how? If you drive and you can go with them to my uncle's house, my aunt's house, I come five minutes before the iftar, salam alaikum wa alaikum wa salam, I lower my gaze, I just sit in the corner of the table, eat my iftar and sambosa and shorba, salam alaikum and leave. That's a win-win. Yes I still was not supposed to be there but if this mitigates the problem and reduces my father's anger, inshaAllah, inshaAllah, I'm not doing a big sin. But no, if my father wants me to stay the whole night there, no this is something you have to draw the line and say, I'm sorry dad but I can't do it because it goes against what I believe, I respect you, I love you, I care for you but I care about my akhira and I'm not saying that you're a kafir, I'm not saying that you will all go to hell but this is my conviction, I don't want to do something that goes against my beliefs and inshaAllah Allah will make a way out for you."
