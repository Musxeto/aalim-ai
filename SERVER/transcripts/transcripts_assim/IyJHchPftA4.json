  "transcript": "Wassalamu Alaikum. My great-grandfather found some gold while digging a house as a laborer and took it without the permission of the property owner. My grandfather used to do business with goats and amassed a huge property. My father also acquired a lot of property. Now I'm wondering if I can inherit this wealth as it might have originated from that stolen gold. My grandfather most likely used that gold but we don't know much about this story. Is this a recording? I inherit and if not then can I? It is. Okay, so Waseem says that his father found gold in the property of his own father, which I'm presuming that he inherited the property and whatever was in it. And he doubts whether it is stolen or not because his grandfather was a notorious blackbeard pirate maybe, I don't know. So what's the ruling? As long as we don't have any evidence to back this theory or doubt up and we don't have any proof, in this case the default is the gold and the property is halal for you and your grandfather to use and Allah knows best."
