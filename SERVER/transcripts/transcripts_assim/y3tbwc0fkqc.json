  "transcript": "about Allah um we know that when we don't know ruling um in that instant you can correct me yeah in that instant um we have to go in accordance with our gut feeling um you can correct me if I'm wrong but I don't um Allah does not hold us to account to this gut feeling and later on we need to ask to get the the actual ruling so my question is um is it obligatory to ask a for a ruling if there will be more harm than good for example it'll give it will cause someone to be more OCD or it'll give them yeah this is too generic Risa mainly speaking that Allah says in the Quran ask the people of knowledge if you do not know now to claim that if I were to ask this would open the Pandora box and it would increase my OCD and it would cause me a lot of hardship is not a legitimate excuse if you're asking as a form of entertaining or overthinking this is when the Sheikh would restrain you and put you back where you should be any knowledgeable sharehold say listen you're overthinking what you're doing is not healthy you have to stop here and he would not entertain your questions and he would block you from moving on and and continuing to ask such questions but if this is illegitimate doubt should I be in a place where there is music blasting all over the place just to eat some ice cream is this legitimate acceptable permissible or not you don't say I'm not gonna ask because this would open the door for OCD or it would cause hardship upon me no this is not permissible you have to and your justification is not valid"
