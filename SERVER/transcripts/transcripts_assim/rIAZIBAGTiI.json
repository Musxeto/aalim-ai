  "transcript": "A man from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, what should I do when I reach late one rakat and pray with the Imam remaining three rakat and give one salam by mistake after the Imam said his second salam and then got up immediately and complete that one rakat and then offered prostration of forgetfullness? What you have done is correct. If a person misses one rakat or more with the Imam and then in the final rakat of the Imam, when the Imam concludes his salat with salam, the person was absent-minded. So out of habit, when he heard the salam, he offered Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi and then he discovered that, whoops, I haven't finished my salat. So he stood up and completed what was missing and did his tashahhud, did his salutation. He should have offered salam to the right and to the left, then offered two prostrations of forgetfulness, then sat and offered another salam to the right and to the left. But if you did not know that and offered the prostration of forgetfulness before the salam, there is no problem with that either inshaAllah."
