  "transcript": "nor from nigeria he says that he has a confusion in regards to the hadith where the prophet's description of his prayer one was describing the prophet's prayer as some and he said that the sujud the sitting were equal in duration so he's confused because there is another hadith which stated that the closest a person to allah is when he's in the sujud position in prostration so whatever you want because allah would answer you or most likely to answer you so now he says i have a confusion if i would like to prolong the sujud this means that it would be longer than the other pillars and i would say and claim that probably and also not necessarily so probably means that yes you can do it once every blue moon there's no problem in that it's not a must that you have to have them in exactly the same secondly not not necessarily in the sense that you can say subhana rabbi al-harim ten times but when you come to sujud you say subhana rabbil ala once and make dua or thrice and make dua and the duration would be almost the same so you can balance this and allah azza knows best"
