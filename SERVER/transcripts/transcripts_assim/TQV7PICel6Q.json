  "transcript": "the uk he's got a long tail and at the end of his tale he says that if a person managed to pray risha prayer and after he finished isha prayer he found that the time of risha was up 30 seconds or so ago first of all ahmed i don't answer according to what people believe so you don't come to me and say uh hanafi and according to the hanafi madhhab one two three so what do you think according to the hanafi madhhab he asked a hanafi scholar when you come to me and say i follow the opinion that says skipping one salah intentionally makes you a kafir so what's the ruling ask someone who believes that i don't believe that skipping one single prayer makes you a kafir this is not true so when you ask me okay yeah but answer me no i'm not gonna do that you have to go and ask someone who believes that or ask me about what i believe and i believe that if a person according to the sunnah and this is the problem with people who do not follow the sunnah or do do not read the sunnah the prophet told the salism that whoever manages to pray one rakah of asar before sunset then his prayer is valid meaning that after finishing muraka when he's told to pray the second rakah sun was already has already set so he finished the second the third the fourth rakah while the sun was already down in its maghrib time his prayer is valid so if this brother finished the four raka's of rishi and managed to do that 40 or 50 seconds after midnight which means that the first second and third raka were done before midnight definitely his prayer is valid from india"
