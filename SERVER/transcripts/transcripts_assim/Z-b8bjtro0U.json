  "title": "Must we not rent our apartment to non Muslims in Arabian Peninsula How to treat them assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Salaam I know the Hadith about them I kind of know what about the Arabian peninsula where like we can't really have other religions other than Muslims but the thing is I have my dad working in Airbnb and I kind of work with them so maybe non-believers can enter the appointment is my income Haram now this is something that is way above your pay grade in the sense that the instruction and the Order of the Prophet Allah not to allow other than Islam to remain in the Arabian Peninsula has been explained by scholars in many different ways among them is that they should not reside and they should not be from the people permanently living there building their mesh their temples building their churches building their synagogues this is totally prohibited for the Muslim and this prohibition is in the neck of the Muslim ruler if he defies this and if he does not care about what the prophet ordered he'll be held accountable among a bunch of things on the day of judgment so this is not for you and me to decide as a Muslim when you meet a non-muslim who is in the Arabian peninsula there is nothing wrong in dealing with them nicely treating them nicely renting them BNB Airbnb or a hotel room or selling them groceries or having commercial ties with them there is nothing wrong in that and Allah knows best Rashad"
