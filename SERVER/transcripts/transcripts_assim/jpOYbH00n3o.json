  "transcript": "Lay from Russia Assalamu Alaikum Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, if a person makes an inappropriate joke about Islam that constitutes Kufr and then they just say something like Astaghfirullah and seek the forgiveness of Allah not knowing that it constituted Kufr and that they needed to retake the Shahada and they just continue their lives thinking that they are Muslim and they live their lives as Muslims would they die as disbelievers because they didn't repent from Kufr? The verse in Surat Al-Tawbah, chapter 9, I believe it's 65 and 66 indicates that joking, ridiculing, or making fun of anything of the Sharia knowingly or unknowingly, intentionally or unintentionally takes a person out of the fold of Islam as Allah said, قَدْ كَفَرْتُمْ بَعْدَ إِيمَانِكُمْ You have committed Kufr after being labeled as Muslims or believers Nevertheless, scholars of Islam say if a person did such a sin without paying attention to it though he exited the fold of Islam but because he's unaware of it and he prayed afterwards and said the Shahada a gazillion times afterwards, he's Muslim and he would die as a Muslim who made that joke, someone who made fun of Quran or Prophet Muhammad of one of the rituals of the Deen and he is aware, he's mindful of it he knows it but he did not repent yet he remembers it he did not ask Allah for forgiveness for it this guy is a Kafir, a full-fledged Kafir Abdullah from Bangladesh"
