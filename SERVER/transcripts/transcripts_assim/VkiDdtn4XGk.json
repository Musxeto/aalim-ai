  "title": "Imam gave Khutbah first before Eid Prayer & said 3 AllahuAkbar only, valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Anas from Canada. Anas. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So it's about Eid Salah. So when I prayed an Eid with one of the masjids and one of the imams, the way he prayed Eid is that he gave the khutbah before the Salat Eid. And the way he prayed the Eid is that he started by Takbiratul Haram, three Takbirat, then three Takbirs, then the Takbir of Intiqal for Ruku and finished the rest of the prayer. Is the prayer valid? The prayer as the prayer is valid. The format is totally wrong. In Eid prayer, the prayer has to be first, then it is followed by the khutbah. Whether it's one or two is an issue of dispute. I personally am inclined to say it's only one khutbah, because the Prophet prayed it in the Musalla, alayhi salatu wasalam, in the open area, and it was never reported that they got the pulpit for him to sit between the two khutbahs. So it's only one. Secondly, the most authentic opinion is that there should be seven Takbirs in the beginning of the first Raka'ah after Takbiratul Ihraam. So you do Takbiratul Ihraam, then you do Dua'ul Istiftah, then you say the seven Takbirs, then you say, In the second Raka'ah, after you say Allahu Akbar and rise from sujood, you say five Takbirs as per the hadith of the Prophet, alayhi salatu wasalam. Some schools of thought say, no, Takbiratul Ihraam is one, and then you do six Takbirs afterwards. And for the second Raka'ah, as I've described. Others may decrease and say five, may say three, may say this and that. Either way, alhamdulillah, the Takbir as a whole is a sunnah. So if you drop it altogether, the prayer is valid without any problem insha'Allah."
