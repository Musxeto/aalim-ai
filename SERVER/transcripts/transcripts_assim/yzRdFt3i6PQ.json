  "title": "How should we treat our Non Muslim parents & Siblings? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Samiha says how should we treat our non-muslim parents and siblings should we meet them on their religious occasions just to maintain ties of kinship well Samia these are two different things now your kinship would remain your kinship no matter what so as long as they do not express enmity towards Islam and the Muslims and they are your siblings your parents your loved ones your kinship you must maintain ties of kinship and this differs from how close they are to how far so those who are close to you like your brothers and sisters you have to contact them you have to send them gift you have to check on them if their pool you have to help them if they are in need you have to assist them and this is connecting to your kinship and if they're cousins or second or third or fourth cousins then maybe a phone call every now and then you see them in weddings and when you see them in family gatherings sending them SMS is whatever is convenient for you and would at the same time be considered as tying the kinship ties of kinship and connecting it attending their religious occasions is a different thing altogether it is totally prohibited for a Muslim to attend the religious occasions or the innervated occasions of the disbelievers so by default Muslims cannot attend Christmas gatherings cannot attend Easter cannot attend anything that is religion related such as funerals wedding in houses of worship sets such as temples synagogues or even churches this is part of religion that we must draw the line also occasions such as New Year though it's not related to Christianity but it is imitating that the non-believers the disbelievers and this is not for Muslims to attend Halloween Thanksgiving though they are not religion related but again it is not part of our customs so it is totally prohibited to attend this and you can visit them when there are no such occasions and there is no problem in that insha'Allah"
