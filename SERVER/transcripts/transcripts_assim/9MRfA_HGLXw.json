  "transcript": "they Collide they shouldn't the mother's rights are definitely separate than the wife's rights but that disturbance in the force happens when the mother wants to control the daughter-in-law wants to mingle in her Affairs wants her to be her servant without due respect to mother-in-laws sons-in-laws fathers-in-laws I usually don't like to give such speeches before dinner because take you to the hotel again but I I was forced to do this I have to say this is the conflict when the Mother-in-law says why do you go to your in-laws every week don't take your wife to her and to her parents it's none of your goddamn business or they'll excuse my French it's not about your business no I'm the mother you're the mother of your son if he takes his wife to eat outside it's none of your business take your nose out of it you don't have the right to say and order your son let your wife clean my room let your wife cook for me let your wife massage my feet you are not her mother you are his mother he does this for you and the boy the the so-called husband has to man up and say Mom I love you I respect you I'll do whatever you want but you have no rights over this woman her mother has rights over her not you I know this is I am unable before dinner or after that in this Society this is Allah's law not mine and unfortunately I get hundreds of similar situations all one thing this to happen I got a Pakistani family in my house once for counseling this is this is for Allah before I became greedy and they took two hours of my time Allah it was suffocating but they came to my house and that was the last time I had person to person counseling because it consumes time and it's dangerous a woman came she was in her thirties with her son 22 years of age and her daughter-in-law 18. and they came the poor daughter-in-law was shivering like a small bird very frightened not able to speak and the sun was a little bit agitated but his mom is mashallah typical Pakistani woman whoa I was afraid that I had my armors ready my shield for riot control everything was ready a gas bombs everything was alhamdulillah and they started talking and she started firing she doesn't cook she always sleeps until uh 10 o'clock she doesn't clean she doesn't do this she doesn't do that I'm trying to explain to her getting in a nice diplomatic way that she is obliged in Islam only to serve her husband and the children if she does this out of her good will for you may Allah reward her she is a very kind and righteous woman but this is not an obligation she wouldn't budge she wouldn't understand and then I understood and I said would you like your son-in-law to treat your daughter like this she said no I said did you like what your mother-in-law did to you 30 years ago she said no but this is how I lived this is how I was out treated she missed uh treated me she abused me she made me do this and this and this I was looking at her son okay why are you doing this to this young woman instead of retracting the mistakes that happen and be fair because I tasted that she must taste it this is one happens to you you become an advocate to defend the needy but when you insist on cascading the wolf then you have a problem so with all due respect when it comes to rights the sun is obliged to devote 100 of his time and efforts to be beautiful to his parents without jeopardizing his wife's rights now financially we have to look because so many people are rich or capable but they demand that their son gives them fifty percent seventy percent of his earnings and then he does not spend anything on his wife no this is not mandatory as a son I'm not obliged to give one penny to my father unless he needs it and I give him what he providing he doesn't use it to give my siblings I earn and work and I give my father and my father gives it to my siblings this is not fair he uses it for himself for his wife that is my mom 100 okay without jeopardizing my wife's rights so I don't give 80 to my parents because they need it and give nothing to my wife and she wants food she wants clothes my children needs to go to school but say what can I do a lot of the culture from here I know because I get as I said tens of thousands of questions a year eighty percent from Pakistan"
