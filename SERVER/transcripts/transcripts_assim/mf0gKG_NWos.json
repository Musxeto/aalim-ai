  "transcript": "I recently saw on Twitter that uh some renowned students of knowledge are promoting Quran known as salafi Quran and it is an English trans promoting what a salafi Quran what is a salafi Quran there's no such thing as a salafi Quran yes they translated the Quran and they translated it well but the head of the Quran is known as salafi Quran so is it valid to me for I have no idea you have to go through it and revise the entire Quran and see if the translation uh is accurate and um appropriate because this is not a game everybody could hold the Quran and translate it and their English is not uh equipped to that level and their AA is not as well so um I can't give my opinion unless we can go and look into it and read it from cover to cover and Allah Knows Best"
