ahmadi commercial Anubhava kato and welcome to this 48 episode of explaining the book of islamic shock which by now I hope that the vast majority of you have downloaded the book and also have registered in Islamic Chuck dotnet the Islamic net so that you would be able to get assessment of your level and fill get frequent quizzes and tests and hopefully by the end of the process you would be able to get a certificate last time we spoke about the wives rights and we mentioned five type of these rights and there are much or there are many more so the dowry being looked after her rights in being satisfied through sexual intercourse proper companionship and kind treatment and finally fairness if he has more than one wife now when we say rights of the wife we do not ignore that she also has obligations to her her husband and her rights are not limited at all in these five categories but when you look at proper companionship and kind treatment this right you can actually right books on because it deals a lot with women's or wives rights over their husbands in kind treatment and not being abusive in giving them and this is also not mentioned but it falls under the same category of being looked after so part of being looked after is to give your wife a separate accommodation and not to live in the same joint family system that is prevalent in the subcontinent this is wrong this is Una's lamech a woman needs her own quarters to dress as she wishes to be alone with herself over the children whenever she wishes to force a woman to stay with her in-laws not only that but also to serve them and to be a a local maid for them this is an Islamic and this is not giving her her rights so when we talk about the wives rights a small paragraph or a sentence would not do her justice yet this is a very concise explanation of truck so we probably need a lecture to expand on the rights of wives over their husbands and also we have to differentiate between what is mandatory and what is recommended so when it comes to mandatory it is her right to be looked after a a husband who is not knowledgeable a husband who is too technical in short an imbecile husband would come and say listen I'm obliged to provide for you and look after you so here is one meal per day if you eat one meal per day you will not starve and you will not die so this is my obligation towards you you want fruits this is not my obligation I just provide you with the main course appetizers is not my problem to buy normal foods that people have in their homes this is not my obligation span Allah you do not deal with your spouse using a calculator this is what I have to do and this is what I'm not obliged to do so I'm not gonna do it no life is not like this there has to be mutual care and love between the spouses even if there may arise reasons for being a little bit unhappy unsatisfied with your spouse this doesn't entitle you or give you the right to not give them their rights fully so this is a very important issue when we study aspects of truck this is not going deep and how relationships should be we're just skimming the surface so that the basics can be fulfilled but there this is only the tip of an iceberg so what are the husband's rights first it says wives should always keep their husbands secrets and this is not the husband's right this is mutual so keeping secrets that can only be shared by the spouses is a must a wife must not expose her husband's secret a husband must not expose his wife's secret and by secrets we mean the things that are related to marital issues so things related to intimacy things related to their own privacy these must be concealed it is not permissible for a wife to go and complain to her husband to her mother or to her father or to her sisters that he does this he does that which are not things to be complained about likewise a man is not allowed to go and speak with his mother I got a question the other day a complaint from a sister saying that her mother-in-law insists on her that is the daughter-in-law to disclose what goes on during the night with her son and she tells her to do this to do that and she doesn't feel comfortable doing that at all and when she saw that she's not responding to her she went to her husband to her son and she's telling her son to do this and to do that and even to have intimacy while she's on her period a liudmila what kind of a man allows his mother to speak to him about such things and he gives us himself the liberty to speak about issues of intimacy with other than his own wife this is totally prohibited and it's totally Haram so a woman must not disclose her husband's secrets she cannot go to her sister for example says all my husband suffers from this or that during intercourse or he sounds like this in that out lavinda allah says in the quran so righteous women are devoutly obedient guarding in their husband's absence what Allah would have them guard a righteous woman does not disclose her husband's secrets in such a fashion number two obeying the husband and fair manner and this is known as a part to Bill ma who [Music] what is fair to you might not be fair to me so if you look at how people measure fairness you'll find that it is measured differently in for example America than it is in Europe than it is in the Arab world than it is in India etc because human beings different so what some may think and consider to be fair others may consider it to be unfair and the only way to reach fairness is to identify it through the Quran and to the Sunna so there are general guide lines everybody acknowledges them whether is a kafir or a Muslim and there are specific guidelines which can be only known be known through Sharia through the Quran and the Sunnah so when it comes to dealing with a husband we said that obeying the husband in a fair manner is one of his rights so what is fair it is part of his rights over a woman that she and this is not mentioned but maybe I don't know but it is part of Islamic teachings that she does not leave the house without his permission so the concept of her having her own car and you know going out of the home whenever she wants coming back whenever she wants doing whatever she needs this is totally out of the question this goes against guard guardianship Allah says in the Quran Ruggiero agua muna and Anissa men are guarding over women so to be able to ignore the husband like it is being able to ignore the father if she's unmarried and she leaves wherever she wants she hangs out whatever with whomever she wishes this is definitely an Islamic yes in America in Europe this is normal she can sleep with whomever she wants not in slap Islam governs such things what Islam doesn't govern then we look at what is normal so if I'm husband tells his wife to stand on one leg does anything in the Quran say otherwise no son does not say she should obey Him no she must not Islam says she must obey Him when it is Bill Maher roof in a fair manner so ask any Tom Dick or Harry where the Muslim or non-muslims is standing on one foot considered to be in a fair manner they all say no this is not logical what what benefit would it be for for her or for him if he just says listen I don't like you drinking tea why I don't like it is she obliged to obey definitely not this is not obeying him in fair manner if he comes to her and say listen I need your ATM and I like to use your money whenever I want you're my wife I have full authority over your wealth she should not give him anything not even a single red penny because it's not part of obeying him in fair manner this is tyranny this is oppression she's entitled to do whatever she wants with her wealth it's her money she inherited money she wants to give her brother he says no don't give your brother anything who are you to command me like this this is my money I'm your husband so I obey you by not going out of the house I will obey you by not allowing anyone in the house without your permission I obey you when I want to fast voluntary fast like the six of shewhart and you say no you should not fast this is your right in Islam I obey you if I want to pray the hatchet and you call me too bad I must obey you but when it comes to other things that are not related to marriage you don't own me so what some men think that they have absolute power over women this is strong so obeying the husband in a fair manner means that if you're working and your husband says I don't like you working and he said but I like working and he says i order you to resign your job and sit back or sit home it is mandatory upon you to obey Him even if you're teaching only women in a girls-only school it is his right that you stay home for him but if he doesn't provide for you this is a different issue and this is not the time to expand upon it so obeying the husband in a fair manner the Prophet said that is sort of Salaam no or the Islamic rule but it's also stemmed from the hadith no creature may be obeyed in what constitutes OBD disobedience to Allah the Creator so this is a well-known fact that a woman must obey her husband he tells her to cover her face and she doesn't believe that covering the face is part of the sooner she's obliged to obey Him he tells her to uncover her face while she balay believes that niqab is mandatory she must not obey Him because there is no obedience to a create to a creature in disobeying Allah so the creator and so on number three giving him his sexual pleasure in if he desires her the Prophet said Allison if a man calls his wife to his bed and she refuses and he sleeps feeling angry with her the angels will curse her until morning now this is addressing the Muslim women disbelieving women or men kafir men or women would not find this acceptable and this is our religion you guys don't find it acceptable that's your problem we don't find your religion acceptable but for a Muslim woman to come and say that no this is not fair this is blasphemy why then share is this not the opposite why when I want my husband and he does not comply the Angels don't curse him there are many reasons above all that we don't have anything to support that the Angels curse man if he does not respond to his wives desires therefore we stick to what the hadith tells us but if we look at it logically men and women are different some say women are from Mars and men are from Venus or the opposite I don't know meaning that they look human but they are built in a different way than one another their feelings their orientations etc and this is why men have more desires for intimacy than women and they are quite vocal about it and it may drive them to do Haram things way easier than women women to have their desires but they're more conservative they're more shy to express and they have far stronger control over it this is why a man can marry four women and a woman can only marry one man this rule was set by the one who created us the almighty allah azzawajal and Alonzo John sent us a messenger and sent us the Orang to explain to us this fact so if a man has the urge for intimacy and is prevented from it this could have catastrophic consequences even when a person is the religious Shaitaan is always there lurking in the dark waiting for the right moment to strike I have so many stories what I do counseling to people I get to meet hundreds and thousands of different people one-to-one sessions for half an hour and they tell me about their problems some of their problems are so obvious you look at them and say subhanAllah how you guys did not see this it's so clear a blind person can see it and some of the problems are quite difficult it needs questioning and asking and responses and opening their minds to understand how Shaitaan works there for a woman depriving her husband from his sexual rights would have dire consequences on the whole community on the society and on the individual I'm not justifying for that person to go and watch pornography or to chitchat with a nun maha woman or to flirt with a colleague at work no this is all prohibited and hard but it is a byproduct for what the woman had done she may and she may not have proper excuses Islam says unless it is harmful for you unless you're sick and you're unable to give him what he wants unless it is harmful and it causing you harm you have no reason even if you were requested while cooking on a stove in the kitchen and he demands his rights the prophecies give it to him of course a woman when she asks her husband any normal person would comply men love to be desired men love to be sought after because this is not the norm the norm is a man runs after a woman and this is why when a father wants to encourage his son he says come on son study hard graduate and the moment you get a job I'll find you a beautiful righteous wife so this is a target that all men look for while when he speaks to his daughter he would never ever say come on daughter graduate and and I will find you a good husband because women are shy they don't seek rather they are sought after so this right of a husband is something that the Prophet Isis o has highlighted a number of times in different Hadees unless it is harmful for you unless you're sick and intercourse would increase in your hardship you have no legitimate reason to deny him a woman's role is passive it's not as active as a man in this intimate relationship so it's not gonna consume her energy or she has to fake it though faking it is reward double by Allah when she pleases her husband even if she's not happy just faking it as they say would and more good deeds to her record books and I think this we have we've said more than enough thirdly or fourthly taking care of the family home his property and their children and this is an issue of dispute among scholars and the reason of this is that the marriage was supposed to be an exchange of her giving herself an exchange of she giving herself to her husband whenever he requires or demands intimacy and that's it so some scholars thought that this is all what is required other scholars said no this is not normal this is not how the Companions used to live and there's nothing to support it Fathima may Allah be pleased with her who's the daughter of the Prophet and his thought was Salam came to him complaining because of grinding the wheat it hardened her palms and affected her health so she requested a servant the Prophet did not tell her al-assad Salam why are you coming to me it's your husband's responsibility to bribe provide you with a servant not mine the Prophet didn't say that because it is not the husband's responsibility so the most authentic opinion is that a woman is obliged to work in her home taking care of the shores of the house taking care of her husband's needs and her children's means so she's the one whose host who does the cooking the cleaning the washing the ironing and they did she takes care of the house this is part of obeying the husband in a fair manner likewise it is the husband's duty to feed her proper meals not only by her sandwiches no he has to feed her correctly he has to clothe her by a proper clothes he has he has to provide her with a shelter not a single room on the roof made for drivers or mates no he has to give her a proper shelter according to his financial ability and to her social status he has to also provide her with medical care and this is not mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah but it is part of treating her in a fair manner and he has to take her out take care of her needs does not neglect her when it comes to words of compassion and mercy texting her that he loves her and he misses her buying her a red rose every now and then buying her jewelry if he can afford it put a bottle of perfume taking her out for dinner spending quality time all of these are not mandated but they are highly recommended because in return she's taking care of your house of your children of your clothes of your food so it's a mutual relationship the mutual returns you have to do something scratch my back I scratch yours with the difference that this is an instruction from Allah as they will judge to take care of one another finally finally kindly treatment and good manners so so many women are abusive so went many women say things and then apologized after a while when it's too late if a woman restrains herself controls her tongue and does not say things that would be more painful to cure than to avoid a lot of marriages suffer from this and a lot of the brothers are complaining for from being unkindly treated some of them that is some of the brothers are too soft and too kind which makes women write them like a mule and some men are too aggressive are too abusive which makes women treat them like an adversary an enemy and they see that the only way to live through this marriage is to be more oppressive and more abusive than him and definitely this is not the life that Allah has promised us Allah says that among his signs that he created for you from you spouses so that you would have shelter in them have comfort and tranquility in them and he made between them the spouses compassion and kindness and mercy when you look at how spouses are living you would see that a lot of them have failed big time and with this grace of Allah so again when I sit with couples trying to solve their problems it's very easy because I can see what is wrong while they for being in the same situation for tens of years have become numb and unable to feel what is going on or what is coming from their mouths and how offensive it is so it's just an eye-opener hamdulillah therefore kind treatment and good manners from both sides is the formula for a happy marriage whenever respect disappears this is when Shaitaan comes this is when Shaitaan is present and problems happen without an end we move on to the following chapter which is the solution of the marriage at the wife's request definition and status this is dealing with fuller when a marriage takes place this is a very strong bond between a man and a wife to dissolve this it has to be done by the man giving Palach I divorce you or by the woman asking for fuller which we are about to talk or by the Muslim judge dissolving the marriage through the the power invested in him so he has the right to say you guys can't stay together your marriage is dissolved even if the husband is not happy even if the wife is not happy but the the Muslim judge has authority to do this so what is fuller color is the solution of the marriage Genesis in specific words and in return for compensation paid by the wife to her husband Allah says if you have a cause to fear that they would not be able to keep within the bounds set by Allah that is the spouses it shall be no offence for either of them if she gives up whatever she may in order to free herself so what is for her color is a process where a woman buys her freedom so she got into this marriage by being paid a dowry if she wants out for a legitimate reason she buys her way out through giving the same amount of dowry or even less depending on what they reach an agreement over in the authentic hadith Sabbatini Christ may Allah be pleased with him was married to a woman and this woman came to the Prophet allahís all to sell now we know that rabbit is one of the companions of the Prophet Elisha watch yourself he was what we explained today as the Minister of Information he's a spokesman so he was the person that the prophet calls at it's awesome whenever convoys come convoys no invoice come and would like to introduce themselves so they have a spokesman of their own and he says we are this we are that and they speak proudly of their tribe travel team in the pace because of his very loud voice and articulate fashion would be ordered by the prophetess Sam to respond to them so this is his job so he's a good companion of the Prophet Isis and his wife came to the Prophet he said o prophet of Allah I do not want to stay with Sabbath I don't want to be married to him and he doesn't want to divorce me so the Prophet said yeah I saw some do you find anything wrong with him is he singing is he watching like porn or doing something bad so she says I do not blame Sabbath even ice for any defect in his character or his religious commitment of Allah he's a good Muslim but I would hate to commit an act of disbelief now that I'm a Muslim whoa what is that related to marriage disbelief here transit is is originally called cover and go for can be disbelief which is major and can be minor which is sinful so accusing you in your lineage this is cover but it is minor so no no no you're not from that tribe or from that lineage or your great-great-grandfather is not who you claim to be so you're not honorable this is covered but it's minor and a woman being abusive to her husband not giving him his rights not respecting him his cover not major but minor so the wife of Sabbath said the man is perfect I simply do not accept him hence I'm unable to give him his rights intimacy and others so this would put me in a category of go for which is the minor disbelief as in the hadith all women give sadaqa for I have seen you the majority of the people of hell and the women said why o prophet of Allah and the Prophet says because of your disbelief and they said we disbelieve in Allah and the Prophet as a son should no no no you disbelieve in the marriage in the marital life and in the good days that had been between you and your husband if your husband is kind cue the whole year and makes one single mistake you would say I've never seen anything good from you so the prophet has have described this feeling of ingratitude of being unfaithful ungrateful described as gopher and scholar said that this is not disbelieve in Allah that would put a person in hell for eternity but it's a major sin and it is minor cover killing a Muslim is kufur but this is minor and in Arabic we have I'll go for and we have go for L means that so even taenia says me Allah have mercy so that whenever that is introduced to the word covered or shirk it makes it major and when it's stripped of it it makes that minor and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best so the Prophet said to her will you give him back his garden because Favot gave her as a dowry a farm and she said yes so the Prophet addressed Sabbath so la salle de and he said take your garden back and divorce her once so this is the right way of performing horror to reach a compromise an agreement between the man and his wife so if he goes and what notices that his wife is not liking him the ideal situation is for a real husband to divorce his wife if she doesn't love you she doesn't want you she doesn't have any feelings to him why are you keeping her oh sure I love her yeah but she doesn't love you back you want to force her to love you she's been there and she has done that so what's the point oh I can't leave her come on man be a man divorce her ditch her and get married to someone who's younger and more beautiful and would appreciate you more she's a human being she doesn't like you anymore she doesn't love you so why are you for fighting a losing battle this is doesn't it make any sense the man is still insisting snow I I don't want to divorce her I invested a lot in this marriage I gave her a dowry so if she doesn't want me as she claims she should pay me back for my losses and this is his god-given right so she wants out of this marriage she should give him something in return and this is why it's very important to know the difference between horror and divorce Paula so many cases that come to me the man says cher is older part of divorce is it counted out of the three divorces as is no huh that's good I said why is it because I divorced my wife twice before and six months ago she asked me for color so I said okay if this is what you want and she offered to give me the dowry and I refused to take a penny and I gave her divorce now after six months we're thinking of coming back together and remarrying I said no deal not possible said why you just said that Haller is not a divorce said yes hollar which is in compensation the wife gives you money so it has to be something for something in order to be counted as fuller you didn't take any financial compensation and you simply her divorced so this was the last and third divorce sorry but you can't go back to her you cannot marry her this is important to know that there are differences between Halle and divorce for example divorce number one and divorce number two the rate the period is three monthly cycles if she's not pregnant while Haller is one monthly cycle similar to the third divorce if a man divorces his wife for the third time she waits only for one monthly cycle and then she can marry again but the first and second divorces she has to wait three monthly cycles color is exactly the same as the third divorce in the sense that she's awarded Haller today in the evening she gets her menses five days later she's pure the sixth day she can get married to another man boom no problem also in divorce one and divorce two during the eight day period she is considered to be his wife and if he wants he can revoke the marriage reconcile with her with or without her permission she has no say in it he's the one who divorced he's the one the own he's the only one who has the right to revoke the marriage and get her back to the marriage institution or whatever if she refuses it has no value in Haller once the holder is awarded a couple of weeks later the man says or changed my mind I revoke my color nope no done deal it's over so what to do the woman herself wants to go back in marriage with him this is a different situation you can propose to her guardian and if he agrees then we can make a marriage contract with an uma heart with two Muslim male witnesses it's the full the whole full nine nine yards but other than that no you cannot revoke the whole as you wish so this is any almost everything that we need to know about what's in color and I think we should move on to the questions we have the first question is from up the bar there he says it is is it permissible for a husband and wife to pray to had Jude or p.m. would lay in congregation in fes is it loud prayers or silent Dan says yes without any doubt a man and his wife it is part of Sunnah to offer night prayer together this is highly recommended by the Prophet Alistair awesome he said that whenever a man wakes up and he wakes up his wife and he sprinkles water on her face if she refuses to wake up and they pray 2 rakaats they will be registered in a las records as among those who remember Allah men and women a lot Zachery inna llaha catherine was a karate and also the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to wake up used to wake his wives up whenever he wanted to perform with him so he used to pray a lot of night prayer but when it came to wit he used to wake a shine his wives up to join him in that so this is a very highly recommended Sunnah to offer night prayer tahajud with your spouse should he recite loudly or softly definitely loudly because night prayer is recited a bit louder than silent prayers where you can heal yourself and also those praying with you can hear you it was reported that the Prophet Allah so someone's passed by Abu Bakr's home or he asked Abu Bakr how do you recite during night prayers and he says I recite silently so when the Prophet asked him why do you recite silently he said I made the one whom I am addressing hear what I have to say now I'm reciting the Quran for whom for Allah does Allah need me to raise my voice this is abu bakr's way of thinking you know I'm calling Allah Allah is hearing me so he passed by rama and rama was reciting the quran loudly so as I said why are you reciting the Quran this loud Rama so he said o prophet of Allah to scare the devil away and to make to wake up those who are sleepy and drowsy to encourage them to stand up and pray so the Prophet said to abu bakr raise your voice a bit and said to omar lower your voice a bit Rashid says after taking color is it mandatory to return the maja amount paid by the groom or what is the ruling on this well we just spoke about this Russia to be a proper holder there has to be a financial compensation to the hospital so if he paid a thousand euros the norm would be that the wife in exchange for her she gives him one thousand euros they can negotiate she may say listen come on I've spent 10 years with you and he cut me some slack make it 500 and she and he agrees that that's fine if he agrees for $1 only that's fine he has to receive something as a compensation for it to be wholly otherwise it is a divorce Maria says the man can marry with another woman without say that to the first wife so her question would be is it permissible for a man to marry without the permission of his first wife yes this is permissible not only that it is also permissible to marry without the knowledge of the first wife some first wives would burn a fuse if you tell her that her husband got married again and she would maybe go haywire in this case the husband is forced to marry without telling her is it the ideal case definitely not is it recommended definitely not either be a man 100% or not a week before marriage tell her that you're getting married if she says oh I don't want to do it marry this not fair divorce me if you're serious and you're getting married and you need it divorce her the house is hers it's open for her and her children you want to stay I'll put you on my head I'll cherish you I love you as I have loved you the past years but when you want to bend my arm as we say in Arabic when you want to hurt me and think that you can force me through intimidating me with divorce or going back to your parents house be my guest if I am serious I have to get married to a second wife or I'll fall into Haram a man comes to me and says my wife does not give me any of my rights of intimacy so I said you like what she says sure I I can only be intimate with her once a month what is this honey you might as well do it through correspondence let's go to our country and what kind of marriage is this and I faced a lot of fitna and I'm going to fall in her on share I said no he get married again he says she will divorce me said tell her send her a postcard says enter you'll miss her a lot if she is not willing to give you your rights and she's preventing you from having a second wife what do you need of her beat it be realistic yes I love her she loves me but she is forcing me she's not giving me my rights I need my rights of intimacy as a man we've mentioned this so you have to become realistic but this is not to be done as simple as I've just explained it there is a whole list and process of doing it of showing her her the gravity of her sin of her talking to someone who would give her advice elders a counselor a marriage counselor someone with authority to explain to her how long she is but at the end of the day if she's not willing she's not staying with you she's not giving you right ditcher Ezra says and by the way this goes both ways men and women so even if a sister complains there is a process there are points that has boxes that has they have to be checked and if she says yeah my husband does this does that does this does that in this case we advise Adam this is not a good marriage or a healthy marriage you have to bail yourself out leave but in most cases we tell the wife to listen you need to reconsider your justifications are not valid and in the man's case so many times I tell my hey you should feel a lot Wyatt marry a second wife your first wife is an excellent woman she does everything in her ability to please you it's just the fun of being cold Wow he's a man he's got two wives as if it's something to be boasting about yeah the gorillas can post about this maybe a lion can boast of Hanks having so many lionesses this is in the animal world Muslims and humans don't do this this is when it is necessary and there is a call and need for it and you know yourself you're going to be fearing a large ocean and being fair other than that hold your horses Ezra says it Islam what is meant by a woman or a man nature is different is this referring to appearances because we are told human nature is the same for all like desires greed jealousy love or of wealth etcetera no this is not true men and women are different appearances or physically they may look alike having a head two arms two legs being able to speak may be women speaking more than men considerably but beside that they are different in how they think in how they feel men are more realistic logical they don't involve a lot of feelings in their lives that's why they're they're having hearts of stone while women are emotional they involve a lot of emotions in their life and this is why we love them because if a man was married to a woman without emotions without feelings he feels like his mandatories buddy a friend a man and if a woman marries a man with too much feelings that whenever she speaks to him he starts to weep and cry this is what is this she wants a man that orders her that protects her that steers the marriage and the family to safety so they are different when women speak or sit with other women they talk endlessly about things that men would never ever speak about and vice versa so when I sit with the boys we talks we talk about cars property prices about inflation stocks about politics economy never ever talk about our personal lives I would never say that yeah my my wife went to the the beauty parlor and she's doing her nails I wouldn't do anything like that nobody knows anything about my life women on the contrary when they sit they tell everything my husband did this my husband did that my children went to school and this happened my daughter-in-law said this to my son and they had a fight and and they gossip and they exchange stories and they put all of their emotions in it this is how they are built generally speaking there might be some exceptions therefore they are different from one another their orientation is different the way they think the way they talk and the way they appreciate men in general failed to say thank you I got a call from a brother the other day he's telling me that my wife is angry with me and I misunderstood the meaning of a hadith the Prophet said rasam whoever does not thank people is not grateful to Allah so he said from this hadith I thought that thanking people would be  because I'm not doing it to Allah so I never praised my wife's cooking or doing good things today she gave me a good meal and I failed to say thank you it's a good meal because I didn't want to praise her why not praising her she because in another hadith the Prophet said that if you praise your Muslim brother it's like cutting his neck how people think the hadith of not praising others is in things related to religion so if you come to me in session awesome you are the most righteous scholar I've ever seen I would say hmm yeah I know that's good and I would act to be humble stuffable ah you see there sure are some you guide us so much to Islam and now we're practicing and now we love Allah all is because of you and I say the stuff inside my head is inflating and I'm thinking yeah and I and I have a lot of good videos as well and the Q&A sessions are beautiful definitely you've enjoyed it I think of myself in a way that Shaitaan is happy this is Haram because with time I'll justify anything that I do by saying to myself yeah yeah I have treated man so many people enjoy my lectures I am I'm way in paradise but praising people and things related to dunya is definitely permissible and recommended so your wife does a good job in preparing a meal Wow the food is great masha'Allah you're a great cook this is nothing religion this isn't dunya she wears a beautiful dress even it's not beautiful yeah she faked it Wow look at this dress is so beautiful you look gorgeous I don't know which is making the other more beautiful you making the dress beautiful or the dress making you look beautiful this gives you fuel for a whole year of compliment she's satisfied this is totally permissible so when you come to the issue of the nature of men and women it's different women love to be praised you have to praise them even if you like it just if this light is a good deed it's Halong say how
