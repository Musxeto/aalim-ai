  "transcript": "our says can we give the cat or sadaqa to say it if no how can we help them financially first of all what is saying it saying it is a title given by the people to those who are from the lineage of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and usually specifically those who are the descendants of al-hussein and at hasson the sons of ali bin abu talib whose mother was Fatima the daughter of the prophet sallallaahu sanam so they would they were the grandchildren of the Prophet Allah so Salaam whom we know that he had no male sons of his surviving him so his lineage was through his daughters zina who had oh mama built a Balazs and the children of ali among them is it has an Andal Hossein among them because they had more than those so they usually described those descendants of the Prophet SM as being saying it and the proper Islamic terminology would be a debate so the zakat is it permissible to give it to the people order the descendants of the Prophet Ã¥lesund answer is no this is prohibited because the Prophet Allah so Sam himself told us that the zakat is the dirt of the people when I have wealth and I give 2.5 zakat this is like cleansing my wealth with the zakat money so it is not befitting to be given to the Honorable descendants of the Prophet erase awesome the Prophet said that these zakat money is the filth of the people's wealth and it's inappropriate to be taken by the descendants of the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam but why is that because in Islam if it were practice correctly anyone who is from the descendants of the Prophet Allah so salam would have 20% of the homes which the Prophet Azzam and his descendants must be given and allocated for them their share from the bootys of war and they would have their share from the income of the state and this is to elevate their level of life and not to make them beg from people unfortunately know where this is being implemented and this leads to us seeing a lot of the descendants of the prophet alayhi salatu salam being in poverty and no one is giving them money so what to do the majority of scholars say that we must not give them from the zakat but shaykh al-islam even taymiyah may Allah have mercy on his soul and so is so did say Sheikh Hamad Masada hath Amin said that if they were deprived from their right in the Treasury of the Muslim Ummah and they were not giving their rights in this case it is totally permissible to give them from the zakat money because of their need as for general charity this is permissible throughout because charity is not the filth of people unlike the zakat Allah says in in the zakat Hoodman amaura him sadaqa or prophet of allah take from their wealth sadaqa that is a cat that you purify them with but the general charity this is permissible inshallah"
