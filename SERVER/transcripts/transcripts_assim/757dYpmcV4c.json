  "title": "Is it prohibited for a Widow to stand under an open sky, see men photos or watch tv (nonmahram men)?",
  "transcript": "Sumbul says, ìMy father died a few days back, and there are people who tell my mom that she cannot go to a place where the sky is visible, and also cannot use mobile phone as there are menís photos or videos on social media, and she cannot watch TV. Are these restrictions correct?î The answer is, ìNo,î and we pray for your fatherís forgiveness. And may Allah forgive his sins and expand his grave and fill it up with fragrances of paradise. A widow, who is your mom, must mourn her husband for four months and ten days. And mourning the deceased husband is by staying in her house, which she used to live with her husband in, the entire time, not adorn herself, not wear perfumes, not go out unless it is a necessity or a huge need is there for such a thing. And she remains there for four months and ten days, and thatís it. She could go to the roof, and sunbathe if she wants. The claim that she is not permitted to see the sky or where the sky is visible is totally bogus. This is not part of Islam. The claim that she is not allowed to watch TV or see the photos of men is totally unheard of. Yes, she is not allowed to do something haram, to watch movies, to listen to music, to see inappropriate photographs. Yeah, this is haram, whether sheís mourning her husband or not. Of course, when sheís mourning, it is even worse. But she can watch TV, halal things, she can watch lectures of shuyukh and learn her religion, she can watch the news, she can do things that are normal people do when it is halal. As for not wearing perfume or adorning herself, this is a given and she has to do this part as part of mourning her husband, and Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
