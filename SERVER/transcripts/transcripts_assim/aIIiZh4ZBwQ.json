  "transcript": "[Music] so mahreen says is it permissible for ladies to pray under the sky without any roof at the top the answer is quite weird because women are like men so if men can pray in the open what would a woman do if she's in the desert or off-roading or whatever there's no restriction none whatsoever for a woman to pray without any roof on top of her head or in the open at all"
