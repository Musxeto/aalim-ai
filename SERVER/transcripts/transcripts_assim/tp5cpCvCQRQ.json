  "transcript": "insan from the emirates says they in their country follow an imam and this imam does a lot of weird things and the people they they do a lot of things and the things he described uh fits the super sufis who celebrate the birthday of their mawlana's their imams tijani gilani or they even celebrate the birthday of the prophet muhammed in what they call it and this is filled with innovations it was never reported in the sunnah of the prophet al-assad it was never done by the companions may allah be pleased with them it was never done by the taber in or tabi tabi so excuse me who are you following and he said that these things are backed by hadith and this is a blatant lie search in the quran and in the sunnah you will never find the companions chanting and saying right and left and as they do in their circles in arabic the super sufis they sit and they chant about uh the prophet's birth and how miraculous it was and how he came out of his mother's womb prostrating on the ground excuse me what is this and when they reach this stage they stand up all of them in this gathering they have to stand up and they have to bring bottles of perfume and start sprinkling it all over the place and they chant the hussaini and they what is this he said ah the soul of the prophet because we've mentioned his birth is blessing our gathering so we're putting these perfumes so that he would find a good stand and we are welcoming him what what is this so again this is all blatant lies and innovation and fabrication and something wrong in these people's heads is this your love to the prophet alice islam to chant and dance like this doing something no one had ever done from the favorite three generations you know more than them no no no we don't but we love the prophet more and such innovations i've asked one of the elders once and i said uncle this is an innovation he said yes but this is an indication of the love of the prophet it's not an innovation in religion i said okay what happens if i was with you and i did not stand up everybody stood up i refused to stand up wallahi he said to me in a serious voice you will be paralyzed so i said if this is not part of the religion where is if you're intimidating me that if i don't stand up i'm going to be paralyzed and you don't think this is part of the religion what is this so don't doubt your deen your deen is very easy it's very clear it's open for everybody and what these guys are doing is not according to islam none whatsoever"
