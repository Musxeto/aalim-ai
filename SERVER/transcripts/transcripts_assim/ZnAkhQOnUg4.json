  "title": "Feeding the poor to give the reward to deceased | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Norrell Hooda asks about mich ban and mesh ban is a feast to feed the society and the poor people this is something called a solo co-op meaning that the reward is being redirected to the deceased and this total arrangement is for my late parents and late brother-in-law he says my wife keeps arguing with me that this is all non-muslim traditions can you give us an advice first of all your wife is knowledgeable and what she's saying is true in Islam if a person dies we are to mourn that person for three days with the exception of a widow she mourns for 4 months and 10 days but normal people a father died a brother a sister a wife he mourns for three days meaning that he may prevent himself from wearing perfume or for him having a bath or from any wearing nice clothes out of sadness but after the third day it's over he must not continue morning sadness is in the heart but you have to display otherwise now what the people are doing such as at the end of the last third day they throw a party sort of invite people to eat and then on the seventh day or the tenth and then the vast majority do it on the fortieth day and this is all coming from the old ancient Egyptians the Pharaohs used to believe that the soul of the dead Pharaoh would come back on the 40th day that's why in the graves in their pyramids they used to put horses and jewelry and food and mail and water believing that they will be resurrected 40 days later and they will continue to live and this came down to us and the Muslims are doing it then they celebrate the anniversary of the deceased every single year not only that they gather people and they feed them and they make a feast this is all innovation it was never done by a prophet or a solution I'm whom we assumingly take as our role model he is the representative of Islam to us so if he did not do it and if his companions did not do it does you would does our scholars know more or do our scholars know more is this logical do those who preach and insist on these innovations invading us do they know more than a prophet as a salam if they say no then hamdallah if they say well they don't say well you're a Muslim you should follow the Prophet Sam and his companions they said it's not harmful yeah how would you know it's harmful or not if you do not follow the footsteps of the Prophet as a Salaam you'll be misguided to somewhere else you will not end up in paradise if you follow his footsteps you will definitely end up with him with the grace of a large Oriole so this is totally not acceptable and it is an innovation you want to benefit the deceased you love them and you want to benefit them here what you should do one make duaa so whatever you make duaa or Allah have forgiveness over my deceased so-and-so or Allah expand his grave or Allah fill it with light or Allah give him from your bounties and favors and blessing or Allah do this do I ask Allah for forgiveness forgive his sins etc number two give charity so you see an orphan that needs sponsoring give him charity on behalf of my deceased aunt or my brother-in-law you see a message it is to be built you give them from their money you see an Islamic satellite channel like that like Hoda and you want something that is generating on and on good deeds and so a band reward sponsor them give them money and this would ensure that they are continuing to give dower number three you have performed your own Rama number four you have performed your own hatch once in a lifetime then you can perform Umrah or Hajj on behalf of a deceased you don't have to go there physically you appoint someone who goes to perform number and Hajj on their behalf pay him the money and this does the job and insha'Allah you have benefited them definitely far greater and more than feeding the poor or having a feast etc"
