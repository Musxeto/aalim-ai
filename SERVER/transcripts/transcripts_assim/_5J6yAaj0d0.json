  "transcript": "[Music] Shalonda behemoth hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa l-'alameen sayyidina wa nabina Habibi Ana Muhammadan sallallahu alayhe wa alihi wa sahbihi ajma'in assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa barakaatuh if you recall it's quite critical that we emphasize on this last time we met we spoke about the Prophet Ali salatu salam postponing and delaying salat an answer until the Sun has set and we know that we have to pay on time however sometimes we have a meeting sometimes we are engaged in something or we're at the hospital or in a government office and we are unable to pray so we think until the following prayer comes so can I pray Allah can I make up for the prayer that I've missed or not it's an issue of dispute among scholars the majority say this you can your sinful but you can however the most authentic opinion is that you cannot pray a prayer that it's time was over unless the reason for you missing it is legitimate and what are the legitimate reasons the Prophet says allah√≠s alot was salam if a person sleep over a prayer or forgets it not delay it he forgets it then he should pray it as soon as he remembers it he should pray it as soon as he remembers it because there is no kuffara there is no expiation except that now analyse the hadith there is no kuffara meaning that he did a sin he was asleep and if you're asleep Eliza just doesn't burden you true he forgot it completely and if you forget something there's a large social hold you accountable no nevertheless the Prophet said that its expiration is to pray it as soon as you remember or as soon as you wake up and that is why I bent a Mia may Allah have mercy on her soul said salat is fixed on time in NASA Lata karna tell me Nina Keith Urban Makuta that it was prescribed in a specific time prayer is prescribed at a specific time meaning that if you do not pray it in its specific time you did not pray and likewise with everything that is time-bound in islam for example when do we stand on Mount Arafat on the ninth on the ninth of hedger of the ledger if someone takes the visa buys a ticket goes to the airport and then he's delayed in the airport because of a strike and then he reaches Saudi Arabia Jeddah Airport but then he has a problem with his visa and he's delayed for a day or two when it is the 12th of the ledger three days later he is cleared out he goes immediately to alpha and sits there with his umbrella what are you doing brother says I'm standing in out of her yes but we are affair is only limited to the ninth of The Hitcher close your umbrella and leave so no no I was forced to do this and I'm standing in out of her is his Hajj acceptable no because he did not do it on time likewise if someone's heard the Athan of Lahore and he's in a meeting and people tell him there is half an hour before also go and pray sir I'll just finish now quickly fifteen minutes ten minutes five minutes before the event I said I cannot leave we have negation I have to stay and then is called for also now what is his duty does he pray Lahore and then a sir even Tama says no he cannot pray Lord is gone huh what do you mean gone I want to make it up I want to do this it's football match or whatever all of these people did not pray prayer on time and the evidence is the hadith of the Prophet the two reasons forgetfulness and sleeping which a person is actually not sinful yet the Prophet said that the only explanation is to pray them as soon as he remembers makes it quite clear that if you deliberately postpone a prayer without any legitimate reason then in this case you cannot make it up okay what about the Prophet Allah so sternum the Prophet Allah so some might have forgotten it because of the fear and might have been postponed deliberately because we have two things on the scale your life or your prayer so you advance you prioritize it by saying no my life is more important once I'm able I pray and this cascades in sha Allah to all things that are hazardous to your life you may do this a pilot is in an emergency landing it's time for prayer he takes an hour or two flying in horrendous conditions one of the engineers out the other is on flames and he goes to the co-pilot listen I'm going to pray mother and come back the whole people are going to die going to crash this is an issue of emergency and one to do that I hope this makes it clear if you have any questions we will allocate this insha'Allah at the end of the segment the grace of Allah we move on to hadith number 52 and who will give us the honor yes / narrated in their bus once a large messenger sallallahu alayhe wassallam delayed the sharp rare then umar IBN al-khattab said o prophet of allah the woman and the children have slept the Prophet came out and water was trickling from his head and then said Harun I thought it hard for her followers I would have ordered them to offer us a lot each our prayer at this time Bukhari this hadith as we've mentioned so many times is a manifestation to what the Prophet wished that is a lot to say of course there are a number of narrations of this hadith and each narration is used differently in different chapters for example the same hadith of Ana's a different narration this is by Abbas a different narration by Ana's may Allah be pleased with him that the Prophet is amused to delay the aja prayer until the Companions waiting for the prayer in the Masjid would fall drowsy and their heads would their chins would touch their chest because of their you know browsing and waking so a lot of the scholars used this narration in the chapters dealing with Pajaro why to emphasize whether sleeping nullifies food or not so does sleeping know if I would oh yes or no yes I've seen people doing this deep sleep yes deep sleep and what does deep sleep by itself no leaf I swallow no the scholars say it is means of nullification but the sleep itself does not know if I would do and that is why the Prophet is an ambien on thetic I did that the eye is similar to the rope that you tie a water container made of leather with so the eye to the anus because if you're awake you know if something comes out of you if you pass wind so the Prophecy's the eye to the anus is like the rope that ties a leather water container if you close it the Rope is untied which means that the water would come out and likewise if you sleep the possibility of you passing wind without peeling it is quite possible that is why sleep itself is not means of actual nullification of the Woodill but it causes two and therefore the scholars say if a person sleeps lightly while being able to feel the surroundings then this does not know if I would example a person is in a taxi going back to the hotel or in a bus or in a train and he is shaking and you know children the minute you put them in cars they because of the shaking of the movement we grown-up also have this problem if you're tired and if you're in the car you just may do this and you know your head goes right and left and turning now does this mean I have notified my although scholars you know because while I'm in this drowsiness if someone says awesome is fact I immediately am alert I work out what do you mean by I'm fat and if someone tries to steal something from my pocket I immediately I'm alert why because I'm sitting I'm in a ready position scholars say that is why if you are sitting down and your drowsiness is light and you can feel the environment then this napping does not nullify your would do but if you're lying down it's different than when you're sitting up because you're sitting up the position is not helping you to pass wind for example if you're lying down and you go into a nap usually you would not feel a thing and those who are lying down people come and take things from their pocket you know what make change of the money and put the wallet back again and they do not feel anything this is definitely means of breaking your Moodle so this hadith was using a number of different chapters here the Prophet as salam postponed salat and the companions were waiting patiently but Omar may Allah be pleased with him because he saw what was happening he complained to the Prophet alehissalaam What did he say this is a sha Allah what we will find after the break so stay tuned [Music] purrs of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him Ana's bin Malik may Allah be pleased with him narrated that The Messenger of Allah peace be upon him said seeking knowledge is compulsory on every Muslim Celyn even ammaji vol 1 chapter 17 hadeeth number 2 - 4 Oh courage it takes to stand up for what you believe in courage it takes to be true and righteous courage it takes to dare and answer your questions or be they social or political or economic or educational or religious to get clear and convincing answers test your courage and question me in there to ask dad to ask tomorrow at 7:00 p.m. Saudi Arabia and 8:00 p.m. UAE on peace TV the Prophet sallallahu wasallam said each person's every joint must perform a charity purity is half a face every day of our lives every part of our body is owed to Allah spot Allah in worship every step you take towards the place of prayer is charity gratitude for our creation gratitude for our health gratitude for everything which we received from Allah so Allah is our daily requirement as Muslims watch a mod eminent in prophetic hadith next on peace TV [Music] assalamualaikum and welcome back the hadith of even our best may Allah be pleased with him stated that the prophet alayhi salatu salam delayed aisha prayer until roman hot tub complained to the Prophet sallallahu taala and this shows us that it is ok to advise someone who is older than you someone who is greater and bigger than you because this would not be impolite and we always make the mistake of thinking that if a share or an imam there's something wrong it is impolite to go and correct him or advise him no this is wrong you have to correct him and invite them but what you should avoid is to do it in an insulted way or in a rude way or to make it to the public so that you would discredit him this is something that would not be advisable so Omar says the prophet of Allah women and children they are there and they are having a problem because they fell asleep and this is not appropriate place for them to fall asleep and the Prophet came out with his head showered recently and the Prophet said by Allah had I not feared that I would burden myoma I would have made this time mandatory for them to pray Russia in why is that the more you come to the middle of the night to the last third of the night this is the preferred time for Allah soldier and that is why the best time of the day for us is the last third of the night two or three hours before Fajar before the break of dawn this is the time of the righteous the time of the ignorant it's this time because they sleep the righteous always wake before such a time they make that hatchet they make their whitter they recite their portion of the Quran they ask Allah for forgiveness because this is a time when allah azza wajal descends to the lower heaven and he as they were JAL calls his servant is there anyone who asks me so that I can answer him is there anyone who seeks my forgiveness so I would forgive him is there anyone seeking my repentance so that I would repent over him every night this happens and rarely we wake up for this great opportunity of answering allah azza wajal so we should try our best to devote some of the night for the sake of allah azza wajal we open the floor for questions we take one question from my right and one question from my left hope those who on the left would get the microphone ready yes are she slowly michelle share when somebody insults our asses l'm what should the muslims do number one and number two when you see in the Battle of French our system was fearful or he had fear maybe so is there a Delisle for that in the Battle of trench yeah because Rosa misses us Salah he was fearful or he had fear is there a Delisle for that as far as a Susan is concerned as for the first question whenever someone insults the Prophet alles klar Justin and we have to look on the circumstances if we are in an Islamic state that practices Islam and implements Islam this person should be taken to the authorities and he should be tried and then executed there is no playing with the Prophet Allah so Salaam unfortunately this is not applied or applicable except at one or two countries in the world Islamic countries and therefore nowadays if someone insults the Prophet aresome or attacks the Prophet al-assad's Aram due to the fact that we're not living in Muslim countries or we're living in Muslim countries that is not practicing Islam we have nothing that we can do except to shun that person and leave him and not communicate with him dis communicate completely with that person as for the second question what is the evidence that the Prophet asam was afraid I did not say he was afraid in the sense that he feared the enemy so he was fleeing them fear is a natural thing and the Prophet Allah saw some was human so he might have been intimidated he might have been trying to avoid what was happening of clashes of someone attacking and this is only human there is nothing degrading or unworthy of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam his anticipation and his being there on the watch until other time was over and moderate sunset was there is a clear indication that this is what had happened yet it is not in the sense that oh the Prophet was afraid that he's a coward nobody thinks this way and at the same time we would not say that the prophet ina so Sam was a superhuman and that he was not a natural person this is also not the case and Allah surgeon knows best yes brother Thank You Salam do we have to offer Sunnah with the first Salam which is offered after the prescribed time with the legitimate reason excellent question the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he told us to pray immediately as we remember it he did not indicate what to do regarding the sunnah prayer and the scholars say as long as the reason is legitimate as if you are praying it on time so if I oversleep on Fajr prayer and I wake up at 10 a.m. what is the first thing I do I pray Sunnah tell fetcher and then pray the for two Rakas why because my prayer is legitimate and it was missed for a legitimate reason so I hope this answers your question yes brother Sheikh alhamdulillah the uniqueness of the timing which you mentioned which has been mentioned and we are blessed that anywhere in the anywhere any part of the world that could be father somewhere could be a sir so no time goes without the Muslims offering the Salar Hamid shake my question is that what happens in places like Scandinavian countries like Norway and other places where the Sun sets and after a little time it rises up again so what is the ruling on that regarding the countries that have sunrise and sunset the ruling applies even if the night was short even if it was two hours you have to pray in accordance to the timings given to you before while observing the Sun the question would not be here the question should have been what do the people in the north pole for example on the the fart its condemned in countries where night is prevailing they don't see the Sun for few months or few weeks or they see the Sun continuously throughout the day in this case we cannot determine our prayers by observing the Sun true because there is no break of dawn and there is no sunset what to do scholars say that alhamdulillah Islam did not leave any stone unturned in the sense that in the hadith of cinema Muslim where the Prophet as some was telling the companions about a Dajjal the Antichrist how many days he will spend on earth forty days one day is equivalent to a year one day is equivalent to a month a third is equivalent to a week and the rest of the days are like your normal days the first thing the Companions asked was a prophet of Allah the day that is equivalent to a year should we pray the prayer of one day meaning throughout this day only five prayers and the Prophet said no meaning that this year is actually three hundred and sixty days but the Sun takes 360 days to set so the Prophet says I have no you have to pray and calculate for your prayers meaning you have to estimate so we know that usually between fajar and the hood there is six or seven hours so okay now it's to her time and after two hours and a half it's also time and after three hours it's Maghrib time and after an hour and fifteen minutes is raesha time this is what the Prophet said Abdullah who had Allah calculate for the portion of the day as much as you can and that is why the major scholars and committees said that the people in Scandinavia and in the places where the Sun does not set they have to calculate the estimate how they estimate by looking at the closest country to their south where you can determine prayer times and they should follow them so if we are in the farthest north you go a little bit south 200 kilometers 300 kilometers and there's a country that has sunrise and sunset you follow their time affair likewise for fasting by the way how would these people fast the Sun is all week long or maybe a month long they say you have to do the same with fasting estimating when the Sun rise and when there is the Sun set as we know that praying father pray is of any Muslim skippered you're sleeping so is it a legitimate cause okay if you deliberately escape this is not a legitimate cause this is not a legitimate reason how do you skip it intentionally by setting the alarm clock at 6:30 or 7:00 o'clock you start work at 10:00 you set it at 9:00 o'clock deliberately in this case don't pray it don't even bother because you deliberately done that but if you go to bed at 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock and you set your alarm clock at 5:30 and you have for I know people who have four or five alarm clocks and if they can buy a cannon they would buy a cannon next to their ears and they never wake up and they feel remorse they feel depressed this is their nature would Allah hold them accountable the answer is no so skipping culture prayer for sleeping is a legitimate cause if you tried and failed but if you definitely did not try or went to bed late and you refused to set the alarm clock then you are sinful I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time for Manila or Salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah wa barakato [Music] a rose looks pleasing but when held together with other rose it becomes a beautiful bouquet a pearl has its charms but when stringed together with other pearls stands out as an exquisite necklace a brick has but little strength and use but when laid together with other
