  "title": "Mom took my similing picture with a Kufr Hand Symbol on her phone, ask her to remove it?",
  "transcript": "Yusuf from the Emirates. Yusuf? Salam Alaikum. Salam Alaikum. My mom, she has like some, it's like a hand symbol on her phone and I think it's not permissible to wear it. I don't know to be honest. But the thing is she took a picture of me and I was like smiling towards the camera. I don't know if I should tell her to remove this picture or not because I don't want to be smiling at like disbelief, you know. So if you can just clarify this. I don't understand the question. Your mom, what does she have on the phone? Like a hand symbol, you know, like this hand symbol. Some people told me, I don't know about it. It's, it might seem like a kufr symbol, you know. Okay. And what's, what's this related to you smiling? Because I was smiling at the camera and like when she looks at this picture, she might think that I'm smiling at disbelief, you know, so I don't know what to do. No, you shouldn't do nothing, Achi. This is too much overthinking. This is way above normal thinking. The hand symbol, for example, it might be any kind of a symbol. This is just a hand. So many people put hands because they like how it looks. There's nothing wrong in that. I've entered many houses and I've seen a statue of a hand. What is this? They said it's a wax module of our hand. We go to fun fairs and we put our hand for five minutes and they make this symbol up. There's nothing wrong in that. It's not a statue. But if the hand is the one that the deviant people think that it prevents the evil eye, this requires that we make sure that this is their intention. And you don't have any certainty in that. You're just jumping the gun and assuming. And this is not permissible to assume such evil thoughts. And your smiling to the camera has nothing to do with that, even if it was the evil symbol, because you don't know whether your mom is going to relate this to that and she's going to think that you're satisfied with this kufr or shirk. All of this is overthinking, Akhi, and this is not right. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
