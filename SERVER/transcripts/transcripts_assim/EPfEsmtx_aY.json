  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Nigeria. Sheikh in order to get a job a man had to \nchange his place of birth but not his lineage. He did not change his lineage \njust the place of birth,   and he also changed some other things, so \nhe couldn't get this job, so he gets the job   and then down the line after some years \nhe got to know that what he did was wrong,   so he regrets, and he makes Tobah but now in \nthis situation Sheikh is he still obligated   to leave this job, and is his wealth Haram \ndue to how he got the job Barak Allahu Feek. Wa Feekum Barak Allah. These are two different things, \none, if transparency and honesty   were not found while applying for a job \nthis is sinful. You're sinful for lying,   you're sinful for forging documents and changing \nyour birthplace or date of birth or anything that   is not related to the actual job. You're \nsinful for saying any misinformation,   you're married, or you're not \nmarried when it's not the truth. Getting a job - if you're not lying \nin the actual job, so they require   a bachelor's degree and you have one, \nthey require five years experience,   and you have actual five or more years \nexperience, you're qualified to do the job,   and you are actually qualified and exceeding \ntheir expectations, your income is 100% Halal.   You don't have to leave the job, \nyou don't have to do anything. What you have done in the first issue is \nlying, you should try to rectify this.   If there would be harm inflicted upon \nyou or maybe doing some jail time   or being sacked from your job. I believe \nthat you should repent and ask Allah for   forgiveness and leave things as because \nthis is not impacting your qualifications,   and it's not impacting your productivity and \nperformance in your job and Allah knows best."
