  "transcript": "Hamza from Bosnia Sheikh if somebody has a curly beard and it gets into his ears would it be justifiable to cut those only those hairs that are getting into the ears he's getting curly hair of his beard entering his ears yeah yes exactly I have had this beard for almost 40 years I don't imagine how it would grow into your ears but hypothetically hypothetically yeah he wash it thoroughly with shampoo put some conditioner maybe put some oil or hair gel and comb it and it will not interfere but again the rule is in Islam anything that harms you you can remove that so even if I have one of my eyelashes so long that it enters my eye and this happens or it could hamper my vision in this case I can only cut what is harmful so assuming that this happens with your ears you may do that inshallah"
