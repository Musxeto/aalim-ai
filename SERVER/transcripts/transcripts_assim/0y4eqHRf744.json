  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Italy the question is I saw one \nhadith in Riyaadh Al Saliheen hadith number 1764 he said that it's not allowed to fast \ntwo days in a row like example like I   can't fast Monday and Tuesday like \nthat, is that an authentic Hadith okay I will answer inshallah and Abu \nabdulrahman's question from Italy   he said he read a Hadith in Riyaadh Al Saliheen \nthat whoever it is not permissible to fast two   days in a row I personally have never heard of \nsuch a Hadith and I highly doubt the existence   of this Hadith nevertheless there is \na possibility and this happens a lot   that the translator of the Hadith made \nsuch an error which led to your confusion   and this happens a lot and this is why we \nalways say people you have to learn Arabic   if you want to understand your religion \nwithout outside interference in the sense that   the prophet said in an authentic Hadith are \nMartyrs in the cause of Allah other than   a person who dies on the battlefield and he \nmentioned one of them to be the the person   who dies with the disease or the pandemic \nthe plague now plague the person who dies   with it is known in Arabic as mataron because the \nplague is paroon the translator came to the word   and understood it through another meaning \nof it which is a stabbed person with a knife   pan so he thought that oh a person who dies \nwhile being stabbed with a knife is a martyr   this is not true the Hadith is specifically \ntalking about a person who dies by the plague   so this is a mistake in Translation \nthat may lead to someone being mugged   to saying to the mother come come \nstab me I want to be a Shahid a martyr   this is not right likewise when we come to the \nissue of a Hadith that a prophet Islam prohibited   continuously and simultaneously fasting meaning \nthat you must not fast continuously the whole year   without a break or that you must not connect \na day with another day and this is called   meaning that today is Sunday \nSunset comes I don't break my fast   I continue to fast till Monday sunset so \nI joined two days in one fasting this is   prohibited so maybe this is what the translator \nmisunderstood and failed to explain to you foreign"
