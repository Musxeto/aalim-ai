  "transcript": "he says he has a problem when um urinating or defecating afraid of splashes of impurity coming back to his body well we have a rule in islam which states certainty is not affected by doubt so what is certain here certainty is that your whole body is pure and there are no splashes there are no najasa so you cannot judge anything that touches your body to be nudges unless you have certainty otherwise it's doubtful otherwise it's pure so i feel sure that something came to my body some of the brothers says when i go to the toilet and i'm on my toilet seat i feel wetness on my shoulder what is this what are you doing even if you lay out a dinosaur egg the splashes from the toilet seat won't reach this high haven't you done any any any physics so these are all doubts how do i know there are doubts when you say i feel perhaps maybe i doubt i think all of these phrases indicate that these are doubts you should ignore abu haf"
