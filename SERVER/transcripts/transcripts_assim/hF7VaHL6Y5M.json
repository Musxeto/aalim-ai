  "transcript": "II love being a fan either one he manhandle a hillbilly I mean salam wa sallim wa barik alaa number matin Lilliana mean nabina muhammad in Wahiawa sabi woman Teddy honey he was sending a paternity Hideo medina and my bad dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this new episode of our values where we will be talking about one of the great values of all religions of all cultures something that all humans truly value and this is the value of truthfulness or honesty no one on earth likes people to lie to him we all love to be told the truth even if it hurts sometimes but to know that people are lying to you this is something that people do not like honesty is part of the characteristics of all messengers and prophets of Allah Azza WA JAL because they represent Allah they are the ambassadors of allah to humanity they convey what Allah wants from them Allah says in the Quran and mention in the book is marilla indeed he was true to his promise and he was a messenger and a prophet he was true to his promised whenever he promised whatever he said something he was always truthful and our prophet alayhi salaatu Sam the descendant of ismael is not at all far from that among his people he was known to be the truthful the honest and the trustworthy they used to give him their wealth and deposits so that he would safe keep it for them and the Prophet alehissalaam did not hate anything more than lying in the authentic hadith whenever the Prophet RA salatu salam would witness or sense a lie from one of his household he would not communicate with that individual until he repents to allah azza wajal and abandons whatever he was doing of such lies even the idol worshippers acknowledged the fact that the Prophet array Salam who later on became their enemy they acknowledge that he was truthful and honest when the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was ordered by allah to publicly called the people to islam he addressed the people of Quraysh he gathered all the tribes and he asked them if I were to tell you that there is an army on horseback who's almost close to invading you would you believe me and they said yes we've never ever experienced you giving us a single line and this was narrated by Bukhari and Muslim also Jarrah Abu Talib as we mentioned yesterday when he presented his case to the Abyssinian Emperor he told him that the first thing the Prophet ordered us to do is to be truthful when we speak yawn when he was with the Byzantine Emperor Basilius as they call him the Basilius or the emperor said to abu sufyan I asked you what does this prophet or do you order you to do so you claim that he orders you not to worship other than Allah and he orders you to be truthful to pray to be chaste and to fulfill your promises and to safe keep your deposits or what you were entrusted with and this is the description of a prophet now this is the words of the emperor of byzantium he knows this from his sacred books and each and every one of us does not want to be labeled as a hypocrite we fear being labeled as a hypocrite and this is why the Prophet tells us having a salatu was-salam in an authentic hadith there are four characteristics whoever has them all is a pure hypocrite and whoever has one of them has one of the characteristics of hypocrisy until he gives it up what are these the Prophet says re so solemn when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust when he speaks he lies when he makes a covenant he breaks it and when he disputes he resorts to obscene speech these horrible characteristics are combined and found in hypocrites and if you watch the media you can see that a lot of the politicians it fits them as a glove and this is a sign of hypocrisy when you speak and you lie this is problematic and it goes without saying that one of the prominent characteristics of a Muslim whether he is in Siberia or in the jungles of Africa or in the Amazon whether he is in Paris or in Monaco or or in Manila it's the same a Muslim does not lie a Muslim does not break the trust and this is why Allah says in the Quran describing the believers and those who are to their trusts and promises a tentative and they always come side-by-side being honest and truthful and safe keeping other people's trust the prophets lra salatu salam he said that there are four characteristics if you have them nothing of this world you miss would affect you so if you have these four characteristics you are you are in good hands what are they the Prophet says are a sorcerer safe keeping trust or deposit truthfulness when you speak good moral conduct and manners and halal pure provisions and food if we manage to get these four things in us nothing harms us if we miss from this dunya and what is honesty and truthfulness it is saying or the rhetoric we use that fits reality and it fits what's in your intention and the intention of the person listening to you what does this mean I could say something that's truthful to me but not to others for example if I took this pen and someone is accusing me of taking it and I say no I did not take it is a swear about it so I say well I I did not take the pen and I mean another pen that is not the one I have in my pocket I mean the pen in the cupboard for example or in the drawer this doesn't work this is a lie though I did not say anything that was a lie the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam the oath you make is on the intention of the one asking you to make it not on my intention I intended something else so what I said was not wrong but because I made an oath according to what he requested it should be according to his intention lying is opposite to belief as Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him said o people beware of lying because it contradicts Eman you cannot say la ilaha illa-llah the testimony of faith without having honesty and truthfulness to it that goes against lying Allah Azza WA JAL in a chapter of the Quran called it hypocrisy or the hypocrites Al Manar kun tells us in the very beginning of the surah of this chapter that even when the hypocrites come to you and say we believe that you are the Messenger of Allah Allah knows that they're lying so what they had said though it is true that you are the Messenger of Allah but because their intention was not purer than they were liars so the hypocrites who say la ilaha illaallah because it lacks sincerity and it lacks honesty it is projected and it would not help them and this is why the Prophet said Alice or some whoever testifies that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger sallallahoalyhiwasallam truthfully and honestly from his heart Allah would make Hellfire Haram for him he will not enter Hell fire so truthfulness is very important and this is why allah so jal orders us by saying o you who believe fear allah and be with those who are true truth honesty leads you to gender of course you will have bumps on the way because when you say the truth you may get embarrassed you may get in trouble people may hate you for that but as long as you are truthful and saying what pleases allah azzawajal it will take you to Jenna the Prophet said Alice a lot Salam be truthful for truth guides you to righteousness and righteousness guides you to Jenna and stay away from lying because lying takes you to sins and sins takes you to Hellfire truthfulness is so praised in Islam that it leads to a Las love and to his messengers love for you the Prophet said that is awesome if you want Allah and His Messenger to love you then you have to give what you were entrusted with you have to be truthful when you speak and you have to be kind to your neighbors if you do these three things Allah the Almighty will love you now sometimes we ask what are the fields that we're supposed to be truthful in first of all we have to be truthful with allah azza wajal so truthfulness with allah is another word for sincerity allah azza wajal says and they were not commanded except to worship Allah being sincere to him in religion inclining to truth you can't worship allah azza wajal without sincerity standing in prayer while intending to impress your boss not to fulfill the commands of Allah this definitely is shirk you are in the wrong place part of sincerity is that you are truthful with Allah when you do something when you vow something when you promise allah azza wajal to do something and I said me another may Allah be pleased with him could not witness the Battle of better on the second year of hijra because the Prophet did not think Ali saws and he was going to battle so not a lot of the Muslims went but after the battle was over he pledged that if I were to witness another battle Allah will see what I will perform and do so Anna 7 another the following year on the Battle of hood he saw the Muslims retreating and he said I can smell the fragrance of Jenna beyond the Mount of a hood and he charged he charged at the enemy and he fought bravely until he was martyred his nephew - of animalic says that when we searched in the martyrs among the bodies we could not find him that is we could not recognize him because he was so badly wounded until his sister came and recognized him by his fingers she recognized him by his hands he said may Allah be pleased with him that we found 80-plus strokes of swords of spears or shots of arrows and the idol worshippers mutilated his face and body anis may Allah be pleased with him says that we the Companions used to believe that this ayah was revealed in the likes of an assembly another my uncle what ayah Allah says among the believers are men true to what they promised Allah they are true in what they promised Allah among them is he who has fulfilled his vow to death and among them is he who awaits his chance and they did not alter the terms of their commitment by any alteration to be sincere to be honest with allah azza wajal and your honesty is rewarded even if it does not materialize the Prophet said Alice awesome whoever asks allah azzawajal for martyrdom honestly and truthfully truthfully Allah will grant him the levels of the martyrs in Jannah even if he dies on his bed among the fields of being honest and truthful is when we speak so a Muslim should always be truthful in all of his situations whether he's serious or joking whether he's angry or pleased whether he's communicating with someone near and relative or with a stranger and someone who's far he must avoid lying lying is one of the worst characteristics that a person could have and Arabs before Islam and after Islam they abhorred lying and they would dis communicate with anyone if they found out that he is a liar among the fields of being truthful is your actions so your actions when you deal with others should always be honest and truthful you should be transparent inside out so you don't deal with others while intending something opposite this this is treachery it's the style of hypocrites Allah says among the people are those who say we believe in Allah and in the day of judgement and they are not believers these are the hypocrites who say and pretend what they're not actually are and among the things that indicate your honesty in action is fulfilling your vows and your promises Allah says and they who are to their trusts and their promises attentive and we see this in so many non-muslims when we deal with them that they are honest take this try it for a month if you don't like it return it and money is refunded a lot of the Muslims say wow this is fantastic we can fool them we can do this we can do that no you cannot but why are these non Muslims truthful maybe because of their upbringing they had good parents maybe because they understand and know if they were to be exposed the law would put them behind bars and they fear the justice of the law maybe they know that people trust those who are honest and this means this is good for business and this is why they're honest Muslims do not do this Muslims are honest because their religion tells them because Allah commands them because their role model Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa sallam was honest so it is not a choice to be honest here and I'll be dishonest here you have no choice other than to be truthful 24/7 and among the fields of being truthful is with our children we often lie to our children it's not sufficient to tell them to preach them to lecture them how important it is to be truthful they have to see us walk the talk the prophet alayhi salatu salam as in the hadith of the love Namur and the love grammar says my mom once called me and she said come I will give you and the Prophet Ison was present so the Prophet said Alice was and what were you going to give him so she showed him the Prophet as Salam she showed him in her hand some dates so the Prophet said Salah Holly or Salim have you not had you not given him dates it would have been recorded against you as a lie so even the things we tell our children come come I'll give you then we grab the child this is a lie that Allah would hold us accountable to among the things that we have to be truthful in our transactions and this is a big area for lying and cheating and betraying because all what I'm concerned with is to get my merchandise sold so if I have to lie to you to extract some money I'll do that and unfortunately we we have seen so many practicing or it seems to us that they're practicing brothers who may pray who may perform Umrah who may look practicing but when it comes to transactions they cheat they betray if they convince themselves that they're doing something that is Helen I don't know how they go to bed and sleep but they have embezzled they have taken other people's wealth and they've lied convincing themselves that they have done nothing wrong the Prophet said is awesome the two who buy and sell from one another have the choice to cancel or to go through as long as they are in the same meeting area they have not departed physically if they say the truth the Prophet said Alice assalam and they disclose whether there are defects or or or the likes if they say the truth and disclose the truth they're transparent Allah will put blessing in their transaction but if they lie and conceal the blessing will be taken away the Baraka would go from their wealth from their health from their transaction and this is why it is extremely important to be truthful when you sell and buy so one asks what are the factors that we can use in order to be truthful first of all the Quran the Sunnah so many verses and a hadith that are compelling us to be truthful and to avoid lying then there is logic because your logic should drive you to tell the truth the line of lie is short people will discover this we'll disgrace you for the rest of your life to be known as a liar always be truthful and your logic tells you that this is something that would be good for you to follow suit of righteous people everywhere and at all times and on the top of the list are the messengers and prophets of Allah so as well then the companions of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when you take them as role models you have no choice but to be truthful and also good company when you are surrounded by liars inevitably you will lie but if you are surrounded by people of truth and honesty you will have no choice but to be like them Allah says o you who believe fear Allah and be with those who are true and asking Allah supplicating to Allah like the Prophet used to do allahís alot was salam when he used to say and guide me to the best of moral conduct no one guides to it except you and divert me and make me go away from the worst of them no one makes me go away from it except you Allah making duaa to purify your heart and to purify your tongue from saying anything that is false also you have to strive train work out by forcing yourself not to lie now there are so many things that one has to understand being truthful is a package deal it is part of your Eman it is a branch of Eman if you do not fulfill it you're not a true believer it is not something that is an accessory I may pick it up and I may leave it it is sad when people lie and then they have to come and apologize apologizing is good by the way but why lie in the first place why relay and transmit rumors just because you heard it and you say well I so-and-so did so-and-so and I've heard so and so and then it is a lie you say I didn't like I just transmitted what I heard the Prophet said that is a lot of Sun it is sufficient sin upon you to relay whatever you hear so do not do such a thing and make sure before you talk that what you're saying is authentic is real you can talk endlessly about the sins people get from these smartphones or [ __ ] phones when they use whatsapp Instagram snapchat Twitter Facebook and they transmit so many false hadith lies about Allah lies about the Prophet al-assad Sarah just simply because someone sent it to them and they are doing the same lying is a major sin and being truthful being honest is a characteristic of a true Muslim it is one of the greatest values that we are proud of and i pray to allah azza wajal that he makes me and you among those who are honest and truthful we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu today i'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader abu huraira may allah be pleased with him said the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said no one's wealth helped me as much as the wealth of abu bakr helped me after which abu bakr began to weep and say and is my life and wealth for anything besides you o messenger of allah this narration shows the level of etiquette and humbleness that abu bakr may allah be pleased with him had in the presence of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam for he likened himself to a slave of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa send him by saying that his wealth was only for the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam as well as his soul and self this comes as no surprise for the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam has more rights on the believers than themselves he may Allah be pleased with him spent his wealth in the cause of Allah and he consoled the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa send him through his own self so the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam recognized that for him and said in order to build his teacher and to remind the ummah of his virtues no one's wealth helped me as much as the wealth of abu bakr helped me among the benefits of this narration it is important to keep good manners and humbleness in the presence of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam thanking someone who has bestowed some favor on you as well as supplicating for them is part of having good manners reported by albahari reported by Al Timothy and eben majeure Albani ruled it authentic in his book sahih al German the explanation of a Cindy on the book of eben Majah and at a seer Bashar al JAMA a surreal I said I wanna come over to LA and welcome back may wish says what is the ruling on those who are fasting and watching food videos all day long in two circumstances one to learn how to make something for iftar two out of pure enjoyment now this doesn't affect your fasting per se because if you know the things that nullify your fasting then anything else does not so watching videos of preparing food or even of people eating doesn't have an impact on your fasting however these programs that are preparing food usually are accompanied by a lot of music there is a lot of free mixing the chaff is usually a woman and she is accompanied by a man or a number of men guests chit chatting laughing the and the likes joking and this is Haram so for you whether you're fasting or not this is not permissible for you to watch and the Prophet used to seek sallallahu alayhi wasallam he used to seek refuge in Allah from knowledge that is not beneficial this knowledge your watching while fasting were you supposed to be low or in your gaze and not engaging in something that is wasting your time this knowledge is not essential it's not medicine it's not engineering it's not something that would give you money and with the mentioned circumstances it is not something essential for you to learn such recipes any food would do we do not live to eat we eat to live so one has to draw the line if you're a woman and she's a woman and you mute the music if there there is any and there is no mixing and you watch there's no impact on that on your CRM insha'Allah on your fast Kiran says I do not know how to pray taraweeh and this is the problem with so many girls in my country so we do not pray them I heard it is similar to praying Feder is this so what sewers one should read after fatiha if one does not know a lot of the Quran Quran this is not a legitimate excuse all what it takes is few minutes if you just simply write the word taraweeh in the search box in www Islam queue a dot info this is the most trusted Islamic site in this world with Islamic knowledge if you write taraweeh it gives you so many answers with explanations but in a nutshell taraweeh is part of the big umbrella the bigger umbrella is called night prayer what is night prayer any voluntary prayer you offer after Isha and before the break of dawn before the Adana fajar you have like eight ten depending on the region you live in ten hours 11 hours maybe less this night time after Asia after you've concluded your Asia prayer anything you pray is called night prayer TI male and under it is taraweeh taraweeh is a specific night prayer designated in the month of Ramadan it is preferable and recommended for men to pray it in congregation in the Masjid women can perform it in the message but it is best for them to perform at home like every other night during the year as it is night prayer how to perform it piece of cake the best is to pray eleven raka every single night whether in Ramadan or other than Ramadan how do we pray this to sing eleven records you pray two rakahs like fetcher finish Dasha Hood offer Salaam then you stand up and pray another two rakahs so you complete eight rocailles these eight rak'ahs are considered part of night prayer then you conclude your night prayer with three Rakas known as whitter and the format is up to you either you pray 2 rakaats like the previous ones conclude with Salam then pray one single raka with witcher fatiha anise or and there are prescribed sewers but if not no problem is there any prescribed sewers for the 11 records no the sky is the limit the three last records the Witter is prescribed that you recite al elahh then Alka fuel then Alice Paul who Allahu Ahad that's it if not no problem if I don't memorize a lot of the sewers only short surahs what to do you can recite that you could repeat them over and over well in the standing position you can even hold the Koran in your hand you can even hold a mobile phone or a PDA a tablet or whatever put it in front of you or hold it and read from it so that you would prolong the standing position it is very simple very easy the essence of it the quality time you spent worshipping allah azza wajal and reciting his book his words that nothing is beloved to him more than it and to supplicate and to seek Allah's forgiveness aisha says when I joined the Imam when he is in his record or sujood or any other position other than the standing position how many takbirs should I say should I just say the inaugural takbir and go directly into ruku or say Allahu Akbar again and then bow before I go to your question I sure I will answer Asif from India finale it's an anthem ah yes I have a question in fact actually I have a friend and his concepts are very surprising and I don't know how to answer so that is the reason I'm asking actually you know for example the things like keeping beer or keeping the cloth evil ankles his logics are abnormal and he said these are not a part of Dean these are living to the places and the times there for example Allah they were using long dresses and all and for example for beard these abnormal or that kind of things I had this and all but he told that no no it's not a part of him and we are not obliged to go further so how to answer in a good way any more questions I will answer in Shalom so we have Mohammed from Gambia okay I think we lost Mohammed so Isis question was joining the Imam when he's not standing so if the Imam is in the record or in the sujood and I want to join him what to do it basically you have to do two takbir the first one is takbir at all Haram the inaugural takbir which is a pillar if you miss it there is no pray here so you say allahu akbar and then you say Allahu Akbar to move whether to recur or to salute with it with whatever position the mm is in these are two tech beers the first tech beer is a pillar the second tech beer is mandatory but definitely a pillar is bigger than an obligation therefore scholars say if you say one takbir alone and you intend with it takbir Atul Haram the inaugural takbir this would suffice for you so if the Imam is in the record position and I walk to the row I stand and I say Allahu Akbar and I bow without repeating another takbir this is perfectly fine but if I do too that would be better and safer so I hope this answers your question as for Asaph's question he says that he has a friend and this friend is ignorant no matter how many times he shows him the hadith where the Prophet Allah saw some orders the Muslims to grow the beard and to not allow their pants and trousers and the likes or garments to go below the ankles the man still rejects this and said no no this is not true is a cultural thing it depends on the environment the society the people the timing the error etc so see how can I convince such a person and my question as if by why even bother with such people there are people who are truth seekers they want to be convinced they want to be taught spend your time with them because there are others who are an illness to know they are diseased they are a waste of time so if someone just for the sake of argument keeps on debating and arguing and saying rubbish why waste your time it's 12 o'clock noon and you tell someone that this is the Sun in the middle of the sky and he says how would I know it's the Sun and not another star proved that to me this is crazy why would I waste my time with such imbeciles my friend if you show someone the Quran or the hadith of the Prophet Isis I mean he rejects it and he uses his logic do not even waste a second with him leave them and never speak to them about this because they are not truth seekers Mohammed from Gambia yeah yes yeah yes yeah if you make a move at your home and you want to go to the mosque it can you use that room again go towards my is it valid okay I will answer in sha Allah so Muhammad from Gambia's okay we have aid from Morocco oh yes yeah yes sir oh my consonant Allah it his pump is inside is what the children is building it and manage it his tent is inside his tent or his grave it ain't too much it when we pried the grave is talking okay I will answer each other okay I understand okay barik alaa fig mum douche from ghana shakes another law you know I I'm fine I'm below what kind of do for your mom doing under a very questionable yes my first question is there you no more my mom said something about me in public and you know like what he says knocks who is true but she always said it to make it their life so there was a little bit like inside so there can I be all red hair or can I these are collected to be disgrace okay so can i quality or actually the little one quality which is something about you right not about others yeah about me okay second question help what yeah and then the second question is if I have a woman pay you kiddo breakfast you're a woman a bad price and everything the wedding everything is done you think I mean you came through money like money and when they will mark and the woman decides to give the money back to the man Wendy Amari all kind it's kind she decides to lend the money to the room I don't buy them the woman the man a little credit back third question yeah that's all he okay I would answer inshallah okay Mohammed from Gambia was asking about TM TM mum is a substitute of evolution of wouldl you know that we cannot pray without being in the state of purity and one of the means of being in a city of purity is performing would where we wash our faces our arms wipe over our head and watch wash our feet but if a person either lacks the presence of water or has a legitimate excuse not to use water either excessive coldness or an injury that prevents him from performing wouldn't in this case we can substitute for dry ablution or TM mum where we strike the sand or the soil once we wipe our faces and we wipe our hands this is the emam so Mohammed from gabions saying if I perform tayammum in home and I go to the Masjid can I pray that says yes as long as the reason is legitimate providing that you don't have water in your home and you cannot get water from anywhere else in the vicinity but if there is water in the Masjid definitely your prayer is invalid if you can go out of your home and buy water and perform woudl your prayer is invalid with TMM you must perform it with water and this is a substitute most of our from Nigeria Mustafa what can I do for you yes sir I want to know if one is authentic hadith authentic celebs report which is authentic selection of water can we mentioned know what what's a lot most of us which is not what you're talking about okay so you want a website that mentions this yes thank you okay I will answer in sha allah so say it from Margaret says that what is the ruling on praying in a Masjid that has a grave in it it's either one of two options either there was a grave of a dead person they built Masjid on top of it prayer in it is totally prohibited and this message has to be demolished of course not by you and me by the authorities because this Masjid is totally prohibited to prayin or the message it was originally built and then the grave was inserted into it so if the grave was or is in within the walls of the message whether at the back front right or left this doesn't make any difference according to the most authentic opinion and you must not pray in there and the grave must be taken out and placed with the Muslim cemeteries therefore and this is unfortunately present in a lot of the so-called Muslim countries I've been to a lot of them and they have graves of auliah Abraha and all of this is totally prohibited and not permissible do not pray there ma'am door says my mom insulted me and said lies about me can I correct her or would this be disrespectful if it's something that is connected to you and she has transgressed upon you there is nothing wrong at all in correcting her politely or better more to go to the people and explain to them your case and tell them that this is a lie and this was not true there is no disgrace in it because she's a transgressor and you have the permission to clear your reputation and defend yourself being respectful secondly if a man married a woman can the woman after marriage give the Doughty back to the man and say I forgive you the answer is yes it's terrible it's her wealth she can do with it whatever she wants okay can she lend it to the husband there's no problem in that at all this is mentioned in the Quran that she can forgive all of it or some of it to her husband Mustafa says can you tell me the authentic salat on the Prophet Alastair sir I'm the most authentic is the hadith of adminstered allahumma salli ala muhammadin wa ala muhammad came oscilator allah' ibraheem o allah al Ibrahimi namida Majid Liberec elohim ala muhammadin wa ala muhammadin comma barik alaa rahim allah ibrahim in the committee machine where to find this and other virgins authentic visit w-w-w dot islam q-a dot info that's it this is the most authentic and just right salutation upon the Prophet so I mean it would tell you insha Allah satya says does that we do have to share the pension of her late husband if this is provided by the government as in the Provident Fund etc then no she does not share it because this is given from the government to the wife but if it is and the service indemnity or bonuses or the likes this is to be shared with the heirs as part of the inheritance a brother says it is written in modulus shahe Ramadhan Bashara beneath I mean that he's asking basically about the difference between methi and many Madi is prosthetic fluid and this comes when a person is aroused and it comes out as a form of discharge this does not nullify your fasting it requires that you perform Woodill and wash the area affected semen or sperm this comes in a gushing fashion accompanied with desire and lust and a feeling of sensation one feels a of sensation when it comes out in a gushing form this requires rustle and if it's done deliberately by hugging or kissing the spouse or by any other means this nullifies the fasting as well it seems that this is all the time we have so until we meet tomorrow same time I leave you feel mandala was salam alikum warahmatu allahi wa barakato [Music] - you almost immediately Mme letter in the wareameye hanifa why mäkinen la mouche city team"
