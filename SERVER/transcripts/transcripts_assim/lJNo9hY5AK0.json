  "transcript": "[Questioner] says can I ask you a question people \nwho go to Graves of Pious people of Islam like the   sahaba and the imams can people pray through \nthem as my dad says you don't ask from them   you ask through them is that right so basically \nwhat madiha is asking about is the justification   of grave worshipers when we talk to \nthem and say what you're doing is [ __ ]   they say I am not doing [ __ ] I'm not asking \nthe jilani or the Badawi or the Tijaani   or the Prophet (Peace and Blessing Upon Him) \nto protect me I'm asking the prophet or these   righteous people to ask Allah azzawaja \nso we are taking them as intermediaries   and this is exactly the Shirk that Allah azzawajal \nmentioned in the beginning of Surat as Zumar   Allah says and those who take protectors   besides him say we only worship them that \nthey may bring us nearer to Allah in position   this is the claim of the mushrikeen of \nthe idol worshipers that we worship them just that we can draw nearer and closer to Allah   so what is worshiping them it's not necessarily \nonly limited in prayer bowing and prostrating   Tawaf is worshiping them slaughtering \nanimals for them is worshiping them   calling them at times of distress [ __ ] \nsave me I'm in a dilemma I'm in a Calamity o prophet of Allah protect me from what \nI fear all of this is worshiping them   though they claim that they are worshiping \nAllah through them we don't have anyone to to   be intermediate between us and Allah \nazzawajal Allah says in the Quran invoke me and I shall respond to you I shall \nanswer you this is what Allah says and you say   no no no we'd rather take a different route \nthis would take you straight to hell so tell   your father that what he's doing is mentioned \nin the Quran and it is totally prohibited and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
