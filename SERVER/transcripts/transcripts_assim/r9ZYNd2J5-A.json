  "title": "Ruling on taking the deceased back to his/her homeland for burial - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "for Khan says what is the ruling on I'm from Pakistan and live in London since 2007 with daughters and wife if I die here in London what's the best way to bury in London or dead body sent back to Pakistan well the Sunnah is to bury the deceased body wherever he dies transporting the diseased corpse to a different country even if it were to Mecca or to Medina is not from the Sunnah and it is not permissible unless there is a real reason and cause for that so if a person dies in the UK he should be buried in the UK if he dies in Germany in the u.s. as long as there are Muslims cemeteries there he should be buried there but if someone were to say to me shake my brother died in America so we have the option either to bury him in America only after they follow their own procedures which are that they should perform an autopsy upon him they cut him up and examine his internal organs etc why would they do such a horrible thing this is the procedure ship anyone who dies they do this to him to ensure that he did not die out of murder or any other reason what do you mean a person who's 95 years old he just simply died why do you have to open him up so this is their loss but because he's not American if he demands that his corpse to be flown to his original country Pakistan or whatever they would not open him up in this case yes you have to go for this option you have to transport his body somewhere else where it would be treated as human as possible and in an Islamic fashion rather than cutting him up like they do in such kafir countries"
