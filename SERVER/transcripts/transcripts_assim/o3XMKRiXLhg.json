  "transcript": "Uh, can I wear my father's slippers at home? Would that be considered following a masculine trade? There's no problem in wearing your father's slippers or shoes because this is not imitating the uh uh the opposite gender. These shoes generally speaking are unisex and you're not wearing them outside. you're wearing them to protect your feet inside the house to go to the toilet or whatever. There's no problem in that."
