  "transcript": "Ummaymuna from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. If a woman does Isfahinja and Wudu and after wearing her prayer clothes she feels some water came out of her vagina and she is certain about that but she is not certain whether it's from the inner or outer part of her vagina. Since water coming from outer part of vagina isn't impure only the inner part is so will her prayer clothes be impure even she is uncertain and does she have to repeat her prayers when she didn't know the ruling. Jazakallahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum. First of all such questions are not highly recommended to be aired on public platforms you can ask this privately preferably. Second of all certainty is not affected by doubt so if you're certain that something did come out then this nullifies your Wudu. If you're not sure whether it came out or it was already present at the outer surface of one's private part then this has no impact on your Wudu or your Salat and this is why we always say to the people once you finish urinating and there's nothing coming out all what you have to do is wash your private part which is the Stinja and damp the area with water so the whole place is damped with water and sprinkle water on your underwear and move on and don't pay any attention to whatever comes to your mind that something may came out or not because this is Shaytan trying to mess up with your head. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
