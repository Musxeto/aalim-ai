  "transcript": "The first Questioner says; 'What is the ruling \non a woman chatting with other women and mahrams   without hijāb, providing non-mahrams \ncould possibly see her?' Now, this is   not clear. And this is the problem with a \nlot of the questions that come to us. What   the Questioner had in mind is something, and \nwhat we understand from it is another thing.   Most likely, the Questioner is asking about, \nchatting with other women and mahrams over Chat   Apps, such as Skype, Zoom, WhatsApp, or whatever. \nSo, Video Chatting, what's the ruling on that?   This is one part. And the other part is, providing \nnon-mahrams could possibly see her. How is that   possible? If there is a possibility of non-mahrams \nseeing her, this would be totally prohibited.   If a woman says, 'Can I go to the balcony without \nwearing a hijāb, or anything covering my 'awrah?   And there are buildings around me, but most likely \nnobody is watching.' What do you mean, 'nobody   is watching'? Can you tell? Do you know if there's \nsomeone behind the curtain with binoculars,   or with a camera with zoom, peeping tom, trying \nto take your photo? No, this is not appropriate.   There is a possibility, and a considerable \npossibility. But on Social Media platforms,   such as Whatsapp, or Zoom, or Skype, \nthe possibility is non-existing.   Rare, if not non-existing. Because, \nnobody hacks and monitors such chats and   go out of their way, unless they're spying on \nyou. There are spying agencies and this is very   rare. So what is rare and what is not \npossible, we do not pay attention to it   because it's quite rare. It's like saying, \n'Is it permissible to sit in a studio where   there's a possibility that the ceiling \nwould fall on your head and you will die?'   If there's a possibility, 'don't know, \nit's harām'. Nobody says this. Because   this possibility is not existing and if it is, \nit's rare and not to be put into consideration.   This is unlike what is possible. So a woman says, \n'What's the ruling on going to a wedding where I   put all my adornment, and wear a nice night dress, \nor, yani, soirée dress, putting my full makeup,   wearing my hair, - (not mine, of course) - doing \nthis and that.' And there are women with mobile   phones clicking pictures. I said 'This is \nharām' because, definitely, they will take   your picture and definitely, you will be seen by \nnon-mahrams. 'O Sheikh, there's so much hardship.'   Your 'awrah, your chastity, your privacy is \nmore important than this hardship. But on Skype,   or Zoom, or the likes, the possibility is very \nnegligible. And Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
