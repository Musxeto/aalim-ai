  "title": "I have two masjids nearby, but one is Deobandi, the other is Barelvi, can I pray at home?",
  "transcript": "Give it a shot there In Sha Allah. Alam from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam. My question is regarding the compulsion of praying in congregation. In my area most of the masjids have parayawi imams and the Deobandi masjid is approximately 150 meters away. The people in the masjid don't start praying and the imam makes dua after every first prayer. So, am I obliged to pray in congregation or can I pray at home? And what aboutâ€¦ I don't understand your question. Your microphone is not clear. If you're asking about praying in a Deobandi masjid or a Brilvi masjid, you pray in the masjid where the imam does not commit shirk. If you know that the Brilvi masjid the imam commits clear shirk and says that the Prophet is Hazir Nazir and he controls the universe and that he's created from Allah's Noor and Light, Audhu Billah, this is kufr and shirk. You cannot pray there. You may pray in the Deobandi masjid if you do not hear any statements of shirk. Making congregational dua is a bid'ah but it does not prevent you from praying there. Not putting their feet next to one another, again it is against the sunnah, but it does not invalidate your prayer."
