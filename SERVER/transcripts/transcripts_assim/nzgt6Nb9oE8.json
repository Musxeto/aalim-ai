  "transcript": "in India nikah is done on one day and usually the next day wima is done wima is the feast and the food that we invite people to come to celebrate such a marriage on ncah day bride's father gives dinner party is this allowed because some people say only WIA Feast is from the Sunnah hence this is not permissible kindly clarify we've answered this question many many times and we said that the Sunnah is that the groom carries out all Financial expenses of the marriage and the girl and her parents don't chip in a penny so the WIA is 100% the responsibility of the groom but it is a cultural thing where the Father of the Bride would like to host another WIA or a dinner party so that he would invite as many guests of his own you see when the WIA is conducted the groom may tell his father-in-law that you can invite 10 people because he's the one who's paying so he can invite the father and the father can bring nine other people with them this is my budget therefore lots of the people lots of the in and lots of the cultures the Father of the Bride says okay that's fine I'm going to host a gathering you my son-in-law may bring 20 30 from your side but I'm inviting like 50 or 100 from my side there's nothing wrong in that there's nothing that goes against the Sunnah or Islam and it's a cultural thing uh altogether"
