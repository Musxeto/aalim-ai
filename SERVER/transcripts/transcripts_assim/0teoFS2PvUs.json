  "transcript": "foreign but when I'm praying behind the Imam so for example when I go to the sujood and between the two prostrations no I'm not able to extend it so much so I I read that if that's the dream is not perfect the words change the meaning and this renders the prayer invited so I wanted to us like how do I different how do I make sure that the touch weight is like do I have to make sure that that's it has to be perfect during the prayer if I'm praying fast first the voltage wheat is to beautify your recitation and to pronounce the letters correctly and if you do this in a quick fashion that would do the job what you've heard is partially correct when the meaning changes but if you said this is and then you just say it likewise you don't have to say alhamdulillah this is but do I have to say it no it's not a must you do not have to recite the Quran with tajweed it's highly recommended but it's not a must you don't have to recite your ass up just pronounced it normally and move on without paying attention to it"
