  "transcript": "a sister asks can you please advise someone who has become accustomed to lying but wants to stop lying is one of the characteristics that was so abhorred and hated by the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam to the extent that if he had ever sensed one of his family to lie he would boycott him or her until that person initiates and expresses remorse and seeks forgiveness from allah azza wajal the Prophet hated lying at his salat of cinema and he never ever lied and that is why he was known to the idol worshipers even before Islam to be the honest the truthful and the trustworthy sallallaahu idea why he was in them if a person is a compulsive liar then he should know his fate after death he should reserve for himself a seat in Hellfire the Prophet said RA his salat WA Salam that lying leads to sins or food or an Elfa door leads to hell and an individual would lie and continue to lie until he's registered at the side of Allah as as a liar so with what face are you gonna face Allah Azza WA JAL on the day of judgement when everyone knows around you after being resurrected that this person is a liar the Prophet had told the saddest or some that the hypocrites have four characteristics a hypocrite whenever he speaks lies and according to the sister this person is a compulsive liar nobody trusts him nobody believes him and at the sight of Allah he's a hypocrite with a characteristic of the hypocrites so I highly advise this individual to fear Allah Azza WA JAL because nothing that comes out of his mouth except it is written and noted down as Allah Azza WA JAL has stated and he will see that in front of him on the day of judgement"
