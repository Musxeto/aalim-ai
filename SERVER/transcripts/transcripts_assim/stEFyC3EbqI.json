  "title": "Can we pray in the dark (room)? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay my question is regarding something which i have heard in my country is that i don't know whether it's an innovation or a ruling that is it permissible to pray in the dark whether fully dark or the room is conflict because some people say the room should be completely dead lit or at least half lit now is is there any reason or just personal preference no no i have heard it from people okay okay i will answer it is not recommended or disliked to pray in pitch black darkness this is up to you and up to your preference and up to the environment you're praying in why do you do i ask is there a reason for it because if someone does it thinking that it is closer to allah azzawajal and it is best for his and it's higher in in reward now this becomes an innovation however it is permissible if someone wants to pray in the light that's the norm why do we say that's the norm because when it's totally dark you're unaware of your surroundings whether a reptile or a snake or a scorpion or roaches may cross your path and may you may step on them or put your hand on them so it's best for you to see and allah has given you the vision so to thank him for such a blessing nevertheless if you are praying in a room and your spouse is asleep and you don't want to bother her so you may pray in total darkness without any problem in fact there is a hadith where mother is pleased with her woke up one night and touched beside her and she could not find the prophet next to her ali and it was dark totally dark so she started trying to allocate him and she touched his feet and her his feet were combined and this is where we get the sunnah that when you prostrate you combine your feet together and not leave them apart and she said i heard the prophet alaihis making the dua etc so this means that the prophet prayed in total darkness but he never recommended this or told it that told us that this is part of the prayer and it's higher for your reward rather it was obviously because his wife was asleep"
