  "transcript": "Mazin from Afghanistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu May Allah have mercy on your soul Sheikh Ameen and you as well I just have a question regarding a situation that took place with my sonny father and his colleague that was a Shia We went to a masjid and my father knowing full wellingly, knowing he was a Shia, he prayed Salat with him in the masjid I was just wondering is he sinful or is his prayer accepted and your overall thoughts on this matter I don't understand your question Mazin Your father is a Sunni, he prays with his Shia friend in the masjid The masjid is a Sunni masjid or a Shia masjid? It's a Sunni masjid What's the problem? He prayed with a Shia He prayed with a Shia but the Shia, is he a Kafir? I don't know So the default Akhi is that someone who claims to be a Muslim, he's Muslim Even if he says I'm a Shia, we say you're a Muslim until proven otherwise If we discover that he insults the companions and slanders mother Aisha and claims that the Quran is distorted And says so many heinous things that the Rafidah do in this case, yes we would label him as a Kafir After ensuring that the conditions were fulfilled and the obstacles were abstained and avoided Even if he's a Rafidah, your father praying in the masjid that is a Sunni behind a Sunni Imam Doesn't matter if he's praying next to a Rafidah or to a Kafir or to an animal His prayer is valid Inshallah"
