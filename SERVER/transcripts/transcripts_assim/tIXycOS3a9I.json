  "transcript": "Okay, Maham from Pakistan So my question is that if a girl feels that someone likes her for example her a van driver or someone that she doesn't interact with but She has to be like in the same place with him like in a bus etc. So But she doesn't like him so is she sinful for being in the same place as him if she doesn't look at him and interact with him because Like it could lead to fitnah as long as a person is Wearing the appropriate hijab Covered properly does not interact with such individuals that does not communicate or chit-chat or open the door for any means of flirting and they go About their business. There is no sin on them We unfortunately have to live in such a world Where lots of weirdos are around us? What is sinful is that you smile? You give the wrong signals you reply to their salam and chit-chat and communicate This is where you put yourself in harm's way, and this is prohibited You"
