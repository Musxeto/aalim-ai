  "title": "Pregnant after Khula - Am I divorced or still married? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "munna says if after Haller in my era de I turn out to be pregnant what's the ruling my idea ends when I give birth but am I still his wife during the ADA or am I actually divorced and it is and is it only about not getting married during the ADA why is it not allowed to marry during the pregnancy we know that when a man and a woman decide to separate this is either done by choice when the man himself divorces his wife by saying antibiotic you're divorced or we're divorced or by the woman filing for Haller and she compensate her husband by returning his dowry or parts of it and in exchange for that financial compensation he agrees for color and they separate or it can be done forcefully by the Muslim judge after studying the case and finding that marriage cannot continue or that there is something that prevents the marriage from existing such in the case of one of the spouses rejects Islam and becomes an apostate in horror what happens is that there is a mutual agreement usually in some cases the judge enforces such a process where the wife says she wants to bail out she doesn't want to stay in this marriage and she has her reasons if verified and legit and the husband does not want to the judge forces him to and if the husband is okay with that and he decides to settle by accepting his dowry back or part of it any financial contribution in this case the separation takes place so the moment he says I agree and he takes the money they're separated they are not man and wife anymore and a woman in the whole ER process has an idea what is the idea when a man divorces his wife she remains in a transitional period between marriage and being unmarried this transitional period is generally speaking measured by the number of her monthly cycles so after divorce she gets first monthly cycle the second monthly cycle the third monthly cycle once she is pure from the third monthly cycle the marriage is considered over she can immediately the following moment get married to someone else but within this transitional period within this Reed they are still man and wife he can look at her he can stay with her but there can't be any type of intimacy no intercourse no kissing no hugging etc and this is if he divorces her the first divorce or the second divorce if he divorced her the third divorce then totally she is prohibited for him and she must wear the hijab having said that if one of them were to die during their iddah the other living spouse would inherit so in these three monthly cycles he lives in a room she lives in a room after cupola of of mensis he dies she inherits her husband and her Rida is increased into four months and ten days the idea of a widow though she hates his guts she separated from him she just wanted out yet she is still considered her his wife likewise if she dies though he divorced her but she was still in the end appeared going back to Mona's question if a woman took caller so Mona took caller after the husband agreed she paid the money now she's in her period she discovered that she's pregnant this means that her idea instead of being one monthly cycle as any woman who applied for Haller it is extended until she gives birth this is what Allah mentioned to us in the Quran and those who are pregnant their raid is over once they give birth so she gave birth immediately after giving birth she can marry the following second now does she have rights any woman who files for Halle and is granted it she has no rights over her husband he is not to provide living quarters for her nor pay for her maintenance but because she's pregnant he is forced to provide her with a place to stay and to provide her with her maintenance that is sufficient for her and her a pregnancy because this is his son this is his child and he is responsible for catering for her well-being and this goes on until she gives birth but they are no longer man and wife in the sense that she applied for color so there is no possibility of reconciliation like any divorced woman rather she has to wear the hijab she must not be in the same house with him in seclusion like a divorced woman no she has to move out or he moves out and there has to be no communication between them and allah azzawajal knows best"
