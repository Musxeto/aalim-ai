  "transcript": "Arise from Canada Hello, hello. Yes Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I came back from Umrah Alhamdulillah But I didn't recite Uh Because I didn't memorize it fully When I was walking to Safa and Marwa and also I I when it was a very big crowd So I thought the Yemeni corner was Haji Aswad. So I said bismillah Allahu Akbar while raising my hand there Is my umrah valid? The good news is That as long as you started From the Hajar Al Aswad, the black stone, and finished seven rounds at the black stone And did your march between Safa and Marwa Seven times Even if you did not utter a single word Your umrah is 100% valid and correct So Alhamdulillah you have nothing to worry about Your umrah is valid and accepted with the grace of Allah"
