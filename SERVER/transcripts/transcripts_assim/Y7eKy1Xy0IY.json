  "title": "Is Niqab (Covering The Face) Mandatory? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "maryam says can we wear pro proper without wearing a cup just wearing hijab so i believe that maryam is asking about covering the face is it a must or not this is an issue of dispute among scholars and whenever there is a dispute among scholars as muslims we should not take the easiest so so many people say alhamdulillah this is an issue of dispute meaning that we can choose whatever we want and this is not true allah says in the quran whenever you dispute over an issue don't go to this scholar or that don't go cherry-picking don't choose whatever is easier for you or more convenient for you rather you should refer back to the quran and to the sunnah nowadays with search engines we can easily find some person stating that this or that is halal and this is convenient for us so if i am if i'm a smoker and wherever i go and check and ask they tell me tobacco is haram it's harmful there is tar there's nicotine and it harms your body and i don't like this frankly so i google it i search for it and then i find that there is a scholar somewhere who's a real genuine scholar but he made a ruling and he gave a fatwa stating that it is halal it's strong this does not discredit this scholar because if we look in his work we would find that he has done great job but he is not infallible he makes mistakes and this is one of them now for me as a cherry picker i would highlight the book underline it photocopy it expand enlarge the photocopy and show everybody that chef so and so the great sheikh the great allama the great scholar said it's halal this doesn't work this way this is religion this is deen the egyptians are witty people and they love to joke so one of them used to say about smoking pot smoking grass marijuana hash whatever you want to call it and he was stoned like crazy and he said listen if it's haram we're burning it and if it's halal we're smoking it so the end result is one he is smoking it and if it's haram okay i'm burning it why are you why are you mad i'm destroying it but i'm inhaling not like clinton he did not inhale no he did so this way of cherry picking is haram when we come to the issue of niqab the covering the face we find that there are many evidences commanding a woman to cover her face and there are a handful few evidences stating otherwise so when an objective person looks into these evidences he finds that so many talk about nepal and it being mandatory and obligatory and there are five or six incidents where might insinuate that it is not mandatory anyone would logic say would say that yes the vast majority of the hadiths and the evidences prove that it is mandatory so we would consider the other four or five or six handful of evidences stating otherwise to be either an incident isolated from the general trend or something that was abrogated later on if you look at the quran you will find that allah in chapter 33 orders the mothers of the believers to cover their faces in verse 53 no one argues about this verse and whenever you ask them for utensils ask them from beyond a visor a hijab so all schools of thought say that it is mandatory no difference of opinion that the wives of the prophet of salaam must cover their faces agreed everybody says yup we agree to that okay go six hours later on verse 59 and you will find that the prophet israel is instructed by allah azzawajal to order his wives daughters the women of the believers to draw down their jell-o bead so that they would not be recognized and hence harassed so the reason for drawing down pulling down your jalla beep the plural of jilbab is that you are not recognized enhanced abused or harassed so this is addressing the wives of the prophet isa if you combine this to the ayah number 53 which we all agree that it is mandating the women of the prophet sallam to wear the niqab to to veil their faces so allah is telling them to veil their faces here again so we know that hijab but he's including with them the daughters of the prophet saw and the women of the believers and justifying this by saying so that they would not be recognized and hence harassed and abused and how is a woman recognized by her face so if she covered her face no one no one would dare to harass her or to abuse her and there are so many other evidences that this is not the time to expand upon them therefore it's an issue of dispute yes but the most authentic opinion is that a woman's face is the most beautiful thing in her if a man were to marry a woman the first thing his mother is going to say to him well i should her face is like the moon no mother would start by saying she's like a four foot nine or five foot and she is petite she has this body figure so and so and so her hair is so and so so when she has the face of a monkey the first thing that a man looks for is a beautiful face to walk to wake up looking at and to go to sleep looking at so the figure the body the hair all of these are secondary important but the most important thing is the face so if the face was exposed and everybody can see it that would cause a lot of fitness in the world and this was not the case at the time of the prophet sam it should not be the case at our times as well and allah azzawajal knows best"
