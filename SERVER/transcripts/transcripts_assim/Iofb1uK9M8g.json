  "transcript": "Ansar from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I have a question. So I have a really bad habit that all the way from my since I was a child, I was stealing stuff and Even right now like I was doing it and a year ago. I started practicing Islam and Alhamdulillah. I'm Just staying away for a long time and and now it's like Shaitaan is telling me to do it again. And I have a question. So I you know, I wanted to You know, I wanted to get away from it and I don't want to do it anymore How can I like become like a better person and fight this? It seems which is that it seems that the only way to Fight this addiction of yours is to Get more and more involved in reading the Quran reading the Hadith Learning the religion to uplift and increase your Iman What you're suffering from is an illness The bad news is that you're not mentally Sick or ill that the pen is uplifted and You'll have a free pass on the day of judgment. You'll be held accountable for everything you steal and Stealing is a major sin the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said a thief Does not steal while he is a mu'min So while you are in the process of stealing the Iman is uplifted and it goes like a cloud Uplifted and it goes like a cloud in the sky and you're not a mu'min at that particular moment And being a major sin Means that your level of Iman is at its lowest Your Iman should block you from doing haram things because your fear of the day of judgment Even if you're alone, even if even if you're at walmart and there are no cameras And you can shoplift And wear it and hide it And nobody knows about it. Allah knows about it Your fear of the day of judgment and of Allah watching you blocks any such ill intent And desires to sin so you have to block this remember What awaits you when Allah exposes your major sin in front of everybody that this is the man Who stole so and so and so and the list goes on? on earth and everybody acknowledges that you're a thief and a burglar and You have to also imagine How islam is going to be tarnished? Because of you. Oh, we caught a muslim. His name is I forgot to to uh, write down your name um His name is a muslim name. He is a shoplifter He stole this and that and they have mugshots like trumps And you're everywhere Islam this is islam If you don't fear Allah if you don't fear the day of judgment the least is to fear the reputation of islam not to be attacked because Of the likes of you and make a lot of dua in sujood that Allah cures you totally from such Dishonesty and such a sin and Allah azawajal knows best"
