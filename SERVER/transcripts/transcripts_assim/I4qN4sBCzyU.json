  "title": "Hadith   House in Jannah for praying 12 Sunnah rakat, do we get it if we pray it once or everyday to",
  "transcript": "one says we know the hadith about the reward of praying the twelve sunnah throughout the day do we get a house in jannah if we prayed it once or must we pray it every day to be eligible for this reward this is an issue of dispute among scholars and without going into details some scholars looked at certain hadiths that clearly states whoever does it once allah would build a house for him in jannah and there are other groups of hadiths that state that he has to be persistent and praying it every single day in order to have a house in jannah so the first opinion was backed uh or was chosen by sheikh nathameen the second was chosen by sheikh bin baz and it seems and allah only knows best that the hadith indicates a person being consistent with it and doing it every single day to the rest till the rest of his life in order to get this house in jannah and allah's favor is far greater than what we anticipate so there's no harm in saying uh either opinion but it seems that the latter opinion which is that you have to observe it every day in order to get it is the most authentic you"
