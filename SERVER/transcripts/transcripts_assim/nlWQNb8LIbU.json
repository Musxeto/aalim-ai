  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India. How much amount of blood is considered \nas spotting before menses and how much blood, how much blood is considered as spotting before menses - \nokay, I will answer Insha Allah. [Questioner] from India she says what \nis the quantity of spotting that would   be considered menses, this is \na frequently asked question   by a lot of women, before they get their monthly \nperiod they get two to three days of brownish   discharge accompanied with cramps and back pain, \nsometimes they may see a drop or two of blood,   scholars say this is Istihaadah, this is not \nyour monthly period, disregard and whenever the   Adhan is called, go to the toilet if you want \nto pray, clean yourself, change your panties or   underwear, make Wudhu and go and pray even if \nit continues to come there's no problem in that. Now when is it considered to be menses, when \nthe blood starts to flow and the flow of blood   is well known and recognised to \nwomen, it's not how many drops,   it's the flow of blood that comes, this \nis when you stop praying and fasting."
