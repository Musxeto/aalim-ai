  "transcript": "Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Thank you so much for the opportunity, Sheikh. So I only have one question. Is it permissible to work in a company that have the opposite value of Islam, such as LGBTQ? Yeah, so thank you. BarakAllahu Fikir. Akhi, this question is not a very limited or controlled question, because there is no company, to my knowledge, that propagates LGBT. They don't do this. But if, for example, McDonald's sells cheeseburgers, Big Mac, and the likes, but they put a logo of LGBTQ. So should I buy? Should I work? Is it halal? The answer is yes. It is halal to work. Why? When you work for McDonald's, what do you do? I'm selling cheeseburgers. Are you supposed to wear, you know, like drag queens or a thong or maybe a bra? No, I just sell cheeseburgers. So if this is the case, it's halal to work. But if the company itself is propagating and calling people and telling the employees to do this in support and you have to go in pride marches and demonstrations and you have to do things to support this haram. No, you can't. So I hope this is clear, inshallah."
