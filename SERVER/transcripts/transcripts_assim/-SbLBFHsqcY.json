  "transcript": "can we give away old clothes that have pictures on them and female clothes that have hijab issues like short sleeves Etc clothes that have pictures on them these are Haram as they are so you should not give them away unless you put dye on the face so you actually remove the facial features or the head all together or don't give it away just tear them and use them as a wiping cloth women clothes that are inappropriate such as sleeveless or mini skirts or trousers or shorts that usually are to be worn in front a woman's husband not in front of her mahrams or other girls they are a private form of clothes such can be donated and given away providing you don't have knowledge whether the person receiving it is going to use it in Haram or not because the default is that people would use it for halal so yes if I give a mini skirt or a sleeveless dress tube donation maybe the poor woman who gets it will wear it to her husband and this is most likely so there's no problem in doing that and Allah Knows Best"
