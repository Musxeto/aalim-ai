  "title": "Is it ok for Students of Science to draw conclusions about Islam without knowledge? ￼ darwinism ￼ ￼",
  "transcript": "Fahim from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, today many Muslims who academically belong to science background and try to do self-study of the Quran and Sunnah, some of them claim that Quran supports Darwinism evolution and also claim the presence of mathematical miracles and many other correlations with science. My question is, is it appropriate for students of science to draw conclusions by just reading few blogs, articles without having in-depth knowledge of Quran and Sunnah? These people are arrogant imbeciles, they're neither scientific nor logical, because it's like them claiming to be academic and scientific and going into a field that is totally not theirs. When they have discussions, they go and talk about geology and how the earth was formed and all the geologists look at them and say, these guys are a nutcase, these guys are crazy. And likewise, when they speak about the Quran and the Sunnah, we, people of Sharia, people of Quran, people of Arabic, people of Sunnah, say these guys are imbeciles, they're ignorant, who cares what they say? These are fame seekers, they don't know Arabic, they have no background in studying Quran or Sunnah, they're just talking from their own whims and desires. People who want recognition, who want to be famous, like that ignorant imbecile who came years back saying that Alif, Lam, Meem and Ha, Meem and Kaf, Ha, Ya, Ain, Saad, these are Aramaic letters that mean so and so and so. So he discovered the new proton, or the quantum physics theory. He says that I've discovered something the Companions didn't know of, the Tabi'een didn't know of, nobody knew of, because I studied Hebrew, I studied this and now I know what it means, subhanAllah. This can be blasphemous, when you come and claim that this means so and so in the Quran without any proof or basis. And not only that, claiming that the Quran is not Arabic. So don't ever listen to such ignorant imbeciles, even if they have a couple of PhD's under their belt, because it has no value in Islam. They just want recognition and to be pointed to and to be recognized."
