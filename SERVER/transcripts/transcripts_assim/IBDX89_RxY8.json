  "transcript": "great how to wash the face in wudu because I find it hard to wash the face with three hands full of water especially the nose and the eyes and the lips area okay so we have to do it practically taking off my glasses then lifting up my head gear and I don't know I'm gonna do it again I can't even see you guys who's this first of all wudu is one of the simplest things in life the prophet Islam used to perform wudu with this much of water and we spend gallons making wudu when you want to make wudu you wash your hands three times this is Sunnah can I skip it yep you can skip it secondly you want to wash your mouth and nose put a little water in your right hand how much water do you think I have one or two tablespoon of water very little and then I take half of a scoop in my mouth and the other half I try to pull up my nostrils from that one or two tablespoon and I blow my nose and I burn the water in my mouth and I spit it out once is enough you want to repeat it twice three times you're okay three is the max then I put water in my hand one or two tablespoons I combine my hands so the water is very little and then I do this that's it I don't have to do this or go in the nose and in the side of the eyes and the lips and the mustache and what are you doing this is not a surgery it's an easy thing put water this is my face whatever faces people once is enough Sheikh I don't know maybe I've missed a part here or a part here or a part here you're not Allah you're not allowed to make such doubts let me fix myself up first maybe I get proposals you never know so you are not allowed to make shaytan open the Pandora box for you it's a simple process just wash your face and move on what about my hand put the same thing in your right hand do this the water drips a little bit you do this voila Stephanie same thing with the left it's very easy and you'll still find water remaining in that mug in contrast to turning on the tap and keep on doing this for half an hour wasting gallons of water shaytan is clapping excellent work keep up the good work this is not from Islam so I hope this answers your question and it annihilates your wiswas"
