  "transcript": "Muhammad says is denying the existence of black magic gin possession evil eye Etc an act of uh kufur black magic is mentioned in the Quran for example in verse 102 inah Bak Allah tells us that the Devils teach people magic it's mentioned that Prophet Musa saw things that were not real peace be upon him from the magic of the sorcerers and also in uh chapter 113 we seek refuge in Allah from the evil of those who blow in knots and this is Magic Black Magic so it is mentioned in the Quran it is mentioned in the Hadith of the Prophet that seven are among the major sins number two is is a magic and it's different types it's optical illusion it can be used by medication and drugs it can be by the use of Jin it can be used by uh or created by the uh talans and the words used by Sorcerers Etc so it's proven and no one denied it except and some Scholars of Islam which prevented the majority of taking them out of the fold of Islam however if I were to be asked I'm not here to ask I'm just reporting what the scholars say something that is found in the Quran should if anyone were to deny it we should immediately say that this is kufur but maybe they have something that would block us from giving them such as misinterpretation and misunderstanding as for Jin possession no it's not kufur to deny it as it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that it does exist not only in Islam in different religions as well as for the evil eye this is mentioned in the Quran and in the Hadith Allah says in the Quran so this is definitely found in the Quran and in the Sunnah and whoever denies it knowing that is found in the Quran and Sunnah would leave the fold of Islam and Allah Asel Knows Best"
