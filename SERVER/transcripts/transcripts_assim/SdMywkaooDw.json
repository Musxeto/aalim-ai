  "transcript": "Muhammad from Switzerland Assalamu Alaikum So just to put some context. I'm an Algerian. My father is diplomat, so we had to live in Switzerland for many years and When they had to leave I stayed there. I stayed here for to complete my studies So next month insha Allah, I will be finished with my bachelor degree and I plan to come back to Algeria However, my parents like they pressure me a lot to to to stay in Switzerland Telling me that I have to pursue with a master and that's my Understanding of the religion is wrong. So it will lead me to the waste of my deen of my dunya and akhira, so am I right if I Disobey them in coming back to Algeria or if I didn't you ask me this before Muhammad I Sent you a message on whatsapp, but I received no answer. So hmm, so basically speaking whenever you're scared and afraid that Your religion is gonna be affected or your Iman is gonna decrease you have to run Leave everything and just go finish your studies get your BS or BA the bachelor degree and Go back to your country regardless of what they say to you But if you know that alhamdulillah, you have strong Iman you have a good community wherever you are in Switzerland, and you're practicing the religion well, and you can make your master's or PhD in less time without being tempted to fitna In this case, it's a win-win nobody gets a chance to do their higher degree in Switzerland and finding people to provide for them and their parents are providing for them So there's no problem in that inshallah because this is a reason if you are Afraid of fitna a Win-win situation would be to tell them. Okay. I'm willing to do my master's and my PhD Providing you guys get me married So go back to Algeria choose a righteous practicing muslima Who would accompany you and go back to Switzerland and do your studies? You're married you're settled and inshallah in couple of years. You'll be over and that's a win-win You"
