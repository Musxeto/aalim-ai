  "transcript": "if everyone does this PE people will change unfortunately we're very passive we're very negative we don't want to contribute and Satan comes and intimidate us with so many things and at the end of the day we end up putting oursel in a shell and isolating ourselves from the others and claiming to be Allah's chosen people I know we've gotten a little off topic where now we're talking about how to correct people so maybe if you have a question more towards uh giving Islam our best effort go ahead okay as a matter of fact I'm an English instructor uh so I try to use my English as much as I can to reveal the best image or the most favorite image of Islam uh this is not because I am an instructor this is um the place where I send an invitation to everybody doctors Engineers students even the guys who spend their time surfing the internet uh un unuseless things or useless things or unnecessary things why don't you try to use the internet to create websites uh to um give the best image of Islam because you know we are image of the Islam so if foreigners or tourists here in Egypt or whatever or whatever so was doing something wrong as myself I had an experience a personal experience I was riding a car with my friend he is from the United States States of America we were drinking soft drinks when I finished mine I threw it out of the window of the car he stopped the car and said Aman get it again and I get it and put it in a recycled pen I was so embarrassed but from this this happened two years ago since then I haven't done something like that and try to tell my friends not to do something like that because we are images for Islam how can we say that Allah says cleanliness is next to Godliness and at the same time you don't do something like that that's all thank you very much okay as for the Hadith it's not a Hadith so cleanliness is is next to good uh godliness a proverb it's a proverb um it it is true we have to do what we preach it's it's not enough only to preach and the best form of making dawa is to actually be a practicing Muslim now there are people who go the extra mile now most of Muslims know what is halal and what is Haram but they find it difficult to go the extra mile in propagating because they are not themselves performing so you cannot propagate something that you're not doing so I believe that it is true that we have to give the role model to the people but before we do that we ourselves have have to be practicing what we preach and this American friend of yours he told you to go and pick it up because this is what he believes and regardless whether he's Muslim or not but okay he's not a Muslim this is what he believes now if you look at the other religions you feel that they have more commitment to their religions than we do and this is unfortunate because of their conviction and because of our weak belief in our beliefs though we have the ultimate truth is Islam no muslim would doubt this but yet we fail to go and call people to Islam because we are ourselves lazy we're not putting enough effort to this very what role do parents play in helping the children correctly prioritize you know between you know life and Islam and and all this sort of thing and the bonus question are we doing our job as parents those of us who are parents well I'll I'll answer the bonus question answer is no unfortunately if we were doing our jobs as we're supposed to be we would not be in the situation we're in we have a cultural Gap and the kids are grow seeing their parents doing something and Lear learning it at school and learning at the Masjid that they should be doing something else in Islam there is no separation M Islam work entertainment they all are put in a Melting Pot and you get one substance that is one not so many if you go back to the Sunnah you would find that the family used to make the children grow up thinking that Islam is their life and to serve only Islam for example um may Allah be pleased with her she's the mother of anas anas was 10 years old when she brought him to the prophet when he first came to Medina and she said oh prophet of Allah anas is a learned child let him be with you serve you and learn from you the prophet didn't need that but he would not return this woman with a broken heart so he accepted The Boy The Boy lived with the prophet Alat wasam and his family for 10 years stating that I've never seen the prophet alhat wasam reprimand me for something that I did by saying why did you do this or for something I did not do shouldn't you have done so and so he would not say this to him in one incident um saw her child anas walking the streets of Medina the prophet entrusted him with a secret and he told him do this thing don't tell anyone about it so he met his mother on the road and she said where are you going he said um the prophet asked me to do something she said what did he ask ask you to do now the boy is 10 years old the first thing any 10 years old would do is to say the secret and the first thing that comes into mind if he doesn't the mother's going to spank him so Anna said I can't tell you it's a secret what did the mother do the mother showed him the role model she said don't ever say the secret of the prophet Alam to any Soul she didn't go on the offensive she she approved what he did now this shows you that it goes side by side he is there to serve the prophet Alat and this is world this is worldly things but he's not there simply for the worldly things he's there to learn religion and by not separating this is the result that we get an Malik one of the Great schol schars of Islam likewise this Cascades all over when I go to do some shopping and my child comes and says oh father let me come with you and I say well I'm going to take an injection at the hospital and they said the child says oops okay go may Allah be with you I'm not giving the role model which means that whenever I'm going to talk about Islam he's not going to pay any attention because I'm not practicing what I preach this is very interesting uh what you said because uh I knew a sister that worked in an Islamic school and she saw frequently how the parents were interacting with the children and uh she told me one day she said that it's so bizarre she's an American she said you know convert to Islam she said it's it's so amazing to me that they will tell their children who's asking for some more like sweets there aren't anymore sweets like lie to them rather than tell them no you can't have it and I'm the parent and you don't need anymore and the child knows that the parent is lying because just saw the Suites on the counter you know but they you know the parent isn't thinking about what sort of psychological aspect this will this will have on the child so I mean is this a common phenomenon or it is unfortunately everyone of us know unfortunately in the houses that we do not consider them to be practicing Muslims that if someone calls by phone and the child answers and he says Okay one minute father it's so and so and the father says tell him I'm not here and my father says you're not here this is common because people are not practicing it's not the culture it's the absence of religion and likewise those who do not lie for example and this is this is one of the the the beautiful attributes in the west though they're Christians though they're disbelievers to us but they do not lie and why is that is it because of their religion no this is how they're brought up they would do anything they would sin they would drink intoxicated fornicate but they don't lie m"
