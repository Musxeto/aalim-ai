  "title": "Does crying due to worldly reasons invalidate our prayer? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Munib from the US. During prayer, if something is going on with our life and we feel in need and we contemplate on Fatiha and Adh-Razqar and Quran we read and become emotional and cry, not necessarily out of fear or love of Allah, but the realization that He is the only one who can resolve all these issues. Does this impact the validity of the prayer? No, this has no impact on the validity of your prayer. Your prayer is valid, Wa Lillahi Alhamdu Wa Al Fadlu Wa Al Minna. We have only one Allah to worship and He is the only one who can solve our problems. So expressing your emotions while in prayer, as long as this does not take you out of the form of the prayer, then there is no problem in such weeping and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
