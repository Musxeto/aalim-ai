  "transcript": "Zakariya from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So, say you're in like a loud rakah, you're in sujood, and the Imam gets up to say a Fatiha or Naud, and he starts reciting it whilst you're in sujood or you're still getting up, have you then missed a Fatiha, and then like missed a pillar basically, so you have to stand up again once he finishes? I don't understand your question. If you're talking about delaying standing up from sujood while the Imam has already stood up and started reciting the Fatiha, is this what you're asking about? Yeah, basically. So your prayer is valid, you're wrong in delaying it, because the moment the Imam stands up, you should stand up. I don't see him Sheikh, I am in the sujood. The moment you hear him say Akbar, you stand up. And while you're standing up, he's already starting in the Fatiha, there's nothing wrong in what you're doing. But if you continue to do sujood and the guy is saying, in this sujood position, this is skipping the standing position and the Fatiha, which is a pillar, and this is not right to do at all. And Allah knows best."
