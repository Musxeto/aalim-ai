  "transcript": "assalamu alaykum wa rahmatullah welcome to another episode of with the Prophet I'm Allie Coleman of your host we are continuing to look at the various interactions that the Prophet peace be upon him had with the people around him during his lifetime and taking lessons from it how we should follow his example sallallahu Leo solemn our guest is a sheikh Azam al Hakim of Saudi Arabia Salaam alaikum and welcome why do you can Saddam was a lawyer or a cat or a second law here for having me our honored to have you with us as we continue the conversation we have now turned to women our focus today is on women now we've earlier spoken about the wives of the Prophet peace be upon him we're not talking about the Y as we're talking about other female members of society without a doubt I mean we are both both sexes are human beings at the end of the day we're made of the same stuff the same things in we depend on the same environment for our livelihood and our sustenance but there is a difference between the sexes I'd like for you to talk more about the essential nature of the woman but before we do I thought I would ask you to do a comparative introduction how different societies different religions across time and culture have viewed the woman both her spirit her body her role in society semana Rahim and him do I mean son la mochila Mubarak are both here I'm attending al-amin nabina muhammad in wada and he was idea Jemaine I'm about women women women can't live with them and can't live without they say the same thing about us yeah but we have the privilege of coming on TV and saying it they don't tumble ah see if you look throughout history women were always mistreated hmm and dealt with as an inferior species the Pharaohs centuries ago thousands of years ago they used to send and throw in the Nile one virgin girl as a sacrifice so that they won't have droughts and that rain would fall upon them so they used to think that females are sacrificed like we sacrificed animals the Romans and till recently a few centuries ago the Christians did not consider women to have a soul they debated whether it's like an animal or it's a different creature that has no soul the Arabs even considered it as something that's worthless this is before Islam so they used to inherit women mm-hmm if a man dies his sons would inherit his their stepmother they would bury girls when they were young age so that they would not disgrace them when they grow old and or bring poverty to them and if you look at the Hindus till a couple of decades decades ago if a man dies his woman is still considered to be his property so he would be criminais 'td Kimi cremated alongside with her she would be burnt alive with her the corpse of her husband and this was banned but it's still being practiced in India now even in modern times if you go to Europe if you go to Russia if you go to the US women are not treated better on the surface they say we have our freedom we can do whatever we want and this freedom if it's not controlled this is what you have the red district in Amsterdam Soho in London you have escort girls you have women displayed on Billboard's almost naked selling their bodies and this is freedom for what it's it's becoming a commodity in ads and different things not only that this freedom brought them nothing but but disaster in an FBI report 2015 mmm-hmm it stated that approximately 400 women are being raped every single day in the u.s. 400 women daily and another report for a reputable organization stated that this is not accurate this is reported where is not reported rises up to a thousand yeah cases of rape in 2015 you do the math we're in 2018 and now and Allah knows what is this the kind of respect we want for women when Islam came all of this has changed Islam came and brought true freedom dignity and respect to women how can we say this you're a Saudi cleric you're a share and you're doing this we know that women in Islam are subjugated they are oppressed bla bla bla well don't quote me and at the same time don't listen to the Western media that tarnishes the reputation of Islam go to the sources the Koran is there and it's been there for 15 centuries the Sunna is there the authentic sunnah and the biography the serie of the Prophet Ali Salim clearly tells us how women were treated at the time of the Prophet Elisha great introduction and in fact as you were speaking I was thinking about US history this this years 2018 and it's been less than a hundred years a hundred years ago in the United States women were struggling to get the right to vote to participate in the democratic process in the United States so it really hasn't been that long less than a hundred hundred years and we're comparing it to Islam that has been there much longer and so what we hope to do in his conversation is you know work against this agenda driven news media that has the aim of tarnishing the image of Islam and Muslims I would like to ask you I in the introduction I said that I wanted you to speak more about this essential difference between the nature of a woman the nature of a man as we as I said both both of us both sexes are human beings we have the same frailties and needs and wants what was that like for the Prophet peace be upon him how did he what did he want us to take away the main difference between the races did he not the races but the sexes did he want us to see women that he want men to see women through the lens of mercy and gentility can you talk about that see it is difficult if not impossible to have a shift in the way people think over decades let alone over a few years maybe less Islam managed to transform the way men looked at women when it came and this is a beauty of Islam if you look at al harem of Mecca the Masjid of Mecca when it is like a couple of minutes before time of prayer you'll find people walking sitting reciting the Quran just when the yama is given by the method he calls for prayer in less than 15 seconds the million people in the Masjid are in straight rows not moving an inch how could this be this control this order this perfection Islam has this power so when the Prophet came erase a lot of Salaam he simply transformed the way people think into an Islamic way now the Prophet acknowledged the fact that men and women are different to one another this is human nature they say men come from Mars women come from Venus or whatever mm-hmm it happens the way they think is different than the way we think we think more with our brains not our hearts and the it is a different with them they think more with their hearts that they think more with their feelings and if they did not think with their feelings we would have problems with upbringing the children thank God for it I the world would be in shambles so if you come back to the way that the Prophet told us about women so many times the Prophet would remind us of Allah and say take care of women take care of your women the best of you are the best to their women and I and the best to my women so he keeps on repeatedly reminding us to take care of our wives to take care of our daughters to take care of our mothers calling us to be dutiful to be responsible to see we have an obligation to their well-being indeed to the extent that when a man came to the prophet Hollis or someone asked him Oh prophet of Allah who among the people is more worthy of my good companionship he said your mother the man said then who he said your mother then I said then who he said he your mother three times and then the man said then who then he said your father only so women have a special status in men's life and the mother has the highest of them all of them all we'd like to continue more when we come back after the break shake I'd like to open up the social status of Muslim of women that the Prophet ordered for us and guided us to after the break back to with the Prophet would continue our conversation about women with a shake awesome it's not far from where we are we're recording this in Cairo the neighboring country of Libya prior to his demise Muammar Qaddafi was well known for having female bodyguards and he elevated the status of women in that way and depended placed his life in their hands but I'd like to know what it was like for the Prophet did he surround himself with female bodyguards the Prophet peace be upon him what was his how did he see the social status of women did he relegate them to certain roles and duties talk about that please well the prophet alayhi salatu salam could never ever do such a thing this is disrespectful for women having them out as bodyguards or having them as playmates Hugh Hefner this is not Islam Islam considers a woman as a jewel you don't hold a jewel or a piece of diamond in your hand exposing it to everyone you cover it you take good care of it you put it in the safest place in your house likewise imagine if we have a banana everybody likes bananas if you peel a banana and you put it in display for someone to buy would anybody would anyone buy it they weren't too close they want it unpeeled you want it fresh as it is the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam respected women he loved women his women that is and this is why he first of all told us that women are the the sisters of men they are the counterparts okay of men so in a sense they have the same rights all in its own position see it is wrong to say that there is equality between the genders in Islam totally wrong that doesn't speak to the nature of the human being we're talking about equality of rolls both see there is no equality in the sense that I can't go to my wife and say listen let's as we are equal I'll get pregnant this year it's it's it doesn't work I'll share the burden it can't happen it this is something that Allah has given her and deprived me from it there is fairness between the genders and this is why a woman even in her wealth she's not obliged to spend upon herself and it's the duty of her husband even if she's a millionaire not a single penny see there is a great amount of fairness the prophet alayhi salatu salam would not surround himself and expose women in such a fashion but rather he would tell them that the best place for them is to do their role her role is to take care of her husband of a children of her house this is half of the society because the society is your home and whatever is out of your home everybody has to go home and sleep somewhere so if she takes good care of her man then she has done her due diligence she has done her duty beautifully for the man is not the other way around him sitting back home cooking taking care of the kids while his wife works no this is reversing the roles he has to go out he has to put the bread on the on the table he has to endure all the troubles that men face outside and this is why why by the way men die faster than women you know an interesting thing is evangelical Christians in the United States have a very similar view when it comes to the roles of the men and women in the household in the family in society they say the evangelical Anglo euro-americans that the reason why we have so many social ills is because the women are in the workplace and not at home amen III second this see the truth wherever it is we take it embrace it now does this mean we're against women working no no not at all but see Islam comes to diagnose the problem and gives solutions it's not from me it's from Allah Azza WA JAL if a woman can work in a segregated place the job is hella and her husband or father approves of that the sky's the limit go ahead you can be a woman can be a businesswoman she can be a head master of a school only for girls she can teach in universities only for girls she can be a medical doctor only for females but there's a cost I've seen a face to face even people in my family well-known persons executives government people in tears because they have to make the decision between folk they're developing their professional career or developing their children and so it's a terrible struggle that women are going through now it's only been about a few decades in the in my country but they're in tears about it I'd like to ask about another thing that has come about in the modern workplace and that is handshaking it's a everybody has an opinion about it and I don't know I think perhaps there are two main positions one is that there's no problem with it the other is that there's there should not only be an abstinence of hand shaking but touching male-female touching at all should be avoided is this one of the issues you know there are many issues for Muslims where some things are more cultural and less Islamic is this one of those or is there Islamic basis for a no male/female handshaking unfortunately there is a tendency among a lot of the Muslims we come back to the issue of the frame and the picture yeah a lot of the Muslims when they see that they have to compromise a lot of their habits and their daily routines they think tend to doubt and put suspicion whether this is cultural Islamic okay you're asking or you're telling no he says I don't know listen it's easy you can google it share Google has ability to give you answers a lot of the websites my website share and manage its website Islam QA dot info will give you full details Oh what you want to learn but don't put the cart or the wagon in front of the horse follow the procedure now if we would like to know the ruling on this issue it's very simple hint been taught ba may Allah be pleased with her when she accepted Islam and that was on the conquest of Mecca on the eighth eighth year of hijra she said to the prophetess I am with other women Oh prophet of Allah give us your hands so that we can shake it and give you the pledge of allegiance because now we're new Muslims what did the Prophet say Allah saw some he said I do not shake hands with women hmm you're not Muharram how can I touch you and Eden another hadith the Prophet stated allahís alot of Salaam in black and white that it is better for a man to be stabbed in his head with a needle of iron rather than to touch a woman that it is not permissible for him so it is totally prohibited in Islam to shake hands with the opposite gender why is that because touching is far more dangerous than looking you can look but it is not as when you touch and you feel and Islam preserves the chastity of both man and women nowadays a lot of the Muslims had have lowered their guard so it's natural for you to see someone shaking hands with other women who are not muharram to him and when you tell them okay this is wrong he said it's a cultural thing in Spain the culture is to kiss on the cheek right and likewise in in France so what is this if you go to some other country and the culture is too hard in my country is a lesser form of area we we embrace our women even if this is this is problematic then what to do this is again your choice whether to abide by the Quran and Sunnah and become a Muslim putting the frame on your picture or compromise and and Shaikh not to labor the point but oftentimes the standard of dress of clothing of attire for the women and then in addition to that you add to this practice of handshaking and embracing I've been in some really awkward situations and I try to protect people's feelings when I'm in my country all of my family are non-muslims so when their friends come when relatives come you know they we have to create the situation for me nevertheless you have to you have to do something about it okay because you have to draw the line because this is your religion so simply step back one or two steps when some when you meet none Muharram put your hands on your chest and just not showing them that you don't know this I respect you but yes but so many times you would probably find someone who is shameless and they know and they do this to you and I face so many situations like this from women and some of them are even models coming and they know that this and I just simply say listen mmm no can't do this is Haram in my religion check we're running out of time we got about two minutes left a couple things acts of worship and charity anything you'd like to say and I'm sorry to do this to you only a couple minutes the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to in courage women to give in charity mm-hmm and he justifies this especially to the married one that they have problems with showing their gratitude to the husbands and this is a major sin see the woman if she prays five times fast Ramadan protects her chastity and obeys her husband this is the formula for her to enter gender unlike men they have to pray in the masjid they have to have jihad they have to provide for their families they have to do so many things so the Prophet told the women in so many incidents that you have to give in charity in order for you to be protected from Hellfire as in the case of eight he used to encourage women to go to attend their Eid prayer unlike their message he used to tell them that pray in your home is far rewarding than praying in the message even in my Masjid but he would not prevent them from entering the message on the contrary he would tell the Guardians do not prevent women from attending the massacre but at the same token listen women it's best for you to pray in the masjid in eight it was the opposite he encouraged women whether in their menses whether they are young whether they're old to go and attend this gathering where a lot of Allah's blessings befall upon them and they would witness the Dawa of goodness with this Muslim gathering so he used to recommend so many of them to do certain forms of worship specifically for women like his wife for example zeyneb and josh and he used to also warn them from being extreme so even if they say if he sees that they are extreme in the sense and doing something out of the cinema he and I saw some would deny them from that mmm got it I'm sorry to rush you Sheikh but I promise we'll come back for part two of women you shall thank you very much for being with us all right we'll conclude today's episode of on women we promise to come back with a second part to conclude our discussion about women that were around the Prophet peace be upon him to help guide us on our interactions with women until then assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah Lippincott"
