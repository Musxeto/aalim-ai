  "transcript": "uh putting an act or actions to a later time so this means postponing Salah for example or postponing fasting of Ramadan if this is my understanding to the word this is not permissible if it would take the time out of the mandatory frame for example if a person's zaka is due today it is permissible to postpone it for a day or two or a week at most so that I could give it to the one in my mind that he needs it most but if I postpone it for a month or two this becomes Haram likewise it is permissible for me to postpone Isa prayer especially for females or for men who are away from Masjid if it's 8:00 Isa then they can postpone it until 11: until 10:00 because the later it is is to closer to midnight the best in Islam but if I'm going to pray it half an hour after midnight this is Haram because now it is out of its time and uh so on with uh all the other things in Allah"
