  "transcript": "Aftab from Malawi. Sheikh the question was, if am I sinful if I set an alarm for Fajr and the alarm rings and I wake up knowing consciously that okay I'm awake now? Okay so we've lost Aftab and most likely his question was if I were to set the alarm to wake up for Fajr and I wake up and intentionally snooze it and go to sleep and then I don't wake up until the sun is in the middle of the sky, I missed Fajr. So am I sinful? This is in Allah's hands. If you were mostly certain that when I snooze the alarm definitely I'm going to wake up within five to ten minutes before the time is over, I know myself I've done it a gazillion times in this case you're not sinful. But if you intentionally do this without setting the alarm again to ensure that you're going to wake up and you know for certain that you're not going to wake up then you are sinful and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it that's good for you. If you cannot you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
