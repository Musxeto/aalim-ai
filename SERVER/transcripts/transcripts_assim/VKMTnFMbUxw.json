  "transcript": "if you ever differed or argued or disputed over an issue refer it back to Allah and to the messenger Alat if you believe in Allah in the day of judgment how do we refer it back to Allah and to the prophet Alam by referring it back to the Quran and to the Sunnah and this is why in so many places in our families in our communities we are plagued by blind following the Scholars or the schools of thought sometimes disputes happen in the same house when a brother fights with his father or with his siblings or a sister fights with her mother because they blindly follow a particular school of thought and you come and say sheam said who in the heck is sheim let him go to wherever he wants who is he and they're right so if you say sh so and so sh so and so they will say okay we have also sh so and so and Sh so and so why don't you follow them is it the size of the biceps is it the number of the followers is it the tone of their skin no it is by Quran and Sunnah and this is why we tell you don't take from me or him take from the Quran and Sunnah whenever we say something we should back it up by so when you speak to them don't say to them so and so sad because they will counter that by saying well sh so and so said something different rather say to them says in the Quran or the prophet Muhammad said in this would shut them off totally because what can they do to refute what you're saying if they don't know any verse of the Quran or authentic Hadith that can counter it theyve lost they have to raise the white flag and said we surrender we believe and follow or they would be questioning their Islam because they rather follow Tom Dick or Harry rather than follow rather than following the Quran and theah which is a grave mistake and a sin so this is the best way of talking to people and Allah Knows Best"
