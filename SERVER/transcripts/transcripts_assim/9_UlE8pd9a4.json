  "transcript": "F fra from the US she says can you tell us the ruling on N so that we can remove the confusion in the United States and elsewhere what is is a slaughtered animal so n is an animal that was not slaughtered it was killed by banging its head electrifying it gassing it uh Strangling it many ways and these ways were mentioned in verse three chapter 5 where Allah mentioned that these types of n are Haram whether it falls from a mountain whether it's banged on the head where uh uh it it was engaged in a fight and ended in D all of these things are Haram so the question is what about us who live in the states or in Europe can we eat from what is sold in the market if you're in Belgium or maybe Holland and by decree by law the government prohibits anyone to slaughter so no way you go to any slaughter house and you find that they're slaughtering they have to stun an animal or Electrify it and kill it then they start to slaughter it if this is the case and this is the rule then it is totally prohibited for you to eat meat there unless it's graded as Halal unless a Muslim farmer who slaughtered himself and he presented to you but to buy it from the market or from restaurants is totally prohibited to eat this is dead meat this is NIS it's like pork but if you're in the UK or in the US and it's a Christian country predominantly Christians live there and Allah permitted us to eat from the meat of the Christians slaughtered they slaughter their animal don't misquote me say oh she is saying that you have to slaughter the Christians no again this is your sick understanding the when we say the slaughtering of the Christians meaning the the animals that the Christians had slaughtered these animals are Halal for us to eat so in America I don't know whether they slaughtered or not what to do there are two opinions the most authentic opinion which I follow is the opinion that binaz and had given the their opinion upon which is that this is a Christian country and in the Quran Allah tells us that the meat which is served by the people of the book the Christian the Jews is halal for us so by default it is halal until proven otherwise until someone comes to me and say this was not slaughtered this was electrified until it died say okay now I refrain and justification is that the prophet Alam in Medina was invited by a Jew woman and he attended her invitation and she offered him a sheep which the prophet ate from not asking her where did you get the money to buy the Sheep is it from riba is it from Haram no he didn't ask and he didn't ask her okay was this slaughtered did you mention the name of Allah no because she's a Jew she's from the people of the book by default it's Halal so likewise it is halal for you to eat until proven otherwise in the US or in Europe and Allah knows best finally"
