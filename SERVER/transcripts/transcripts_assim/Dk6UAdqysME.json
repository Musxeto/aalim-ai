  "transcript": "Heidi from the Emirates. Sheikh, how are you? I'm fine, Alhamdulillah. I want to ask one more, just a little bit of clarification. You gave a very nice advice on that we should not remind people our, we should not avoid people what we do good for the other people. It's not nice, it's not recommended in Islam. And what is the people if they are ungrateful, they are thankless, and they remind you that you did not do nothing for them. And although you've done a lot for them and still you're doing for them. But even in return they are ungrateful, thankless. So what is a person who is doing good? Okay, first of all, Heidi, those whom you have done lots of goodness to, and then they come and face you and lie to your face and say you never done anything good for us. One of two. If you were to confront them and say, no, I did this and I did this and I give you this and I helped you in this. The outcome is one of two. Either they will confess and say, oh, Astaghfirullah, I am sorry, I apologize, you're right, you have done so many good things for me. Or they will remain defiant and continue to lie and say, no, this was not done for the sake of Allah, you did not do this for me, you did not do anything. There isn't a third option. So if this is the case, number one, if you know that they have forgotten and you remind them not to rub it in, rather to open their eyes and remind them of what you had done so that they would not be ungrateful. And they would excuse you. This is self-defense. And there's no problem in that. It does not fall under the category of al-mann, which is reminding others of your favors upon them. But if you know that these people are by nature ungrateful, and no matter what you show them, even if you show it to them in video, they would still deny it and say you have not done anything. The best course of action is to give them a big smile and not reply to them. And not give them anything from date. And ignore them and move away. De-escalate. Why? I feel I want to avenge myself. Don't. What you have done was for the sake of Allah. Keep it for the sake of Allah. The moment you want to avenge yourself, this is when your reward goes down the drain. So there is no point in doing this. And it's best for you to have the upper hand and to be the one who's patient and tolerant and give your back to them and just de-escalate and leave."
