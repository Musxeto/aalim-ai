  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (3) - Things that made him happy - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "of the role model the prophet Allah indeed was the perfect human being and it's not true that he was always sad and contemplating and thinking of the hereafter because this is inhumane the prophet Salaam was the perfect balance he used to be sad and he used to be happy Whenever there is a reason to be sad he used to be sad and when there was a reason to be happy he was happy he was pleased when things needed to be pleased with and he was angry when he needed to be angry as a perfect human being he was filled with emotions and he used to become happy at times yet his happiness was in the direction of what pleases Allah and not for worldly matters we are happy when we buy a new car A new Gadget when we receive gifts worldly things this was not the case with the prophet so we will list few things just to understand how the prophet salallahu lived his life and what made him happy so that we may Rejoice with such things when it happens in our lives the prophet Allah as described by the companions whenever he was pleased or happy with with something his face would lit and his companions would recognize this in his face so in a sense he didn't have what we call poker face no the emotions would show on his face was and they would know by the change that they can see for example when people Embrace Islam revert to Islam especially when they are part of the elite or the dignitary of quraish the prophet would be happy because he knows that there will follow them a lot of the people and follow suit recrima may Allah be pleased with him he is the son of Abu jahl the fierce enemy of the Prophet Islam and of Islam he's the Pharaoh of this ummah he tormented Muslims killed them plotted against Islam did everything he could till his last breath such a an enemy you would hate everything that is related to them and you would have wanted to kill anyone related to them even their dogs not the prophet Allah Ray creamer when he heard of the conquest of Mecca fled and traveled all the way to Yemen and his wife traveled to him trying to convince him to accept Islam and not to fear for his life because whoever comes to the prophet Allah accepting Islam the prophet accepts that from him so he traveled back to the prophet sallallahu and accepted and reverted Islam the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was very happy and he jumped to him and gave him his cloak and took the Pledge of Allegiance from him when he came and this appeared clearly on the prophet's face and this shows you that the prophet sallam did not have any hidden agenda if he were to hate someone he would have hated the son of Abu jahil for what he had done yet he was happy for him accepting Islam likewise he was happy when ideas came and accepted Islam the prophet Allah smiled in his face and his face was lit when he announced that he came as Muslim likewise whenever the prophet Allah learned something knew that would confirm a fact that people denied he would be happy we spoke before about his adopted son Allah be pleased with him who was his son till adoption was abolished in Islam the prophet loved him as a real son and continued to love him Zaid was when described as white as cotton the prophet married him to an Abyssinian slave woman who took care of the Prophet when he was young so you can imagine how old she was and she gave birth to a young boy by the name of Usama however Osama was as black as night so people usually hinted that Osama is not the legitimate son of Zaid so it is white Caucasian and Osama is black how could that be and the prophet salallahu was discomforted by such comments and he did not like this he loved Usama and his father Zaid dearly like a son and a grandson until one day one of The Trackers his name was entered the house of the Prophet Allah when Usama and his father Zaid were lying down covering their faces only their feet showing from underneath the blanket to white feet two black feet as a Tracker as someone who has Insight of tracking people knowing things they have this ability and gift from Allah and he did not know the story behind Osama and his father and what the people say he commented the moment he saw these feet and he said these feet are from one another they belong to one another meaning that they're related the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was so happy that they the that this man managed to notice this without being hinted to and revealed what is a fact and the truth known to the prophet Islam but unknown to the others we all know that the prophet salallahu was tested and tried by a huge and severe calamity when the Hypocrites slandered his beloved wife Aisha an accuser of adultery with safwan one of the companions may Allah be pleased with him and they started spreading rumors and slandering her everywhere was dismayed and for a whole month Revelation did not come down to show her innocence or to reveal any of the truth and the prophet salallahu could not judge an issue by mere feelings he needed proof so after a whole month and after this ordeal revealed her innocence in Surah to Noor in the Quran and the prophet salallahu was so happy it would show on his face and he would come to our Isha laughing and the first thing he said to her Allah has proven your innocence so he was jubilant and happy with such a relief from Allah not only that as a human being the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was frequently bombarded by his beloved wives there were nine of them and they all demanded more money not to the extent that they wanted to buy Versace or whatever they just wanted a normal life we know the hardship the prophet Allah and his family went through when mother Aisha said that we would pass two months two months would pass upon us without lightning any fire in the house or cooking and what did you feed upon she says water and dates for two months so you can imagine the hardship especially for women who came from Rich families like those whom the prophet had married to Allah so when they came and complained the prophet salallahu was angered by their consistency in demanding and demanding so he took a pledge not to come close to them for a whole month and he took a small room in the Masjid and kept himself in seclusion from his all of his wives and everybody was thinking that he's going to divorce them after this month was was over he went as Allah has revealed to him and gave his wives the choice and among them was Aisha so Allah says o prophet of Allah say to your wife to your wives if you want this worldly life and it's adornment come I will provide for you and set you free I'll divorce you but if you want Allah and his messenger and the Hereafter then know that Allah has prepared for those who do good among you a great huge reward so the prophet salallahu said to her listen Aisha I'd like to mention something to you but don't give me an answer before Consulting your parents and he recited the Ayah so he gave her the choice and she said to him why would I consult my parents I want Allah and the prophet Allah and the hereafter so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was so happy with that it could show on his face because this is what he wanted he loved his wives but this is his mission in life this is his lifestyle this is how Allah made him and he cannot rest with the adornment of Life coming to him like everyone else among the things that made him happier where confirmation of things about the future prophecies that he told his companions of course all of his companions believed him undoubtedly but sometimes it would be nice it would feel nice if you get a confirmation that would reiterate what you had told them earlier and this happened when tamima Daddy may Allah be pleased with him came and he told the prophet Allah about his Encounter of the Antichrist on an island and some of the prophecies that he gave and it coincided exactly with what the prophet saws had told them about earlier and it fit like a glove so the prophet gathered all the Muslims all the companions in the Masjid and he told them tamim was a Christian and he encountered few things while on a sea Journey that coincide with what I told you earlier and he told them exactly in the very long Hadith how Tami met at the jail and how did the jail explained to them about the lake of tabariya about this about that how many days he's going to spend on Earth then the prophet said had I not told you about this before and they said yes o prophet of Allah you told us exactly these things before the story of tamim so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was happy that this Hadith of tamim coincided with whatever he used to tell them about Makkah and Medina and the antichrist the prophet salallahu also was happy whenever something good happened to any of his companions for example one of the three Poets of the prophet when he did not catch up with the Expedition with the prophet Islam to tabuk on the ninth year of Hijra and the prophet came back the Hypocrites came to give their apologies or we could not come and catch up with you because this because of that and the prophet would accept their apologies and two other men from the companions said o prophet of Allah we will not lie we had no excuse so the prophet ordered the companions not to speak to them for 50 days they were boycotted by the whole of Medina nobody would communicate with them or say salaam or talk with them until Allah revealed their his acceptance of their repentance so when this happened the prophet salallahu called cab and cab came and the prophet's face was lit with joy and happiness and it says have the Glad tithing or cap with the best day since your mother gave birth to you today when Allah has repented upon you and he said is this from you or from Allah he said this is from Allah the prophet was happy for cab and the prophet Allah would also become happy whenever he was supported by his companions at times of difficulty whenever he heard beautiful words like may Allah be pleased with him was with the prophet Allah and they were about to encounter the enemy forces and the prophet salallahu was afraid that he would not have the support of the people of Medina because he did not give them the pledge of allegiance to accompany him outside of Medina outskirts but rather to defend him while being within the limits of Medina so when he he had to go out and fight he was hesitant he was afraid maybe they won't back me up so may Allah be pleased with him said to him o prophet of Allah we will not say to you like the Jews said to Moses peace be upon him go you and your lord and fight we are sitting here we're not coming with you rather we will fight to your right to your left from in front of you and from behind you meaning that we will be with you round the clock don't be afraid so the prophet saws face lit and he was pleased with that the prophet Allah and I will conclude with this was also happy whenever there was a Cause to be happy whenever the Muslims have benefited it so whenever the prophet heard some news that was positive that was helpful for the Muslims and for Islam he would prostrate in happiness in showing his gratitude to Allah and this happens only in something that does not re-occur unlike what many ignorant among the Muslims do nowadays after Fajr prayer all of a sudden after the rathkar they just go and prostrate okay what are you doing come he said I'm prostrating to Allah showing my gratitude and I said but this is not permissible he said subhanallah the prophet used to offer this sujuda sugar and I said yes but all Scholars say that he used to do this when something that does not really occur happens such as the conquest of a country that was in war against Islam and the Muslims or the saving of a Muslim prisoner and the release or something that happens once every blue moon because if we were to be grateful to Allah and show our gratitude with this sujood for His blessings and favors we would not stop prostrating he gave us the sight he gave us the hearing he gave us the health he gave us the wealth he gave us the shelter so many things so he will keep on prostrating till the day of judgment this is not the way of the Prophet Allah so what you're doing is an innovation don't do this when you receive receive your paycheck at the end of the month don't prostrate for gratitude because this is coming every month but if your father goes into ICU and he undergoes a surgery a major surgery a life-threatening surgery and he makes it yes you can make this sujud because this is once every blue moon and the prophet Allah would also be happy and show his jubilation when the Muslims come and give for charity as in the case when few Nomads came into the Masjid with torn clothes and signs of poverty over them and the prophet was angered by that and you can say see it in his face so he started encouraging the Muslims on the pulpit to give and shelter themselves from Hellfire even by half a date and he recited the verses that would encourage this nobody moved everybody was sitting until one man came with a big bag of food and clothes that barely he could carry and he placed it in front of the prophet as Charity the moment the companions saw this they immediately ran to their homes and brought all what they can until they made a big pile of food and clothes and things that they would benefit from then the face of the Prophet Allah lit and he was pleased by their reaction to his call to help those in need this is how we should react this is when we should be happy not for worldly things not for seeing sins when we hear of people coming to Islam even if they were enemies of Islam we are happy when we see Muslims benefiting from charity we're happy when we see Glad Tidings for Islam the Muslims we become happy like the prophet alaihissala to assalam"
