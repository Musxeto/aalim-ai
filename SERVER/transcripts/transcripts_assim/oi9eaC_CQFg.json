  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord I mean on my back Hajj is the fifth pillar of Islam so are there a scar prescribed to say when doing umrah or Hajj of course whenever you are set after wearing your ehram assuming the state of a Haram for your umrah or for your Hajj the Sunnah is to say a telbia now telbia is not your intention this is something you say verbally as form of vicar so what do we say we say foreign in response to your call here I am in English it may sound like here I am what is this but in Arabic when someone says awesome I would say in a fraction of a second meaning here I am yeah meaning at your service at your command whatever you want so here I am here I am you have no partner here I am again Le bake verily all praise Grace and sovereignty belongs to you you have no partner imagine saying this over and over and go over from the beginning of your RAM till you see the Kaaba it may take an hour it may take a day it may take a full week until you reach your destination but you keep on saying this thicker here I am o Allah and the Sunnah for the men to raise their voices so when you see a convoy of pilgrims going for Hajj from the mirpat onwards they raise their voices the men that is not the women women say it silently and they raise their voices with they still be what a beautiful scene man what a beautiful expression and show of being servants and slaves of Allah azzawajal we've reached Makkah we've entered the Haram may Allah Grant you and me a complete and perfect when we at the tawaf what do we say when we Circle the Kaaba he was whenever he came back by the black stone he would one either kiss it if not possible to touch it with his hand and make us his hand if not possible three touch it with a small spear and if not possible simply point at it it's on my left I do not go as many people say Allahu Akbar this is wrong it's while going round and circulating the Kaaba you say Allahu Akbar and some Scholars say you say Bismillah Allah the the confirmation is to say Allahu Akbar which is Allah is the greatest while we are going around the Kaaba just before the corner where the black stone is there is a corner called yamani because it's directed towards the South which is Yemen so one side each Sunnah to wipe no kissing and no pointing just wife if not possible then once I pass it between it and the black stone which is maybe less than a minute walk the Sunnah is to say hasana o our Lord grant us the best in this life and the best in the next life and protect us from the torment of hell protect us from the torment of Hell or from adabu and Nar the punishment of the fire now we finished our tawaf we pray to rakas behind Maham Ibrahim and we go for Sai is to walk between the two hills Safa and al-marwah so what do we do in the very beginning foreign foreign that when he approached Mount Safa he recited indeed are from the places of worship of Allah this is an iron or a part of an eye and then the prophet said I'm I begin with what Allah began with which is a Safa this is why he started from a Safa and then as he climbed it he said this Ayah now remember is only to be recited once and that is the first time you climb over asafa when you go to al-marwah you don't recite this eye when you go back to asafa you don't recite this Ayah so seven rounds you don't recite it except in the very first and then what then the prophet Allah after he climbed a Safa until he showed the Kaaba he faced the Kaaba and he said Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar and then this is Allah is the greatest three times and then he would say the following Dua none has the right of course we say it in Arabic again none has the right to be worshiped except Allah alone without any partner to him belongs all sovereignty and praise and he is over all things omnipotent none has the right to be worshiped except Allah alone he has the right no none has the right to be worshiped except Allah alone he fulfilled his promise aided his servant and single-handedly defeated the a Confederates or the allies and the prophet used to repeat this three times and then he walks to al-marwah and he does the same thing three times and makes Dua afterwards in between and prolong the Dua so this are places of dura and vicar this is all the time we have until we meet next time [Music]"
