  "title": "🆕🌟Can we say PLEASE 🙏  in Dua? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Is it permissible to say please in Dua in terms of begging Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala? This is not from the Sunnah to say please because your Dua by praising Allah Azza Wa Jal and glorifying Him and offering salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ is the Sunnah. Saying please or I beg you or do this, I insist on you, this is not from the Sunnah. However it is permissible to say please. What is not permissible to say if you wish. This is not permissible to be said in Dua because it implies that as if someone is forcing Allah Azza Wa Jal to do something that he doesn't want to do. So if you wish you can forgive my sins or if you wish you can pay off my debt. If you don't, I'm fine with that. No, this is not permissible. The Prophet ﷺ says when someone asks Allah, he must affirm his request from Allah Azza Wa Jal and not be hesitant saying do this if you wish, forgive me if you will. No, he has to affirm it and be certain of Allah's accepting it and Allah knows best."
