  "transcript": "brother Hyder says that there is an individual and he gives his name he is a citizen of Pakistan claiming that Allah is showing him divine dreams and telling him about the future and claiming that most of his dreams came true I personally do not believe see a single word he says can you please let everybody know what kind of people these are first of all I advise brothers and sisters not to send names unless it is necessary now the name he coated I don't know the person and I might be slandering on-air someone who is righteous practising etc and this person brother Haider might be just interested in tarnishing his reputation I don't know but without giving names if a person claims to be righteous to be practicing and to see divine dreams and that Allah is speaking to him and telling him things about the future and he wants people to follow him this is exactly what we had addressed just before the break that when you want exposure you do anything even if you have to lie even if you have to become an advocate of the devil there's no problem for you and this is problematic it was reported before that in one of the seasons of Hajj the pilgrims while going around the Kaaba caught a man a Bedouin trying to get some faeces and soiling the Kaaba with it and a jazz impurity they got hold of him they beat him up and they take him to the Muslim ruler and the Muslim ruler looked at him and said subhanAllah why did you do what you had done are you a Muslim he says yes sir I'm almost so why why were you trying to to soil the Kaaba with faces he said I wanted to be remembered by the people even if they curse me so years later they would say do you remember so-and-so the Bedouin may Allah curse him so people acknowledge him know him and know his name even if it was through cursing him so wanting Fame wanting to become exposed wanting to be well-known among others this is one of the greatest diseases and illnesses of the heart may Allah protect us no doubt such an individual who claims that he has divine dreams is a soothsayer someone is visited frequently by jinn manipulating his head telling him 99 lies and one true thing that they eavesdropped from the heavens and people believe them either he's a soothsayer or he's a blatant liar making things up for the fame for the exposure in the media and after a few years when people discover that he is a blatant liar he would have gained millions of rupees real estates mansions and become rich so what let them curse him this is how people think may Allah so shall save us and protect us from such lies"
