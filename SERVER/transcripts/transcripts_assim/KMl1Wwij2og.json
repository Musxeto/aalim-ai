  "transcript": "Salman from India Sheikh I know of the couple who were in an illicit relationship Haram relationship but they are now repenting and are planning to get married to each other they have cut all ties while repenting they have separated and do not talk to each other in any way but the check out each other's WhatsApp profile pictures which are actually not their own photos but rather quranic versus hadiths Etc and sometimes cartoon images showing that the girl is missing the boy as they are not together like they were used to so is it okay to see these profile pictures each other for this affects their repentance the repentance which the scholars refer to after having an illicit relationship that is prior to getting married is repenting from the major sin of Zina so they repented from Zina and they feel their remorse and they pledge not to do it again and they quit anything that relates them to that major sin in this case this repentance is valid for them to get married now if they as you've explained check one's uh uh one other one another's uh profile or Facebook or what they publish about themselves and WhatsApp or exchange images of showing that they miss one another this does not impact the repentance of Zina but it impacts their repentance of having Haram relationship with the opposite gender but this does not impact their marriage if they were to get married so my advice to them is to totally cut all Communications to block one another and if the man is serious he should go and propose to the girl's guardian and get things in the right track thank you"
