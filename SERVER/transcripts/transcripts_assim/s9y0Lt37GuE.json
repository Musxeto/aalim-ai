  "transcript": "oh used to say before it rains and we know what he used to say while it was raining so what did he say after the rain was over chapter 65 after rainfall when the rain stops the prophet alice assam used to say we've been given rain by the grace of the mercy of allah again the reign is over yet he has to show and teach his followers his ummah that we attribute such a favor and blessing to allah the almighty aza wajal and this means that we have to attribute everything in life that is good to allah the almighty not to the stars not to the clouds not to the season rather to the one who originally gave this to us the following chapter asking for clear skies why would we ask for clear skies when it rains for too long and we're afraid that the rain is going to be something harmful for the lands and for the animals and for our crops then we should ask allah azza to seize the rain and this is what happened once while the prophet was giving khutbah for jumu'ah a nomad came and said oh prophet of allah it's feminine drought we are starving and there is no water ask allah azzawajal for reign so the prophet during the khutba he says allahumma arithna the one which i mentioned last episode o allah relieve us three times and he asked for rain anna sublimaric the narrator says out of nowhere a small dot like a cloud started to become bigger and bigger and bigger in matter of minutes and it started pouring as the english say dogs and cats so everybody was happy and relieved then they went home the following week the rain continued for a whole week so during the khutba the man came and said the prophet of allah we're we have drowned the earth has flooded and the cattle is about to drown and die so ask allah azza to stop the rain the same guy maybe another one but a whole week it continued to rain so the prophet susan raised his hands and said allah let the rain fall around us and not upon us so he did not ask allah to seize the rain but to divert it so that still the lands would benefit from it so let us let it fall around us and not upon us o allah let it fall on the pastures the hills pastures are you know a little bit highlands the hills the valleys and the roots of trees these areas the rain benefits the land the most especially the valleys when it runs and it goes to where it was supposed to go rather than on the cities and on the towns that drowns it and kills everything if it was overdue so there is a dua when we want train there is a dua when we want the rain to stop what else the prophet alaihis salatu whenever he saw the crescent moon he used to say a dua and we know that the new moon is born 12 times a year the beginning of every lunar month a new moon is born and we see this small crescent that becomes bigger and bigger until it's the middle of the month 13th 14th and the 15th of the lunar days this is when we have the full moon and then it reduces in size what did the prophet allah say when he saw that he used to say allahu akbar allah allahu akbar why does he say that because when you look at the moon and you see how small it is and how big it's going to be this is one of allah's signs one of allah's creatures and it's so small so tiny yet it's so huge in our eyes allah is bigger than that that's why we say allah is the greatest o allah let the crescent loom above us in safety faith peace and islam so let it be a good omen for us and in agreement with all that you love and pleases you o our lord our lord and your lord is allah who am i addressing i'm addressing the crescent that listen your lord and my lord is allah the almighty this shows you the communication the reaction to whatever happens around the prophet allah nothing is attributed to himself nothing is attributed to his wealth everything is attributed to tawheed to directing people to direct communication and connection with allah the almighty as wajal likewise every single blessing we get is from allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala and there 4 chapter 68 upon breaking the fast what do we say why did i fast in the first place because allah ordered me to do so so when i fast inevitably when the sun sets i have to break my fast what to say after a long day of fasting the moment i eat my dates and have a sip of water the sunnah is to say the thirst has gone the veins are moistened and the reward is confirmed insha'allah with the will of allah what does this indicate it indicates that all these 16 or 17 or even 20 hours of fasting the pain and suffering the hunger and the thirst are gone and now the thirst has disappeared with a few sips of water and the veins are moistened now i feel refreshed all of this is gone but the reward is confirmed if allah wills with the will of allah azzawajal and this is life it is so short 70 80 years you live on this earth but then it's gone and once it's gone the only thing that remains is seeking allah's forgiveness and the reward that awaits you in jannat [Music] allah foreign [Music] foreign"
