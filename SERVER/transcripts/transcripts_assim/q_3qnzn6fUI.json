  "transcript": "in our Muslim homes you don't hear curs words you don't hear vulgar and profanity because the prophet saidat the believer that's you and me the believer does not slander curse or speak in an obscene or foul manner in our Muslim homes we should bring the children with love and compassion and not continuous reprimanding and blaming and criticizing you have to teach them in kindness because this is a longterm investment it's not something you just want to get out of your chest by shouting and scolding and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to teach the children by saying Yul oh boy Say bah eat from in front of you and eat with your right hand this is how the prophet used to deal with children and those who live in Muslim homes are kind to their neighbors they don't harm them they don't blast the music they don't throw trash in front of them they don't let the water run into their homes because the prophet saidat no one from whose harm his neighbor is not safe will enter Paradise if your neighbor is not safe from your harm you will not enter Paradise"
