  "transcript": "uh she when I travel to visit my relatives they always do Haram activities in their houses like free mixing drinking alcohol back biting listening to music and the whole nine yards It seems impossible to physically keep the ti of kinship with them and I cannot control what they do in their houses so she my question is if I only stay in touch with them by doing phone audio calls and text messages would I be counted as the one who cuts the ties of kinship no you are not the one who cuts the ties of kinship because it is totally 110% prohibited for you to go to them when there is such Haram activities this exempts you from visiting them free mixing consumption of alcohol Haram presence of sins you're not allowed to go there now you have to figure it out sometimes you say that I go to them on the occasion ofid and they're all celebrating say okay don't go to them in visit them in other occasions when they're alone because they do these sins when they're together so instead of going to your grandpa's house where all the uncles and their wives and their children are gathering you know that this will be Haram go to your grandfather's house a month later when there is no Gathering so you can visit your grandfather and your grandma go to your uncle's house go to your aunt's house alone without any activity if you know that this would be inshallah possible without facing any Haram and Allah Knows Best"
