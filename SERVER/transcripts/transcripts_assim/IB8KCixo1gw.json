  "title": "How to respond to non muslims who say there are errors in Islamic law of inheritance assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question was about uh inheritance in the Quran and specifically the ratio so I know this is mentioned in Surah verse 11 but um many non-muslims are saying this is an ex this verse is an example of like a mistake in the Quran somehow where they give an example for example a man dies with a hundred dollars and he leaves behind like a wife three daughters and parents so the ratios he would have to give would be 1 8 to the Y of two-thirds to his daughters and 1 6 to each of the parents but when you add these up they don't equal a hundred dollars so they'll like be more than 100 so we need to give 112 and a half dollars so my question is how would some like situation how would the situation be solved and it you know how can we respond to these people saying this is a mistake first of all we address the non-muslims and say to them is this the only mistake you found in the whole entire Islam Eureka that's good that's fine and we will have an answer for that as well but if it is the only mistake it wouldn't be logical that the 99.9 percent which is all correct and valid and false proof would cover and overwhelm this single mistake that your minds could not comprehend or if we look at your own religion and find that it is 75 percent filled with errors or even 60 percent filled with errors and 40 that makes logic what ratio are you talking about this what you have mentioned along with other cases in the laws of inheritance are solved by if I'm not mistaking uh the word of owl and it is recalculating the percentages because this is an offshoot something that is not normal or regular so they deduct in proportion from all the parties so that they would be equivalent and the ratio would be the same and this is a correction that the companions did may Allah be pleased with them and they never doubted the Quran or the Sunnah the tabirin and for 15th centuries Muslims have been applying it it's not something new it is found also in some cases when the wife and the parents are left over or the husband and the parents are left uh when the wife dies or the husband dies and also there is a form of Correction between the ratio of the father and the mother of the deceased where it should have been differently this is all fixed and known by the companions and the consensus is there among the Companions and the Muslims of fixing this ratio so there is no mistake and again we talk to the non-muslims is it the only thing you found wrong in the Sharia alhamdulillah the others the so the overwhelming correct and logical and fair and just rules of sharia should overwhelm this thing that your head could not comprehend"
