  "title": "Is using a 𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐜𝐤 during 𝐅𝐫𝐢𝐝𝐚𝐲 𝐊𝐡𝐮𝐭𝐛𝐚𝐡 Sunnah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing uh from bangladesh so sheikh my question is what's the ruling on using a stick during the friday sermon is it a sheikh jazz so the holding of a staff or a sword or a stick by the imam during giving khutbah during friday prayers is not part of the sunnah it was reported that the prophet used to do this before he had the mimbar which was made for him by a carpenter that was a slave of a woman from the ansar so before he had this pulpit or member he needed something to depend on while standing so this is why some of the reports stated that he used to hold a staff or a stick or a spear or a sword nowadays we find in modern times in some countries the imam coming with a stick or with a sword leaning on it as if it's representing a sunnah which is not a sunnah and this is something that people unfortunately uh don't know and have no knowledge of you"
