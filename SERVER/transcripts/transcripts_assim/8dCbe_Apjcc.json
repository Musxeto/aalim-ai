  "transcript": "Ahmed from UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam So Sheikh I have a question that Is it halal to trade forex like gold and other currencies using swap free fundet accounts? So fundet account is a fundet account which you pay like $60 or more and they give you a kind of exam that if you pass they will give you the account which can be $5000 up to $100k depending on the amount you pay and that fundet account have automatic leverage but it doesn't take any interest from the leverage it just takes a fee or commission but no interest so the only time you pay is $50 and then after you pass and start trading gold or anything else the money that you trade with is not like your money so when you start placing a trade and then if you win the trade you will take like 80% of the money and they will take the 20% so is it halal to trade gold or other currencies with fundet accounts? If not what is the halal way? Because nowadays we can buy 3000 gold worth of gold and bring it home and sell it when it's up Jazakallah Khairan This is 110% haram It is totally prohibited to deal with such leverage because this is all riba based and they are giving you a bait so that you would trade with so if you put $1000 to trade with they will give you another $9000 from their own so this is $10,000 you can trade with the moment the amount goes below $9,400 they will block your account take their $9,000 which is their capital and $400 from you they will take as profit so this is total gambling and riba based loan and haram and every kind of trade on forex is not something that's tangible that you have certificates on it's only digits on a monitor so it's all a hoax and it's not permissible for you to buy if you wish you can buy a gold bar 20g, 50g, 100g and keep it in a safe place in your house and the moment the gold goes up sell it and cash the money if you wish"
