chef a symbol of man Hakim sure Hassan is a well-known dad who has travelled extensively to many countries across the world and has been the leading Khateeb an imam of a Masjid in Jeddah Saudi Arabia for the last 21 years sure Hassan welcome her and thank you for having me she Hassan for many Muslims today it is very difficult for them they find themselves dealing with issues that aren't necessarily dealt with directly in the Quran and in Sunnah we went to the street to find out the opinion of the common Muslim on this issue this issue of Falcon no-hassle or contemporary fit to see what they had to say about it let's go to the footage what do you know about now a self-similar and rahim what do I know about effect namazi namaz it is about a methodology in Islam where we can deal with emergency situations like in boudoir how we can take a food in desert where there is no water present in desert this also many things I think I know about it not much no signalizing sorry I'm gonna pee no was it actually there's no much thing I know about Finn or Z but y know is phenomenal it's about Islam give us some chance in emergency case such as a pregnant woman is it is not obligatory for her to continue his fasting if she scared about the baby's condition you with issues of the rudy or issues of necessity could you please elaborate on this issue especially this term that is new to many of us as muslims I mean the you know Muhammad you know sorry I Jemaine this is quite new to a lot of the Muslims as it's a branch of science that not a lot of Muslims know about simply because it is not addressed to the mass or to the public only a handful of scholars who are qualified to discuss these things know about it yet this branch of fit is very important because we know that jurisprudence or Islamic  is divided into a number of categories so there is the fact that deals with forms of worship such as purification prayers fasting and there is another part of fact that deals with transactions and so on no acid is the understanding of the nasal which is the singular of namazi which is a plural name of it and if you look at the origin of the word nas Allah it comes from the word descending so it is engaged it is focused on studying issues that are happening in contemporary times and they require an Islamic ruling so there are things that happen at the time of the Prophet Allah so Absalom and the Quran either answered them address them or the Prophet Salla Salim himself gave the verdict or the Islamic ruling on them but Islam is a religion that's being revived on and on it's a living religion it's not something that is suitable for a particular time or a specific location it's reoccurring things that are reoccurring need to be addressed over and over again and that is why we need to strive to know the ruling of the Sharia on a particular incident this is where Ana wazzle come in and there is this terminology of analyzing which is a general and broad sense of a no-hassle and looking at them and there is a specific one which is and now as it else up here which talks only about the incidents that deal with fit so what's the difference it's very simple freaking nawaz it it makes you understand how to deal and treat things that are temporary whether they're religious they can be related to flip they can be related to Athena for example the new sects the new Creed's and ideologies that are reoccurring or happening for the first time so this is an as Allah that has to be studied thoroughly and then the verdict would be given there are things that take place in language and it's also considered to be an as Allah there are innovations inventions that are not related to Islam so these are all called Noah's it and you have to understand how to deal and treat them what we're focusing on is a Noah's Iliff Appiah and if you look at the word in the wazzle itself you can look at it from a number of directions for example there are as of mentioned earlier looking at them in respect to hapax so is it fair or is it linguistic or is it science or is it Creed and Annunaki de you can look at it in terms of its importance because there is an as Allah that it is extremely important that you have to be very careful when tackling for example if it's political or if it's relating to the welfare of the whole Ummah with respect to when it's about an individual so this is an as Allah and the other one is also an as Allah but it's a different weight and size reoccurrence you can look at it from the angle of how many times that has happened there are no azov that only concern a limited limited number of people like political asylum for example like seeking the nationality or the the citizenship of a non-muslim country this is addressing a limited number of people but there are also something that happens a lot to Muslims like praying in the airplane this is something that did not take place at the time of Prophet Elias or Sam so we have to give a particular ruling to in this regard there are things that happen in between we need to look into them such as bank accounts credit cards etc so it depends on how you look at it and of course the final angle or one of the angles that you can look at this topic as well is whether it has an origin that took place at the salif's time or it's completely new set of meaning earlier generations yes that's exactly what I meant because for example if you look at sperms Bank they never had anything they never anticipated having anything like this so this is something that's completely new but if you look at some forms of transactions such as bei Almora Baja which is a merabh AAHA transaction in it's a sort of Islamic financing will this had an origin to it at the time of our predecessors but it's not exactly as they discussed it so we have to look into these things dissect it analyze it and then give the ruling of it so what we understand then is that the economizer noelia is in general it's a contemporary issue it's something where we look at modern-day issues and we're trying to understand how Islam can deal with these issues because there's no direct ruling found in the Quran or the Sun now how does this fall back on the fundamentals of the religion or looking at the fundamentals when dealing with deciphering these rulings when the scholars go and issue a ruling how does it go back to the fundamentals can you please explain for us okay that's a good question we have to understand first of all that it's exactly what you have just mentioned that made these issues come up to the top this technological advancement this industrial boom that we are living calls for new things and these new things can only be looked at from this branch of fill because it did not have any direct link in the Quran and the Sunnah directing us to them and that is why scholars had to put a lot of effort trying to figure out how to give the ruling on such topics and issues and I believe I don't know if you share this with me but I believe that this shows us how strong Islam is and how compatible it is to all times into all place I believe that it is a great manifestation that Islam is appropriate for all times and locations rock lava Kamisha I don't think there's any Muslim that can disagree with that statement I will continue in just a moment Sharla after we go to the break assalamualaikum welcome to la / kettle you [Music] Molly cule Brocato and welcome back to contemporary issues in SM we were just discussing right before the break which awesome below planet Hakim share Assam we were discussing the issue of how Islam is a universal religion and it's for all times in place and one of the miracles of Islam is that it can adapt with an essential look at its fundamentals when addressing any issue no matter how big or how small how do a Muslims deal with these new issues these contemporary issues when they come about is there a procedure to follow is there certain steps that we have to look towards I completely agree with the concept as you've mentioned before the break that there's no Muslim who does not believe that Islam is suitable for every time and place I may disagree with this statement because I know that with the influence of different ideologies there are a number of Muslims who beg to differ and they think that Islam it should be isolated in a Masjid it should be kept behind walls it has nothing to do with finance politics economy art etc thinking that Islam is only restricted to the time of the Prophet Elisha harem this is not true Islam is suitable for all times simply because allah azza wajal is the source of Islam and he created us and he knows what is the best thing for us secondly the prophet sallallaahu is allah our prophet is the seal of prophethood so there's no prophet or messenger after him which means that this is the final religion of Allah the Quran is the final revelation and this has to go on till the end of time therefore Islam is suitable for all times and for all places and from this we understand that a great responsibility lies on the shoulders of scholars who have to contribute positively and they have to strive and put a lot of effort so that they could give the people the best solution that is stemmed from the Quran and from the Sunnah and which also calls us to apply Islam in all aspects of our life not only in our forms of worship prayer fasting etc but also in politic politics and economy in running the country because Islam is a way of life it's not only forms of worship that should be isolated in a message or segregated from our life not a fake ownership share but who are the scholars that we should be looking up to when we want answers to these questions we find many people going with sincere an earnest desire to find a result whether it be an issue of insurance or issue of health care or issues of banking and we find them going to scholars who many times seem to be leading them astray so how can we know the righteous scholar and the sincere scholar over the scholar who's basically giving Fattah WA and giving verdicts for a checkbook every month well a proper scholar is a person who has the characteristics of a scholar in the sense that he has the knowledge the proper knowledge it's not necessarily that he's articulate or he can deliver a beautiful speech it's not necessarily he's a good orator but he has to have possess the tools of knowledge of Islamic knowledge that gives him the way or the means to give fatwa so he has to be knowledgeable in Arabic and without Arabic he cannot be a scholar he has to be knowledgeable in silk so he has to know the different schools of thought and what they contributed in our great religion he has to be extremely knowledgeable and the fundamentals of fit known as a Sulha fit which gives him an overview of Islam as rules and guidance that he must follow he has to be knowledgeable of contemporary issues so he cannot give fatwa without knowing where this came from and this is why if someone asks us is there a process that we should follow to give a fatwa on such new incidents there is yes there is a lengthy process and there are a number of conditions that that should be fulfilled and among them you have to visualize an incident so if you are a sheikh and someone comes to you and says what's the ruling on X Y Z and you have no idea what X Y is that means if you like a lot of the people do nowadays if you shoot from the hip and say it's Haram it's forbidden or if you say it's halide its permissible you're wrong in both ways and it's a form of oppression in either way because you're either making the religion too easy for someone or too difficult or someone exactly you have to know what the person asking you quit the question means it's not enough for you to say yes sir No so when someone asks you about something you have to visualize it if he tells you about a financial transaction and you you don't know anything about it he has to explain it if he asks you about a medical procedure and you're not a doctor you're not a physician you have to ask a physician to explain it to you until you visualize it and have a 360 degrees understanding of it so basically yeah sure we need to have a communion or a union between these scholars of Islam and the scholars of the field which are in question so if we have a question regarding economics we need not only a scholar of Islamic jurisprudence to help understand the situation from an Islamic point of view whether it's permissible or not but we also at the same time need a scholar of economics to make it clear for the for the Islamic scholar what exactly that issue entails and likewise issues of medicine or issues of cosmetics and so on is that correct this is completely correct I remember one of my friends who was an airline captain was that the gathering of Sheikh Mohammed the masala hadith I mean may Allah have mercy on his soul and the Sheikh was asked about the direction of Qibla in Canada because it's almost on the other side of Saudi Arabia so some of them used to pray to the direction of the east and some would pray to the direction of the west and the Sheikh did not know what to say until this pilot told him about how things are and he described it to him over a map and about the distances and how things are in the Sheikh was very pleased and he said that we have to have experts in their fields in our gatherings so whenever we're asked about something that is dealing with economy an economists would speak if we have a question about something dealing with medicine a doctor would speak and then we give the ruling of Sharia of Islam whether it's permissible or not after understanding it so this is extremely important now after you visualize it then you move on to trying to know under what category of Islam it falls under so now we visualized it now we have to try to think it over and see that according to the Quran and the Sunnah and the rulings of Islam we try to know whether it is it's permissible or not and how does this come about for example when you deposit money in the bank account now is this money a deposit or is it a loan to the bank you have to know because there are differences between a loan and a deposit if I deposit money with you and the money was destroyed it was annihilated the house burned for example without any form of aggression from your site or negligence it just happened I have no right to come and tell you give me my money back because you were entrusted with it there was a deposit while if it were to be alone it's a different story because alone you have to pay it back whether you lost it it was burnt it was gone it was confiscated it's alone it's related to your person and you have to pay it back regardless so now when you look at bank accounts you try to figure it out you have to have this realization I visualized the finance and the bank system now I have to visualize under what ruling does it fall in Islam is it alone or is it a deposit likewise in so many things that would add value to you and know how to look into it I'll give you an example scholars say that in order to know under which category it falls under there are four types one that falls under a general verse of the Quran or of the Sunnah or of the consensus of scholars for example among the contrary things if you electrocute an animal it's dead so can I eat the meat or not this falls under the category or the the verse of the Quran that it's a dead meat whether it was killed by hitting it on the head electrocuting it etc it's dead so this has the direct ruling and indirect evidence yes this is part one part two things that do not have a clear-cut direct ruling but there is something that took place long ago that we can put it under the same ruling for example an open buffet it's a contemporary thing you go to hotels restaurants you pay a fixed amount of money and you can eat all what you want yeah so if you're thin and skinny and it's different to your consumption if you are big in fact so scholars said how can we look at this how can we figure it out there is nothing in the Quran or CERN that that governs this yes but there are similar things that are equal in so using PS or analogy to some sort of but to an incident that took place for example they measured this to an issue of the public baths Baraka logicoma share unfortunately we're just about out of time for today until next time assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh you Oh"
