  "transcript": "Tonight is Medina from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Me and my brother might go to Jeddah, and my brother's passport says he's a Muslim, but he isn't. And I know that he really wanted to see Mecca or Medina, but things as much as I know, he's not allowed to go there. So now my question is, what is my responsibility in this matter? Like do I have to, if he goes there and I tell him not to, do I have to tell like the authorities? Or should I cancel the trip in hope that he will also not go there? Or can I just let him be? First of all, it is a very dangerous thing to play the game of giving Takfir. Now I could sit with anyone, and he could say something that may sound blasphemous, and I'd jump the gun and say, you're a kafir, you're an apostate, and I spread this all over the place. Now the Prophet, Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, whoever says to another Muslim, O you kafir, one of them is going to take that label. So it is one of the qualities and treats of Al-Khawarij to give Takfir to others. Having said that, I'm not saying that people may not do or say things that would nullify their Islam. No, they can do this easily. However, in order for me to identify and label a particular individual, like your brother, to be a kafir, there are a number of conditions that must be checked and fulfilled, and a number of obstacles that I must make sure that they do not exist. Because one of these obstacles can block me from giving Takfir to him. If you say without any doubt, he is a blatant kafir, he insulted the Qur'an, he stepped on it, he cursed Allah, he cursed the Prophet Muhammad, Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, repeatedly, and did heinous things, despite the fact we've explained that to him. He did things that are beyond doubt acts of kufr, and the conditions are fulfilled, and the obstacles are removed. In this case, if he's only going to enter Mecca because you're going there, no, you should not go with him, and you have to cancel that trip to prevent such a kafir from entering the holy shrines. If he's going with you or without you, in this case you need someone who's a mahram to accompany you, you may go there and benefit of it. Telling the authorities would not do you any good, because this is a case of slandering that has to be proved in a court of law, and would cause you and him great hardship, and it's not in your ability to prevent him and block him, or to prove that against him, in a foreign country. Despite the fact that the authorities don't have the authority to block someone who says I'm a Muslim. Someone he says and claims that he's a Muslim, do we have to cut his chest and scrutinize his heart and give him a placement test to prove it? No, this is not logical in Allah."
