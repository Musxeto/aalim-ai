  "transcript": "brother was D had two questions first question is a very valid question a lot of the Muslims fall into this mistake they think that okay let's head to birds with one stone zakat is mandatory upon me and when is a better time to give the cat out other than Ramadan so they delay there's a cat until Ramadan and some of them do it religiously thinking that yes this is part of Islam the cat can't be paid except in Ramadan this is totally bogus what do you mean he never the Prophet Isis am instructed us to give zakat in Ramadan no the Companions know that the followers of the Companions first of all second of all zakat is mandated once a lunar year passes so if I started saving or I got a hundred thousand Coweta dinars a la creme this month which is Rajab which is Gemma Dell Allah for example the fifth month of the hijiri calendar after one year the same month I have to give the cat 2.5% this is the condition one to reach the threshold and tableaux on Assad to that a full lunar year you do rural a hellhole is complete now to delay it to the month of Ramadan it is totally prohibited because it is prescribed at a specific time that you have to pay it's like someone saying okay moderate prayer is like about 6:30 but because I know that the best and preferred time for Allah is the last third of the night which is approximately at 2:30 a.m. so I'm gonna delay my Maghrib and pray then I say it's not accepted don't pray it because Allah will not accept it from you you are innovating in the debut you're making up things that the Prophet never instructed us to do Alice Oh Sam so this is wrong and it's a misconception not only that a key you are harming the poor sufferer Allah how would I be harming the pool when I'm giving them money in Ramadan when every Muslim gives his zakat in Ramadan to the poor what about the rest of the year which is 11 months and the poor are needy and they're waiting for someone to give them a helping hand and he said no only in Ramadan while if I give my zakat in Muharram and you give it and suffer and he gives it in ribeir√£o and he gives it an Raja and he gives it in each a while then the poor would not be able to accommodate the needs throughout the year not on a specific month now brother Wesley says what about delaying it so that a particular participant is available well the scenario as scholars say is one of two either the participant or the recipient of the zakat is soon to come so it's like a week ten days maybe a little bit give or take a few days couple of days there's no problem in delaying it with this intention but if the guy is for example in Pakistan and he's coming after four months you cannot delay this far or this much sit share but he's my cousin and I in his really poor and needy I'm only going there after four months to give him there's a cat so can I keep it with me yes you can providing you give him a call today when the cat is due and tell them but if he is by my zakat is due today or I have two thousand reals for you with me so do you authorize me to keep it to you until I come after four months if he says yes no problem keep it with you please in this case there's a cat has been given to the recipient and you are now our kill an agent for him you have received it and kept it for safekeeping until you go and send it to him and this is permissible but to delay it for more than a week 10 days give or so give or take a couple of days more this is as the scholars say is not legitimate one more point and this is a bonus and it's an extra thing is that delaying it is not permissible but paying it before its time is permissible how is that my zakat is always on the 8th month of the year which is Shaban and now we are in the fifth month which is jamaat al allah and all of a sudden i see someone who is in desperate need of the cat he is deserving to take the cat so I said to myself I can't wait another three months the guy is in dire need so what do I do I can give him this a cat of three months later now so if for example I estimate that my zakat would be ten thousand reals so I give him the ten thousand reals for his operation for his rent for paying off his debt whatever he needs it for and when Shaban comes the eighth month of the year I calculate my zakat and see how much am I obliged to give zakat if it is twelve thousand so the balance is two thousand I gave him ten I have two thousand now to give for the deserving people no problem if it is less if my real zakat is 8,000 or 9,000 so the nine thousand of zakat has been given and the 1,000 extra is a charity and it cannot there's no problem in sha Allah in doing that and the hadith of even of a best uncle of the Prophet Isis I am where the Prophet himself said that Allah bath gave me his jacket for two years in advance which means that paying it in advance is permissible and la knows best"
