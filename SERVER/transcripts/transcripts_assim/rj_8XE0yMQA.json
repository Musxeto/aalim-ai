  "title": "Giving dawah to opposite gender - Assim al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "zayn had four questions one there's a counselor chancellor in his school and she is christian and he's hesitant in giving her dawah don't give her dawahi you're a boy you're a male and you should keep your distance away from the opposite gender first of all second of all the best form of dawah is practicing practicing islam when you sit with her in a room and when you talk with her freely and when you look at her and you say that i'm giving dawah and she says but all what you're doing is against your quran and sunnah so what kind of dawah are you doing what kind of walking the talk or talk or doing what you claim that you uh that is your conviction this is going against your beliefs so i would not advise you to do this the muslim sisters would do that probably"
