  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany Yunus Alaykum Sheikh Alaykumussalam to Allah So, you said often that I have to pick one Sheikh and then follow him and now the thing is I don't know who to follow with answers to all my questions like you don't answer all my questions I have to go basic for example Islam Q&A the thing is if I for example pick you okay I'll follow Sheikh Asim and I don't find an answer for you of you who should I then follow because the rest one because the other ones also differ so should I make it a ranking so Asim then Islam Q&A then Dr. Mohamed Salah so on so forth oh like what should I do if my Sheikh doesn't have all answers and can I switch Sheikh so for example if I move to Morocco then like everyone's Maliki I come there as Asim al-Hakimi then I'm going to do everything different I hope it's clear it is clear however this is something that is between you and Allah Azza wa Jal the process is as follows number one you must follow the Quran the authentic Hadith with the understanding of the three favorite generations I don't have the ability to do this Sheikh I don't know the difference between Quran and the Hadith and if someone recites it or reads it to me in Arabic I'm lost in this case you have to follow one trusted Sheikh and depending on the Sheikh that is available for you so if you have a ranking of who's to trust most then you should follow that if he's unavailable or you try to call him and he doesn't pick up the phone because you usually call six times or ten times or 15 or 20 times a day and he's irritated from the frequency of your calls so he decides not to pick up then you go to the second in ranking who's available if not available then to the third one so you have to select those whom you believe that would save your neck on the day of judgment if you ask them and that they are trustworthy they're knowledgeable and you trust that they're saying and doing the right thing to the best of your ability and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best you"
