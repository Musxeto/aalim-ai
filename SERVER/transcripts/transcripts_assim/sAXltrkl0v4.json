  "transcript": "i'li Ayub says assalamualaikum shaikh I'm happy I got a chance to ask a question from you I know financing a car on RIBA is Haram good but is it allowed to finance a car on zero interest how could anyone finance a car with zero interest show me the place because I need a couple of cars for myself there's always some strings attached let's listen to the rest of the question he says they only take penalty for the car for a month I can't pay on that on time and after it is still 0% they say which even happens when I rent an apartment and other stuff yeah ID lau any penalty on the delay of payment whether it's strength whether its installments this is clear Reba because you all you owe them money so and this unfortunately some so-called Islamic schools do it I take my child into the school and I have to pay the first semester in the beginning or at the end so if it's at the end of the second first semester and I fail to pay it they add a percentage and they call it penalty because of the delay in payment this is clear Reba this is totally prohibited people say sure how can we ensure that they pay on time this is not my business taking money take the money in advance or don't admit the child but if they were to pay at the end of the semester and they fail and you add money to that in this case you are charging them likewise with the installments of your car"
