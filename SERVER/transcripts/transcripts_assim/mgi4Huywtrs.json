  "title": "A teacher spanking children",
  "transcript": "I want to know if it is allowed for the teachers to beat their students if not what should the student do when he faces this situation thank you this depends on the regulations of the country and it depends on the parents generally speaking I have taught with the grace of Allah for 15 years in a high school and I've never ever laid a hand on a student and I've never ever cursed a student in my life alhamdulillah and I still have great relationships with uh my uh students and with their parents and with their even sons and and daughters as well uh but sometimes at an early age when the child is about s or 9 years old as spanking not being meeting would sometimes be required but this again depends on the regulations of the country and it depends on the approval of the parents long ago in Saudi Arabia my parent my father would come and take me when I was 6 or seven years old to school and we would address the Headmaster or the teacher by saying here is my son you have the meat and I'll take back the bones this is this was really scary you know so so the the the father my father was giving full approval that even if you skin him alive you take the meat return the bones back to me I have no problem this caused us to fear our teachers and to respect them of course but at the same time be polite so we were always polite with our teachers we will always respectful and obedient because we know that if we're not we're going to get a be a spanking nowadays what we see not only in Saudi Arabia in the Arab countries but also in Europe and the states we see that respect is not there anymore and children are being brought up to be uh nasty to be rude and to be disrespectful to the elders and this is bad so opening the door for all teachers to spank whenever they want is wrong and closing the door altogether is wrong as well there has to be a med uh a middle way I personally as I said I do not approve uh spanking the children especially grown-ups but sometimes when you are uh having a dis a disciplinary problem in a class with a renegate child sometimes you have to intimidate this child so that he would become obedient and respectful of the law and respectful of the elders and Allah Knows Best"
