  "transcript": "I think it's for all the Muslims in around Europe we have a kid and basically in here in UK and the kid is going to school basically they teach them about genders and we have no choice and the best way you basically have to leave Europe and where do we go we're from Iraq and which is not safe and we are basically in bad position and we don't know what to do because if we go with the beer and we might be asking every week you know we have to go to please you know where we go it's not safe basically you know it's sunnibo is run by the you know what I mean okay okay this is a problem that most Muslims living in kafir lands face but to my knowledge the UK is the best place for Muslims to live in because they're people and their government are very tolerant and open-minded unlike neighboring countries who are hypocritical and blatant Liars when they say that there is democracy in their land rather there is communism and the likes and socialism enforcing their people not to wear the the girls in school not to wear the Abaya not the head scarf the Avaya anything that relates them to their religion is totally banned UK is the best to my knowledge so alhamdulillah if you are unable to prevent your kids from studying in such public schools there are private schools Muslim schools that do not teach this if you're totally unable and you don't have the means to migrate to a Muslim country in this case you have to focus on condensing the amount of Islamic knowledge you give to your children to teach them that this gender issue and the lgbtq and the sex education is all against Islam and teaching the proper knowledge about Islam teach them how to abide by the Quran and the Sunnah and to have their own identity and inshallah they will be saved"
