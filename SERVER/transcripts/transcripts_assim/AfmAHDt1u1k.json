  "transcript": "Ammar from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, I heard a student of knowledge That he said that if we know Two or more different views of different students of knowledge We should take from the one we trust the most but from some others they said we should take the easiest or the hardest or Whatever opinion we want now, I'm confused. What should I do? Should I follow the easiest opinion hardest? I am I don't know what to choose Follow me That's all This puts you off your confusion. Akhi, we've said this so many times You have to find as a layman someone a Particular individual who you trust his knowledge his moral conduct his akhlaq his wisdom and Who has been? Consistent over the years not flipping and changing his opinion every now and then and who follows the Quran and the Sunnah clearly And he follows the great scholars of Islam and you follow him you cannot go and cherry-pick from oh, I have two opinions of Students of knowledge this one and this one meaning my name my name Oh, no, you have to follow one and All the way and he will protect you on the day of judgment because you will come and say he is my shield He's the one I trust it. I have no knowledge I don't have the ability to differentiate between what's right and what's wrong So I followed him because he's the one who I trusted and he's the one who told me to do this He'll take the blame for you But you can't go and say, okay, I'll take the hardest opinion that's not right Islam is not like that as it is not right that you go and say I'll take the easiest I'll take whatever is convenient for me because this is fatwa shopping and cherry-picking"
