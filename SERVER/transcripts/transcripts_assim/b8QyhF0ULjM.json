  "transcript": "from india is value added tax comes under riba valued added tax yes okay the last question is from kalthum from india is vat valued at a tax is it riba no it's not riba valued added tax is a percentage that is taken on things that you purchase and the vast majority of scholars say that this is not permissible especially when the government has enough revenue to not use such taxes but if a country is stone broke and they have no income and they have no ability to generate what runs the country some scholars say that this is permissible because originally the prophet said allah in the farewell speech that your blood that your wealth that your honor is haram upon one another as it is haram on this date in this holy month and in this holy lands so it is not permissible for me to just come and impose taxes on you and take your money unlawfully it is not permissible for me to come and where whatever you're bringing from abroad i take customs on it a percentage this is my hard-earned money who gives you the right to take it so what to do well you have all the right to object but at the end of the day you have to pay otherwise they throw you in jail and you can claim your right on the day of judgment from allah azzawajal who would compensate you for what was taken from you and allah azza knows best we have a short break"
