  "transcript": "Islam came with a perfect religion because it came from Allah who created us and knows what is best for us yeah and this is why Islam prohibited demonic and satanic habits that include changing the creation of Allah so it is pro prohibited in Islam to pluck the eyebrows both for men and women as the prophet cursed whoever does this it is prohibited to have tattoos on your flesh and I see a lot of the Muslims unfortunately who live in these countries think that it's cool to have some ink on your skin not knowing that they are cursed for this but when they see celebrities when they see athletes and when they see those whom they look up to doing this this is when you lose yourself you lose your identity you lose your pride and honor when you imitate someone like those also Islam prohibits connecting the hair with extensions and it's a major sin Islam honors hair the prophet told us Whoever has hair should honor it doing what offering it coffee of course not honoring the hair is to Comal it down to put some um oil or the like so it would not looking good to Comet and to have it tidy and clean and this is why in Islam it is prohibited to have and is to leave some part of the hair on your head and shave others so this kind of haircut is Haram in Islam but unfortunately a lot of the Muslims think it's cool and with the weather here everything you do is cool"
