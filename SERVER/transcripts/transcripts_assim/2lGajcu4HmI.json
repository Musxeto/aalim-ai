  "transcript": "uh Chef I have a question that a friend of mine asked is non-muslim he said um he believes in one God and he doesn't practice any religions if he does good and dies would he go to heaven okay okay so we know from the Quran and from the Sunnah that Allah clearly stated in the Quran whoever chooses other than Islam to be his religion it would not be accepted from him and this means that if you believe in the presence of an existence of one God but you don't believe in the prophet Muhammad or in the Quran then you're not a Muslim and hence you'll be abiding in hell for eternity and the prophet had said that Allah clearly when he said with whom my soul is in his hand so he's swearing by Allah azzawajal there's no Jew or Christian who hears of me and does not believe and follow me except Allah will throw them in hell and this is a clear indication that without accepting Islam wholeheartedly there you have no chance in survival in the Hereafter enjoy your 60 and 70 years on Earth but then you're going to be thrown into hell for eternity and that's a very very heavy price Allah has given you everything in these 60 or 70 years on Earth showed you the way showed you all the evidence is you need to acknowledge his existence and to believe that he had revealed the ultimate book his own words to be your Constitution and guidance and sent you his best messenger peace be upon him to be your role model you have no excuse you want to enjoy life in your own whims and desires going against Islam be my guest but don't blame other than yourself because you will not live a happy life you'll be always depressed suicidal thinking that everything is against you because you don't have it in your heart and when you die you're gonna go straight to hell and believe me it's not a nice or Pleasant place to be in but if you join the two billion Muslims living on Earth today and see the tranquility and happiness and peace they're living and live their life with the Tranquility with this tawheed the Oneness of Allah with the belief in the Sharia in the Quran and in the prophet of Islam Muhammad he will be the happiest person on Earth and when you die you'll go straight to heaven for eternity and this will blow your mind if you were to just contemplate upon this notion of 60 or 70 years on Earth and this is what's your choices are these are what your choices are either Heaven For Eternity or Hell For Eternity and the choice is yours"
