  "transcript": "numbers are toxic and used to say harsh and dirty words like you are a character-less and no man will marry you this is anonymous but it's from a sister apparently uh and my uh oftentimes my family members are angry without any reason i am practicing to be good muslim but i forgive them most of the time but sometimes i get angry and i shout at them and i use rubbish language may you please suggest any thus be no there is no tasbih for that tasbih is saying subhanallah so if somebody insults you you say subhanallah he said you are characterless you don't have a character alhamdulillah this is there's nothing in sharia like that abusive people they bully you in order to make you respond in a negative way so when you say rubbish things and you shout at them you've uh fallen into their trap and you've done what they were hoping for so mission accomplished what to do i always say this in my counseling sessions when people complain if someone says to me and in arabia this is an insult if someone says to you you are a donkey if somebody says to me you're a donkey does this mean that i'm going to grow two ears and a tail no so they can say whatever they want to say when abusive people bully you and say bad things to you they are anticipating your response that would incriminate you and make you wrong so what to do turn the tables on their head how to do that first always keep a smiling face you have no character you're this you're that you'll never get married you're ugly you're short you're dark you're fat you're keep a smiling face two never defend yourself no i'm not ugly i have so many friends who are more ugly than me i have a beautiful face so many people say that i'm thin that i'm skinny that i'm this never defend yourself even what if they what they're telling are blatant lies never no need what will they do sue you don't defend yourself thirdly never argue with them why did you put this on the table why is this happening why just smile and look at them play with your mobile answer questions don't do anything that would make them feel comfortable this would kill them softly this would turn the tables on their heads and they will shout and they will make a scene out of it everyone in the gathering would say why why are they shouting the poor girl is sitting there and smiling in their faces and they're bullying her oh they're evil people after five six times of repeating this scenario they will feel ashamed of themselves feel very little feel insulted and they will stop it's not easy it needs a lot of training it needs a lot of support from allah but if inevitably once you get there you will taste the beautiful sweetness of such a behavior and allah knows best"
