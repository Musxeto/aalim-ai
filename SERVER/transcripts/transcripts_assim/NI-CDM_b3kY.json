  "transcript": "foreign the first question from the sisters in terms of Discord what kind of terms do we have to be with our fellow Muslims and the second question what if the person does not take responsibility for wrong I'm not good in doing riddles English is not my first language so I'm a bit confused I could answer these questions a gazillion way you need to be specific what do you mean by in terms of Discord Discord is known why are we differing if it is over something of the Dunya I'll give you my right no problem we're fighting over my parking spot I must take it no problem I'm not gonna do a make an issue out of it but if it's something in the team let's look into it analyze is it something that's an issue of dispute women must cover their faces no women don't with their faces No you you're they use if she doesn't do that no you're an extremist uh a terrorist come on this is not a cause of Discord this is no reason to fight over an issue that's acceptable among the Muslims he'll go your way I go my way you say potato I say potato who cares but if it's something related to hakida when I say that there is torment in the grave according to the vast majority of Muslims except the Hawaii and he said no no no there is nothing in the grave we dig up people when they're dead and there's okay when you say that Allah can't be seen in the Hereafter like and I said whoa Allah mentioned this in the Quran this is something that we cannot compromise we cannot have middle ground this is total a no-go if you insult and say that she committed adultery and you curse man um this is there's no Common Ground between us so you have to as a scholar or a student of knowledge or someone with knowledge to weigh the pros and cons and know when it's acceptable and when it's not so I I don't know if this makes any sense"
