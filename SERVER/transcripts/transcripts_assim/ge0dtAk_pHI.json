  "transcript": "Ubay from Tunisia. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Salam to Allah. My question is, during iftar my family watches TV, TV shows with music and other haram content and I always mute the sound and advise them but they get mad at me and turn it back on. If I eat alone they probably boycott me, so what should I do? So here Akhi you have to acknowledge that there is no obedience to anyone in disobeying Allah Azza Wa Jal and being who you are and advising them with evidence from the Quran and the sunnah and they reject that. They don't want to listen to that. However their sin is upon them. But when you sit with them this sin is also affecting you negatively, therefore you cannot sit with them even if they will boycott you only on iftar or on this meal suhoor. But other than that you can sit with them, you can talk with them, you can socialize with them, you can be dutiful and obedient to them. However whenever there is a sin you must not sit with them as Allah mentioned in Surah An-Nisa chapter 4 verse 140 and Allah knows best."
