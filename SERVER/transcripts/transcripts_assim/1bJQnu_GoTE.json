  "title": "Even Quraish didn't accept Haram money for Kabah, why is it ok to build masjid with interest money?",
  "transcript": "this is directed towards you i have seen i have seen your video shift in which you said it is permissible to give interest money for building a masjid with some remarks like the donors should not expect reward from allah for such a donation uh we know from history that uh even before uh the prophethere did not accept money for building kaaba with money not earned in proper way this has confused me peace can you explain first of all quraish before islam did not accept haram money does this have any ruling in islam is no quraysh was not a muslim so we don't take our religion from them islam was not at the time revealed so we don't take rules from it secondly the actual money that we have so this is a bill if i buy halal things or haram things does this bill become impure meaning if i give it to you as a loan saying that you have to return it back to me with 10 riba so when you return it back to me is this now filthy because it's riba based the answer is no the money itself is halal the earner is sinful for earning it so for example we know that the jews deal in riba in interest and usually and they embezzle people extort people and take money from the people unlawfully however when the prophet was invited to iran that was cooked for him by a jew woman the prophet did not ask her where did you get the money from was it from riba was it from embezzling people and exhorting them no he accepted the invitation and ate from that poisoned ram which means that the money itself is halal yet the earning is haram and therefore if a person has interest money he's either earning it willingly and happy he's sinful for that or he has no other place to deposit his money except in such interest-based bank accounts and they give him interest as in the case in india he's forced to take it it comes to his account without him being able to control it so in either cases the interest is haram for the earner whether willingly or unwillingly so when he takes it and gives it to me and says shahasim i have a lot of interest money for example and you have your weekly program on zad and on huda tv and it costs a thousand euros per program so i would like to give you 54 000 euros for the whole year to sponsor it for the sake of allah this is interest money i wouldn't say oh ram no i will take the money and give it to the channel because they are paying a thousand euros a day from for my program and they need money but you will not get any reward with allah because the origin of your money is haram yet we can use it in our program we can use it on our tv channel we can use it in our islamic center we can rebuild our messages with it without any problem inshallah"
