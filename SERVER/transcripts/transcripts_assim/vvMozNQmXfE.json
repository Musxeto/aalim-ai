  "transcript": "we as parents in general and as fathers in particular have a great responsibility towards our children and with mixed emotions sometimes it's a bit difficult to determine how to deal with our children and the best way to know how to deal with them is to look at the greatest teacher of all s wasam and how he used to deal with his children the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam first of all stated that for a father for a teacher for a brother for any individual when dealing with the children you have to be merciful the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam said he is not from Among Us who does not have mercy on our youngsters our children and is not respectful to our elders and the youngsters have a very important role in the life of the Prophet alham as he gave them a lot of interest and this begins from day one well actually it begins earlier than day one it starts from choosing your spouse because she will be responsible for upbringing Your Child So if you want to have a good child you should have a good wife and this is why the prophet wasam ordered us to select and to choose the one who has religion and once this happens even in the war moment of intimacy when a person is about to have intercourse with his wife the prophet tells us Sall Ali wasallam A Dua that we must say so that Shan could not harm our children and the Dua everybody knows once you say this then with the Great gra of Allah he would not be able to harm your child and we also care for our children once they are born by showing signs of Jubilation and happiness especially when a female is born unlike the mush unlike the idol worshippers who once they are given the Glad Tidings of the birth of a daughter their faces turn dark Allah says and when the news of the birth of a female child is brought to any of them his face becomes dark and he is filled with inward grief the prophet goes onam to tell us how to select names of our children and he tells us that the best of names is Abdullah and rman and these two beautiful names relate the child to their lord Alman to Allah the almighty Asel and on the seventh day we're ordered to circumcise the boy we're ordered to shave the head of the newborn and we're ordered to sacrifice two Rams for a a male child and one RAM for a male for a female child as sign of gratitude to Allah and showing how happy you are if you look at the S of the Prophet you will never find him and you'll never find a report or a Hadith ever stating that he had spanked a child or that he has punished a child or cursed him for any given reason because he was sent as a Mercy to Mankind s unfortunately we have forgotten the basics of Islam and you find in our household that violence is controlling we never speak to our children except in an admonishing admonishing uh uh uh tone without saying are you stupid can't you understand how many times do I have to tell you this or without pushing them or spanking them or insulting them in front of others and these are against all basics of Islamic upbringing the prophet Alat wasam once kissed alassan his grandchild the son of Ali the son of Fatima and in his yard in his court there was and he said with astonishment prophet of Allah you kiss your grand Child by Allah I have 10 of my own offspring I have 10 Sons I've never kissed any one of them in my life and the prophet looked at him and saidat he who does not have mercy will not have Allah's mercy upon him and this is a grave warning to us if you don't have this Mercy to your own child then Allah will not be merciful to you and in another narration the prophet told himam what can I do to you if Allah has taken the mercy out of your heart the prophet Alat wasam once was on the pulpit giving a sermon to the Muslims imagine the whole Muslim um is sitting in the Masjid and the prophet is giving them giving them advice he's preaching them and all of a sudden he sees Hassan Hussein wearing two red garments barely able to walk 3 years four years of age maybe less entering the Masjid the prophet Alat wasam interrupted his speech came down from the pulpit and carried them and he recited to the companions the Ayah in the Quran your wealth and your children are only a trial the prophet is confessing I can't help it I I love these two grandchildren of mine may Allah be pleased with them and likewise this was not with the boys alone even his granddaughter abuat may Allah be pleased with him tells us that the prophet once came out to the prayer carrying um um is the daughter of his daughter Zab so she is his granddaughter so he started praying carrying her on his shoulder and whenever he bowed or prostrated he placed her on the ground whenever he stood up he again put her on his shoulder throughout the whole prayer what does this express to you imagine if I an Imam of a Masjid went to my congregation and was carrying one of my children or one of my grandchildren how would the people react what do the people nowadays do when children come into the Masjid imagine grownup men shouting and screaming in the Masjid don't bring your children don't do this who are you to say this do you know more than the prophet wasam it shows you how far away we are from the Sunnah of the Prophet wasam likewise a Hadith when the prophet once prayed and he came to the prayer carrying Al Hassan or Al Hussein the narrator is doubtful which one of the two and the prophet started the prayer and in one of his prostrations he prolonged it so long that the companions feared that he died in prayer so one of them left his head to find the prophet prostrating with alhassan on his back mounting him like a aide and when the prophet concluded his prayer they told him prophet of Allah you did something that uh um was too long and we thought that something had happened to you or that maybe Allah is revealing to you and the prophet saidat wasam my grandson took me as a ride and I didn't want to interrupt him this is from the prophet Alat prolonging the prayer which everybody else is praying behind him for the sake of the heart of this young infant this young child which shows the importance of taking care of the feelings of our children the prophet Alat wasam despite his political and social status as the head of the state whenever he passed by children playing he would come and read Salam to them nowadays if I'm walking in the street and someone meets me I expect him to start the Salam because I'm the sheh I am the Elder I am this and that this is arogant this is a disease in the heart you should come down to the people and the prophet used to come down and greet the children because of the mercy and the love he had in his heart he used to do this not as a Public Relation gimmick he doesn't want to gain votes he did this because he was merciful this was his nature sallallahu alaihi wasallam which we should strive to make it our na our nature the prophet used to play with the children and used to give his condolences to a child AB a young child of four years of age or five who is a brother of anas Malik the prophet used to visit their house often and he had a small bird in a cage and all of a sudden the bird died and the child was in grief and he was sad and the prophet whenever he saw himam he would joyfully play with him and say and it Rhymes the child's name what did the small bird do as form of condoling him sallallah alhi wasallam he used to call children and he used to give them gifts he was once brought a garment and he said where is and who was about 5 years of age a young uh female companion and when they brought her he gave her that dress to wear and so he did that to Usama Zade may Allah be pleased with him Zade as you know was the adopted son of the Prophet before adoption was uh abrogated and Usama was his son soam may Allah be pleased with him once brought the Garment of the yein the king of Yemen so you can imagine that it's not an antique it is a very exotic uh uh uh dress that only is worn by Emperors and Kings so he bought it with a large amount of money and he gave it to the prophet so that the prophet would wear it and the prophet didn't even look at it he said where is usam and Usama was brought to him and he gave him that beautiful garment to wear he used toat react to the cry and to the Weeping of children in a prayer once while he was praying he heard a child cry so he hastened to to finish his prayer quickly and the companions were astonished because of the speed of the Prophet Alam once he concluded the prayer he said I heard the child crying and I was merciful for his mother's heart so I concluded my prayer quickly so that she can attend him and by Allah this is the mercy in the prophet's heart that we lack he did not reprimand The Woman by finishing the prayer and saying oh women what don't you fear Allah don't bring your children to the mosque no he did not do that he did not reprimand a child as so many ignorant Elders do in the Masjid a child is a child if he shouts if he runs in the Masjid this is his nature do you expect a 5-year-old child to sit idle in the Masjid and write a thesis for example he's not normal if you see a child sitting on a chair not speaking not playing not doing anything for a couple hours this child is autistic probably or he has a problem this is not normal you have to look into it so we have to understand the nature of our children the prophet used to be approached by a by a young girl and she would say oh prophet of Allah I have a problem and I need to address it to with you and I want to talk to you and the prophet Alam would give her an appointment she comes and she takes his hand and she drags him in the streets of Medina complaining about her problem and the pro Prophet is walking behind her listening to her problem he used to S wasallam pay a lot of attention which we should do to the feelings of the children's to the feelings of the children especially and specifically when it comes to jealousy and we know what happened with Yousef Prophet The Prophet Yousef PE be upon him with his brothers and how they got rid of him because of the love of his father Prophet y peace be upon him who could not conceal and hide his feelings towards Yousef the prophet wasam used to warn us from being unfair when it comes to gifts with our children because because this disturbs the psychological aspects of the child when he sees his parent preferring one over the other and inash may Allah be pleased with him and with his father when Al bash gave an his son a gift his wife was a wise woman she said I will not accept your gift to my son until you take the prophet as your witness so he went to the prophet and told him I gave my son an a gift and my wife told me to make you a witness so the prophet said did you give all of your children a similar gift and said said no I did not Al bash the father of said no I did not oh prophet of Allah so the prophet said do not make me a witness over such Injustice fear Allah and be fair to your Offspring to your children why would the prophet do such a thing because if you favor one over the other he will hold feelings of of hatred of Envy he will have a grudge against his own brother which the prophet Alam uh does not want and there is a difference between gifts and maintenance what a child needs is different than what you give as a gift and this is not the time to discuss this an Malik may Allah be pleased with him also tells us an incident that we rarely give attention to while the prophet was sitting one of his companions was sitting next to him so his boy his child came in and this companion held the boy kissed him hugged him and put him in his lap and moments later the man's daughter who was almost the same age also came in and the man took the girl and put her next to him the prophet Alat wasam looked at the man and said you were not fair with both of them the boy you kiss and hug and put him in your lap and the girl you put her on your side this is not fair and this is not part of the Islamic teachings of how to treat the children despite his love and mercy to the children this did not stop the prophet Alat from teaching them from educating them and we all know that the prophet you know the Dua of we always say this in Ramadan in Witter in uh Etc who relayed this Hadith to us believe it or not it was alassan Ali a seven-year-old child who came to the prophet and said oh prophet of Allah teach me something to say in my prayer in my Witter and the prophet taught him the Dua and this shows us that we should cater for our children's needs and questions when your son asks you something don't ignore it and treat him as if he doesn't understand give him weight give him size give him importance in life so that he would be able to re uh to act positively inshallah Abbas tells us that when he was a a youngster 10 years of age the prophet used to uh uh take him behind him on his right and he used to advise him and he used to give himam and the great we know and look what happened to abdah he became one of the greatest Scholars Of All Times may Allah be pleased with him also whenever a child did something wrong the prophet would advise him would correct him but with love with care with Mercy the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam in theith used to eat with the prophet and he was his stepson sallallahu alaihi wasallam and once the prophet saw him eat and he said oh boy say eat with your right hand and eat from what is in front of you because he used to eat with his left and he used to eat from whatever was uh um in the dish whether it was in front of him or not and he would not take that lightly and say oh he's young he's a no he would Sall wasallam advise him and teach him uh and correct him likewise when alhassan uh um took a date that he found on the ground he the prophet Alat wasam told him meaning that this is not for you you are from you cannot eat charity and he took it out from his mouth the prophet wasam used to correct mistakes whenever he sees them he would not ignore them once he heard children mocking the aan imagine this happens from children they were playing so one of them was calling the Adan in a mocking way making fun out of it and the prophet told them bring me that person who's making that aan and making fun of it so they brought him that and the child was Abu Mah he was from Mecca and this was after the conquest of Mecca and these PE boys were just uh recently reverted and the prophet wiped over his head and over his chest and he said you have a beautiful voice I will teach you the proper aan and he taught him the Adan and he became the MU of mecah he didn't admonish him he didn't punish him the prophet on the contrary he redirected him and this is what you should you should do as a father you should redirect your child advise him give him nice uh uh so that Allah would open his heart to that with the grace of Allah the prophet used to order us to take care of our children by instruct them instructing them to perform forms of worship at a very early age because this would stick in their heads and they will be brought up on worshiping Allah didn't he say instruct your children to pray when they're seven and spank them when they're 10 meaning if they do not pray 3 years is far more than enough to have our children accustomed to prayer and in this three day three years 365 days five prayers a day you never uh back out you're always adamant to have your child pray uh encouraging him come my son come my daughter yes let's go without any punishment or reprimanding for 3 years and then when he's 10 years of age if he still continues to be reluctant in praying you can spank him slightly not beat the heck out of him or break his bones or put scars in his face no you have to be fair and and and know how to do this uh the companions used to order their children when they're seven years of age to fast or six years of age and if they felt really hungry or weak they would make them fast until time and give them food or encourage them to fast until and then give them a gift so this is far part of their training and we know about I Abbas and how he used to pray night prayer when the prophet was at his aunt's house Muna may Allah be pleased with her he he used to pray at night prayer and I Abbas used to stand next next to him and pray with the Prophet The Prophet Sall Ali wasallam used to trust the children empower the children do you imagine this Sal may Allah be pleased with him he was six or seven years of age when his people came and accepted Islam and he was the most learned among them to memorize the Quran so the prophet allowed him to lead them in prayer to lead men to lead Warriors because he memorized more Quran than they did so in short as a parent what you choose today is what will reflect on our future with the grace of Allah how you choose to deal with your child you will see this when you grow old you will see the impact of what you have said or done on your child's Behavior you will see that on the community that would benefit inshallah from that our children today are tomorrow's men they are tomorrow's leaders nations rise on the shoulders of our children today and if we take care of them if we cater for their needs if we teach them their religion properly and teach them how to implement this religion as pleases Allah if we protect them from whatever harms them physically mentally or religiously and try our level best to upbring them as strong men with the grace of Allah asael we would find them effective and we would find them fruitful and they would be a satisfaction to our hearts and to our eyes whenever we look at them so it is a long investment it is our responsibility it is not something that we have chosen but rather it is something that Allah has usted us with if you look at your child in this way and through the spectrum of the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat you will manage with the grace of Allah to have fulfilled what the prophet Alam entrusted us with and you will inshallah be successful in having an offspring that would benefit you even when you are buried in your grave the prophet saidat wasam when the man dies all of his Good Deeds are over are cut are discontinued except of three and he mentioned one of them a righteous offspring that he or she supplicates and invokes Allah for you with this I conclude my talk I pray to Allah the almighty that he grants you and me and all of the Muslim umah children that would carry the burden and the responsibility of this umah that would cater for the needs of this umah that would take this umah from the ground level that she's in into the highest levels of success and honor may Allah Asel Grant you and me offspring that would become scholars in Islam that would become good practicing Muslims who would give the best illustration of Islamic morals and and and ethics to the whole world a mean and with this I Leave You"
