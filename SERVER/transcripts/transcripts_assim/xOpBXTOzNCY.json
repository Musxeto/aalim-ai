  "title": "I know going to Birthday Parties is haram but if my parents force me to go & I go, am I sinful?",
  "transcript": "from saudi so my question is if my friend has a birthday party and um and i don't want to go because i know but my parents tell me to go and maybe they might force me am i uh and i go am i a sin or no okay i will answer inshallah that hashem from saudi arabia i think his parents oblige him to attend a birthday party he knows it is not permissible to attend such parties so what should he do if they are forcing him nothing don't go you're a man and the word forcing we have to look into it is it compelling or not someone comes to me and says i forced i was forced to divorce my wife does the divorce take place and i said um being forced means that you don't have the freedom of will so the divorce does not take place wrong answer what do you mean you should ask what kind of force was used ah sorry so ahi how did they force you to divorce your wife he says she told me that she won't cook me dinner tonight if i don't divorce her and i was hungry so i divorced her this is not forcing she said to me that she will travel back home next week so i was forced to divorce her this is not forcing a compelling forcing is that when she brings a gun and puts it to your head and says divorce me or i'll blow your brains all over the place when she is in in the 60th floor and she threatens to throw herself and you know she creates she's crazy and she's going gonna do that this is compelling forcing you you divorce and it doesn't take place likewise your parents what will they do they hold a gun against your head no they will probably say that we will shout at you we will not give you pocket money etc and this is not compelling forcing you need to hold your grounds and remain steadfast on islam there's no obedience to any creature while disobeying the creed the creator the almighty"
