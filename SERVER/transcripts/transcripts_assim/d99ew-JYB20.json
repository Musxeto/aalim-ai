  "title": "Can I do Istekhara for my Daughter's marriage? Marrying out of your community - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Rabia she says that mashallah her daughter is getting proposals of marriage so can she makes Tahara the answer is esta Hara first of all is to be done by the person involved so the proposals are not coming to you Sarah it's coming to your daughter so your daughter is the one who makes mr. Hara and she does not make a stay Hara until she accepts a proposal so if she gets five proposals and proposal number two is suitable and she's happy and satisfied with it she may go and ask for a meeting or an engagement and before that she makes esta Hara but not on the five themselves because she has to pick one of them secondly when you say that they proposed to her from outside of the community so you get different nationalities different ethnicities and you want to reject this so is this permissible or are we not being grateful to Allah for sending us such proposals the criteria that the Prophet RSO saram said that whenever someone comes to you with satisfactory religious practice and moral commitment so two things his religion and his Halep if they are accepted then you should give him in marriage he did not speak about wealth he did not speak about beauty he did not speak about ethnicity or nationality however people say and scholars say that if this is against the norm in the community if her relatives will be offended by her marrying an expert or marrying someone of a different race etc and this would cause problems in this case you have all the right to refuse such such a proposal and it's not the end of the world and in my opinion so many times we've seen that such marriages face a lot of difficulties and sometimes end up in failure when someone from Saudi Arabia marries someone from America different culture different way of thinking different environment she cannot drive she cannot do this you cannot go on her own etc she's lonely she doesn't have friends and then ends up in marriage different to a person marrying someone from the community from his locality she knows the habits and the customs and what to cook and what to say in different occasions and events it's a different ballgame however if the woman is willing and the family is capable of coping and adapting and the man is accepted in his religious practices and his moral conduct then there is nothing wrong in that and it's up to the father to decide mainly not for you to say sorry with all due respect because the man is the one responsible for giving the a sir no in this approval of his or decline what is what counts in a marriage your approval or the client does not affect the marriage at all and you have virtually no say except advice but it is the man's decision that counts you"
