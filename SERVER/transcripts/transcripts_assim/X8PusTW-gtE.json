  "transcript": "abbott says what are the etiquettes \nof visiting the graveyard the prophet ﷺ recommended the Muslims to visit \ngraveyards and said in the past I prohibited you   from visiting the graveyards as of today go and \nvisit it because it reminds you of the hereafter   so it is highly recommended for men to visit \ngraveyards and not for women because there   is a Prohibition and a CURSE upon the women \nwhen they visit graveyards and the etiquettes   to visit graveyards start with the intention \nwhy are you visiting the graveyard if it is   to make dua for yourself and this \nis a blessed place you want to   ask Allah for things this is prohibited \nyou visit the grave for two reasons one   to remind you of your fate and what you will share \nwith them in a few days few months few years time   so this is a good reminder secondly to benefit \nthe deceased with your dua with your prayers so   the intention comes first then the dua which \nthe prophet ﷺ used to supplicate and say peace be upon you o a place of believers you are \nthe first to precede us and we will follow etc you   will find that in Muslim fortress of the Muslim \nthere are many duas and one has to be respectful   in the sense that one must not walk over the \ngraves themselves unless he's he's barefooted   so if you had to walk on the graves you have \nto take your shoes off otherwise there are   pathways there are places specific for people \nto walk over that are not over any grave   it is prohibited to sit on graves it is prohibited \nto pray in the graveyard the offer salat   the only prayer that is allowed is to pray \nfuneral prayer for those who had missed it and it is prohibited to give your back to \nthe qibla and face the grave when making dua   rather you should face the qibla when making dua \nfor the deceased and if you make the grave between   you and the qibla so you would be facing \nboth that would be acceptable in sha allah azzawajal"
