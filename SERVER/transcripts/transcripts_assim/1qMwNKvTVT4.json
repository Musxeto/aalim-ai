  "title": "Must we remove beard oil / cream or hair gel / cream when performing wudu? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "help from india says sometimes we put beard oil or creams or whatever when we perform wudu must we remove this the answer is yes because the beard belongs to the face and it needs to be washed unlike the head the head we're ordered to wipe so even if you have hair gel or creams or whatever just wiping over it does the job while the beard itself it has to be washed while washing the face and hence you have to ensure that there's nothing making a barrier but if it is normal creams that are absorbed by the hair itself then you have no problem in that insha'allah"
