  "transcript": "um so our question is from brother ahmed and ahmed says what determines a country to be muslim is it the population or it's the ruling system the majority of scholars say that a country is labeled as muslim if the rule of islam is established in it and a person can actually establish his islamic rituals so the adhan is called the prayers are established friday prayers are permitted the laws of islam in general are also so implemented then this is a muslim country even if the majority of the inhabitants are non-muslims and the other way around would be also the same it's not considered to be a muslim country even if the vast majority of muslims live there providing that none of the islamic sharia is being practiced so they're not permitted to raise the adhan or to conduct juma or read they are not allowed to practice their islamic rituals such as slaughtering the sacrifice such as gatherings in islamic events wearing islamic attire etc this is a kafir country and or at least it's not labeled as a muslim country however this question bears in it a lot of question marks usually those who ask whether this is a muslim country or not their intention is unfortunately to label it as a kafir country hence a country that might be taken as a hostile or an enemy to islam which allows us to rob from them to lie to them not to hold any of our of our treaties with them and this is not the case here when we say that it's a muslim country or non-muslim country we refer to the possibility of living there what use is it for you to live in a vastly populated country by muslims if islamic law is not established and if the sharia law is not being practiced this is not an islamic country and hence one should not consider living there and should move to a country where the sharia law is being honored or at least partially to an extent that he would be living an islamic life and larger knowledge you"
