  "title": "Having 4 Friday prayers in the same masjid between Dhur & Asr timing?",
  "transcript": "Louiene, from Canada, says, that the masjid in his \nlocality - they pray four Friday prayers and they   divide these four Friday prayers \nbetween the time of Dhuhr and Asr.   So is this permissible? The timing is not a \nproblem because, the vast majority of scholars,   the Hanafi school, the Shafi'i school, the Maliki \nschool, they say that the time of Jumu'ah is   identical to the time Dhuhr. So it starts after \nzawal. Only the Hanbali, they say that, it can   start earlier. And their opinion is the most \nauthentic, as in the hādīth of Jabir ibn 'Abdullah   and Sahih Imam Muslim and other hādīth, proving \nthat the Prophet (aleyhi salatu wa salam) used to   pray it before zawal. And this is, what called \nSheikh bin Baz, ibn Uthaymeen to say that,   you can pray Jumu'ah prior to the time of \nDhuhr by half an hour to an hour, max. Now,   repeating the Jumu'ah in the same masjid is \ntotally prohibited. 'Okay Sheikh, but you know,   we live in the west and we have different timings, \nschools, work, etc.' This doesn't change the fact.   'The place is too small, we can't accommodate all \nthe worshipers.' They can pray in the adjacent   area, streets, parks etc., following the \nsame masjid. But not to offer two Fridays   in the same local masjid, this is an \ninnovation and it is not permissible,   as the scholars have stated. So, this is \na full stop. You cannot go around this.   Not only that, some scholars even went further \nto say that, repeating two congregational prayers   in the same masjid is not permissible. Like the \nopinion of Sheikh al-Albani and others, following   some of the companions who refused to offer \nanother congregation if the first congregation was   over. Though this is not the most authentic \nopinion but, it shows you that the issue of Friday   is far greater and more prominent. Because this \nis the only prayer in the week, so it must not be   separated from the ummah by repeating it \nthree or four times, and different imams,   and different topics. It should be only behind \none imam and they all should pray only one   Friday prayer. And Allah knows [best]."
