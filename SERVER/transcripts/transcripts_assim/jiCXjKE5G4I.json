Jazakallah Khairan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Is it permissible for what? A fully veiled woman To do what? To study in a co-educational medical college Yes If she doesn't have the opportunity Okay If she is studying medicine and she is fully abiding by the hijab and not showing any of her body parts and at the same time she is trying to segregate herself from men and boys, not socializing and not chit-chatting, then there is no problem in that inshaAllah and Allah Azzawajal knows best"
