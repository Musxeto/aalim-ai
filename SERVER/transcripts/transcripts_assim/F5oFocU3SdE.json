  "transcript": "third question about the those who draw those who make or imitate the creation of alonzo Aegean so he's saying that what's the ruling on having a picture in my in the background of my mobile and my laptop as a screensaver or a background of it if the picture has no life in it there's no problem meaning if it is about trees oceans the Sun the earth stars the rocks whatever no problem if it is of something alive if it's a photograph the most authentic opinion if it's of animals you have no problem at all if it is of human beings being male children you have no problem at all what is restricted in photographs is to keep photographs of women even if it's your wife or your mom because women are obliged to wear hijab and this can be hacked and people can look at these pictures with or without your permission and women are protected from such foolishness and also the picture of deceased we're not allowed to keep pictures of dead people may Allah have mercy upon them but if it is drawn again the one who drew it is the one whose sinful if it's a character of Mickey Mouse for example and you're keeping it as a background a bit childish but I cannot say it's Haram because it's not a hunk on the walls and it's not visible all the time it's just background there's nothing in it I would personally not put it I'd recommend to stay away from it but I cannot say it is haram on a larger who knows best"
