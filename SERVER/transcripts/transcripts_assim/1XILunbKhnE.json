  "transcript": "first of all the vast majority of brothers who have urine incontinence are delusional this is the whispers of Shaitaan Shaitaan is playing with them there are ground rules one you're not allowed to go every five minutes to check on yourself you're not allowed to squeeze your private part or to squeeze your muscles during or after urinating just to ensure that there is not a single drop left you're not allowed to jump in the bathroom as so many people do in the toilet after finishing urinating just to ensure that nothing is left and definitely you are not allowed to become obsessed by the issue of purity when people centers since the time of Adam peace be upon him urinate normally and answer the call of nature normally Satan is messing up with your mind sure but I have this feeling but this feeling is from Shaitaan he's laughing his head off because of what he is making you do so what to do generally speaking men and women once you go and answer the call of nature take your time meaning take your time by three minutes - five minutes max not half an hour or an hour and after you finish simply pour water on your private parts so you wash it this way and that's it no squeezing nothing that is not natural and sprinkle some water on your underwear and then leave whenever you get this idea that I feel something is coming out I feel that there is wet tell yourself that this wetness is from what I had sprinkled on my underwear two to three days max you will not have this problem at all I promise you"
