  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome to another edition of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman our beer host joining us from Saudi Arabia Shaikh awesome alaikum Salam alaikum alaikum sit down mom thank you for being with us brother to continue part two of our discussion about non-muslims looking at how the Prophet peace peace be upon him interacted with non-muslims during his life in the first part of this we covered some good territory and just a few more things I'd like to ask about we touched on in the first episode about his efforts to create a harmonious society people were migrating running for their lives literally and when they arrived there were people there and of course is a very critical moment in Islamic history he wanted to set resettle himself peace be upon him and his companions characterized for us the steps he took to create this peace and harmony this peaceful coexistence whit non be the pre-existing non Muslims Jews Arab pagans and others so now monitor him and Hum Dil I have a benign I mean what's illallah wa sallam ala Khan Abdul or a Saudi intervening Muhammad in wada a de wa sahbihi ajma'in am bad as you mentioned the Prophet I saw him when he migrated with his companions their numbers grew because there were Muslims already in Medina of the original inhabitants okay so Islam and the Muslims became a majority huge really when you don't have a religion or a set of ethics governing your actions the norm is to kick anyone else outside mm-hmm to expel them because they don't fit with us and we don't fit with them this wasn't the case with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam it was reported in the Sierra books that the Prophet signed a treaty peace be upon him with the Jews so that no injustice will be done to either party okay so they had the right to practice their religion they had the right to trade to coexist but the main point that was highlighted was that they would not betray the Muslims okay they would not assist the enemies of Muslims against Islam and the Muslims and almost that was it so the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not confiscate their properties on the contraries he on the contrary he left them to work to be positive to be beneficial to the community and he also honored his agreement with them until they betrayed okay so he didn't kill any one of them though there were suspicions until they betrayed mm-hmm and he allowed them to practice their own religion this is their god-given right there's no compulsion in religion meaning that people do not have to be forced to accept Islam okay so clear to everyone that Islam is the only divine religion that is from a lot that was yet but we don't force them if they don't want to accept Islam yet we treat them as non-muslims as well so very important part this is actually very important to know that when the Muslims all arrived they constituted a majority and as we were discussing this is easy to do if we remember what the demographers have told us that the human global population did not reach 1 billion until just 200 years ago it's easy to become overnight a majority population by a mass migration and so this this is what we have and you're saying to us that after the Prophet peace be upon MRI he was respectful and it makes sense those Jews and others who were there are in a very critical sensitive position they're insiders now and if they wanted to they could betray and cause the collapse the ruin of the early Muslims you mentioned you touched on the subject of justice were there cases that came before him where he would have to peace be upon him rule over disputes between Muslim and non-muslim between himself and religious leaders or however when we talk about justice doing justice to them is it is it not is it more than just honoring their pre-existing beliefs and lifestyle is that also resolving disputes well the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam and there's one or two incidents that I may think of or try to improvise one was that the Prophet SAW once alayhi salatu was-salam a group of jews with a boy and a girl accused of fornication okay so the Prophet asked them at a sort of cinema about this and they told him and they asked a prophet sallallaahu Selim to judge according to the law of Allah so the Prophet asked them a lot so Sam what does your books say about it and they said that we put tar on their faces and like in the Wild West maybe feathers mm-hmm and put them back to back on a mule and take them round the city hmm and they showed him the Torah but the Prophet doesn't treat Arabic let alone Hebrew hmm so one of their rabbis who accepted Islam Abdullah who knew Salam may Allah be pleased with him who became a companion told them to remove their hands from the verse that the man was trying to cover which stated stoning so when he did then it was obvious that the ruling was to stone and the Prophet ordered Alice awesome them to be stoned according to not only Islam but also according to the Bible to the Old Testament and if you go through the Old Testament see a lot of the non-muslims accuse the Muslims of being harsh being barbaric for the punishment free a prescribed punishment of stoning yea though if you go through the Old Testament you'll find that it is in a number of things is there yeah you stone whoever curses or slanders the king you stone a child who is disobedient to his parents the elders are told to take him to the outskirts of the village and stone him to death you stone someone who has a sexual relationship with the daughter of a priest you stone even an ox an animal if he kills someone you there are so many things yeah this is not the show to make it a comparative between Islam and and and Judaism for example or Christianity but this isn't their books so stoning was there the Prophet solved the dispute that the Jews came to him trying to cheat the Prophet lacerum so that he would give them a lenient punishment other than what is in their books also one of the Companions was once assassinated at the gates of high bar which is a village for the Jews so the son of this companion and his two uncles the brothers siblings of the companion who was assassinated came to the Prophet at a solution and they're saying o prophet of Allah the Jews must have killed him now if you're the ruler and you have justice in your hands and you know the enmity between the Jews and the Muslims you would definitely say that we were right no one could kill him except the Jews and he was killed at their gate gates and wolves so definitely they're the one who killed him but not the Prophet that is awesome ok how did he react he would not be unfair or he would not show any form of injustice though they are the enemies of Islam he told them it is very simple can you swear by Allah that they killed him the companion said how would we do such a thing we did not see it in this case the Prophet said 50 of them of the Jews would swear that they did not kill him the companion said o prophet of Allah they are disbelievers they would swear they don't fear Allah know yet he said I cannot help it either you provide the evidence or I cannot accuse them have to acquit them yeah so this shows you the amount of fairness and justice the Prophet had a day his salatu was-salam one of the companions and his name is a chef in a place in Yemen disputed with a Jew over a piece of land so they escalated it and went to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they told him as a companion o prophet of allah this land is mine and this Jew claims it says in a muslim court this is a Muslim against a non-muslim if there was any bias or injustice the result would be known at the time of the prophet alayhi salaatu sir he said to Allah chef do you have any proof documentation witnesses anything to prove that this is your land and he said no so the Prophet awarded to the Jew because the Jew had a house the Jew lived in it so in order for you to verify this you have to bring your evidences again this shows us how the Prophet Allah saw some dealt with them as non-muslims as if he's dealing with Muslims as well thank you for that we have a break now Sheikh when we come back interesting question about Jews sneezing in the presence of the of the Prophet peace be upon him will get the sheiks answer after a break assalamu alaikum welcome back to with the Prophet we're continuing with Shaykh awesome in our discussion about non-muslims who lived with the Prophet peace and blessings be upon him sneezing news you know when I first heard about this someone was saying that the Jews certain Jews around the Prophet peace be upon him had a habit of sneezing in his presence I thought to myself is this kind of like you know when crafts people in the street rude people poor mannered people are spit in your presence as a form of disrespect or whatever is that what was going on what was that all about well first of all we have to understand the relationship between the Jews and Islam in general it is stated in the Quran that the Jews believed in the prophecy that there will come a prophet whom they will fight with all other nations and prevail under his faction and they believed that the Prophet SM was a prophet of Allah yet out of envy they refused to follow him and when they were asked they would say yes we know he's a prophet but he's not the Prophet that we were told to come hmm because he's not from the offspring of Isaac rather he's of the offspring of Ishmael and they were lying to sons of Ibrahim yes they are lying because the Prophet they will follow as we believe as Muslims is the Antichrist or the Dajjal the imposter Christ who will come at the end of time the Prophet told us a lesson that seventy thousand Jews from Isfahan from Iran would follow him and it is shocking but this is what's happening in Iran at the moment the Jews are settling they have certain type of clothes that they'll wear and they're preparing for the the coming of their so-called prophet so they know that the Prophet was a prophet of Allah abdullah bin salam may allah be pleased with him was one of their best rabbis he said when i heard of him coming to Jed - sorry when I've heard him coming to Medina hmm and by the way Medina and Judah is 400 kilometers apart so it's our neighborhood he said I went to look at his face I'm a good character of I'm a good evaluating yeah yeah my character a character of people mm-hmm a good judge of character so he says I went and he was preaching the people I'm the Lama said I'm a Jew says the moment I looked into his face I know it was not the face of a liar so he accepted Islam on the spot went to the Prophet Isis Amman said o prophet of Allah I bear witness and he read the testimony so the Prophet was happy then abdullah said o prophet of allah you know that the jews are people of deceit and lying so i'd like you to invite them and ask them about me while I hide behind the curtain so the Prophet invited them and he asked them what do you think of abdullah bin salam so they said he's one of our most righteous knowledgable hmm and the son of one of our most righteous and knowledgeable hmm abdullah bin salam came out okay and he said a shadow la ilaha illallah wa ashhadu mohammed rasoolallah immediately they flipped and said he is the worst of us and doesn't have the worst of us so this shows you that this is their character mmm this is the way they behave now let me go back to your question because I forgot the sneezing okay now having said that and they know about the Prophet Isis Aram mm-hmm though they did not follow him they used to do something that was awkward when they were in the presence of the Prophet Allah thought Oh Sam they used to pretend that they sneeze why pretending yeah because in Islam if I sneeze the sooner and the etiquette is to say alhamdulillah praise be to Allah Allah now it's an obligation upon you because you heard me sneeze and praise Allah at the same time it's obligation upon you to say to me llamo cumin law may Allah have mercy upon you okay so it's an exchange of dua of invitations and supplication okay the Jews wanted to hear this from the Prophet erase a lot so they used to sneeze I said hamdulillah are just so that he could bless them or make some with mercy I see and the Prophet would only say may Allah guide you and rectify your affairs and this shows us that the Muslims are permitted mmm are allowed to make dua for non-muslims okay of any good thing in this worldly life so may Allah grant this person cure of his illness may Allah make him healthy may Allah make him successful in his job in his education may Allah rectify his affairs what is not permissible for Muslims to do it is to seek Allah's forgiveness or to ask a larger for mercy and paradise this we cannot do to the non-muslims so even if I have non-muslims parents I cannot say oh Allah forgive their sins no Allah admit them to join them although have mercy on them this is totally prohibited okay what I can do is Allah guide them or Allah or expand their chest open their heart to love Islam and to become Muslims consistently and inshallah this is okay thank you for clearing that up about the sneezing it almost sounded juvenile when it first came across was the profit I'm wondering about I mean obviously there were a lot of people who were not happy with him and peace be upon him despite his humility his great love and compassion for human beings there were people who hated him they wanted him dead and that included you know people in arms but also they employed other means like the woman in the earlier earlier tried to poison him and then there were magicians sorcerers what was that all about were they trying to kill him manipulate him what was the the use of magic against the Prophet all about peace be fun okay first of all the issue of magic is something that is mentioned in the Quran so no Muslim can reject it and the biggest and most clear story of all is the story of Moses peace be upon him with the sorcerers of Pharaoh sorry just to clarify you're saying that for a reason with the knowledge that some Muslims don't accept it magic is real is that correct not some Muslims a very mannered amount or percentage of not real Muslims those who were affected by the philosophy of the geek those who followed the deviant sects and cults like Al Motta Zillah and the likes who reject a lot of the unseen I see no sir which is sorcery is mentioned in the Quran okay and Moses who is one of the strong will messengers of Allah the five strong-willed messengers of Allah was mentioned in the Quran to be affected by it so we will not go into magic in details but there is a type of magic that is known as imagination mm-hmm so it's a spell that makes you feel something that is not true or see as in the case of Moses peace be upon him something that is not true they threw their staff they threw their ropes and the spell was there to make him think that these were actual snakes then he was intimidated as mentioned in the Quran in allah azza wajal made his heart steadfast by telling him that don't be afraid you are the highest you will prevail and you'll win the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam had a similar spell and it was some say two months it was some say six months some say a few days the period itself is not that accurate but the story is authentic as an Bukhari and Muslim is in the whole nine yards it stated that the prophet alayhi salatu salam used to enter his homes and this was the spell and he used to believe that he had intimacy with his wives what he didn't hmm so the spell was not in his intellect in his memory in Quran in halal and Haram teaching no no it was not related to the religion animal at all it was something physical and mental as if it's an illness a virus so he used to think that he had intercourse with his wife well when he didn't and his wives were you know felt strange why is the Prophet not like what he used to be until he says himself I was asleep and then a man stood at my head and another so that my feet and they started a dialogue what's wrong with the man the other one says he is sick and the other one says what off said there was a spell cast upon him in what in a few pieces of his hair and his calm put in a special branch of a palm tree where at it's at well of so-and-so mm-hmm whom by its by labeed evening awesome who was a Jew so the Prophet woke up addisam the two men were obviously gibreel and a field angels of Allah informing him in a form of a revelation so he instructs his companions to go and do that well and to go deep and get the things that were his belongings and he ordered them to be burned out the norm is to execute this person who did this shameful act to harm the Prophet at essaouira but he failed the Prophet did not kill him in an authentic hadith the Prophet even went X the extra mile the hadith says that the Prophet I system never showed it in his face whenever he met this Jew and never talked with him about it so neither he reprimanded him nor informed him that I found out what you had done or punished him nothing the prophet has simply moved on and this shows you how he treated the non-muslims and thereafter this hallucination I don't know what to call it the spell was lifted of course it was lifted and then the Prophet was given the last two chapters of the Quran 113 and 114 which is sorted to Philip and she saw her to an ass to protect and preserve him and us because this is what we recite after every salat once after fajar and mother the evening and morning earth car three times along with Volvo Allah had chapter 1112 this is a form of protection if you maintain to you to say you're at the car after salat five mandatory prayers before going to bed before going out and in the morning in the evening you are not virus protected like and then the PCs but you are protected from the jinn from the evil eye eyes everything back these spiritual intangible things check we have run out of time a couple things left over we do plan in a future episode to talk about some other subjects that maybe we can get get them in dealing with congratulating and celebrating with non-muslims accepting gifts from not from non-muslims thank you so much for opening up this subject for us barakallahu may Allah accept our efforts and thank you for being with us we hope it was beneficial for you we look forward to continuing with a prophet in the future until then a Salaam alaikum"
