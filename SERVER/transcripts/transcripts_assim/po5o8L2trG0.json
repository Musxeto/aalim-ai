  "transcript": "recommended. Ahmed says, \"Is the punishment for apostasy death in Islam?\" I heard someone say that one hadith is not enough evidence for this. The consensus of all scholars that if a person changes his religion from Islam to any other religion, the punishment should be execution, death. However, it is not for Tom, Dick, or Harry to carry out this punishment. This cannot be done by any person without following the procedure. Meaning, if someone says that he doesn't believe in the prophetatam, he's a Muslim. He says, \"I don't believe in the prophet anymore.\" This is an act of apostasy. Can we go and chop his head off? The answer is no. First of all, you have to make sure that the conditions are fulfilled and that there are no obstacles preventing the description of apostasy to fit him. How is this to be done? There has to be a panel of judges, Muslim judges or scholars who would sit with this individual, interrogate him, advise him, remind him of Allah, trying to bring him back to his senses. If he does not go back to his senses, in this case, they give their verdict to the Muslim ruler, the Muslim imam of the country. And when we say imam, he's not a person who leads prayer in a masjid in uh for example in Birmingham or in in uh somewhere in Europe who has a congregation of a thousand or 10,000 or even 100,000. He's not the imam. He is a prayer uh person leading prayer. The Imam is the Muslim ruler who has the army, the civil defense, the police force, who runs the country. This is the Imam who can only execute such a verdict, who can only implement the death penalty over an apostate, but not any person. Therefore, if the judges give the verdict to the ruler and the ruler looks into it, then he carries out this punishment. The prophet said, \"Whoever changes his religion, execute him.\" This is not for individuals. So, if I'm living in Holland and my next door neighbor is a Muslim or was a Muslim and then says, \"Listen, I don't believe in the Quran. I don't believe in Allah. I don't believe in anything.\" Or changes his religion and becomes a Christian. and he wears the cross. I say, \"I'm a hotblooded Muslim. I'm going to chop his head off and then uh um I'm going to say that he did this and that. If I do this, I'll go to hell because you cannot give without the fulfillment of the conditions and being sure that the obstacles are not there. This is not for individuals to be done. This is only to be carried out by the Muslim ruler. And we know what happened when Van Go, the director, the Dutch director was executed on the streets. How many problems resulted from that? Always look at the consequences. Don't be impulsive. do things without knowledge like these keyboard knights that we see on Twitter, on Facebook, on the internet calling for jihad and calling for killing people and and and making to all people around you except them. Don't be like them. This is not the way of the salaf. This is not the way of the prophetatam. Whoever says to a person, one of them has to take it. So either he is a true real true true uh uh real kafir or if not it's going to bounce back at you. One should be really careful when uh uh going into these things. So yes in Islam the punishment for apostasy is death penalty only after a panel of judges interrogate speak to that person try to bring him back to his senses. If he still insist then this is worse than uh uh grand treason and allahel knows best. Nabila says, \"I wanted to know what are the best options for Muslim females in"
