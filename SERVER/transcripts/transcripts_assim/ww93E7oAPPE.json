  "transcript": "Brother Anas from the UK. Brother Anas. Assalamu Alaikum. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Yes my friend. Does the name say Brother Anas? Because maybe someone else, because my name just says Anas. Your name is Anas? Yeah. Okay. What's your question? Okay nice. Do you know my driving instructor, he gives me, he charges me less than what he should charge, but the boss, his boss said it's not like allowed, but the boss has to get a certain amount of money every, like a certain amount of money, and whoever exceeds it, the driving instructor gets to keep it, and every single time the boss always gets his money, whether he charges me one pound or twenty pound or the exact number, exact price, but the boss always gets his money. Your contract is with the instructor or with the boss? I give the money to the instructor. But your contract is with whom? I don't have a contract. Then you have no relationship with the boss, as long as the instructor is the one who's giving you the lessons, and he's the one who's charging the money, it's not your problem what he does with the money. Okay. Barakallah Feek."
