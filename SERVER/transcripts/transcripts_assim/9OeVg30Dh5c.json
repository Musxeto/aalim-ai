  "transcript": "now um so the question I'm asking the question on behal of a sister so um uh she said um she she has a husband and um the husband doesn't take care of uh of the children and herself by she said the husband provide food but what she wears what the student what the children wears she doesn't know the husband doesn't provide that um she she was now asking if it's uh permissible for her to compel or to ask her husband and also she mentioned that whenever she gets pregnant the husband doesn't look after her you know she doesn't he doesn't go to the hospital with her and um she was not asking if it's possible or permissible for her to compel our husband to probably do you know something that could prevent uh her getting pregnant or is this enough reason for her to um file for or to avoid or to you know prevent or deny the husband intimacy so the scholars relate the obligation of a wife to give her husband her his rights of intimacy they related to the husband being able to provide for his wife so if the husband does not provide for his wife the normal the bare minimum then she has the right to refrain from giving him his rights of intimacy now she said that he gives her a food and he provides her with a roof on their head but he doesn't pay for her clothes this is problematic what does he mean if throughout the whole year he doesn't buy them clothes for her and for her children no this is something that she is she has has all the right to demand and compel him by force and even if she has to go to court that he has to give her enough money that within reason to buy whatever is necessary for her for a whole year of course not a whole wardrobe but according to the norm and the judges know what is sufficient for that and not taking her to hospital or being with her when she's giving birth this is not a reason for for divorce so many men may be frightened maybe busy maybe negligent but they're providing for their wives and they're caring for the children Etc when it comes to hospital they're too lazy or they have a reason here or there this is not a legitimate right and Allah Knows Best"
