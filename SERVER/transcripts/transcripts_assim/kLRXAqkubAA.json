  "title": "When Mother Aisha let Mother Zainab HAVE IT | Tolerance of the Prophet ‎ﷺ | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "And the last point, it's not the last, it's one of so many, but this is just an example. He should be tolerant. He should be tolerant. Tolerant to what? To his wife. As we've seen the Prophet ﷺ do with Aisha when she was jealous. Did he react? Very tolerant. Didn't do anything. Not only that, sometimes your tolerance is your survival. Aisha was with the Prophet ﷺ in her house. Zaynab bin Jahsh, may Allah be pleased with her, the cousin of the Prophet, so she's related to him. And she's one of the most beautiful wives of the Prophet ﷺ. She comes and she starts to curse Aisha. You did this, you always take him with you, he loves you most. And she starts, and Aisha says, and I'm looking at the Prophet ﷺ, I'm not replying, I'm not saying anything, respecting the Prophet ﷺ. Until I saw the Prophet's face change as if he wants me to, what? To answer back. And when I saw this, I gave her. And I returned everything that she had and a little bit extra. And I can see the satisfaction in the Prophet's face. And when I finished he said, this is the daughter of Abu Bakr. Being proud of her. So he tolerated Zaynab. He didn't speak. Why? Because we need tolerant husbands. I don't think tolerant husbands do. They need. Don't get me wrong. Women need tolerant husbands. Why? Men would justify this, yeah yeah Shaykh because they have little brains and they, no it's not because of that. Their nature is full of passion, compassion, love and impulsiveness. They don't hide, they speak on the spot. If you're like this, the house will ignite. So the best way of having a good marriage is compromise. If the husband pulls, the wife lets go. And when the wife pulls, the husband pulls. No, you also let go. So this way you have the perfect marriage. You'll always be happy. If you tolerate your wife, you will find out that she will come and appreciate it in a very strange way."
