  "transcript": "Hassan from Japan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen Sheikh, I want to ask about my country like their two years military is mandatory so like we have to do that and like we how can I say like we cannot pray anything or like fast or something during that time so and actually people also if they can afford illegally afford they want to pay but still like it's hard to do that so during that time for two years most of the people just living Salah or like even fasting during Ramadan so what shall we do in this case I mean we cannot do that As a Muslim, you're obliged to obey Allah Azza wa Jal so even if your ruler or your country force you if they force you to disobey Allah by skipping Salat or skipping fasting Ramadan or even shaving your beard you must oppose this and fight it to the best of your ability you must not obey them because there is no obedience to anyone no matter how big that person is in disobeying Allah Azza wa Jal so if you're forced by law to do these heinous acts to do these two years of compulsory military service and they would force you not to pray you have to skip this by any means even if you have to bribe you have to lie, you have to forge documents to skip it, there is no problem in that because your religion comes first and it's like being in the desert and you're stranded and there is nothing for you to eat nothing keeping you from dying except a dead dog or a dead donkey that you are forced to eat one or two morsels to sustain your life in this case every scholar say you are permitted to do so so this is something that does not require a rocket scientist now if you're unable to do any of this and you're forced to do such service and skip prayer then you have to pray on time even if this leads you to be beaten up or thrown in jail so be it but you have to pray on time if you can pray in hiding or combine dhuhr and asr due to necessity and still pray on time that is mandatory and Allah says in the Quran فَاتَّقُوا اللَّهَ مَا اسْتَطَعْتُمْ fear Allah to the best of your ability it would be advisable to try and migrate from such an evil country that does not allow you to practice your own Islamic commitment Islamic religion this is pathetic what kind of a country does such evil acts abandon them and ditch them and go and migrate to any other country that would give you their citizenship you"
