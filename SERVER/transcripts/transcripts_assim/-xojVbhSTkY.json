  "title": "Can anybody change intention during prayer and Reward for Lending Money to Help",
  "transcript": "pretty straightforward she started prayer and while she was praying she remembered that she missed F so can she change her intention to make that prayer fuder or should she continue with her prayer the answer is she must continue with her prayer finish fouras and then pray two of f because if she changed her ention within the prayer she would not be praying neither F nor both would be nullified and she would it would be considered for her voluntary prayer so alhamdulillah due to forgetfulness as long as she started praying she should continue to pray and then pray F afterwards the order is mandatory this is without any doubt but this obligation Falls when you are ignorant or when you have forgotten as in the case of uh sister Nadia her second question is very usual people get this someone comes to me and asks for a loan for 3 months I have the money and I can give him but I have bad experience with this person over or I heard few people complaining that he borrows and does not give back so am I sinful if I don't give him the answer is no lending people is not an obligation it's not mandatory even if you have money it's something that is highly recommended the reward is so enormous it is unbelievable if you lend someone let's say 5,000 R for a month and he gives it back and then he borrows another 5,000 R for any given period a month or a week or so and he gives it back you have the 5,000 in your pocket Allah Asel would reward you as if you given for charity 5,000 R because you lent it twice and if you give a person 5,000 R and you give him a date and he doesn't pay it back and asks for an extension and you give him another month and again he doesn't pay it back Allah would give it to you and if you have given 5,000 for charity and if he if you set a third date for him and he doesn't give it back for each day Allah would give you 5,000 r as Charity no investment in the world can give you this uh uh profit nowhere so lending people is good but throwing your money in the dust bin is not good so you have to know where you give your money or who you give your money"
