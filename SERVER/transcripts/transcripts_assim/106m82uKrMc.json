  "transcript": "foreign and we found a product that we wanted to sell so now in Amazon they have two listings one was of the brand and the other one was of what other the other one was non-branded so from where we imported our Goods the we were selling the non-branded ones and the customer knows that okay we are selling the non-branded ones and they are not original but the non-branded ones had the logo of the original brand and when it was out of her control to actually change it but the brand when we asked the brand do you allow this uh because there were other listings of the brand of unbranded products as well they said that we know and we have trademarks on our logos but it has been over I think almost a year and the listings have not been removed so I want to know if this is Haram and if it is I I was assuming that if that it is and I told my relative about it they said that nothing will happen you don't need to worry about it but I was a little bit um skeptical about this and I want to ask if if it is Haram then because my financial needs are fulfilled by that relative and if I want to start a business again can I take the money from them if the money is Haram from them first of all it is not permissible for you to sell counterfeits as this is violating these companies copyright so this is a legal thing and upon its legality Haram so if legally it is halal and the company gives you permission or says it's okay to sell our counterfeits we have no problem with the logo being violated and then rights are okay then it's halal if they say no you're not allowed to do this then it is Haram point one point two if your relatives income or they deal with Haram and they are sin they are sinful for their earning and Haram income but if they give you money as a loan to work with or to operate as a partner there is nothing wrong in that because the sin is on them for earning Haram money but it's there's no sin on you in it as long as you're doing Halal job and Allah Knows Best nothing"
