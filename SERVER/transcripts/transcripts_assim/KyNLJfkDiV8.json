  "transcript": "this happened and they are now in Saudi Arabia and they work and they came here without a m is it permissible for them to travel to mecah for omra uh uh if they are in the company of trustworthy women and would this companionship be considered as Maham the answer is the same you are not allowed to travel to mecah for omra because traveling without a Maham is forbidden because you came all the way from your country to one city does not mean that you can hop from one city to the other without a mam because you initially came without a Mah no this Still Remains and the sin is reoccurring again and again whenever you travel but if you are working in jid it is permissible for you to go with a group of women to perform because jida and mecah are not considered to be a traveling distance so they're considered to be suburbs of each other so going up and down to mecca for residents of jida is permissible and a woman does not need a Maham for that she needs the companionship of trustworthy women"
