  "transcript": "before I start my talk I don't understand Bahasa very well I don't understand Bahasa at all but did I hear it correctly that you read the Fatiha and then Surah after fatihasura yes and then takbeer and rukor why do you recite the Fatiha I don't want to come on the day of judgment and Allah would say why they make this Innovation and you did not speak ever in the books of Sunnah had the prophet Allah like this yes or no never you know more than him no I don't so this is why I have to clear my conscience so that on the day of judgment I told them honest I go so it is not Sunnah in Arabia when we have marriage contract or engagement and nobody knows the receipt reading and they wipe their face and they wipe their bodies and they scrub their backs if they go take a shower what are you doing and also because marriage is like death when someone is dead he said oh Abdullah is dead foreign it's not from Islam Fatiha is recited in the Salat the greatest Surah Fatiha is recited in rupiah is Hadith I have illness in my throat every time I drink water alhamdulillah and I think but nothing Gathering so excuse me I'm supposed to speak about how to be happy but I will make you unhappy first but inshallah"
