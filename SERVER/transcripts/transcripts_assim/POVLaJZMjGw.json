  "title": "Can my Stepfather be my Wali in marriage & can my maternal family members be a wali in my marriage?",
  "transcript": "Muhammad's maybe or Muhammad from the US? Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. My question is, can the stepfather be involved in representing the Waliya of his daughter? First of all, the guardian or the Wali of a girl has to be whom Allah appointed as a guardian over her. Father, then if not the paternal grandfather, then if not her son, then if not her brother, then if not her paternal uncle, and brother I mean her full blood brother from a father and a mother. If not available, then her brother from her father's side, paternal brother. If not available, then her paternal uncle, if not then her paternal cousins and the closest to her paternal cousins. Which means that her maternal side of the family can never be her Wali or guardian. Even her grandfather, even her maternal grandfather is not her Wali. Even her maternal uncle, the same goes. What about her stepfather? By default, her stepfather is further away from her than her maternal grandfather. So he cannot be her Wali. Unless her father, her real biological father comes and says, listen honey, I haven't been involved in your life since we've separated with your mom 20-30 years ago. Therefore, I authorize and delegate my rights of guardianship to your stepdad. In this case, alhamdulillah, this is legitimate and acceptable and Allah knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
