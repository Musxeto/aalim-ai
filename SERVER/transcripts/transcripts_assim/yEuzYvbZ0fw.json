  "transcript": "last two questions the next question is is it permissible to offer Dua while performing in the the answer is yes without any doubt don't listen to Scholars from this continent or a subcontinent that say do not make Dua in prayer only in prayer they have no proof to support this Allah ordered you on the Hadith of the Prophet Alam by saying the closest you are the closest servant of Allah is to Allah when he's in suud so choose whatever Dua you want because you will be answered who said this Muhammad wasam did he say in prayer no in F prayer no in any do du how many gods do you have one who will stop me from making Dua to him I will make Dua whenever I'm in sujud whether f or na the issue is can I do it in other than Arabic ah now this is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is if you're not a native if you don't know how to do it in Arabic then do it in your language I can say oh God forgive me I know this but if I want to say oh Allah let me marry my cousin who lives in um somewhere else and who checks all the boxes I don't know how to do this in Arabic do do it in your native language without any problem"
