  "transcript": "Ahnaf from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh if a person has a habit of sitting at random time of day and asking Allah for all that he needs can this person make a checklist or a list of things he needs so that when he makes dua he doesn't forget something or will it be an innovation? If someone writes it down to remember that's fine but if he's making a timetable and like some people some folks have okay dhuhr, four raka'a fard, four raka'a sunnah before, two raka'a afterwards and after each one he checks a box and then recite six pages of the Qur'an check then say subhanallah a hundred times check no this is an innovation just do it because this is not part of the sunnah what you're doing and even worse it's not part of the sunnah to share it with your group of yes I've done my sunnah nafil, I've done my night prayer, I've done my juzah of the Qur'an and you make a list out of that and Allah knows best."
