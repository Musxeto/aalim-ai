  "title": "Are people who work in scorching heat exempted from fasting? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] Muslim laborers and construction workers work in the extreme heat of the noon and can die due to heat strokes are they exempted from fasting to die is a little bit of exaggeration yes if they work for 12 hours even if they're not fasting they'll die of such a heatstroke when it's completely hot but the hardship they're facing is it a legitimate reason to break your fast the answer is no until it reaches the limit of endangering your safety or you fear you fear that you'll faint for example so I know that I have to work six hours under the Sun in this extreme temperatures of heat this is my daily job it's not permissible for me when it's Pfizer time to have breakfast and say today is gonna be really hot so I'm not fasting this is not permissible then what is what's permissible is that you have your support you pray further you go to work after 2-3 hours if you're dehydrated if you're extremely tired and about to fall and you feel that you're out of power totally only then you can eat and drink because this is a necessity not that you feast on it and have fun and two double cheeseburgers and ice coke and have fun no you have to sustain your livelihood and what gives you power to continue work as usual but then you have to stay fasting so that you would give the day it sacred month and honor it so the scholars say you cannot break your fast and tell you each the actual hardship when your hope when is fed sure when this morning and you did not start work there's no hardship so why break you have to continue fasting until you reach the level of hardship and this goes for every day by the way not for the particular day every single day you have to wait until you reach this hardship [Applause]"
