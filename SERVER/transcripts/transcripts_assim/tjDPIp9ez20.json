  "title": "Undermining Islamic Values by demanding Gender Equality in Mosque Management? | AssimAlHakeem",
  "transcript": "basically about the romance question is very crystal clear he's talking about the Muslim minorities in Europe and in non-muslim countries and that they have been infiltrated and this is a fact Muslim communities have been infiltrated by the enemies of Islam whether it is intelligence powers whether it is deviant sects and cults trying to undermine true Islam so they infest the Muslim community with deviant theories ideas beliefs you name it they've got it and one of the easiest way to demolish the Muslim community is to corrupt the females if you manage to integrate in their sense between men and women and have them mix together and uplift all barriers this would mean that you've been melted in their melting pot and you've become like the kafir because there is definitely characteristics different from one another there are differences between us and them being citizens of their countries does not mean at all to be integrated and to compromise your religion in Europe nowadays I was told that they force girls and boys to take physical education classes and this means that they have to swim in the same swimming pool at school who in his right Islam I would not say mind because people may have minds but do not have Islam who would send his daughter or even his son who's a teenage to share a swimming pool with the opposite gender and then say don't fall into sin this is not possible allah azza wajal had made segregation between men and women even in the most sacred spots on earth and that is the message the Prophet said alehissalaam the best rows of men in Israel in salat in prayer in the Masjid the best rows of men are the first and the worst rows of men are the last and the best rows of women are the last and the worst rows of women are the first so imagine the closer women are to men this is bad now to enforce having women in the board running the Masjid so claiming that the committee that runs the message we have to have women this is we have to look into it if they are totally segregated they never mix they never meet it's only limited to emails or a whatsapp group where the women take care of the women's section and they view their needs and their ideas in order to improve and to run the women's section properly and that is it this is Helen there's no problem in appointing a woman who we never saw her face whom never sat with us in a meeting whom we never exchanged jokes with to run the female section she knows everything about the maintenance what the food when the food of your power is served the classes to be run the Q&A is when they are submitted and answered and delivered etc but if by saying that running a message is not Jenny gender oriented this is wrong if your meaning by that to have a woman sit with us on the same table looking at one another discussing the affairs of the Masjid cracking a joke here or there or looking at her when she smiles her frowns what is this this is not Islam maybe in Europe this is okay but not with the Muslims maybe with other religions maybe cultural things maybe Islam prohibits is totally so okay you have to hold your ground now the Muslims worldwide even in Muslim countries are being separated and divided into two factions as the Prophet said Alice thought was Sarah that at the end of the time the Muslims would split into two divisions Islam without a hypocrisy in it without any hypocrites in it and a division that is hypocrites without know a man in it this is what we're seeing now being developed and disbelievers in the West they're banking on these hypocrites because they look like us they speak like us they claim that they are God loving people when actually they are doing their very best to undermine and to demolish the infrastructure of Islam wherever it is so a Brahmin you what you had said is is right and when the Prophet said Allah saw some initial shock or a cordial meaning that women are the sisters of men in the sense that they share the same religious obligation he did not say that they were equal rather he said that in regards to religious commitment when they are all they're ordered to pray like they pray fast like they fast give zakat like they exactly the same but no one says that women have to do jihad like men no one says that the women have to provide for her husband like a husband has to do that and there are so many differences between them among them is that they must not it all share with them platforms or like we see nowadays and a number of droite are sitting and sharing the platform the the stage with other women and they're talking and the discussing what is this this is like an Islam virgin 2020 this is not permissible so many that is nowadays have no problem in having selfies with women I don't know if Islam changed or the daddies have changed so hold your ground ask Allah for a that the Prophet is awesome always used to say Oh Turner's of hearts make my hearts that fast on your way on your religion and may Allah's will make us all steadfast"
