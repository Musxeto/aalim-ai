  "transcript": "Sheikh the question is asking, the Muslim people are so divided at this time and the shaykhs have talked about it so many times, can you tell us the reason to that and also the solution of the whole problem? وَيُغَيِّرُوا مَا بِقَوْمٍ حَتَّى يُغَيِّرُوا مَا بِأَنفُسِهِمْ When you change yourself positively according to Islam, your household, your community, your neighbors, your city, then everything would fix. But people, unfortunately, are focused on, why are the rulers like this? They're corrupted. Okay, we put good rulers. What will you do? They close all night clubs and bars. They are bad rulers. Where will we have fun? SubhanAllah. So, damn if you do, damn if you don't. No, this is not the right way of doing it."
