  "transcript": "his second question is even um i wouldn't say worse but he says that the first the shahada as you said is mandatory so when the imam stood for the third rakha without sitting for tashahud i didn't say subhanallah subhanallah why didn't you he said because it's not a pillar and who said that reminding the imam only is is only done for pillars it's not even for mandatory acts it's to notify him if anything happens you say subhan allah subhanallah subhanallah after the imam finished prayers he went to him and explained that you missed the first the shahood and rightly the imam would say says who and you would say says i they would say why didn't you notify me he said because i didn't know it was mandatory i if i were in the imam's shoes i would say go back to sleep it's none of your business you don't have knowledge so don't speak about this and i would not believe you but if others came and said to me that and i believed them then the imam should immediately face the qibla offered to sujud of sahu and the prayer is valid in sha allah you"
