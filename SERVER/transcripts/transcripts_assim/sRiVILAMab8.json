  "title": "Pray as if its your last prayer Don't say anything 4 which you must apologise, don't look at.. Assim",
  "transcript": "my question is can you give a little explanation about that when do not see anything for which you will have to apologize and give up hope for what other people have already okay muhammad's question it requires a lecture it's not easy to explain in a q a session the hadith is an authentic hadith the prophet said whenever you pray pray as if you're bidding someone farewell meaning that you're dying so if this is the last raqqa i'm going to pray how is my prayer going to be allahu akbar okay i have to do the groceries okay then i have to take the kids to the garden no it will be full 100 concentration because i'm going to die afterwards so the second thing is that you have to avoid saying things that you apologize from later on a lot of us sometimes get agitated and they're impulsive so they just shoot and then ask questions but unfortunately when the word comes out of your mouth it cannot be retracted you cannot pull it back so now it's in control of you and you are a slave to that word that came out of your mouth while while it was inside you were in control and you had all the power over it so the prophet is actually saying that we should evaluate the consequences of whatever we're going to say so that we do not regret it and have to apologize afterwards and thirdly do not look at what people possess in their hands so when you see someone driving a better car or has more money than you or has influence in the government don't always aspire to what they've got because this shows on your face and people do not like when others are in need of them so they always look down at them and they always appreciate when you have the upper hand when you don't need people's help when you don't need their uh charity or kindness or pity so be strong the prophet says assassin and give up hope from whatever worthy matters people have in their possession because you're going to ask it from people not from allah so give up hope i believe that i have a khutbat juma a friday speech on my youtube channel on this particular hadith in english but i cannot tell you have to go there and revisit it inshallah"
