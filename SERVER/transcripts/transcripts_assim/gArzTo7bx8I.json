  "transcript": "well politics in today's defition is lying so it's um lying and lying is not permissible in Islam but if politics is defined in a different way and that is trying to help the people trying to go by the laws of the country in order to change what is wrong and to enforce what is right in this case going into politics is permissible providing one knows himself see brothers and sisters we have a great problem and this this problem is that a lot of the Muslims think they can handle what is happening once they IND indge themselves in the chaotic situations they start to give in they start to compromise they start to loosen their Dean I've seen so many yeah Scholars student of knowledge Mas Allah who used to be extremely good and powerful knowledgeable who started to give in a lot to compromise a lot of their religion and one of them I remember uh uh uh uh another Sheikh told me that he his OB objective and I was shocked to hear this he he's telling me that his objective this shik is to be on CNN Subhan Allah he compromised a lot of his religion he made lots of issues loose and yeah it's okay we have uh uh two opinions in this issue so you choose what you want he made Islam and as if it's a 711 you go in you do your shopping and you come out whatever you want and this is Islam choose whatever uh item on the shelf that suits you and this is alhamdulillah permissible therefore if a person is confident that he will not compromise his religion that he is steadfast on Islam and that he's following the Quran and Sunnah and that he is trying his best not to gain money position or to be influential but rather to help Islam this is his main objective and he's confident that he's doing this for the sake of Allah inshallah I pray to Allah that this is permissible and Allah"
