  "transcript": "Mackenzie from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Um do I have to examine my clothes and towels before I dry off with them because there's likely dog hair on it from the dog my non-Muslim family has? I know dog hair is considered pure according to some scholars but the dog hair is often licked by dogs so what should I do because it's going to be complete it's going to be hard to ensure that everything is completely free of dog hair? No you don't have to do any of this because dog hair is pure and you have to prove that they've licked that particular shred of hair which you cannot so the default is it is pure."
