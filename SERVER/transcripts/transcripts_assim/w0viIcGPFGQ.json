  "transcript": "well actually it is like someone striving to jump to the roof without taking the stairs first instruct you and me to establish an Islamic State is this part of our religion are individual duties it's not therefore what we should stop we should establish the Islamic State in our hearts which is established the Islamic State in our houses in our homes we should establish the Islamic State in our work at our workplaces by implementing the Quran by executing the instructions of the Quran Sunnah in our lives to 100 percent but to let this go and only focus on the government how to topple it how to assassinate the leaders how to do this how to lie how to embezzle just to reach how to climb over people's backs just to reach a political position or to be a member of the parliament or to be a leader in the party is this Islam is this what Allah tells me to do in the Quran no I've seen so many people need to who do not pray such a prayer on time or who pray uh prayer but this is like a a fat week or a pleasure every couple of weeks I've seen people like this yet they are focusing they're setting their targets for an Islamic State and they're working hard to do this this is not what they're supposed to do they're supposed to save themselves from Hell by practicing Islam they're not doing this I've seen people shaped people who claim to be loving Islam and so on but they're not doing anything that proves their love to Islam except talking they don't know night prayer they don't know fasting of one season and and Thursdays they don't uh they're not truthful they're not kind with their family they're not this they're not that they don't see their parents except once every six or seven years they don't connect with the next skin because you don't have any interest common interest between them otherwise they would have called them every single minute this is not what Allah wants us to do so focus on establishing the Islamic State in your heart and in your homes and by this inshallah the Islamic State will come eventually by itself inevitably and Allah"
