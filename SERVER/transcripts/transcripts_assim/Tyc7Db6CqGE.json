  "transcript": "foreign [Music] the first Hadith in the Fortress of the Muslim is where the Prophet says yet the comparison of the one who remembers Allah and the one who does not remember Allah is like that of the living and the dead what does this Hadith refer to it refers to first of all a similitude that the prophet is giving a comparison so he highlights to us the difference between someone who remembers Allah reads the Quran reads the prophets Hadith reads Sciences of tafsir of Hadith remembers Allah after the daily five prayers in the morning in the evening before going to bed before leaving the house he remembers Allah all the time and the person who does not remember Allah at all is there any such person unfortunately yes the vast majority of Muslims all what they do is watch movies listen to music read newspapers listen to news podcasts go into social media rarely you will find them remembering Allah maybe if they see an accident they would remember oh yeah Allah rarely you will see see them ask Allah for forgiveness ask anyone around you when was the last time you said a hundred times said oh throughout the whole year my I don't say it that much so we have a problem is highlighting this problem so if you remember Allah you're alive and if you don't remember Allah azzawajal you are as if you're dead look at a dead man's corpse he doesn't remember Allah he cannot pray he cannot fast so this is the same example that the prophet Allah is giving us the second Hadith the prophet Allah starts with asking his companions a question and this question is to bring their attention to highlight to them what the answer would be so that it sticks in their minds foreign foreign should I not inform you of the best of Deeds now everybody's anticipating and the most sanctifying of Deeds before your lord wow which does more to raise your positions with Allah and are better for you than the distribution of gold and money in the cause of Allah or battle with the Enemy now the companions are trying to figure out whoa what kind of Deeds would be better than all of this so they said indeed inform us so the prophet said remembrance of Allah this indicates that all what was mentioned above remembrance of Allah azzawajal is more beloved to Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala than it though it seems to us that it is very little compared to spending spending of gold and silver and meeting the enemies and fighting them and what may result out of that whether we are martyred or we kill them they are the enemies they're attacking us we have to defend ourselves yet what's far greater than all of this at the side of Allah azzawajal though the work and effort exerted is far less as it seems to us is remembrance of Allah azzawajal and this by itself highlights to us a very important issue and that issue is that Islam is not based on having someone between us and Allah to put a good word for us we don't need certificates of clemency or forgiveness or pardon from anyone it is a direct relationship between me as an individual and the creator of the heavens and the Earth no one stands between us I don't need to go to the prophet Allah and ask him to ask Allah there's no one interceding between me and Allah I don't have to go to the pope or to a priest forgive me Father for I have sinned no I go to Allah azzawajal I remember Allah the almighty and once this connection is established this is where a person almost reaches perfection because he becomes a servant of Allah now this is theoretical but when you implement it and work it out you'll find that you have reached what Allah azzawajal wants you to reach and you that and that you have become Allah's beloved servant this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave here [Music] foreign"
