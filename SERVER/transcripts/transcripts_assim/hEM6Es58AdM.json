  "title": "How Shaytan Tricks you Tom & Jerry to OverDose",
  "transcript": "May be anime, maybe to Japanese grandizers and the likes. When you're 14 or 15, past the age of puberty, PG is not good enough for you. You want to go for R, rated R. Yes, I want to see some flesh, I want to see some blood, I want to see some explosions, killing, violence. And then when you're out for college and you don't have anyone to monitor your PC or your iPad or then we go to, you know what? This is shaytan. And later down the line, you want to try the real McCoy. I don't want to watch. I want to experiment. Do not follow the steps of shaytan. So these minor sins, when you get accustomed to them, after a while, it doesn't work. I need a higher dose. And without knowing it, you will OD. May Allah protect us on sins. Seriously, why do people OD? They started with a normal cigarette, Marlboro, and then they went for a joint. Someone said, come on, it's going to make you feel high and happy. You eat a lot of Doritos afterwards. No problem. Just go for it. Then cannabis, then maybe some cocaine, maybe some amphetamine, maybe some crack, maybe little by little injection, heroin. And after a few weeks, he used to come with us in a Tahfiz, but then subhanAllah, he went down the drain. He OD."
