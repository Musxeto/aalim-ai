  "title": "Do we need to send blessings on Prophet ﷺ‎ when saying morning evening Adhkar & Dua #assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh when I make Dua for for example in the morning at course on or when I make Dua to a friend do I have to pray on the prophets each time okay now when we say the ascar of the morning of the evening or even after Salat the one who taught them to us was the prophet Allah and he never told us to offer salutation which means that salutation is to be offered when doing General Dua so if I want to make Dua for a brother who's getting married next week so I raise my hands and say Allah Allah facilitate the marriage of my brother so and so and make it a successful one and bless one blah blah blah this is General Dua but when I want to say Allah I don't offer salutation when I want to read Ayatul Kursi after Salat I don't read the salutation of on the prophet and I hope this answers your question insha Allah"
