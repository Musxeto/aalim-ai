  "transcript": "example Allah in congregation I'm from getting up from the first record I accidentally said Allahu Akbar twice and one time I said Surah Fatiha twice in congregation in the silent is any ruling on that it's for saying the fatihad twice in the same raqqa there is nothing wrong in that it's against the Sunnah but there is no problem because it's Quran as for saying Allahu Akbar twice when you're praying behind an Imam the Imam carries out these mistakes and you don't have to offer any uh forgetfulness prostration besides that you did not tamper with the posture of the Salat of the way of the Salat is done it's just what you had said extra and there's no problem in that insha Allah"
