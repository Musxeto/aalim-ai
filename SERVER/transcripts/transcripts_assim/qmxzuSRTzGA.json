  "transcript": "Hassan from Japan Hassan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. I want to ask like in my original country like there are people I mean the Tradition is like, you know after someone passed away they give a sadaqa for that deceased for for a week and then for a month and then for a 40 days and then a Year, and every year it continues like, you know, they are gathering and making dua together with the Imam, etc So like what's a Sunnah way to? Like, you know do things after like someone passed away. This is all part of Wa Jazakum. This is all part of innovation especially when it's related to a certain period or a fixed number of days. In Islam, we're Allowed to mourn our deceased for three days With exception for a widow, of course So three days we can show our and express our feelings of remorse and sadness and the likes But after that There is no mourning of The deceased if you want to do good deeds and give charity the whole year is open you must not Relate this to one week after the death of a deceased or 20 days or 40 days or one year All of this is an innovation and not permissible"
