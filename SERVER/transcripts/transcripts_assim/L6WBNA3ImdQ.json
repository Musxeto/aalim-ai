  "transcript": "and uh before I conclude a lot of the brothers were asking me about the wiish uh assassination in London where two alleged Muslims uh stabbed and hacked uh a British soldier to death in the middle of the day in front of everybody and they were saying Allah abbar we will pay you will pay and we will keep on doing this as long as you're killing our Muslim Muslims brothers and sisters worldwide so what's the ruling on it well first of all I will not talk about the hisb or the party these men Alle are alleged to be associated with which is which is an offshoot of because both hisb both parties are uh not part ofama and they have a problem in uh their manhaj and methodology and they have a problem in everything that they're related to uh they are well known to do Tak and to do the night Patrol I think and where they go to the Christians coming out of pubs and and they say you have to fear Allah you you'll go to hell what I I'm not going to talk about that but what's the ruling on killing a a British soldier who probably served in Afghanistan or in Iraq maybe he killed someone of the Muslims and so is it justice to do what we're doing to that to him first of all this is not permissible full stop and no matter what the justifications you have it is not permissible in Islam the prophet Alat he is our leader and he is our role model one of the vicious and fierce enemies of Islam and the Muslims and the prophet was Abu sufyan IB and yet he came to Medina and the prophet gave himam uh uh safety to come and talk to him and leave and all the companions of the Prophet Alam was saying that oh our swords did not take care of that man we should have slaughtered him we should have chopped him yet no one had done this why because the prophet did not allow this and he gave him the Safety and Security so we have treaties and we have uh uh peace agreements Etc that has that have to be honored providing that these two as salant were not uh uh UK citizens apparently they are UK citizens so even for UK citizens it is not permissible to kill someone by cheating him and by such treachery this is a betrayal of the covenants between people and between us as strangers or foreigners and the UK government the prophet abdah the head of the Hypocrites Allah revealed a whole chapter about the Hypocrites mentioning him and what he had said yet the prophet Alam did not allow any of his companions to kill him and when he was asked oh prophet of Allah allow me to kill him he said no people must not talk and say that Muhammad is killing his companions which means that as Muslims we have to look into to the conclusions so even if and this is a big if even if hypothetically that it was permissible to kill this man this man and it is not permissible by no means because even if we have a treaty with the cfer the disbelievers the prophet says Allah commanded his Prophet that if you feel that there would be a sort of treachery or betray tra from their side your feeling does not allow you to launch War because I can have the benefit of the first strike Allah tells the prophet no such treachery or betrayal is forbidden so what should I do you should go to them sent to them a message telling them that the pact or the con uh uh uh the treaty that was between us is no more and now we have no treaty we can fight so you cannot betray someone you cannot uh cheat someone and killing him like this if you want to kill someone in an army and you have an army then it is to be on the battlefield not to stab him from behind or to do something like this this is cowardness so the act itself is forbidden totally and it's prohibited completely and the consequences prove that what they had done was against Islam look at the attacks that the masjids had under undergone to look at the women who were forced to take their veils and the uh uh uh Hooligans and the right-wing uh lunatics uh started to attack on the streets why because of an incident that two lunatics did and they claim that this is related to Islam and no one says that this is related to Islam this has nothing to do with Islam at all and unfortunately this is what the media does now when this uh uh Norwegian guy went on a shooting spree and he killed like 200 people and blown up a building and went to another Island and and started shooting the youth no one said that he's a right-wing Christian no he's a lunatic okay why don't you call these two people lunatic and instead insist that calling them that they're Muslims they have nothing to do with Islam and what do they know about know about Islam bring them in front of me and let me give them 10 questions about how to purify themselves or how to perform W or how to perform prayer they are ignorance they are people that were put there to infiltrate Islam and to a bad image about Islam so in short these PE this incident does not relate to Islam these people are definitely lunatics to do such a thing and uh I pray to Allah that he would grant us the knowledge and the wisdom to deal with such uh uh people and Allah Knows Best Al"
