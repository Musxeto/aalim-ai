  "title": "Is not asking questions to people of knowledge out of fear of being held accountable for sins Shirk?",
  "transcript": "farooq from qatar so my question is if someone doesn't ask questions about the religion to like people of knowledge when he is obligated to know such basic knowledge of islam because they have social anxiety or they don't do obligatory acts such as forbidding evil because they are afraid of what people would think then have they committed major sheikh because of leaving obligatory deeds for the people no this is not major shirk but this is sinful when a person knows that if he asks people of knowledge about this ruling they will command him to do this or that and he doesn't want to do this or that either due to his anxiety due to fearing the people due to his weakness being a coward whatever reason so he refrains from asking people for this reason he's sinful without any doubt i know people when you want to advise them about the ruling of something they say no no no we don't want to listen why is it because we if we listen then allah will hold us accountable this is not true even if you don't listen allah will hold you accountable you are in a country of islam and among the muslims and the means of knowledge is at your fingertips but you are turning your back to it so allah will hold you accountable to this regardless you"
