  "transcript": "Sala says who would ask the questions in the grave and what are those questions is it true that our good deeds and recitation of the Quran would transform into a beautiful looking man who would be present during questioning in the grave as for the first question we know from authentic hadith that two angels who look horrible and who are so tough in their questioning would come to an individual whether Muslim or non-muslim and they will ask him three or four questions so they will reprimand the deceased in his grave and they will shout at him who's your Lord a believer would say Allah what's your religion a believer would say Islam who is this man who was sent to you and he would reply his muhammad the messenger of allah sallallahu Salim and then they would ask him what did you do or what have you done in what you have received from this message or information and he would say I believed in the Book of Allah the Quran and I acted upon it then they will say to him sleep like a bride until the day of judgment and then a gate or a window from paradise would be open in his grave and he will get some of the fragrances and the coolness and beautiful things in it and you say oh Allah make the hour be cold now I want day of judgment now so that I would be admitted to my paradise then the Prophet tells us a man who's well presented will come to him and the deceased would say masha'Allah your faces is very beautiful you're a handsome person and I feel comfortable looking at you who are you and the man would say I am your good deeds and this is an authentic hadith the disbeliever and the hypocrite when they were asked when they are asked about these four or three things they would say huh I don't know I heard people say and I said what they had said so they will be shouted at and these two angels would hit the man on his head with a big stick merhaba something that is scary and he would turn into salt and then he would be brought back again and they will punish him and open a window from hell and he would be punished in his grave until the day of judgement while calling or Allah let the day of judgment never come because this is in the grave what will happen when the day of judgement comes may allah azzawajal protect us all"
