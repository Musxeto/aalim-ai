  "transcript": "Dr zakya could you explain the term kafara and furthermore could you also let our viewers know what is the experation for a person who has sexual intercourse whilst fasting during the month of Ramadan the word kafar is DED from the word kuf which means to conceal which means to hide which means to cover and in context of fasting kafar of fasting is done when a person willfully breaks the fast by having a sexual intercourse when a man has sexual intercourse with his wife while fasting while keeping F fast that's fasting in the month of Ramadan then they should be kafara as far as what is the kafara it is mentioned clearly inkari Vol number three in the book of fasting Hadith number 1936 where a person comes to prophet malli wasallam and he says that oh messenger of Allah I am ruin Ru I am ruined Prophet asked what happened he says that I had sexual intercourse with my wife while I was fasting he approached the prophet and said I had sexual intercourse with my wife while I was fasting so the prophet asked him that can you manumit a slave can you free a slave so he said no then the prophet asks him that can you fast for two consecutive months and you fast for 60 days together so he said no then the prophet asked ask him that can you feed 604 people the man replies no so then a person comes and gives a basket of De to the Prophet The Prophet hands this over to the man and says that give this to the poor people and that will be AAR so the man asks that should I give to a person who's poorer than my family Prophet says yes so then the person says I vow by Allah subhana tala I don't know of any family which is poorer than my family between the two hills and mountains of Madina so the prophet Smiles tell his M aen and he says give it to your family so from this Hadith we come to know that once a person breaks the fast purposely by having a sexual intercourse with his wife the first thing he should do is that he should compensate the fast as early as possible but natural before the next Ramadan number two he should give kafara so from the you come to know that there are three options given number one is he should free a slave or number two he can fast consecutively for 60 days continuously should fast for 60 days together without any break or he should feed 60 poor people and most of the scholars agree that it is not he can choose any one of the three some Scholars say yes he can choose any one of the three but the real ruling is he should try and do the first one should free a slave if he cannot free a slave then he should fast for two months consecutively continuously if he cannot do that then the option is that he can feed 60 people so this is as far as the kafar is concerned"
