  "transcript": "suhara Ali says I have a question regarding Muharram if your husband X did not give you your MA and it has been many years and you notice that he is not intending to do so can you choose to forgive him now what is the meaning of Maha Maha means doubting and when a man marries a woman he has to give her her dowry this is her right so if she was kind enough to postpone receiving the dowry she says okay maybe next year maybe I don't want it now and they consume ated the marriage and they had children this is a debt that the man must give to the woman unfortunately a lot of quote unquote so-called men may deprive their wives especially after divorce from their god-given right and they will be held accountable on the day of judgment the vast majority of them they misinterpret and they say yeah yeah she was unfair to me she did not do this and that to me she took money from me I gave her this I paid for her medical bills I they misinterpret and they find justification for their evil acts okay this is not going to help you on the day of judgment you're going to be held accountable and this that you will pay each and every penny from your own good deeds on the day of judgment plus interest if there were any interest because you have deprived this poor woman from her god-given right while you enjoyed her with out paying her anything and this is totally Haram now for you is it as a wife recommended that you give him this is up to you if you are a need why would you forgive him so his uh or through this evil person take him to court and show the evidences the marriage contract where it's written how much he's supposed to pay you and even if they throw him in jail let it be this is your god-given right such a person does not deserve your kindness and forgiveness but if he's stone broke seriously he was trying but he's unable to provide for you and he doesn't have the means of it you can reach an agreement of paying it installments or you can forgive him and your reward would be to allah azza wajal"
