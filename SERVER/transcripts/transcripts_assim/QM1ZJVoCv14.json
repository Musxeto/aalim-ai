  "transcript": "we begin inshaallah in today's lesson the description of the prayer of the prophet salallahu salaam and it's a vast and wide topic however it is very easy because it's governed by hadiths of those who describe the prophet allah he said pray as you have seen me pray i didn't see you how do you pray how would i know simple by looking at the description of those who had seen him pray and with us today is hadith number 81 used to keep silent between the takbir and the recitation of quran and that interval of silence used to be a short one i said to the prophet may peace be upon him may my parents be sacrificed for you what do you say in the pause between takbeer and recitation the prophet salallahu set me apart from my sins as the east and the west are set apart from each other o allah clean me from sins as a white garment is cleaned of dirt after washing oh allah wash off my sins with water snow and hail this hadith of course as we know is in one form of what is known as the inauguration supplication which takes place between the first takbeer and the recitation of al-fatiha how many times does it happen in the prayer only once in the very beginning so the first thing abu hurairah said the prophet once he gives techbeer he pauses silently for a while and scholars described his pauses in prayer and some of them said that he pauses in the raqqa three times in after reciting the fatiha and before going for rukur and the most authentic opinion is that he only poses twice these are backed by the hadith the sahih hadith and ibn al-qaeda may allah mentioned them in his great book the first pause is this and we have the hadith of al-bukhari and muslim to back it up the second pause is before going for rukur and it's not an actual pause as scholars say it's a pause to take the breath so after reciting the surah and you finish the surah you run out of breath nobody goes for example either so these are the only two pauses in forms of the recitation that the prophet ali allah used to have however one may ask the prophet didn't he pause after reciting the fatiha so that the people would be able to recite the fatiha in his pause and the answer is no there is nothing in the sunnah to prove that the prophet is sustained used to give the people a pause or a period of time to recite the fatiha what about what's happening in al-haram of makkah and medina where the imam pauses well not all of the imam sports and that is why those who pause are making a mistake they are going against the sunnah of the prophet because if they pause to give the people time to recite the quran or to recite we give them a question and that is did the prophet stopped or paused for a while so that the people would be able to recite the fatiha they can say either yes or no if they said yes what do we tell them provide me with the evidence from the sunnah if they fail to do this then the answer is no he did not pose if he didn't pause how do you dare and do something he didn't do and it's very simple the analogy is very simple the way of thinking is very simple following the quran someone says oh it's okay it doesn't hurt it doesn't hurt i'm not going to make a surgery i'm not going to take an injection i'm going to follow the prophet's way of praying and if he didn't do this then you have no right in doing it so abu hurairah allah be pleased with him when he noticed that the prophet pauses he went forward and asked him in some narrations the prophet said o abu hurairah i was hoping that no one else than you would ask me because he saw that was keen on learning so he thought that the only one who would ask him about this was abu hurairah and he told him i say and he read the supplication that the brother has read to us and there are a number of supplications not only this one but what is the ruling on such supplications are they mandatory are they pillars of salat are they sunnah what do you think it's a sunnah how do we know that it is a sunnah yes brother sheikh we come to know this because the prophet didn't uh tell his sahabah to read this after questioning he answered that's one of the good reasons that the prophet sallam did not instruct the companions to do it after he was asked he told them and also we have the hadith known as the man who does not know how to pray or the bad worshiper and we will come to describe this when the prophet saw the man praying and he three times tells he tells him go and pray you did not pray go and pray you did not pray finally the man surrendered and said by allah i don't know how to pray except the way you saw me so teach me and the prophet taught him the scholars looked at the instructions of the prophet and said that this hadith refers to pillars and any instruction or order in other hadiths these are mandatory and anything else is voluntary and this is how they segregate and classify the acts of prayer and we will come to this insha allah later on so the prophet salallahu salaam is explaining to abu hurairah what to say first of all he says o allah distant between me and my sins as you have set apart the east and west is there anything further than the east and west the east never meets the west and they're so far apart so you're praying to allah azzawajal that he makes you so far away from your sins how would that happen if allah forgives your sins so this is one of the means of distant or make the distance between me and my sins so far and one other interpretation is that do not make me fall into sin so if i would fall into sin this would generate sins so further me away put me as far as possible from falling into such sins as if is the distance between east and west and both meanings are beautiful the second thing is cleanse me and clean my records from sins as a white though as a white garment is cleaned from dirt always in commercials of detergents they bring a white shirt with yellow spotting with dirt with mud and then all of a sudden it's masha'allah white and clean usually they lie a lot but nevertheless this white clean shirt is what you wish that allah azza changes your records of deeds all those stains all those sins you wish and hope that allah changed them into good deeds or at least it is the bad sins and the bad deeds from them and the last and third one that allah cleans you and purifies you from sins again but with water with hail and with snow so all of these three things that you pray that allah washes your sins away however one would argue what is the best temperature to clean garments with cold or hot hot so why then use hail and snow scholars say that because things are fiery in nature and would lead to fire in hell as a purification and punishment the prophet allah found it suitable more to ask allah azza to cleanse these sins with cold substances that would manage to take the heat out of them with the grace of allah and the best means to put a fire out is by using these substances of snow hail and water now as stated before it is part of the sunnah to read this supplication but do i read it silently or loudly silently without any difference among scholars and this is the doing of the prophet that is why abu hurairah asked because if the prophet islam had ever recited it loudly there's no point of asking and there are different types of such supplications among them that ones that we will insha allah read to you in brief but we have a break so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back there are a number of supplications that the prophet alaihi salazar used to inaugurate his prayer with he used to start his prayers with among them for example the one you know was this scholars say that the prophet used to say it in prayer especially in night prayer and there is the famous hadith subhanallah and this is concise and short and it is said a lot and scholars gave this dua preference over the others because it includes only praising of allah subhanahu kalahama will be praise be to allah azzawajal and glory may your name be blessed what's the meaning of jed no one knows you should try your best to learn the meaning of these supplications judd yes as we call as show you that as in the surat the lady says my father is a sheikh means age age-wise as we gain a degree of respect of honor no judge has two meanings means uh he's the only one who's got the power to give and the power to take no no this is not the right interpretation jed in arabic one of the meaning is grandfather the grandfather is called jedd but here ta'ala does not mean that your grandfather is elevated subhana allah has no father and by far has no grandfather as well so what does it mean it's similar to what is found in surat al-jin ta'ala swahili means it's also similar to what we say at the end of prayer when we conclude a prayer and making dhikr we say min khaljad so it has nothing to do with the grandfather judd here means richness and power so allah is the one with richness and power and when we say walaiyan for odell meaning the man who's rich this wealth of his will not have any value from you because if i am the richest man in the world what would this money do to me to protect me from allah nothing while i am for the jed the wealth of a rich man would not avail him would not do him any good so when we say meaning that your status your power your richness may be elevated and increased and there is no god except you this supplication a lot of the scholars among them ibn kayem and other scholars preferred it more than any other one because in the supplication of abu hurairah you're asking allah you're actually asking allah for purification and for forgiveness but in this dua you are only praising allah and we know that dua is divided into two sections dua of simply praising allah and dua of requesting something from allah so dua of only praising allah such as the prophet said the best of dua that the prophets before me and i had said is okay what are you asking for not only that the supplication of the man who was swallowed by the whale what's his name jonas and the other name the noon so allah says when he were left angry because of his people foreign anyone who calls allah with it allah would relieve him from any worries or depression he's facing what is it what does it include what do you want this is what jonas used in the belly of the whale but what do you want it simply says there is no god worthy of being worshipped except you praise be you i was among the wrong doers that's it okay what do you want you want money you want food you want salvation he doesn't have to say because he knows that allah knows what he wants so he's simply giving dua of praising allah the other form of dua is oh allah forgive me o allah grant me a wife or take my wife this is depending on your status so these are all kinds of dua you're asking something allah to give you or to protect you from so the scholars back again say that this short dua subhana gallahu hamduk tabaraka smoke that it is the best of all because it praises allah the almighty and some say no the hadith of is far greater why because it's in the sahih and the other one is not it's in the muslim so it's a higher level and because it is what the prophet used to say and both of them used to be said by the prophet so if you take this one that is great yet the scholars say whenever there is a number of variations or let me rephrase that whenever there are a number of ways of saying things or virgins you have to do them for example after praying we say subhan alhamdulillah 33 times and we say to the end there is also supplication that the prophet used to say subhanallah alhamdulillah ten times and that is it so part of the sunnah i use this sometimes and i use that sometimes so that i would be reviving the sunnah of the prophet islam secondly i would not be enslaved for a certain pattern if you only say one version of every single prayer it becomes routine but if you deliberately change this tomorrow i'm going to change that and i play with them sort of speak in the sense that i would always be in in concentration of the things that i say that is far greater insha'allah we open the floor for your questions if you have any yes abdul rahman say guys it is the sunnah to uh that the prophet may peace be upon him he said so what about a person who joins in late does he also have to say the dua or you know what very good question what's the ruling on a person joining the salat late if he joined the salat in silent raqqa he says the dua but if he joins the salat while the imam is reciting the fatih or the surah as the brother said allah says you must if the quran is being recited you have to listen so you do not say allah you say allah of course but you do not say subhana muhammad yes the sky is the limit you say all of these because you have time inshallah to say it and a lot of the muslims make the common mistake when the imam is in the rakura and i come late they say what are you doing the mommy is in record immediately say and allah and and bow and should i do two or one this is an issue of dispute not the time to discuss it we will come to discuss it later on inshaallah yes brother this is concerning the and hoso of the salah i wanted to ask that is it permissible for a non non-arab to recite the translation of the verse for example i am reading surah fatiha i recite alhamdulillah then i directly repeat the translation all praises to due to allah the lord of the worlds is it permissible for a person to repeat the translation and contemplate on it is not at all permissible to repeat the translation because if you do you have nullified your prayer why because you're adding to the prayer something that is not part of it you the part of the prayer while in the standing position is to do what read the fatiha alone and then read the surah in arabic alone no translation is permitted afterwards those who do not know the fatih in arabic we all know that those who are unable to recite the fat at all they don't know anything of it the prophet instructed them to do thicker so in the islamic position they say subhan alhamdulillah as to the best of their ability until it takes them a day or two to memorize the fat or even they can hold the paper in front of their face while praying and reading it in any way that is acceptable but to translate no this is completely prohibited in the prayer this is all the time we have until we meet next time wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi"
