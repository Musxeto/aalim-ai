  "transcript": "The next question from our lady's side. She asked about, she's working in a showroom whereby they charge interest and penalties for late payment. Is the job halal? Now this is a combination of halal and haram. The showroom that she works in sells halal products. Let's assume they sell garments, they sell cars, they sell commodities. This is halal. You're not selling anything haram. So your income from selling such things is halal. The moment you are involved in filling up late payment fees or interest for EMIs depending on the payment method of payments or you facilitating their collaboration with a bank to finance this and you're helping it, you're cursed by Allah. Because this is riba. A prophet said, Alayhis salatu Wassalam La'anallahu aakilar riba wa muukilahu wa shahidayhi wa katibahu. May Allah Azza Wa Jal curse five individuals. Number one, the one who consumes riba. This is the financial institution, the bank. They consume riba. Number two, the one who pays riba. This is the customer who is buying a house on mortgage. He is buying a house in riba. Number three and four, the two witnesses who are maybe good Samaritans. They're just witnessing. They're not being paid. They're just witnesses signing the name that yes, he borrowed this from this. And the fifth is the clerk, the accountant who registers the amount 100,000, they will have to pay 120,000 in two years. So if you're not involved in any of these paperwork or directing or collaborating on it, you're just selling halal items, then your income is halal inshallah."
