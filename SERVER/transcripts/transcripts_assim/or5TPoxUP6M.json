  "transcript": "ibraim from guine my question today is uh related to I mean uh in my country here unfortunately there are many places where it's like women who work there or they in like uh their rooms basically there just windowed rooms but the woman is alone inside for example at the bank uh the Islamic Bank where I GRE it's like that so unfortunately the problem is sometimes when you go and she's alone in the room you cannot really go in and close the door otherwise you're in a hor situation and you still have to solve your issue so for example uh sometimes what I do I just try to leave the door open so that the people outside can hear us or something like that or uh try to do things like that but one day I Tred to go there and there was somebody in the room so I was waiting outside and when I tried to go in the client went out but when I went in and I started talking to the woman uh the door was open but I realized that on the whole floor actually it was just the two of us so I realized that even if the door is open is not really I mean I'm still in a whole situation so uh unfortunately I was trying to solve a issue uh and at some point she had my phone on her hand so I didn't really know exactly what I would should do in that situation uh like should I just take my phone and stop talking and run out or something like that like eventually I finished my conversation with that I went out I want to know like was I sinful for that and like uh what should I have done in that situation basically you're sinful for there's no doubt in that if the floor had no one and you are alone with this woman you should have taken your precautions by bringing someone else with you or making sure that there are at least some employees around you looking from these windows or glass doors so that it would wouldn't be fully uh what's done is done ask Allah for forgiveness next time be more care careful and Allah Knows Best"
