  "transcript": "[Music] dear brothers and sisters in islam and welcome to this new episode of your program the basics one of the basics in islam is which each and every one of us muslims take for granted and cannot compromise and that is the quran the quran is the basics of islam it is the fundamentals of islam it is the core of islam islam is found all of it in the quran and the quran is the word of allah which was revealed to his messenger muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam through his archangel jibril peace be upon him it is miraculous in its structure in its wording and is in its content and it is also the only thing that we can recite as a form of worship of allah which means that anything you recite in the salat other than the quran is invalid and it has reached us through a tawatur and a tawatur is a means of conveying information from one generation to the other where it cannot be at all falsified or denied there's so many people relaying it from one to another generation that it is impossible to be taken as a lie and it's written in the mushaf from the beginning of surat al-fatiha chapter 1 to the end of surat annas chapter 114 this is the technical definition of quran so al-quran is the word of allah and this is one of the basics in islam it is something that we are proud of as muslims you see when we meet other religions they boast about their messengers whom we believe in of course is part of the articles of faith in our religion to believe in the messengers and they talk greatly and highly about their miracles which also we believe in simply because the quran talks about it but when the jews for example talk about the staff of prophet musa peace be upon him and how it turned into a big python a big snake that swallowed all the sorcerers tricks when they talk about splitting of the sea when they talk about other miracles that allah has given to musa an atheist would say show me they say no no this is found in the scriptures did you see it did you say no how can you believe something you did not see when the a christian says that jesus christ peace be upon him isa alaihissalat used to say that i cure the blind from birth and i cure the leper and i give life to the dead because at his time people excelled in medicine as at the time of moses people excelled in sorcery for example and magical tricks so their prophets were sent with miracles that suit their times so when a christian tells me all of these things and i say masha allah can you show me any of these miracles he said they do not exist today have you seen it yourself i said no but i was told about them i said okay and you go on and on to all prophets and messengers whom were sent to their people with similar miracles but these miracles were specifically given to their people and once the mission was accomplished there was no need for such miracles so we don't see any of these miracles unlike the time of the prophetic the people of arabia excelled in their literature in how eloquent they used to use language how beautiful they structured it whether it's rhymes or poetry or regular writing and speech so the prophet alaihis salat islam came to them with many miracles the splitting of the moon water gushing from his fingers you name it he had it yet allah has given him the ultimate miracle of all miracles and that is the word of allah the almighty which is unlike anything else and this miracle remained with us till date so any religion when challenged to present their miracles they fail to do so we muslims believe in their miracles by the way because our religion confirms it but they don't believe in one another's miracles and they can't prove it themselves because they had not seen it themselves islam is different because we have the miracle with us and we show it to the whole world allah azzawajal chose to reveal the best of his books the quran through the best of his angels the archangel gibril to the best of his creation prophet muhammad in the best of in the best of nights and there is the night of decree in one of the most beautiful months the month of ramadan in the most sacred land and that is mecca all of this allah azza has given to us the followers of muhammad ali the muslims so that this quran would be the ultimate revelation that abrogates everything that came before it and would succeed to remain till the end of time now quran is a book of miracles and it's something that is not so huge or big you've all seen the quran allah has made it easy to remember to ponder upon to study and it is easy it is full of miracles scientific achievements though the arabs when it was revealed to them might have not reached the level of knowledge and science to comprehend all of it but they accepted it and they embraced it they believed that it was one of a kind literally they believe it was one of a kind linguistically and on the literature level so eloquent so fluent and easy yet so profound and powerful they believed that and they were the people who were masters of the language as time progressed and science facts were revealed we come to discover that the quran is filled with miracles though it's not a book of science it's not a book of technology this is what this is not what it was revealed for yet you'll find embedded in it many miracles when it talks about astronomy the big bang theory etc when it talks about the mountains and the earth's geology when it talks about human structure and how allah created mankind it talks about biology when it talks about the creation of the fetus embryology when it talks about the plants no one knew that they were female and males in plants so bhutanese is discussed zoology when it talks about animals when it talks about the bees and how they live about the ants things that blows your mind away how could someone who was illiterate could not read and write bring so much wealth of information and knowledge in arabia in the desert 15 centuries ago let alone when the quran talks about economy about usury about interest about halal and haram in forms of transactions let alone when it talks about the social system and how affairs must be ruled and governed when it talks about inheritance and the specific percentages mentioned in the quran when it talks about the prescribed punishments and their role in building a secure and safe community and society when it talks about politics how to deal with the non-muslims how it governs our relationships with them at times of peace as well as at times of war and this is as i said a book that also talks about the unseen heaven and hell the day of judgment what will happen talks about prophecies that had come and prophecies that will come and we believe in that and the astonishing thing is you cannot find any contradictions in it it's a perfect book simply because it is the word of allah and one of its miracles is that allah has challenged the humans and the jinn as well to collaborate together and produce 10 surahs like it 10 chapters like it if it's possible allah says or they or do they say he invited he invented it the disbelievers say that the prophet sallam invented the quran say then bring 10 surahs like it that have been invented and call upon for assistance whomever you can beside allah if you should be truthful so if this man the one who does not know how to read and write invented this book call and collaborate with whomever you wish and produce out of the 114 chapters produce only 10. if you're truthful then the challenge goes up and the stakes are higher allah says or do they say about the prophet he invented it say then bring forth a surah one chapter like it and call upon for assistance whomever you can beside allah if you should be truthful till date 15 centuries later the challenge is still on and no one has succeeded they all have failed miserably why because this is the word of allah no one can duplicate or replicate something like it so you as an individual know as basics this is the ultimate revelation this is the final revelation allah stated that prophet muhammad ali is the last messenger ever to be sent to humankind and to the jinn and the quran is the last revelation that's it full stop till date this stands till date it is challenging it is a miracle that stands you as an individual have a responsibility regardless of your religion to check whether your religion is the most truthful one or not so how do you do that well look at your scriptures look at the book you have can it stand the acid test would it pass the numerous logical tests that we should put it under and through such as the quran is the only book i know of that is about 600 plus pages the only book i know of that is fully memorized from cover to cover not by thousands of people not by hundreds of thousands of people rather by tens of millions of people and the funny thing is the vast majority of these people are not arabs they don't understand what they are memorizing yet they memorize it letter by letter 600 plus pages and they recite it to you as if they are native arabs no book on earth i know of that a religion has would have this show me someone or show me a thousand person who can revise and recite the bible or the vedas by heart no way there isn't yeah they may memorize coats here and there but put sit them down and open it from cover to cover and let them recite it from memory no way only the quran show me a scripture that has been preserved in its original original form that it was revealed in you will not find that even the bible you will not find that the quran is preserved as it was revealed and its preservation is both written and memorized so the tens of millions of people who memorize it by heart if we were to come to the copies of the quran worldwide and burn them and destroy them today these 10 million people will sit down and write the same identical quran letter by letter you cannot make a mistake in the quran and be unnoticed i would recite the quran in prayer in my congregation and a nine-year-old child behind me if i make a mistake in the recitation he would raise his voice during prayer to correct me and i would rectify my mistake and correct it and after the prayer is over i go and thank that child for preserving the quran no other scripture has this no one can claim among the miracles of the quran is that the language which was the quran revealed in is still spoken today by hundreds of millions of people of arabs and non-arabs alike so we have like 350 400 plus million arabs they speak the language they open the quran they read it they understand it and there are hundreds of other millions of non-arabs who studied arabic as a second language so that they would understand the religion for themselves no scriptures share this with the quran usually it's a translation of a translation of a translation of a translation so you don't know what was lost in translation and those who speak the language of the ancient scriptures are few and they can manipulate the meaning that serves their own hidden agenda this quran has been preserved not a single letter has changed and it is a cause or a reason to be proud of no other religion shared this with us you can't find a single defect or error in it and the challenge has been standing for 15 centuries nobody was able to replicate one surah and by the way one sure is one single line the shortest surah in the quran is a single line three verses then the challenge stands this is the quran which constitutes one of the essential basics in our religion how did the non-muslims react to it and how they are reacting to it at the moment and how will their reaction be in the future what is the relationship between the muslims and the quran as we speak today because this is our biggest problems this is our biggest problem when the muslims do not abide by the basics and if they go and search for other than the basics they'll go astray so what are the muslims doing today about the quran this is what we will attempt to investigate inshallah in the following segments of our program the basics we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we'll be right back"
