  "transcript": "Musa from Azerbaijan Assalamu Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum Is snot a barrier in wudu, the thing which comes out of the nose? Because after washing it with water or taking it with my hand, I still feel layer under my nose or in the middle of the nostril. This is not possible, ya Musa, ya Musa. This is not possible. Snot is water, waterly based. So it's not super glue and it's not cement. Once you wash your face and you just do this, it goes. The traces you may feel has no impact on it, inshallah."
