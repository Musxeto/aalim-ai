  "title": "Can I pray Taraweeh in two different masjids and still get the reward for the entire night? | Assim",
  "transcript": "is it okay to pray taraweeh in two different messages suppose I pray the first ten raka in one message then the next 10 in another mess ship first of all Thalia what is the ruling on praying taraweeh is it mandatory the answer is no therefore if you skip it altogether you can't say is it permissible or is it okay you're not sinful and if you pray half of it and skip the other half you're not sinful if you pray half of it in one message it and the other half in another message it you are not sinful the sky is the limit but the problem is that will you be rewarded fully or partially why are we asking such a question because the Prophet said Ali is salatu salam in an authentic hadith he who prays with the imam that is taraweeh prayer until he finishes Allah would reward him as if he had prayed the whole night so this means that if I managed to pray the eleven broca's or the twenty-three Rakas with the imam one single imam in one masjid until he offers taraweeh then Allah would reward me as if I prayed from Asia tell fetcher and that's a lot but if I divided if I pray ten rakahs here and thirteen rak'ahs there I will not get the same reward as mentioned in the hadith"
