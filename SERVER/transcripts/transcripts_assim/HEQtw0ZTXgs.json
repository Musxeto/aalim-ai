  "transcript": "in last football World Cup an octopus well known as Paul predicted correctly could you please light on that well this is something that the media have the media has managed to fool people with an octopus is an animal and by making an animal choose and thinking that this animal has intellect or knows what kind of team would win those who believe this are themselves considered to be insane or not people with uh uh a Sound Logic an animal that is unable to communicate to speak to write to read to uh uh have a Sound Logic of its own it is an animal then you claim that it has the ability to predict by simply putting boxes with the flags of Germany Spain England or whatever in whatever it chooses to eat from or to sit on this is a prediction this is nonsense so any person who is Muslim I'm not talking about non-muslims non-muslims are cfer they're already know where their destination is so there isn't anything greater than kufur so no matter what they do they've hit the rock bottom there's no way below that because they disbelieve in Allah Asel but I'm talking about the Muslims Muslims who believe in such a thing and that flipping a coin could determine which team would win or send the birds and if they go right this means that Germany would win if it goes left this means that England would win or thinking that by looking into a coffee cup after finishing it and looking at the traces of the coffee there you can be able to determine the future this is all blasphemy this is all taking a person out of the loop of Islam Because he believes that someone other than Allah knows the Unseen and Allah tells us in the Quran that no one knows the Unseen except Allah so therefore yeah people should not pay any attention to this nonsense and Allah knows this"
