  "title": "Is shaving the beard or not wearing the hijab a continuous ongoing sin?",
  "transcript": "real from bangladesh my question is that uh is the scene writing continuously on them who do not keep beard and for women who do not maintain hijab is the sin continuous for someone who shaves his beard and a woman who does not wear the hijab who cares it's a sin this person is disobeying allah so the moment i shaved my beard i'm sinful so does this mean sheikh that the sins are ticking and i'm increasing sins etc who cares you're sinful no no i need to know how many at the end of the day have i gained sins like the steps i do i watch on my watch or my uh phone i need to know how many sins i've uh accumulated why this doesn't make any sense what makes sense is are you sinful or not yes is it continuous it is continuous until you repent so if you shaved five minutes ago and you felt remorseful now and you've repented it will boom grow again no so once you repent the sin stops but as long as you have no remorse and you have no problem with that the sin is continuous but is the meter ticking or not this isn't allah's hands the sin is there and how many have you accommodate accumulated this is in allah's hands you"
