  "transcript": "la manna for him and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salam o alikum mother ultimate an El Alamein nabina muhammad wa ala aalihi wasabi woman a derby hat year western visual neti he lau me Dean a man dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato and welcome to this new episode of women around the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam today we will talk about two of the prophet's daughters may allah be pleased with them they are the second and the third in order in terms of age as we know zeyneb was the eldest and we talked about her in a previous episode she was the wife of a bellossom near revere then there was Roy I followed by Uncle Tom and the last of the prophets daughters sallallahu alaihi wa sallam was fatima so today we are to speak be in la sol about rakia and uncle soon rakia the daughter of muhammad sallallaahu are you seldom her mother was Khadija went to hue lit so she had the best lineage ever she's the daughter of the messenger and the a prophet of Allah Azza WA JAL she was born about when the Prophet was 33 years of age so when he became a prophet I did so some she was seven years of age that's a young age however she accepted Islam at that young age with the rest of her sisters alongside their mother and she was a girl a young girl and a woman who was sought after because her father was Muhammad bin Abdullah he was the trustworthy the honest and the truthful everybody knew him and acknowledged this her mother was Khadijah the rich an honorable woman of Quraysh so at an early age rukia and her youngest sister Uncle Tom who was a year younger than her we're both married to the cousins of their father rota and wrote a BA and they were the sons of Abu Lahab the uncle of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam their mother was Jamila the daughter of her the sister of Abu Sufian even her and aunt of the halifa amirul mumineen more are we even ABI Sufyan so the whole community was interlinked these two boys married these two sisters but when the prophet alayhi salatu salam became a messenger and announced it as we know the Prophet took the first three years of the Berthe in calling people in secrecy he did not announce it after three years allah azza wajal revealed to him to announce the DAO to everybody so he announced it he called the people of mecca the dignitaries everybody and gave them the announcement to worship allah azzawajal and to abandon their idols the first one to reject and stand in his way was his own uncle Abu Lahab he was so furious so against Islam and Dawa after being one of the biggest supporters and people who loved Muhammad as an individual once the Prophet as salaam declared islam and called them to it he became a fierce enemy of Islam he tried everything in his possession to tarnish his reputation and to deter people from following or even listening to him until allah azza wajal revealed a surah condemning him cursing him sentencing him to hellfire Allah says in the Quran what translates to may the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined and ruined is he his wealth will not avail him or that which he gained he will enter to burn in a fire of blazing flame and his wife as well the carrier of firewood around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber this surah is known as Surat wilma said it's a full chapter dedicated to abu lahab and his wife condemning them to hellfire some scholars said that this surah was a clear evidence of the truth of Islam of the Quran of Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wa sallam this surah was revealed and it could have been easy for Abu Lahab to play a game and say okay this surah says that I will be I'll burn in hell well I embrace Islam and to pretend that he embraces embraced Islam and everybody would know that Quran is not true because it stated something and it was false but he didn't which indicates that was that was a prophecy and it was a challenge so when this surah was revealed Abu Lahab went to his sons along with his wife and said to them I will not speak to you I will not have anything to do with you unless you divorce Muhammad's daughters so the two boys immediately divorced the daughters of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam which was something that Allah wanted to honor our prophet elisha salam by detaching from such people and allah wanted to increase the humiliation of abu lahab and his children because of their cover and their disbelief by the way Ramaiah was 10 years of age when she was married to her cousin which again not one not to so many women of Quraysh were given in marriage at a very early age Amina the mother of the Prophet Allah so Sam was married when she was 13 so this was the norm that girls got married at a very early age because they blossomed physically and they were capable of catering for the needs of their husbands when she was divorced there was earth man - earth man was a young man a rich man a man who came from a very powerful tribe he had kinship to defend him and this is what mattered at the times your kinship your family your tribe they can defend you they can stand with you they can support you and if you had money alongside that you've got it made and if you were young and handsome then every woman would look to have an opportunity to marry you earth man was among the very first to accept Islam and these are one of the blessings and favours of Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him who managed to call so many people youngsters and influencers in a very short period of time the moment the words of truth touched his heart and his hearing he accepted Islam being who he was he proposed to the prophet alayhi salaatu a sinner so that he would strengthen the bond with the messenger of allah azza wa jal and the prophet alayhi assalam could not refuse such an honorable man a man who came among the first to accept islam so he went and discussed it with his daughter aya who felt happy and joyful that allah azza wajal replaced her with such an honorable man instead of that thing that was married to her and divorced her without any wrongdoing from her side so she accepted and they got married and all historians say islam did not see a true love story similar to the story of earth man and his wife will pay yeah though he was rich and powerful his people did not like him reverting to Islam nor that he got married to their enemy enemy's daughter so they started causing trouble to him and this is when the prophet alayhi salatu salam ordered him among a handful of men to migrate to Abyssinia and the Prophet told him to take his wife with him either his salat WA Salam so they set off on their journey which was to the unknown a land they don't speak the language of and they have to cross the sea which they have never sailed on before and she was pregnant so they set off and traveled migrated she gave birth to his first born son Abdullah and earth man was known to be nicknamed as Abu Abdullah and they stayed in Abyssinia until Allah willed that they traveled back again and they migrated again to Medina so they had two migrations on their CV and that was a great honor at the time to migrate to Abyssinia and to medina at the same time when they went to Medina subhanAllah a lot of people died in Medina and unfortunately relia was one of them she fell sick and in the second year of hijra which means a year in few months after they reached medina she got really sick and it was the time for the Battle of better when the Prophet Isis I'm told the Companions to go along with him to try to attack and seize a caravan filled with wealth and money that belonged to the people of Croatia so earth man asked the prophet alayhi salatu salam if he could join him but he told him about his wife aya so the Prophet Isis I'm told him that you have to stay with rakia try to nurse her try to take care of her and I will save your share from the battle as if you were participating and this shows you how great rope aya was in the heart of her father that he prevented this man from joining the army in order to take care her and it's also a lesson for us to learn to learn the importance of our spouses of taking care of them of showing them affection and love especially at times of need so many men yes I know it's their nature not to express their feelings but they have no excuse not to give their spouses their wives they needed care especially when they are in need for that she serves you and your children and takes care of the house and cooks every single meal for you and when she is in need for help or assistance you simply look the other way this is not how men real men behave so he stayed behind and he tried his level best but fate was quicker than his attempts only for her to die before the coming back of the Prophet Isis and from butter and she died at the age of 22 on the second year of hijra and she was buried in Alberta air now rakia had a second sister who was one year younger than her and this sister was uncle - uncle phoom at the time was about 21 or 20 years of age after being divorced from her cousin she did not get married now she also faced the calamity of divorce at an early age and this by itself was a trauma for any woman she migrated with their siblings to Medina lived her life in Medina of course after all the years she spent in the house of the Prophet as-salaam in Mecca and also in Medina on the third year of hijra the Prophet SSM noticed that earth man had sadness in his face and when he asked him and this narration is mentioned in the books of serie the chain of narrators may not be authentic but it is a famous story that when it comes to serie we're not that specific in authenticating all the narrations so he asked him what is it so earth man says this calamity that had struck me the daughter of the messenger of allah died while being married to me and with me and my back is broken the chain the link between me and you our prophet of allah of being an in-law was severed and cut so the prophet said to him erase all of some or earth man this is gibreel telling me that Allah is ordering me to give you an marriage uncle tomb on the same dowry you gave to Roja on the condition that you treat her as well as you had treated rakia and oh my gosh says the Prophet said RA salat wa salam I did not give birth man uncle tomb except through a revelation from the heavens meaning from allah azza wajal so he married her and he lived with Uncle Tom for six years and they did not have any children she died in the ninth year of hijra this is why some historians give earth man the nickname of the new rainy meaning the one with the two lights as no one had ever married two daughters of a prophet or of a messenger and he was the only one who managed to do that so those who praised Adi may Allah be pleased with him for marrying the daughter of the prophet of islam which is fatima should praise at man double that because he married two daughters of the prophet elisha she died on the ninth year of hijra and the Prophet was reported to say had I had a third daughter I would given her to him and it shows the amount of love and respect the Prophet ideas of Sam had turf man ignore fan may Allah be pleased with him may Allah be pleased with rakia may Allah be pleased with own costume and all the companions of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam had Allahu Alem when is spittle ill me either he Aslam sallallahu sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad while and he was happy he had me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu today i'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader abu huraira may allah be pleased with him said the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said no one's wealth helped me as much as the wealth of abu bakr helped me after which abu bakr began to weep and say and is my life and wealth for anything besides you o messenger of allah this narration shows the level of etiquette and humbleness that Abubakr may Allah be pleased with him had in the presence of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam for he likened himself to a slave of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa send'em by saying that his wealth was only for the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa send'em as well as his soul and self this comes as no surprise for the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam has more rights on the believers than themselves he may Allah be pleased with him spent his wealth in the cause of Allah and he consoled the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa send'em through his own self so the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam recognized that for him and said in order to build his teacher and to remind the ummah of his virtues no one's wealth helped me as much as the wealth of abu bakr helped me among the benefits of this narration it is important to keep good manners and humbleness in the presence of the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam thanking someone who has bestowed some favour on you as well as supplicating for them is part of having good manners reported by Albahari reported by Al Timothy and eben majeure Albani ruled it authentic in his book sahih al jermeir the explanation of a Cindy on the book of eben maha and at a seer Bashar al JAMA a surreal I said I might want a la and welcome back Ibrahim says during this time of pandemic we sanitize our hands very often which contains alcohol in it so is it allowed to read the Quran and offer Salah after sin aside sanitizing our hands with alcohol-based sanitizers alcohol is not neji's and this is a most authentic opinion of scholars it is not physically impure which means that if I have it on my clothes or on my body this means I have to wash it before prayer therefore you can use sanitizers and hold the most half not only that you can also pray while having traces of sanitizers on your hand or putting alcohol-based perfumes on your body and clothes there's nothing wrong in that insha'Allah Saba says I have read that there is a hadith which says if a person makes dry while lifting his head up towards the sky during Salah Allah takes away his eyesight is it only in Salah or in general a person should not make dua while looking up as hacia peace be upon him made dua while looking up during the torture done by firown' on her well the most authentic opinion is that while praying you're not allowed to look up and say some ilaha mohammed or o allah forgive me or do this for me this is inappropriate this is prohibited and the Prophet warned those are aiso some of the possibility of them losing their eyesight as a punishment which means it is sinful but outside of prayer no there is no problem in that for example the prophet Isaiah used to wake up in the middle of the night recite the last an eye sore eyes of surat al-imran chapter 3 look at the heavens there are other a hadith stating that the Prophet used to make duaa while looking above so this is only limited to [Music] raising your eyesight during prayer because in prayer you should not move a lot you should not do this scratch your body watch your mobile phone check your watch this is not recommended as it is not recommended to distract yourself and show inappropriate actions such as giggling or laughing or smiling or excessive excessive movement or looking above now you should be standing in front of Allah Azza WA JAL filled with submissiveness humility expressing your poverty when you look up like this it shows that you have no respect at all to Allah during salat and this is prohibited Junaid says why is there a timing for emsac before the fajr prayer as mentioned in the hadith the Prophet Allah salat wa sallam said that finish what is in your hand even if the event of Roger is called out please clarify a lot of the people tend to be more Roman than the Romans and this is unfortunate in Islam Allah tells us to eat and drink until we can distinguish the white thread from the black thread meaning the break of dawn from the black thread which is the night time this means that I have the right to eat and drink until I can distinguish and if I did not distinguish yet I still can drink and eat however due to the fact that we live in a city with lights and with high risers and buildings this means that we won't be able to notice when the break of dawn truly is that is why we depend on the Athan so the determining factor here is the call of the event the Prophet said our aim is lava el imam o bombing the imam is a guarantor and al Veeru mocked Amman the one who calls a van is entrusted for keeping the time therefore if someone calls the van on the day of judgment he's the one who's going to be held accountable for me eating or not eating for me praying or not praying so I have to depend on the event some people came when they made their timetables and they said well the event is at five o'clock let's give a 15 minute buffer zone so at 4:45 this should be in sac what do you mean by him sac it means that you don't eat or drink okay can I pray should know you can only pray after 15 minutes so who put these 15 minutes as a buffer zone so we did we thought that that would be safer know with all due respect don't innovate in my religion not on my watch the Prophet Allah saws sallam told us to eat and drink until we hear even know me Maktoum giving the Athan bilal gives the ad an earlier but we can eat and drink we can pray a night prayer but when I open the o mEEMIC - may allah be pleased with them gives the event this is when we have to refrain so there isn't anything as such as an impact period prior to the event and I hope this answers your question a sister says both husband and wife work and save money in a joint account their joint money exceeds nisab but not when divided into two as they share as the share is 50/50 how should they give zakat if they're putting the money in this shared account just for the sake of convenience but they know that he owns 50% and she owns 50% and both monies do not individually reach the threshold in this case there is no problem on them both and there is no zakat on them but if they're keeping their money in a joint account mixing and having shared ownership not caring who owns what and in this case they have to give zakat and I'll give a word of advice to all brothers and sisters keep your financial savings and transactions separate from one another if you as a sister earn money don't share what you earn with your husband don't tell him how much you earn and don't tell him how much you save and don't give him access to your wealth or to your ATM or to your bank account details he might feel sad angry disappointed what's okay this is the best in order to ensure the continuity of your marriage because most likely if you ask him the same if you ask him to give you access to his bank account his ATM and to know how much he earns and when where he spends his money he wouldn't give you that so Shaitaan is always there lurking in the dark waiting for the right moment to strike I've seen so many problems from people having such joint accounts ending up after 10 or 15 years with the man marrying someone else with her money I've seen has shared with you so many times about those people who confiscate the gold and the wealth and the mehar of their wives and give it to their parents for safekeeping actually for keeping and this is theft and Haram so this is my advice and Allah so Allah knows best Rayanne from the US Ryan Ryan from the us why they conceal or allocate oh yes of he how I'm fine I'm doing well as I can look here what can I do for you yes I'm sure I know that that is how long to live in non-muslim countries but my relatives don't agree to this they say that so Allah says at hand in the Halloween no other load of our world so isn't it America Canada UK like the land of Allah ok my second question is is no previously on Veronica Mars alone yeah I know a little catchy ok I'm a lot of some question is that many people say that music is I have almond takes you out of the full of Islam so like you worship where and like when you see the rhythm if you're not down to it that's when you come Haram this is true so they mean that dancing to it is Haram but listening to it is ok no like when you listen to where and you like she like that you want to wait you only can you tap like your hand or like when you move because you like it so enjoy about enjoying it is Haram but listening to get randomly is not yeah okay it's fine listen to it but I feel like I feel like makes you like a moon and like makes you know why but thinking with it shakin everything because I will answer you in Sean barakallahu feat brother a yawn from the US the hare says that so many people say ok we have another caller and the caller is sister Sarah from Qatar sample ah so my question is basically for you what is your opinion on the best day job do we have to do as girls where are Bella and does it have to be black okay any more questions Thank You vonikken logical okay so Ryan says a lot of the people when they come to alhamdulillah or a bill Amin al al-amin is the plural of alum and Adam is world so Allah is the lord of the worlds and they say America Europe is one of these nations so why would we not live and migrate to such places why is it Haram first of all living in an unnamed country it's a long topic in a nutshell if you are forced to do it as in the case of a person who was born there so so all of his family friends they live there so if you were forced to live there or you were kicked of out of all Muslim countries and no one would take you and accept this kaffir country and which is the most important condition is that you are capable and able of worshipping Allah Celgene meaning that you can practice the rituals of Islam without any intimidation or any hardship if this is the case you can live there there's no problem in that so many millions of Muslims are living in the UK and the US and they're practicing their religion alhamdulillah without any intimidation or any hardship there's no problem in that but when you can't pray or abide by the hijab or you can you are being intimidated and abused at the workplace or at your schools and you feel inferior and maybe there might be hardship or even harm on your safety in this case it's not permissible to live there it's not permissible to give the pledge of allegiance to people that don't share our conviction with us and hence this is what the scholars say as for al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen these worlds are the world of the humans the world of the angels the world of the animal kingdom and the world of jinn so would any of them say by their logic I can live in the world of jinn or communicate with the jinn and serve them and get being served by them definitely this is not the right understanding his second question is can I say a ceremony who Marat allahi ta'ala wa barakato there's nothing wrong in that Tejada is a description of a large ocean so by saying it there's no problem in that insha'Allah his third question was some people say listening to music is not Haram unless you are enjoying it so unless you're tapping on the steering wheel while driving or you're beating with your foot when you're listening to music or you're dancing and enjoying it this is Haram but if you listen to Beethoven while having dinner then this is okay Subhan Allah who said it's okay because you're not being influenced to it okay then why not have during having dinner a glass of red wine 1986 for example a good year why not I'm not gonna get intoxicated I'm just gonna drink a little bit said oh no wine is Haram why irrespective it's Haram and likewise music irrespective whether it touches your heart it makes you this or that it is totally prohibited and giving such a certification it's playing around with Islam something that is Hallam's Haram end of story don't give justifications to it that are not mentioned in the Quran and the Sunna Zayin a Deen from the UK to LA to see you talk to you the pleasure is all mine my friend and I have been trying my best to lend the Pilatus food not as much as possible but I have a question regarding my father you see my father I mean I'm a Somalian but I'm a small in background and you know how to Moni father's oh but my mom I'm sorry my my father I've tried to tell I don't cause any problem of the whole but every single time my father always insult to me is always reaching me he's always not being polite to me he's always happy to shout at me so my question is how can I make draw against him and I have a better question and that is is it permissible for me to accept in this commune come up to me please come aside about the Hadees or next so I can clarify it to my like my uncle because I know it's referring to and I know it's referring to Iraq and you know but they just won't listen okay is that come ahead zina Dean and may allah azza wajal make you steadfast on Islam may allah azzawajal make you among the knowledgeable scholars of Islam and may allah azzawajal grant you the best of character of moral conduct of the highest levels of ethics because this is the biggest test that you're facing at the moment first of all you are from a Somali origin so jumbo jumbo kuriboh and the best of luck saying that your father and you know how fathers are of Somalian origin no I don't I know a lot of Somalians a lot of Koreans who are dear brothers to me and they're excellent parents so this we cannot paint the whole picture with the same brush definitely this is unfair thirdly if your father is abusive rude not caring and at some times offensive and aggressive there are a number of ways to approach this one best way is to sit back and look at the way you treat your father and believe me my friend in a great number of cases a great deal of it you will find that it's your fault your father is up here and you are down here you cannot deal with your father as you deal with your colleague or mates at school he's your father so Alma tells us in the Quran to respect them to obey them to be dutiful to them not to look to them straight in the eye to always show them humility and you will find that you're not doing this maybe because of the hormones that are now spreading in your body you feel that it's a one alpha male I have to prove myself yourself to whom to your father to stand in his face to reply back to him this is the easiest and the fastest way to hellfire the Prophet Isis I'm said to one of his companions the father is the middle gate of Jenna you keep this gate or wasted it's up to you it depends on how you treat your father hence how you'd enter Jannah so it is extremely important for you to know who your father is and to try to rectify the wrong things in dealing with him so that you don't go to hell now this is difficult but this is your test from Allah if your father was a sweetheart caring loving giving you money doing all what he can do to please you go out of his way trying to satisfy you what's the test in being kind and good to him even a kafir would be good and kind to him this is normal but the test is when he is as you had described so what to do first rectify your own shortcomings secondly try your level best not to argue with him not to defend yourself always whatever he says and complains say yes father you're right father I apologize that's it don't try to justify your actions well I meant this I meant that no you misunderstood me let's listen to my mom's side of story mom did I say the truth or not listen to my siblings you bring witnesses you bring evidences are you taking your father to court then how would how would you elevate yourself to be among the people of Jannah if you're unable to lower your wing in humility to your father as mentioned in chapter 17 Surat al Islam this is something you have to bear in mind now as for your question about your uncle stating that Nejd where the Horn of shaitaan is and that this is the devil's homeland meaning that Saudi Arabia we've explained this so many times and I think you've seen my videos and my explanations over that and you can find it easy insha'Allah on the Internet and it goes without dispute among the early scholars of Islam so you go back to the early scholars of Islam when there was no Saudi Arabia to prove to you that gnashed in the hadith of the Prophet a system where all the calamities and tribulations and fitton came from would be rear up and Iran till date so there's no way in comparing these two places with actual nudge that we have which refers to the central area of Saudi Arabia and a large surgeon knows best use of from Algiers Salaam alaikum Salaam to allocate oh how are you doing here I'm finalizing of hey what's gonna do for you I have one question about advent of tire oxygen why what I won't know of fire oxygen okay there are two others in this fire ok good main reason ok thank you thank you a brother Yousef I think is asking about the to advance of Federer and why do we have to advance well this is how it was at the time of the Prophet Isis Salam all the years that the prophet a son lived in Medina they had to advance the first Adan was done by Bilal the more advent of the prophetess of Salaam and the Prophet said to the people when Bilal gives the Adhan this should not stop you from eating and drinking this is just a reminder so that those who are praying to Hatchett know that fire is approaching so they can they wrap up and pray with her and those were asleep would be able to wake up and it say the pre-dawn meal in preparation but when the Adhan of naomi Maktoum is called this is the adhan of Fechter so these are two events until today and Allah in Mecca and Medina it's still been practiced there is the first event which is just a reminder and in this event by the way we don't say Isola - hi remain unknown twice we call the normal event which means that it is a reminder but the van of the actual break of dawn where you can pray and when you must stop eating and drinking this is the event where we say Isola - hi Roman and know me twice and I hope this answers your question Ayesha from Saudi hello assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh why are they equal misil Emma was not a la jolla cattle I have two questions yeah Kushina what is the ruling on watching beneficial videos that contains background music beneficial videos in the sense that not religious but we give up technology environment quality and cookery shows etc and my second question is sending my kids to Islamic school when my husband is equipped with that and I have tried my always to convince him and am i thankful in sending my kids to Indian School so the question is about Indian schools and sending your kids to it okay I will answer you in Charla so is first question there are videos that have beneficial benefits in it these videos are beneficial and they can talk about self motivation about management about worldly sciences that the have value in them not only that there are some religious clips and videos of some of the brothers who are supposed to be Diaries though they claim they're not at dice but it is filled with music in the background so what's the ruling on watching such things the answer is it's Haram especially these so-called religious or motivational videos that a man comes and tells you about their own practices here or there but it has music in the background sometimes equivalent to his own voice this is Haram and such a person should not be actually put forward as a role model when he is sinning openly he says it's an issue of dispute this is none of my business we have Quran and Sunna go to the scholars and get me the fatwa that says it's an issue of dispute as for the other types of motivational videos self training management etc you can find duplicates replacements may be better without any background music and at the end of the day when it comes to the scale of good deeds and bad deeds on the day of judgment would this be in your good deeds no it is not of the prerequisites to enter Jannah Allah did not order you to listen to such videos or to learn such Sciences yet you did and you'll learn listened to music alongside to it so this is a sin that definitely would weigh in your bad deeds scale so I would say that you should not do that at all her second question is she's in dispute with her husband over taking their children to an Indian school and we know that an Indian School is not an Islamic school it would have praising their Constitution and their motherland and so many Shaikh in it and wrong practices alongside that it is mixed so she tried her level best but her husband is defined and insisting you cannot do anything else it is his call it is his responsibility and he will have to answer on the day of judgment for such a choice because as his children grow and adopt such wrong practices and ideologies and thoughts and behaviors it's all gonna pour down into his bad deeds scale and he would be shocked on the day of judgment of the amount of sins that he managed to gather upon himself upon himself without knowing that and may allah azzawajal protect us all from such evil and wrong decisions take your children they are your capital there are your investment take them to Islamic schools or at least to schools that do not practice Haram and if not give them homeschooling rather than putting them at such an early age in a place where there will be brainwashed and adopting customs that would be next to impossible to extract these practices and thoughts in the future I pray to Allah soldier that he grants all of us a good upbringing and an Islamic environment hada Allahu Alem when it's betrayal merely he Aslam allahu wa sallim wa barik ala nabiyyina muhammad wa ala aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in was seller Malik I have to like you a lot"
