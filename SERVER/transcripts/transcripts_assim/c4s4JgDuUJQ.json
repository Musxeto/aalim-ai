  "transcript": "gelareh hand over him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa Barozzi rahmatan lil hara me nabina muhammad in water early he was happy he Jemaine and Movado dear brothers sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato this is our 52nd episode of us all teaching their islamic shop and book on truck and we spoke about marriage we spoke about divorce we spoke about Haller who spoke about the waiting period all of these usually in the books of luck come together they collected and they put it one after the other and one of the things that are related to marital issues is the chapter that deals with breast feeding or suckling and one would argue and say why would we mention or need these things why don't we include them in the books that deals that deal with food and drinks because this would be more appropriate well the scholars include suckling or breastfeeding in the chapters related to marriage and the likes because through suckling we get what becomes an issue in the future in regards of a person being mhmm so by default a woman gives birth to a child this boy automatically whether breastfed or not whether suckled or not he becomes amount to his mom he becomes a man to his maternal and paternal aunt he becomes a matter of mahon to his sisters he becomes Mahon to his nieces he becomes muharram to his grandmother's etc just by being born now the similar way of prohibition the similar way of process of becoming a maja takes place whenever a child is suckled so this suckling effects marriages and it prohibits a person from marrying certain persons and it permits them to be alone in seclusion and to deal as a muharram with those who were involved as we will come to discuss insha'Allah so it's very important to understand and know this concept in Islam this issue of suckling and what comes afterwards was mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah and it's the consensus of scholars of Islam Allah says in the Quran your mothers who have given suckle to you you're suckling sisters and this is part of ayah number 23 in Surat Annisa chapter 4 where Allah says in the beginning of the same limit alaikum it has been made prohibited for you your mothers your daughter's your sisters your aunts etcetera it goes on mentioning the list of prohibited women for men who are considered to be their mom so is my neighbor's wife my maja know why I can't marry her because she's married yes but once she's divorced you can marry her when she's widowed you can marry her so she's not your Muharram your Muharram is someone who is forever not possible for you to get married to such as your mother your sister your daughter your grandmother your knees your aunts and so on so here Allah says your mother's among those who are prohibited for you who have given suckled to you ok this is understood the woman that circled me is a Muharram to me your suckling sisters and also the sisters that were born to that woman or who suckled with me from the same woman they will become Mahad to me as well and the Prophet said Alice selasa in an authentic hadith breastfeeding prohibits marriages just as birth prohibits the human arriba Muhammad Nasir so through birth through your lineage through your bloodline who's my heart to you my mom who gave birth to me so likewise the woman who circled you is now your mother okay also my sister who's born to my mother or she's a half a sister we share the same father but different mothers or we are siblings have the same father in the same mother okay that's good so also any daughter of the woman who gave birth who who suckled you any girl who is the daughter of the woman who suckled you is considered to be your sister so anything that is considered to be prohibited through birth or lineage or bloodline it's the same thing with suckling and now also the consensus of scholars dictate and state that now people would usually ask and say what are the conditions because scholars differ first of all second of all we heard some strange things about adult men becoming muharram through suckling so can you summarize this much that's pretty easy there are two conditions for a child to become the son of the woman who has suckled him and these conditions are very straightforward number one the breastfeeding must take place before the child completes two years of age calculated by the lunar months and not by the Gregorian months because there's a twenty days difference the lunar or Hijri calendar is ten days shorter than the Gregorian calendar and everything in Islam and I mean everything is calculated by the lunar or the Hijri calendar Muslims do not and I repeat Muslims do not use the Gregorian calendar in matters related to their religion never I often get questions from sisters saying that my is the cat is due in August and I said whoa this can't be we don't have such calculation for the cat it has to be through the lunar months because if you calculated every August for example after three years you'll be one month overdue because every every year there's there is a difference of 10 days and this is not fair so in terms of religious practice we only refer to the Hijri calendar in day to day like when you're traveling when as the conference going to be held etc you may use the Google Calendar due to the fact that most people are ignorant of their Islamic heritage and their religious beliefs so they don't understand if you tell them well it is in the header the twelfth of the pigeons what is that but if you say to them is on the fifth of July or something like that visit ok now you're talking and this is shameful unfortunately but anyhow this is not our topic so the first condition for suckling is that this should be while the child being suckled is less than two years of age calculated by the lunar calendar Allah says in the Quran mothers may breastfeed their children for two whole years that is for those who wish to complete the suckling surah al-baqarah verse 233 and also Allah says and his weaning takes place within two years chapter 31 verse 14 and o sedima may Allah be pleased with her the wife of the Prophet has a son said that the Prophet said no breastfeeding causes prohibition of marriage unless it is on the breast reaches the bowels and is before weaning reaching the bowels mean that it has an impact on the growth of the child and it is before weaning meaning before the completion of two years and this is what called some scholars to say that suckling must feed and nourish the child stopping its hunger and helping its growth and here we come to another issue of dispute among scholars so if the child stopped weaning or if this child stopped suckling when he was a year and six months for example and started eating solid foods and not at all suckling from his mom and a month later or two while he was still beyond or below two years of age my brother gets the baby girl and because we live close to one another we don't want to have this issue in 15 years time of separating the kids and they can't play together because they're not Mahon etc so my wife suggests that my sister-in-law breast feeds my son who's eating solids he's a year and 10 months now old still an infant below 2 years of age so if she does that if she circles him would he become her son or not an issue of dispute some say that because he passed his weaning time and now he doesn't suckle anymore this doesn't work because the milk would not nourish him would not build his bones would not feed his hunger he's used to solids other scholars say that as long as the duration was mentioned by the prophet our son and also before that in the Quran then two years is two years and this seems to be the most authentic opinion of all so even if this child eats solid foods as long as he's below 2 years of age then the suckling can be implemented so this is condition number one what is the second condition the second condition is that the suckling has to be five meals or five sucklings so this is also a room of great dispute among scholars so some scholars say listen if the child circles little or a lot this is sufficient because this is what the Quran speaks about it speaks about breastfeeding in general so why would we put a limit or a specific amount for that no the child circles once is enough the second opinion is that only when a child has had five separate feeds and we will come to talk about that separate meals another opinion is that three feeds is sufficient and this was narrated by abu huraira may allah be pleased with him so which opinion should we follow well the most authentic hadith in this regard is the hadith of mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her and others where she said that the Prophet Allah thoughts have said five sucklings that fill meaning that prevents hunger suffice so the scholars came back again and said okay what counts as suckling if a child takes his mother's breast and sucks once and then he leaves it would this be considered to be a meal because in Islam we have the word Allah from suckling Radha rhymes with Raja which is meal so some scholar said okay the five sucklings that the Prophet was talking about herself were referring to a meal so when the child is hungry takes his Muslim mother's breast and circles and circles and circles until he's had enough and leaves it because he's full even if you try to force the child to drink more he would not take any more this is considered to be one meal one suckling other scholar said no if the child picks the breast and suckles it and then leaves it whether to breathe or whether to shift to another breast he does this without anyone forcing him to do it in this case this does the job and this is considered to be suckling so by this second definition some scholars say that even if a child does this five times in a row this counts as suckling so if a child takes his mother's breasts chuckles for half a minute leaves it breathes play around then goes back again and suckles again that's a second then he leaves it and goes back a third time so he could accomplish five sucklings in one sitting so some scholars say yeah this is possible shareable enamine may Allah have mercy on his soul he says that the safest is that we do not consider this except a one suckling because it took place in one sitting and if you want we cannot simply say that oh this child is my aunt to all of the women in the family of that mother who suckled him unless we have ample proof and evidence that would be considered beyond doubt and this is doubtful scholars have different in this regards so the best is that we give a child a suckling pear sitting so he picks the branch the drinks from it and when he leaves it on his own this is considered one so in the afternoon later on in the evening he does this process again this is a second one but not to have it in the same sitting in half an hour and consider this to be accomplished so it's not three sucklings is not a single suckling it is five that would fill and considered to be a meal for the child and by the way in the beginning this was part of the Quran as mother aisha said in the beginning the ruling was ten sucklings would make the child prohibited for his mother and that was revealed in the Quran then it was abrogated into five sucklings and that was also abrogated in the quran recitation' wise but the ruling remains one says whoa what is abrogation well abrogation is uplifting either the text or the ruling or both so uplifting the text while the ruling remains this is given an example by stoning stoning for adultery and adulteresses was mentioned in the Quran then it was abrogated we don't recite it anymore but the ruling remains likewise ten sucklings was mentioned in the Quran we do not find it anymore we don't recite it anymore because it was abrogated and that of the famous hadith if man had a valley of gold he would have asked for a second and if he had two valleys of gold he would ask for third this was part of the Quran and it was abrogated as per the authentic hadith why would Allah abrogate such a verse or such a ruling his 'unless words Allah says in the Quran man and sermon is in all known seha not even min ha Oh mija Adam Chalam and Allah Allah kulla shay'in qadir whatever we abrogate from the verses of the Quran or we make them to be forgotten we will substitute it with something that is similar or better so this is for a large soldier as for the obligation of the ruling while the ayahs remain there are plenty for example or you who believe do not approach prayer while you are in the state of intoxication so that you would be aware of what you say we all know that this is a verse of the Quran but the ruling is not applicable because it was abrogated when Allah made intoxicants prohibited from so likewise the ayah in surah 2 mu J Dilla or you who believe whenever you want to speak secretly to the Prophet Allah salam you should offer a charity it energy to resolve the mumbai net energy welcome salaka this as Ali says may Allah be pleased with him I was the only one who applied this verse because the Companions used to overwhelm the Prophet is solution with the questions so Allah wanted to make it easy for him and he mandated that whoever wants to speak to the Prophet must first give charity so a lot of the Companions hesitated because this was too expensive for them they couldn't afford it I said I wanted to speak to the Prophet once and I had a drink so I gave it in charity and I spoke to him and then the ayah was gated and nobody was obliged to give the sadaqa before speaking to the Prophet as a son so this is abrogation of the ruling while the recitation remains and the third category which is the hadith we have at hand that says that tanin sucklings used to prohibit this was abrogated from the recitation of the Quran and also from the ruling in Sharia so it's not required to be 10 anymore five would do analyze the original knows best now it has to be known that we have an issue called Lebanon fan and what is meant by Lebanon file when a woman breast feeds a stranger child how did she get the milk in her breasts to feed that child how was this possible scholars say that this was possible because of her getting married to her husband so it was the husband originally who made this possible because generally speaking girls don't have milk in their breasts the milk in the breasts only come to reality when they get married and they get pregnant so the cause the reason of this milk is the man and this is why they consider that when she breastfeeds a child automatically the father of the child who's suckling will become her husband which means that if the conditions are fulfilled five sucklings within the two years of his birth the woman becomes his mother her husband becomes his father their children whether combined or separate meaning if the man had another wife and he had children from the second or third wife these children would be his brother wanna see chef but it was the woman who suckled said yes but the milk belongs to the man who caused this so his children from another wife are his brothers because they share the same father and his sisters are his aunts his mother is his grandmother and the same is with the women who suckled him all of her relatives who are Muharram to her biological children will also become Muharram to her suckled child how is this confirmed so we know that usually we need two male witnesses to testify so that their testimony would be accepted but in the case of suckling mother this is done privately and women don't do this in front of men so the hadith supports that one woman's testimony would be sufficient and about even inherit may Allah be pleased with her with him said that he had married a woman and after they were married for some time an old slave woman saw them and she said I remember that I suckled both of you when you were infants and Abba was out of his mind so he rushed to the Prophet as a samisen Oh prophet of Allah this old crazy woman says that she suckled me and my wife so the Prophet said Isis am leave your wife Abba begged the Prophet and urge them or practice of Allah she's my wife and this is only one single woman so the Prophet said Allah so Sam how could you continue with this marriage when this has been said leave her which indicates the importance of being careful when suckling others in many joint families in many normal families cousins in-laws they got get married together they all conceived together they give birth together and because they are so close to one another they don't want to separate the family so they want B suckling to be implemented so they all become a one big family this is permissible but it has to be either documented or witnesses should testify so that no ambiguity may arise in the future besides I have this in my family a lot so I have a lot of children of suckling and in one case or the other I feel that it wasn't a good decision because that boy that we suckled and who has become my son would have been probably a good candidate to one of my daughters but now he's her brother this is done and over with so sometimes it's not why's to do that but it's an option that is always there and will always continue to be there for a family to adopt and to take it this option is extremely valuable in the case of Islamic adoption as we know we don't have adoption in Islam meaning that the child that I take take in my custody he doesn't carry my name he doesn't inherit me and he doesn't become Muharram to my moms but Islamic caught uncaught adoption is when my wife and I can't conceive and we love one another I don't feel like marrying someone else and she doesn't want to file for divorce so we reached an agreement to adopt Islamically a child to take a child and sponsor and support that child we go to an orphanage and we see this beautiful young girl or beautiful young boy we bring them in they have their own ID cards family name and everybody knows that this child is not ours we're just providing for it the problem comes up when the child is like in his teens 15 17 years of age if she's a girl I'm not her mom yes I took her in I provided for her I changed her diapers when she was young etc but I'm not her biological father and I'm not related to her so she has to wear the hijab in front of me when she's 10 years of age or maybe younger older and if it is a boy the same thing happens with my wife he's not her mom so this causes a lot of hardship to avoid this we tell the people to adopt children that are beyond or below two years of age and to suckle them five times five good meals so that they become Mahad to them so if it is a baby girl I asked my sister to breastfeed her so that I would become her uncle mom and for my wife she's the same gender no problem I asked my niece to breastfeed her so I become her grandfather or like if this is not possible then I will go to the doctor and ask for medication that would make my wife's breasts full of milk and she can suckle so some sort of hormonal medication that women get and this happens also and can happen and this is the most authentic opinion among scholars if a woman is single someone who's 40 years of age still a virgin did not get married wasn't successful in getting married and she says I don't want to spend the rest of my life alone I'd like to adopt so say okay you can take a boy or a girl she says I don't have anyone to suckle it no relatives nothing so in this case you can go to the doctor he gives you medication and you can breastfeed the child and there will come milk out of you and this is totally legit and Haddad insha'Allah the same thing goes with the wife if she doesn't want to go for medication she looks for her sister for her knees for someone related to her so that after suckling the child the boy would become Muharram to her and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best so we will stop here inshallah and it is time for your questions and we have a number of them still pending since last time so so Heda Sulaiman says what is the ruling if a man says three taluk in one sitting please clarify thank you we've covered this when we talked about divorce and we said that this is an innovated divorce because Allah says that all you prophet of Allah when you divorce women divorce them for their Rida and calculated so it's an innovation to divorce a woman when she's in her menses it's an innovation to divorce a woman when she's pure but a person had sexual intercourse with her during her purity and it's an innovation to divorce more than once some of the husbands are more of an ak-47 you know the Kalashnikov machine gun when he's angry he gives fast rounds of divorce talaq talaq talaq talaq talaq I divorce you I divorce you I divorce you you are divorced 25 times and five times a bonus from my side so these are 30 divorces and after five minutes he comes knocking on my door calling me sending me text messages and emails share I did this and this what to do so this is an innovation does it take place or not the hadith of the companion Omar may Allah the peace with him he said that people had a lot of Liberty and room at the time of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam divorced in three times in one sitting was considered one at the times of Abu Bakr divorce the divorce in three times in one sitting was considered to be one and at the beginning of the reign of Rama it was the same until he saw that the people are taking liberty and divorcing three times ten times a hundred times in what setting so as a form of pre pre manding them and punishing them he made it go through and he warned the people anyone that comes to me who has divorced his wife thrice in one sitting this would be considered as price and the Muslims carried on with this for a while until this issue surfaced and there was a need to address this so the Salafi scholars those who abide by the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favourite generations of the Companions intervene tablet having looked at this issue and said okay if the Prophet has some anaerobic er ruled that three once the thing is one and it's much easier to rule with this because people knocking on my door they're breaking the door sure if we have six children and I was so mad that was so enraged she insulted me she said that you're a man you can divorce me you don't have half what my brother-in-law has she kept on insulting me I was blinded by rage so I said you divorce you divorce you divorce and I didn't intended chair I just wanted I don't know what happened in this case the mufti not the judge the Mufti has the right to give fatwa in accordance to what his knowledge states to him my knowledge states that the Prophet ruled it as one and I saw to Salaam I will follow suit now other Muftis say no because the Roma may Allah be pleased with him is one of the rightly guided caliphs and he took a decision and the Companions agreed upon it so this is considered the right position to take this is why we have an issue of dispute especially in courts Saudi courts if you go to them and if you tell them about divorcing and menses or when she was pure but had intercourse prior previously etc they would not even listen to you they will implemented three divorces if you go to Pakistan blind followers of hanafi madhhab anywhere they would say three divorces and once the thing is counted as three and this is the right because they're following a rightly guided Khalifa now you don't like this because you are in the situation your feet are in the mud and you want to get out of this divorce that's why I don't like it so it's an issue of dispute and people should go to their court in their country to ask about the ruling if they are not living in their country and they contact a scholar for a fatwa then they have to be careful because yesterday for example it was quarter to twelve fifteen minutes before midnight a man knocks on my door I'm not gonna open the door it's too late man it's already past my bedtime so I speak to him and he says I I need to speak to you I said if I come tomorrow so no this is urgent I divorced my wife said tough luck come tomorrow did not share please I beg you I need an answer I said here's my mobile give me a call so the guy calls me 10 seconds later and explains to me that he divorced his wife a month ago and he wants to reconcile with her but she says I need a paper from a trusted Mufti so where's your wife he says in Yemen where is her family in Yemen where was the marriage conducted in Yemen and you come all the way to me for a fat one I can't give you fatwa no one can give you a written factory in Saudi Arabia because we have to see the marriage contract we have to make sure that you haven't divorced her twice before because the man says this is my first divorce so you can give him a fatwa when he's lying and that was his third divorce thirdly we have to hear what had happened from her husband from her from him and from his wife as well because the wife might say no no no sure it is not like what he said what happened was listen listen this so this is not possible that the mufti can give you effect were based on what you say without verifying with your wife and knowing the circumstances in some times in some cases like for example if I get a question from the Islamic website like we do at the end of it each session and they say that share what's the ruling on like so hey it's question what's the ruling on a man says three table can one sitting I'm giving you the answer I'm not giving in a fatwa this is the general answer you can't take it and said okay I said this to my wife so alhamdulillah I'm free this is considered one divorce no you're not a Mufti but I'm giving you the general rule as part of the guidelines set as knowledge based not to be implemented as a fatwa allah as allah knows best my mother pretty says whoever suffers from depression is he the follower of Shaitaan of the devil no this is too extreme depression has forms there is a very mild level of depression that everybody suffers from so if I have a car accident I'm depressed but this expression would probably last for half an hour and then alhamdulillah I'm back when yeah oops son peace be upon him and upon his son was abducted by his own siblings and thrown in a well and he lost Youssef he was depressed when they took his brother to Egypt to get some food and then Youssef took his own brother in custody what when they did not know who he really was when they went back to their father and told him listen we tried our level best but the King simply took our brother because her brother stole from the king he got more depressed to the extent that he lost his eyesight he became blind would anyone in his normal mind say that Jakub is a follower of Shaitaan because of his depression Allah is this depression everlasting no this is a phase that people get the Prophet Elisha saw our prophet used to be saddened when he calls people to Islam they reject him and they accuse him of lying and being a poet or a magician or the likes and Allah says to him are you about to kill yourself because of their disbelief don't harm yourself unless telling him this in the Quran which shows you that this form of depression is not the type of depression that people take prozac for or go to shrinks to speak about no this is a phase like happiness like sadness like grief that comes and goes and the duration of it is dependent on a person's trust dependence and reliance on a large solution sometimes it is a medical condition that requires medication the vast majority of cases are not lot like this they're mild or medium that can be talked out of it if you sit with someone who's wise and positive and gives you positive words you would feel much better this is why we sit with our parents with sit with our elders who inject positivity in us but if you sit with someone who would depress you more and more then you have a big problem and allah azzawajal knows best if as well Huck says I have a question with the markets and the mosques opening in my country is it mandatory now to attend John or should I still stay home well the answer we have answered this so many times and said that if you're healthy and if you do not complain of anything and you take the necessary precautions and you use the PPE the personal protection equipment masks sanitizers your own Sajjad that your own prayer mat and you go and pray with the Muslims this is what you're supposed to do we need to trust Allah as ocean we need to have confidence in Allah soldier but if you are ill feeling to infect others you must not go if you are chronically ill yourself with very weak immune system and doctors all say that listen you could easily get infected and it's not a probability it's a reality then don't go analyzer than those best Rami Yousef says what is the HUS what if the husband refuses to accept the money and continues living with the wife even if the wife is not happy we spoke about this and said that between the couples the spouses they have to live together and they cannot be separated unless the husband divorces or the wife buys her way out through color giving the dowry and if these two are not possible the husband doesn't want to divorce the woman offers the compensation and returns the dowry and the man is still defined does not want to award her color the third possibility would be that the woman goes to the muslim court or to the authorized islamic center in the region complains to the imam looks into their case and if he sees that she has the right to return the dowry and she doesn't want to live with the man what's so strange about that in this case the authorized imam would issue a separation order where he dissolves and breaks the marriage bond and she becomes free to leave him or Nemo whatever he says thanks so much share for this topic but I'm extremely confused right now I know that islamically there are lie laid upon or laid down rules to follow if one wants to get divorced how is one just jokingly saying by mouth that I'm divorced you overrule all these laid down procedures it does not overrule these procedures however your concern seems to be how is it possible that an irresponsible word makes the divorce valid we have said this so many times that whatever comes out of your mouth you're held accountable for it so if you were to say la ilaha illa-llah this takes you into Islam or the moment you say ashhadu an la ilaha illa-llah that's it that's the meaning of faith ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh if you say another word that's blasphemous or mocking of a lot of jell-o the Quran or the Prophet SSM or Islam rules it takes you out of Islam to get your daughter married you say I give you my daughter in manager to accept marrying a woman you say I accept marry her so divorce is similar to all of that it's the word that comes out of your mouth if it is said jokingly or seriously it takes place due to the fact that people's lives are not a game to play with now imagine we have let's say 500 million couples in the Muslim world every day a man says to his wife you divorced in the afternoon when he comes back from offices I was joking so this woman is in a roller coaster in my divorce am I married and every divorce that takes place a man can retract that and say a couple of weeks later down the line our guys I was joking I was a serious so through this we would never have divorce between always remain a game men use manipulate the lives of their wives and Islam does not allow this if you say I give you my daughter in marriage jokingly and he says I accept the marriage takes place if you say I divorce you jokingly the divorce takes place if a divorced couple in their waiting period and the man says I reconciled with you I revoked the matter that the divorce the reconciliation takes places no she thought I was joking no one divorce down two to go she's your wife continue living with her but she I divorced her last week I don't want to continue why did you reconcile I was joking well this job doesn't count it's taken seriously that's why Allah says in surah al-baqarah well at the Teredo ayat Allah he whose wha when he spoke about divorce he said do not take Allah signs others versus a mocking and ridiculing them so using divorce is mocking at a Duke ridiculing a lot vs. and Elijah knows best Jeffrey Samar says a woman who does not cook or clean for her husband saying it is the Sharia or the Shia so is it true this is an issue of the street among scholars some say that marriage is not made for a woman to serve her husband and children rather it is only made for him to enjoy her and to fulfill his desires the halal desires other scholars say no this is totally misunderstood a woman must obey her husband in whatever is considered to be bill Maroof whatever people are accustomed to and acknowledged to be the norm she has to obey Him and part of that norm is working in his house serving him and his children and they give examples one of them is the most famous which Fatima the daughter of the prophet Isis Iran may Allah be pleased with her was married to her cousin I'll even have a party and she used to grind the grains with her hand over two big stones grinders or what I don't know what they call them to make wheat and it affected her heart at her hands severely so highly said to her after what he had seen why don't you go to your father and ask for a slave to help you in the house chores so they went she went to the prophet and I thought so and we know the hadith where the Prophet said should I tell you what is better than a servant to say subhanAllah feet 33 times at hand Allah Allah about 33 times before you go to bed and complete the 100 by another thirty fourth allahu akbar and and this would be better for you than a servant scholar said if it was not her job to work at home he would have told her and why are you working why don't you ask your husband to bring you a slave or a servant or someone to help you it's not your job to work at the home the Prophet did not say that racism the Haditha was my bit Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with her another or the father where she used to walk long distances to bring food made of the seeds of dates to her husband's horse among other evidences so scholars say that this is the norm it's the man's job to work outside of the house and it's the woman's job to work inside the house and if a woman does not cook or clean for her husband and says that this is not part of my rule I don't have to do this the husband can react in a similar way which is definitely not recommended but just to logic with her by saying okay it's my rights not to take you out and it's my rights to stop you from entering anyone I don't like to my house so I'll keep you in isolation you are not to leave the house and no one from your family wood is to visit you it's not tells me to feed you so I will bring you one meal a day maybe some rice and half a chicken that's it for breakfast lunch and dinner you try to get over it as for the clothes I'll buy only one set of dresses throughout the whole year and I'm not obliged to take you out to restaurants or to travel with you on holiday or to say beautiful words to you this is not my obligation what kind of marriage would that be definitely this is not the marriage Muslims look up for or up to so when it comes to not knowing what your rights are and what your Breguet shion's are we end up having divorce at the end of the day there has to be discipline I do something you do something I take care of putting food on the table working out gaining money for the family and you take care of my home you clean you cook your iron and you give me a safe haven to go to after a long day of work and let us hope that things progress from there to have a good and happy marriage with the grace of Allah this is all the time we have until we meet next Thursday I leave you via Manila or salam alikum warahmatu allahi al kato"
