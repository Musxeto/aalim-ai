  "title": "Do I pray in the Masjid or Musalla if  Masjid is too far from my home? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so hell from malaysia says he is finding it difficult because there's a masjid which is about 15 minutes walk and there's a surao or a musa or a prayer hall which is couple of minutes far and he doesn't know where to pray the problem is that the musa itself sometimes there's no one in there and sometimes he'll find a person or two praying congregation so what's the ruling the ruling is if the distance between where you live and masjid is sufficient for the voice of a mu advent to rise on top of the masjid and calls the adhan without any loud speakers and there are no obstacles high risers buildings highways concrete buildings it's an open area if the voice can travel this distance then the prayer is mandatory 15 minutes means that it is about two kilometers maybe two to three kilometers depending how fast you're walking so if this is the case most likely that the prayer is not mandatory upon you because it's too far and hence you can pray in your room it's better to pray in the musa in the sarah and to call others to pray with you and allah knows [Music] best"
