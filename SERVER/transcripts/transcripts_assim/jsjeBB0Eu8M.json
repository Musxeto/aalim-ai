  "title": "Do women who wear the modern hijab fall under WOMEN who are CLOTHED YET NAKED? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mustafa from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. And you are? Mustafa. Yes sir. What can I do for you today? So sir, so Sheikh I wanted to actually ask about a hadith where the Prophet ï·º said that there are two people from hell who he's not seen yet and amongst them are women who wear clothes and and yet are naked. So my question was that, sorry I've actually read the explanation of this hadith from great scholars like Imam Nawawi and Sheikh Ibn Uthaymeen and it seems that, and correct me if I'm wrong, that women who you know wear the hijab but wear it in an improper way such that they're showing their neck or the ears or the tip of their hair just above their forehead that they're also included in this? No, no, no, no, no, no. They're not included in this. This is inappropriately wearing the hijab. The hadith refers to women who are dressed yet at the same time considered to be naked which means that it is one of two. Either she's wearing real tight clothes like leggings and a sports bra and the likes that may cover the outer skin but it shows the physique and the body curves and the bone structure of a woman. So this is she's dressed but she's actually naked. You can tell all her figures and her body curves. Or it refers to someone who is clothed but and it's oblique not tight yet it's see-through so you can see what's underneath. Though there is cloth on the outer side of it but you can see through what's underneath. This is what is meant by the hadith. Showing the earrings, showing some part of the hair, showing the cleavage or the neck and the likes. This is called tabaruj but it is not falling under the category of the hadith and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
