  "title": "Is there any reward in visiting his parents grave, How often should he visit? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the last had the question of tonight is from brother Han he says how often should a person visit his parents grave is this rewarding for the person who visits and what about a person who does not visit the grave of his parents at all is it rewarding the answer is yes it is a form of worship to visit the graves the Prophet said alehissalaam in an authentic hadith I used to prohibit you from visiting the graves now go and visit them because it reminds you of the ayah this means that the ruling in the beginning was prohibition then this ruling was abrogated and now it is permissible to go and it is recommended to go because it reminds you of the hereafter and whatever reminds you of the hereafter is a good form of worship so yes it is rewarding for you to go how often it is not mentioned but we know from what the scholars say that specifying Eid or Friday - visiting the graveyards is an innovation thinking and this is a custom here in where I live in Jeddah Saudi Arabia that some families select the day of rate in the morning to go and visit their loved ones in the grave this is an innovation it was not done by the Prophet Isilon and it wasn't done by the Companions so it should not be done on a regular basis how often this is up to you the sky's the limit but why is it that I go to my parents graves or to my loved ones graves it's not to benefit myself and in terms of duaa rather to benefit the deceased and to remind me of my destination we are so engaged in this world that we forget or seem to neglect that we are soon to die so if you ask me Shahar some when are you going to die said now I don't know maybe another 50 60 years no one says I don't know maybe I'm gonna die tonight maybe I'm gonna die now it's all in Allah's hands so putting this in front of you that my death is inevitable and it's going to happen soon I don't know how soon this makes you a better person a more positive person a person who is far away from sin always fulfilling his obligation so that he is ready he's always on standby so going to the cemetery is good for me to refresh my Eman but one should not consider this as a habit or attach it to certain festivals or celebrations or AIDS but what about if I don't visit my parents grave at all there's no sin at all in that there's no sin at all in that as long as you're making dua for them as long as you're seeking Allah's forgiveness for them and doing charity on their behalf then you are in the safe insha Allah"
