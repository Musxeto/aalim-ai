  "transcript": "the next question is when someone dies in The subcontinent B is delayed for some loved ones to come fromes is this allow if the delay is a day or two or so for a legitimate reason and there is no fear that the body would change I hope this is fine but I would never do it why because the prophet yeah okay let's let's be frank without any emotions I know most of you say this's my father I have to take the last look you haven't called your father in 6 months now you want to have the last look who you fooling oh he's my brother he's this he's that okay this is the dead person you love him yes what do you want I want to wait 3 4 days until I see him and then we bury him okay if this that person were to speak and we know that he's destined to Jenna would he say okay yeah no no no worries I'm not in a rush I have enough time take take your time 2 days 3 days I'll wait or he will say the hell with them I want to go to my Paradise I want to go to my Jenna what would he say so you are depriving him from going to Jenna from meeting whatever he wants to meet and whatever he had worked his whole life for just to see his face yeah he will send you a snapshot but what is this so my point of view is don't wait even one second the prophet saidat to honor a deceased is by hastening in burying it this is the honor because you want to get the man straight to his inshallah reward and favors and blessings from Allah and Allah Knows Best"
