  "title": "Must I advise everyone I see to grow their beards & wear pants above ankles? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "we know that forbidding evil is obligatory upon us but what about the sins that are widely spread like if i go to the masjid the masjid is filled with people with shaved beard and clothes below the ankle so should i just go up to each of them and if you go to each one of them in the masjid and start telling them to fear allah and grow their beards and lift their trousers above their ankles and you're not praying correctly you're doing this wrong what will the people think of yahnav okay i think is not with us but i this is a rhetorical question so you don't have to answer they would think that you're crazy and definitely darwa or calling people to islam is not done this way you cannot just be the religious police and go out and start hunting people and scolding people and admonishing people and telling them to do this and do and not to do that this is not enjoining a virtue and righteousness this is plain evil why because what will result from this is that people would reject your dawah and even worse they would associate your way with islam and some of them would say oh if islam is like this i don't want anything to do with that i would this is kufar so is this calling people with wisdom and insight no how to do it then first of all we have to segregate between the different evil acts that must be addressed on the spot so if i see someone doing something haram i have to give him an advice on the spot otherwise i'm not going to see him again so someone is flirting with a girl publicly or trying to harass her i have to forbid evil and say brother fear allah this is providing his muslim and we're a muslim country say brother this is haram what you're doing do you like this to happen to your sister or something like that but someone who is coming to the masjid who's clean shaven and i see him every single day to go without an introduction and say to him this is haram and this is mandatory to do and this is this and this is that that would not be advisable yes maybe i would plan to get acquainted with him give him salam the first couple of days check on him the the following other days maybe give him something to eat maybe share some perfume with him um comment on the khutba afterwards share some knowledge here and there until there is a relationship he's acquainted with me we're on on good terms then i may drop it politic diplomatically and politely to him and say that you're a brother and i have to give you advice this and this and this and the prophet said so and so and so yeah this is acceptable but not to throw the bomb at everyone you see and say that i have to enforce virtue and righteousness you"
