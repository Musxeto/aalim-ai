  "transcript": "[Questioner] From the Emirates um so I have\na question about a hadith that I read about the Prophet (Peace and Blessing Upon Him)\nrubbing like a water when he was doing ablution on a 'Imaama so can a woman when we used to\nhijab and go out we're going around and about just wipe over our headscarves instead of\nhaving to take it off and wipe over the hands or something okay so the question of I mean\nif I understood it correctly the Prophet (Peace and Blessing Upon Him) sometimes used to wipe over his turban Umaama\nor 'Imaama and whatever exposed from his head so he would wipe over his forelock and the\nrest of the turban and continue his Evolution his wudu so she's asking can women do the\nsame in wiping over their hijab it's an issue of dispute some say that due to necessity\nthis is permissible especially if we're talking about a public place where women are performing\nvoodoo and they don't want to jeopardize exposing their hair in front of others permissible because I when I want to perform\nmudum I cannot come and wipe over my headdress like this because this is not a turban okay\nyou're wearing it on your head yes but it's not a turban see a turban is a head gear that\nis turned around the head and then it goes underneath the chin and tied to the back removing\nsuch a turban is burdensome to put it back again this is why the concession of sharia\ncame to make it easy in the case of women who want to wipe over their hijab headscarf\njust because they're in public how would they wash their arms to the Elbow would they expose\nit in front of everybody else would they expose their faces in front of everybody else if\nthey're able to cover that then they can from underneath their hijab do the same with their\nwiping their head without jeopardizing or exposing their hijab and Allah knows back and have you ever taken a counseling session\nwith me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you\ncan afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this\nis for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're\npoor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me\nand let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will\nuh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for All"
