  "title": "Can his old parents put on Ihram attire for Nafl Tawaf or is this cheating",
  "transcript": "my parents are in makkah right now to perform host this year mashaallah they have already completed their umrah now they would like to fight for more nafld off currently the mata period is available for the umrah pilgrims only so if they want to perform novel top they have to do it on the first floor now my parents are above 60 and have pain in their legs they cannot walk for a long time in this case if my father puts on the two white garments of iran and go to mata to apart from naval tower will it be cheating why would he do this is it because he wants the authorities to think that he's wearing and they will allow him to do this yes so he can go to mata then yeah this is this is sort of cheating but it is legal cheating so we know that nafl tawaf is not mandatory and ichram is not one of its condition i can perform naval tawaf wearing this attire but if a person says i would like to wear my two towels the white towels as if i am a mushroom but i am not in the state of iran i just want to pretend that i am in the state of akram so that they would allow me in there is no problem in doing that insha allah i would not do it why because i'd rather go and pray rather than offer this tawaf which i know that may burden other worshipers because it's a limited area and lots of people are coming for umrah or for hajj i don't want to add to the burden and to the crowd so instead alhamdulillah did my umrah i will do my hajj later on i can do that and if i don't do it there's nothing wrong in skipping it altogether you can go and pray nephil and voluntary prayers as much as you wish and allah azza knows best you"
