  "transcript": "Abdullah from the states um I have a confusion about one of the six periods of women uh about scripture so we know every Prophet received Revelation but does that mean that all of them like roll it down or were some of it only like verbally transmitted this is why it is one of the Articles the six articles of Iman to believe in Allah's scriptures our belief in such scriptures that they exist the details is not known to us like our belief in the article of Angels so we believe in the existence of angels how they look how many they are what are their duties specifically we cannot say except to what Allah azzawajal and his Messengers told us about so we know what jibril does we know what Mikhail does we know what Israel does etc but other than that we have no knowledge so when it comes to the prophets and Messengers how many a lot how many do we know a handful like 20 25 a little bit more a little bit less these are mentioned in the Quran so what is our belief regarding the others it can be a hundred two hundred or three hundred alanos we believe in them without without going to details so the scriptures are the same we believe that there were tablets given to Prophet Moses and they were written so what happened to them Allah knows we believe that the injil was revealed to Prophet Risa Jesus peace be upon him was it written was it memorized we have no knowledge of this but we believe in its holistic idea of it being there and it being revealed to these prophets and Messengers Knows Best foreign"
