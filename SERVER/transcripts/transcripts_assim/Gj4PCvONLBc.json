  "transcript": "I'd like to know um if for a layment if uh if he only follows one shik who is trustworthy will he be suris for every of his I for example I follow you because I trust you will I be Exempted from everything if I follow you if you follow someone who you trust in his knowledge in his moral conduct in his righteousness and piety believing that he would be your Imam and you as you've described you are a Layman who does not have the means and tools to differentiate between what's right and wrong between Quran and Sunnah between things that are accordance to the sunah or not if you follow such a person you will be saved on the day of judgment because Allah ordered you in the Quran twice to ask the people of knowledge of and when people don't know they need people of guidance to guide them so if you follow the right one whom you think and believe to the best of your ability that they are qualified to do this Allah would not hold you accountable in all things inshallah"
