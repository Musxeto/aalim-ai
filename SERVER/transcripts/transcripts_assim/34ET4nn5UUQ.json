  "transcript": "cd from germany um if a person is like um 27 to 30 minutes away from a masjid but he can resend five minutes with a car so does it become mandatory for him to pray in this message if he has a car so 27 minutes walk cd is it walking distance 27 yes okay so the obligation of attending the prayer in the masjid is dependent on the distance where a normal person would climb over a building and called a van without loud speakers saying so how far does his voice reach in normal conditions where are where there are no concrete buildings no cars no double glazed uh windows how far would his voice reach i don't know i used to say in the in in the past approximately two kilometers i don't know you need to practice this and see it 27 minutes means it's approximately two and a half to three kilometers distance and that is a lot of walking distance so if i were to say that the voice of the reaches you and the prayer is obliged upon me once i hear the adhan so imagine if i'm in a maghrib sitting in my home and i hear the adhan and i immediately walk to the masjid by the time i reached the masjid they would have prayed the maghreb and the sunnah and they went out home so 27 minutes to me i think this is too much and you're not obliged to pray there if you have a car you can do go there in five minutes it's not mandatory upon you but if you do definitely you are a winner and you will gain inshallah the reward you"
