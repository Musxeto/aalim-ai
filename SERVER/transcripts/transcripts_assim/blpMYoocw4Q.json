  "title": "The Prophet’s ‎ﷺ reprimand of Mu’adh ibn Jabal for prolonging Isha prayer assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "For that, the Prophet ﷺ also reprimanded Mu'adh Ibn Jabal, his great companion, when he used to prolong Isha prayer, which was difficult for the worshippers behind him. In an incident, he came to lead them in Isha, and he started reading with Surat Al-Baqarah. One of the companions had so many things to do, and so many errands, and that was taking too much time, so he completed Isha on his own and left to attend his things. People told Mu'adh, Mu'adh said that this guy is a hypocrite. Same people went to the guy and said to him, Mu'adh is accusing you of hypocrisy. He went to the Prophet and complained, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam. The Prophet was angry, and he admonished Mu'adh, Are you trying to repel people away from Islam, from prayers? When anyone of you leads prayer, he should acknowledge that behind him, there are those who are old, there are those who are sick, there are those who have errands to accomplish. So make it short and easy."
