  "transcript": "as for your questions before I answer them and elsewhere said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam clearly said whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it it is rejected it is void it is unaccepted and this is one of the pillars of our religion that Islam revolves around number one Deeds are judged by intention number two these Deeds have to be comply in compliance to the Sunnah of the prophet so these are pillars of Islam which means that when I judge something it has to be in accordance to the parameters of the Quran the Sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite Generations the of the sahaba companions otherwise it's an innovation it's something that is fabricated our Lord in the Quran said today I have completed your religion and completed my favor upon you and accepted Islam to be your religion Palace it's over whatever was completed you can't add anything to it you cannot take anything out of it if this is crystal clear to you and to all Muslims because this is Basics logical things you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure it out if this is clear to you and to the Muslims let's go to your questions where it says these guys after the salaam after the prayer of the congregation of Prayer they offer salutation upon the prophet Allah very good very nice salutation upon the prophet salallahu is highly recommended and desirable anytime nope what do you mean nope if I'm coming out of the toilet or if I'm entering the toilet I want to answer the call of nature I say Bismillah this is the Dua we all know this Muhammad or when I come out I say Muhammad no this is inappropriate he said why he said this is not something that the prophet taught us to say excellent did the prophet teach you to offer salutation upon the prophet after concluding the Salat no but it's a good thing a good thing in your head not in the religion of Islam and this is an innovation because you've come up with something that the prophet did not come up with so question number one did the prophet ever offer salutation upon himself after Salat no did it did the companions therefore rightly guided khalifas was it ever reported that they performed congregational salutation upon the prophet after the Salat no so with all due respect do you know more than them no but it's a good thing subhanallah a good thing and the prophet did not do it you're coming to me and saying that oh now I'm doing something the prophet didn't do he didn't know that it was a good thing that's why he didn't do it but I'm doing it this is gopher okay Imam in the Netherlands or in Germany or in the UK or the US they're doing this actually most of these imams are ignorant people they don't know or they are following deviant sex and cults these are immigrants who came running and fleeing their country for a good Social Security they're coming for money if you check a lot of them not all of course there are righteous and practicing Muslims among them but so many people that I get similar questions from are gold diggers they are buying homes in riba and mortgage they're free mixing I get sisters from Denmark and from Norway and from Sweden talking to me about imams telling them to come with them in the car to travel to different cities alone what is this and she says I don't know the Imam says it's okay these are not imams they're just there for the money yeah maybe they're Arabs maybe they're Turks maybe they're from here or there they know a few verses of the Quran and masha'allah they grow up here then they became mawlana and they became these are deviant people stay away from them"
