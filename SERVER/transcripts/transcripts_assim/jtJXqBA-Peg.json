  "transcript": "if the imam is doing wrong method of healthcare so can i do it correct one like he is making one salam and immediately doing two thousand hours so can i skip this one so this is too generic akbar um if he makes one salaam thinking that this is sufficient and you add another salam there's no problem but if he makes one sajdah then his prayer is invalid if you follow him in that so everybody has to say subhanallah subhanallah if he doesn't listen and he stands up to the following raqqa has to assume that the prayer is invalid and they continue themselves because he had left a pillar and such a pillar he has to either go back to it or you guys have to finish your prayer correctly by offering the second sajdah and continue to pray on your own and i hope this answers your question"
