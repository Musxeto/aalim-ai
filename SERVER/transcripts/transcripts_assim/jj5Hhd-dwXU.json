  "transcript": "so um I need advice about the way to go about my uh my cultural way of dealing with things so we we Muslims right but majority of the way we conduct our business is not in accordance with Islamic violence and what do I mean you know uh the cousins the cousins are considered like brothers so we mix feelings we are like just like our own blood brothers so when you try to when you know more about Islam and you you try to kind of like set boundaries with so many things it's just it's so hard with our cultures and by the time you know you find yourself trying to find those things you feel so isolated and you feel like you you it's just so weird what advice would you give someone like me and it's not just me so many other people that I know are going through the same thing Amina the issue is what is the use if all your relatives surrounded you loved you cared for you and respected you while Allah azzawajal is angry with you 've lost everything whoever finds Allah he has everything and then whoever loses Allah he has lost everything if everyone boycotts me does not speak to me isolates me but I'm doing this for the sake of Allah and Allah is with me I'm the happiest man on Earth the pro Allah described Ibrahim to be an um of his own the prophet Allah when he came with Islam and he called the people to Islam they boycotted him and his companions for three years in in a in a remote area of Mecca three years not allowing food or drink to come to them not allowing people to marry from them not allowing anyone to communicate with them did this make any difference not at all so you have to understand that as long as you are with Allah azzawajal and what you're doing is for the sake of Allah and you try to explain to the people that what do you want me to do this is the religion of Allah Allah the almighty told me that your female cousins are Nan mahram so you have to treat them as such my female cousin is like any woman walking on the street any random woman she's a stranger total stranger what rights do I have to go to this woman on the streets and say good evening how are you how are the kids how's the husband let's have lunch some day she's a total stranger and my cousin is even worse because of the relationship between us so remains steadfast always remember that this is the same route that the prophet Islam and the companions had walked through and if you are following their footsteps you will be inshallah with them on the day of judgment all what you can do is give dawah explain the religion show the people that this is not my way this is the way of Allah this is Sharia bring me proof from the Quran that this is permissible and I'll do it people always complain your beard is too long it's too thick give me reason to shave it give me an Evidence I'll shave it today live on air what like do you think I love having a beard this is what Allah mandated I love it but if I have a way out of it that Islamic and pleases Allah I'll do it on the spot so whatever we do we do it for the sake of Allah and whatever the people are doing they're doing it for the sake of Satan knowingly or unknowingly so don't care about what people do to you as they say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger so be steadfast on Islam as uh for the sake of Allah and you'll end up with good results with the grace of Allah"
