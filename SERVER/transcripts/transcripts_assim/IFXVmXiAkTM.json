  "title": "Is my friend a Kafir because he made a mistake in narrating a Hadith man or woman who gave water to",
  "transcript": "Okay, we have a question from the emails from Abdullah from Germany. He says, a friend narrated a hadith from the Prophet ﷺ that a man gave water to a thirsty dog and he went to paradise. Allah forgave him and took him to paradise. But also we know that there is a hadith about Abu Hurairah, may Allah be pleased with him, where he said that it was a prostitute who gave also water to a dog from a well and that Allah forgave her sins. Is this friend a kafir? Because narrating hadith with mistakes in it is kufr? What should he do? He has deep remorse and he fears that he may left Islam. First of all, I think he should be careful in the friends he selects, Abdullah, with all due respect, because you're definitely not a good friend. Why? Akhi, the guy did not do any kufr and you're making him feel upset, depressed, and you're making him feel that he committed kufr because you've stated that making such a mistake in a hadith is kufr. Who said so? Tell me, show me, who said that making a mistake in the hadith is kufr? No one. Did he make the mistake intentionally? It's not a mistake then, it's deliberate. Thirdly, fourthly, who's counting? I don't know. Akhi, there are two narrations of this hadith, both are sahih and authentic and 100% authentic. In one narration, it was a man who went to the well and brought water in the shoe and held it with his mouth until the thirsty dog drank from it and Allah thanked the man by forgiving his sins. In the same other hadith, it was a prostitute that went down and did the same for the dog. Now you can come and say, was it the same dog? Come on akhi, give me a break. These are two different narrations. Why would it have to be in the same country, the same city, the same era, the same month, the same date? These are two separate incidents which illustrates to us the mercy of Allah Azza wa Jal. But both hadiths are authentic. So there is no kufr from your friend, but definitely you jumping the gun is a very dangerous thing. And by the way, there are mistakes that are said that on the face of it is totally blasphemous, yet the Prophet ﷺ did not consider it to be even sinful. As per the hadith which is in the sahih, where the Prophet ﷺ said, Allah the Almighty is more joyful and happy when His servant repents to Him than the happiness and joy of a man who was in the desert travelling with his food and drinks on his camel and when he took a short nap, woke up to find his camel not there, it disappeared. He looked for it everywhere, but he was in the wilderness, he was in the desert. So when he thought that he was dead for sure, he took another nap only to wake up to find his camel next to him. He grabbed the camel's harness. And out of extreme joy and happiness he said, O Allah, You are my servant and I am your Lord. The Prophet ﷺ says he made the mistake out of happiness. Now such a mistake, did it take him out of the fold of Islam? Definitely not. Did the Prophet ﷺ say anything about it? Definitely not. Which means that the last verse of Surah Al-Baqarah, رَبَّنَا لَا تُؤَاخِذْنَا إِن نَسِيْنَا أَوْ أَخْطَأْنَا O our Lord, do not hold us accountable. If we were to forget or to make an error, Allah said, I shall do that. Allah will not hold us accountable. So I hope this answers your question. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
