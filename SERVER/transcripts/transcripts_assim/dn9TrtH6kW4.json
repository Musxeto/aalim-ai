  "title": "What is better, to Memorize Quran the Traditional Way or Memorizing with Tafsir while implementing?",
  "transcript": "my question is what's better for a person to memorize the quran the traditional way of going from mass to baccarat or that a person who memorizes it with the help of the steve while implementing it bearing in mind that while doing the traditional way he's going to finish within one one year or two years by probably doing it because he would take him long time so what's better it depends on hala upon where you find your heart in some folks find it easier and more more convenient for them to memorize the whole quran so once they start on their trip they do not rest until they finish it so they just say bismillah and they go ahead with memorizing the quran until they finish it in a year or two or three some folks find this sometimes a bit time-consuming not being able to comprehend what they have memorized and they would rather focus on the quality and saying no i'll take bits and pieces of the quran memorize it understand the meaning of it implement it in my life like the companions used to do they used to memorize 10 verses of the quran understand their meaning and that fear and implement it in their lives then they move on to the following ten so it depends on where you find your heart this is the most important thing not to force yourself quantity versus quality it depends where you find its best of interest to yourself not to others because what works for me may not work for you and allah knows best you"
