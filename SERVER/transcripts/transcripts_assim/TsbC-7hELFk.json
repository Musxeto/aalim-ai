  "title": "Calling kids Shaytan or little Angels? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh we have Nila on the line from Bangladesh uh she shaan is but here we use the word shaan for someone who is very naughty especially to a kid like he's very Shan or he does very shatani not only this some compare small kids to Angels like they Angels that's why Allah protected her nothing would happen to her she is an angel so I wanted to know if it is permissible or not because Angels humans and D are three different things for people to be called as Shan this is derogatory and sinful unless that person is a shatan so if we look at the um president of uh uh the occupied Palestine the the Jew Israeli Netanyahu we would say he's Shan there's no problem in that but to call Shan to Children this is not permissible is Satan and any animal or creature that goes beyond its limit we call that Shan and this is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam instructed us to kill any black dog with the two yellow dots above his eyes and he said that this is a Shan meaning that he's the most evil upon or among his uh uh species or or the likes to call a child an angel this is not recommended because angels are creatures of Allah asael and they're honored and they're close to Allah subhana wa taala nevertheless we know that in Surah yusf when he came out to the women who were sitting and they were so so shocked with his Beauty they cut their own hands with the knives they had for the fruit not noticing that they cut their hands and they said this is not a human being he's an honorable Angel because of his Beauty so it's not recommended it's okay to say at something that is beautiful that this is yeah something related to the angels but to call female children as Angels this is not permissible or to give the name of Malak to a female or a Malak this is Haram because this is what the idol worshippers did when they claimed that the angels of Allah are females so it is not permissible to call a female child jiel or israf or Mika however we can call a baby boy jiel or israfil or mik and Allah Knows Best"
