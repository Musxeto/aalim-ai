  "title": "Can we congratulate Christians & other disbelievers on their festivals & holidays? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the second question is that can we congratulate the Christians and other denominations with their feasts festivals holidays the answer is no this is not permissible because we believe that their religion is not authentic it is not true it is not accepted by Allah as a widget Allah Allah does not accept at the moment except Islam so by congratulating them on their false reads or festivals or holidays it's like endorsing it and saying to them Merry Christmas which means that I believe that Christ was born on the 25th of December and that he is the son of God because this is what you guys believe and this is totally inappropriate and not permissible so don't be rude but at the same time don't go out of your way and compromise your own faith and religion be kind to them but you have nothing to do with the festivals and their holidays and Allah knows best"
