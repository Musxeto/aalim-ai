  "title": "Why do Malikis put their hands by their sides when praying? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from uh uk says al-maliki followers when you go to morocco algiers maybe some places in nigeria or whatever they what they call saddle they don't put their right hand over the left on the chest they leave their hands to their sides so what's the point of that some scholars say that the followers of imam malik started doing this when he started praying like that why would imam malik imam darul hijrah pray like that when he knows that the sunnah of the prophet islam as in the hadith was to put the right over the left on the chest and this is the sunnah of all prophets why would the medic do this the reason was that at some time or period of history there was a disagreement between the muslim ruler and al-imam malik which happens throughout history with all scholars this happened with imam ahmad this happened with the mahmoud hanifah this happened with imamitamia who died in prison all great scholars are tested and usually if they don't kiss the backside or they don't polish shoes they will be thrown in jail this is the norm so there was this this agreement which imamic refused to compromise the religion which led the muslim ruler to flog him and beat him in prison that led an injury to his arm which prevented him from being able to lift it so he used to pray with his arms to his side some of his disciples and students apparently who were not very smart followed that way of prayer instead of going back to his books to his hadiths that he used to teach to learn how the prophet used to pray and they mimicked that and made it part of their religion or part of their school of thought which is totally bogus which is totally not true and ali my friend as a muslim we have to go back to the references quran and sunnah not to what tom dick and harry did with all due respect to them but allah ordered us to follow the quran and the sunnah and people differ people have their different preferences and understanding to things so we are not to get closer to allah by their understanding rather by the quran the sunnah with the understanding of the three favorite generations the companions tabarine and tablet tabby"
