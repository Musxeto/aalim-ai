  "transcript": "my question is regarding um so like so a child so a child who hasn't reached the age of puberty um he isn't accountable for his sins so um well what so does that mean he can like freely sin and he feel like let's say if a child like does commits murder would that mean like he wouldn't have any like legal punishment or anything like that the prophet sallallah alai wasallam said that there are three individuals whom the pen of accountability has been lifted one of them is a child until he reaches the age of puberty and Scholars say that this means that such a child if he gets involved in crimes or any other illegal activity he's not accountable on the Dave judgment for his actions because he's not accountable this does not exempt him any his parents from the consequences of his actions so if he breaks something or he kills someone he has to pay in compensation for what damages he had created and caused so yes he's not accountable on the day day of judgment but in this world he has to pay the compensation whether it's Financial or the likes and Allah Knows Best"
