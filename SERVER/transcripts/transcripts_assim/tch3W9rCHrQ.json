  "title": "Can a woman show her face or ears during an exam for the purpose of identification? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um almost all government jobs in Bangladesh have exams to get the job uh and during exam one must remove mikup and show her ears also uh the job is halal though so is it permissible during exam to show face and years for identification um probably I have to keep my face open the whole day like during the whole exam or if not face at least I have to show my ears if there is a necessity that demands this and necessity is something that is measured by the true nature and gravity of such a necessity if I have a cut on my pinky a small wound that does not justify me eating pork when I'm hungry but if I'm stranded in the desert and I'm about to die and I'm losing all of my power and there's nothing in sight Halal to consume and there is no help in sight and if I don't eat one or two morsels of that pork meat in front of me I am definitely going to die here it becomes a necessity so we have to look into what you're up to if you need a passport to travel and the authorities insist that you uh show your fa face and maybe part of your hair or part of your ears just for identification which is very very strange and not normal and it seems that this is one of the ways of humilating the Muslims and insulting them but if there's a necessity for you to travel then yes if there's no necessity then the answer is no you cannot compromise your hijab for such a reason if you're sick and you have to go to the doctor and the doctor has to look at some parts of your body in order in order to treat you or to operate upon you this is a necessity but if you want to do this to a a um a saloon for example where the hairdresser is a man and you have a wedding and you want to fix your hair of course this is not permissible and I hope this answers your question"
