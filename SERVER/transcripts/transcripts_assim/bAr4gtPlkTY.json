  "transcript": "I've heard on YouTube that um our sins affect the um like heard you heard what our sins affect the umah the sins affect the umah yeah okay in generalization this has reality in it but not as what people think so a brother next to me is clean shaven and I say to him all what's happening in is because you are shaving your beard come on this is not logical but when the umah itself in its whole entire umah they don't do not enjoy that is virtuous and righteousness they don't enjoy good they don't forbid evil and vice and transgression in the whole umah where we see it in the market in the homes in uh politics and economy and everything and we're totally diverting from the straight path this would have an impact on the whole umah and Allah Knows Best"
