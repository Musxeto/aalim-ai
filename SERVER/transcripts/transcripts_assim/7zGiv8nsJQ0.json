  "transcript": "If a boy and a girl are engaged and the nikah is planned after some months, is it permissible for the bride and the grooms and gifts in this period? Your line is breaking Akhi. Is it permissible to do what? Okay, I think he was referring to communicate. So a fiancé wants to communicate with his fiancé, the answer is no, this is not permissible at all. They are still non-mahram and they are to be legally married, Islamically married in two, three months. So within these two, three months their chit-chatting and messaging and talking together is totally haram and sinful. And so many times it so happens the engagement breaks. So they go their different ways without getting married and that would not be something that pleases Allah. you"
