  "transcript": "selling the Cascades to the Christians it is not permissible to assist other religions on their religious uh um rituals so anything that would assist other on their rituals is Haram for us to participate so what's the ruling on selling them a Christmas tree Haram what's the ruling on selling them lights Haram they have their own religion they can enjoy they can do whatever they want I don't assist them on it but if this is your question so let's assume my parents are Christians and they or one of them died is it permissible for me to attend my mother's funeral and burial the answer is no because they are doing this as part of their rituals and their religion my sister is a Christian she's getting married can I attend her wedding at church the answer is no yes she is my sister after the wedding is over and and so on I can go and give her a gift in her house there's no problem participating in the rituals that are related to their religion is not permissible I hope this makes sense"
