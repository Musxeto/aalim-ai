  "transcript": "we are studying the book of that deals with the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam physical and characteristics sallallahu alaih Al wasallam physical appearances so we're still discussing how he looked Hadith narrated by Al may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said I have never seen anyone endowed with a lock of hair flowing below the ears wearing a red suit of clothes more handsome than the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam he had some hair touching his shoulders broad shouldered he was neither short nor tall s we spoke about this in the previous episode you can go and check it out his hair was medium length below his ears but above his shoulders and this shows us that there's nothing wrong in making your hair long as this is not a Sunnah by the way this is not something that the prophet wasallam recommended people to do this is part of the customs of the community so if you are in a community that men wear their hair in such a fashion then you're totally more than welcome to follow suit may Allah be pleased with him describ the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam when he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was neither tall nor short we've gone through this endowed with sturdy hands and feet Stout head and limbs okay what is this the description in Arabic is and this means that his hands and fet were sort of uh um Big in structure in in bone wise they were big and and and and not skinny not bony and the toes were not long rather they were of average to short length and the Palm was full so it's not skinny it's not bony and this is a way a man would be complimented and praised for when you shake hands with a man and his hand is full and his grip is strong this is something to be praised so it had meat in it yet though it was big but at the same time it was softer than silk as described by many of the companions so it wasn't harsh or tough rather it was Fluffy and and and full of meat and big but at the same time very soft and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasam had a stout head and this means that his headat was big and this is a sign of wisdom and and smartness to the vast majority of people when you have an a fair uh um head that was symmetric with his body that's not something ugly having someone's head like this and his body like that it was symmetric with his body sallallahu alaih wasallam and his limbs also were large his bone structure so his knees his elbows and the joints between these areas were quite uh uh um considerably large which gives the appearance of manhood and strength at the same uh time and he had lengthy hair on the chest and this is called Al Al is the hair which men usually have on their chest that goes down to the navl so the prophet had this hair connected and this shows you how the companions may Allah be peace with them knew the prophet Alam to the finest of details when you love someone you can actually draw a portrait of them and and this is how the prophet was with his companions they loved him so much they can tell and they can describe him in such a fashion and when the prophet Alat wasam walked he inclined forward as if he were descending downward slope and we spoke about this Al may Allah be pleased with him said I have never seen the like of him neither before him nor after him and this is a fact not an exaggeration Ari is his cousin Ari is his son-in-law but all those who described him always described him to be extremely handsome and this was recognizable not that he had the share of beauty which Yousef had peace be upon him but he was considerably handsome and this beauty and and and and uh uh um I don't know what the noun is handsomeness is that when you look at him you feel relaxed you feel attracted and this is how a prophet and a messenger of Allah should be um the following Hadith is uh by jab samur may Allah be pleased with him he said the prophet of Allah was and I asked this is simak uh um he said uh or he was asked the narrator of jabber what does that mean that's why I did not translate it because it has a different meaning to it so what is means that he has a grand and impressive mouth so his mouth is not so tiny and delicate and this is not a beautiful feature in men and it's not like the Joker's mouth taking half of his face rather it was quite considerable and it's the size that was beautiful on his face so that when he speaks you can tell and you can understand the words that he's saying what is some say that is the length or the slit of the eye so his eyes are big and slit and some say no this is a form of redness in the whiteness of the eye that gives a form of beauty as for they say that it is endowed with a lean heel so his feet are not bulky and fat which may cause a person to be tired when walking rather they little in meat in them which means that this person is capable of uh uh striding and moving forward for long distances and Allah knows best"
