  "transcript": "a friend of mine asked me um she has a toxic family meaning that her father is very abusive towards her mother and he is offensive language runs to beat her Slanders her uh and drinks alcohol all kind of bad stuff and it's been continuous for quite some time it's been two decades to be exact this time her mother decided to leave him and grown-up children once and for all and left to other City to grandmothers the problem is my friend doesn't want to stay with her father too she's married but didn't play with Lima yet because her husband is abroad and that's why she was living with her parents now that her mother no longer there she doesn't want to stay with her abusive father and her father is against it and if he says like I will never be please blessed with you if you leave and you should stay with me until the volume at takes place but my friend doesn't want to stay uh will she be sinful for not listening to her father this is problematic because it's like Torn Between Two Lovers and Imam Ahmed if I'm not mistaken or even Tamia one of the two was asked my father tells me to do something while my mother tells me not to do it so he answered obey your father and don't disobey your mother the guy said duh how could that be one says go right one says go left and you say obey both of them he said this is my answer which means it's quite difficult to give an answer to such a situation you can't compromise one of your eyes you have two eyes Okay choose right or left I can't I need them both no no I have to choose it's the same thing your father your mother you can't choose now in this in the case if your father is intolerable and you fear for your safety or your mental health all your physical uh safety because he may beat you up abuse you anything of that yeah in this case you can leave and go with your mom if he is a sweetheart to his children but he's abusive only to his wife his relationship with his wife must not affect you and your siblings his children they have to remain obedient dutiful and respectful despite his sins this is between him and Allah azzawajal so try to have a balance and walk a very fine threat by being diplomatic with them and telling him that my mom is depressed and I have to be with her I'll go one week there and one week with you try to do something but at the end of the day obey your father and don't disobey your mother and Allah Knows Best"
