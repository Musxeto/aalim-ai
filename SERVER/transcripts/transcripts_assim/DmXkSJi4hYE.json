  "transcript": "Maham from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So I want to ask what is considered like a helping in sing like if I want to go somewhere and I ask my friend to pick me up but I know she's going to come alone with a driver so am I sinful for that and like if I hire a maid to do something and she doesn't do hijab and in my house sees her so like am I like a sinful for that I'll answer only one question if you ask your friend to pick you up and she comes without a mahram comes alone with the driver either way she's riding with the driver 24 7 and doesn't care about the ruling so you did not commit any haram because this is how she is and if you need her to pick you up both of you with the stranger or non-mahram driver is fine because there's no seclusion so there is no sin on you in this and Allah knows best you you"
