  "transcript": "foreign we can go combine both straight away combine both so this is too long the program is too long until one o'clock I'm might wrap it up at 11 inshallah so we can live early the prophetic way why if we were to speak about why to follow Prophet Muhammad this would take us a lot of time Allah says that in the prophet there is a role model for you for you to follow was sent for us to follow him if the Quran was sufficient and enough Allah would have given each one of us a copy of the Quran and said go but no we had to see someone a human like us implementing the Sharia to know that it is applicable and this is why Allah sent us the best of his creation to see of the of the prophets and messengers of Allah had their Sierra biography day-to-day acts documented except the prophet Allah we know nothing of prophet Musa Prophet ASA how they lived how they slept how they ate who whom they married we don't know anything about that only Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam we know every single detail he did to the extent that the Hypocrites made fun as in Muslim they went to Salman Al farisi and they said your Prophet taught you everything even how to clean yourselves after defecating after answering the call of nature he taught you how to do this they're making fun Salman may Allah be pleased with him said yes he told us not to face or give our backs to the Qibla and he told us not to touch our private parts with our right hands and he told us not to wash or to wipe ourselves with stones less than three times where can you find this in any other religion nowhere this is why the beauty of studying the prophets is that it makes you aligned with Sharia it's like the railway and you're the train you have to go on the rails otherwise you will be derailed and this is the way of the Prophet one of the beauties of following the prophetic way is that through it you gain the love of Allah didn't Allah azzawajal says Allah say if you love Allah then follow me Allah will love you so if you want Allah's love you have to follow the prophet Allah and you have to follow him wholeheartedly not like us what do you mean Sheikh we follow the prophet selectively things that we like I grow my beard why I can save money on Gillette two or three I don't have to shave every single day and besides when people see me with a long beard please come come they give me respect I like David it's a good Sunnah but it's also a Sunnah that you spend money in the cause of Allah no no this is too much I can't spend money I love money Don't force me to do this so I'm selective I am generous with my friends because I know they can give me but I'm stingy with my wife because she is not a working woman she doesn't have money this is not the way of the Prophet Allah you love the prophet sallallahu you give yourself wholeheartedly to the Sunnah in every single thing even in clipping your nails which is Trivial thing I was in Indonesia I was in Malaysia and I'm shocked with boys having this nail long what is this men he said where is the manicure nail polish where is it I'm offended I'm offended why aren't you following the Sunnah why is this nail is it for um any purposes should know I need to cut things you know I get wrappers cut things pocket knife what is this so you follow the Sunnah 100 you trim your mustache because the prophet said you're kind and tolerant to your wives as we will get to know inshallah how the prophet dealt with the children with the Sinners with the disbelievers follow the steps of the Prophet Allah it will only lead you to Jannah and I pray to Allah that he leads me and you to Jannah now what is the difference between studying Sirah and you know is the description of the Prophet Allah which is included in this so what's the difference between studying the shemael how he looked how he talked how he wept how he laughed how he ate how he walked how he stood how he slept this is and what is the difference between that and the seera the Sierra is time bound he was born he lived in Mecca he was revealed to in Makkah 13 years he traveled to Medina he died his battles year two brother you're free Etc while speaks and talks about specific topic how he wore clothes so they collect from the Sierra from different places that he used to love the white that sometimes he wore a black turban or a green turban that his clothes were to the middle of his legs so this is one of the differences and this is why it is important to read and study the serum inshallah I think they have started to air it on Huda TV but Allah blessed me like three four months ago I went to Cairo and I completed the book muhammadiya and I explained it all alhamdulillah on TV so hopefully it should be on YouTube soon and also on that TV for you to watch so moving on to the session number one the prophets wives may Allah be pleased with them it is very important to know them why because they are our mothers and so many times I ask people give me some of the names of the wives of the Prophet Allah the first name I get is what no Fatima this is problematic you don't know his wife from his daughter Fatima is his daughter you reminded me of this Franco Arab he's from Greece and he was pretending to be an Arab and living among the Muslims and he's Christian and one day on Ashura he was crying said why are you crying he said because the daughters of muawia died Al Hasan Al Hussain Hussain daughters and he made them Daughters of when you have ignorance in the Deen it's overwhelming so we need to know before we go into the subject the names of the prophets wives number one Aisha know number one is Khadijah and I will not speak about Khadija may Allah be pleased with her because this will take us the whole day though her contribution to Hadith is zero do you know Hadith where Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her narrated that the prophet said so and so no because she died in Makkah there were no companions to listen and learn from so what's the contribution Allahu Akbar Khadijah she is the mistress of women in Jannah out of four four only perfect women and they were Asia Maryam the mother of Khadijah and hello Aisha no Aisha is not see you go to Jannah you enter Jannah Masha Allah a beautiful place who's this what's her name I don't know this who's this yeah come on give me some names I know man who's this this is I don't need it you know these guys you say Jannah mashallah beautiful place nice weather like but I don't know people here take me to Hell Fire not you inshallah the Menace women are happy so I go to hell I know everybody I go to hell I know everybody so this is a problem we have to know our heritage we have to know our history the fourth is Fatima the Mistress of Jannah Asia the wife of pharaoh Mariam the mother of Isa Khadijah and Fatima the wife and the daughter of the Prophet Aristotle so number one is number two are Isha number three hafsa um married the daughter of the first Khalifa married the daughter of the second Khalifa who were there his best Companions and they're buried next to him in the grave in Medina it is three Graves Prophet is then he married sauda bint Zama and sauda is the first one he married after the death of Khadijah with Khadijah he did not marry anyone for 15 years almost or more no more he did not marry anyone because of respect and love to her and she was a full complete woman no one would say oh why are you marrying a second wife because you're not Khadijah till she died the prophet married sauda and soda by the way was 53 years old you should marry someone like you know young and and and a beautiful no the prophet's marriages were not based on beauty or human desire it was based on fearing Allah and interest of Islam then he married of course this is not in a Time bound because after Khadijah he married two sauda about 50 years of age and Aisha six years of age and the marriage was not consummated until she was nine years of age when she was ready to be married and no one says to me how can he marry a nine-year-old because we've spoken about this a thousand times if I had the prophet coming and he wants to marry my daughter if she is one year I will give it to her huh she's one year there is no one on earth like the prophet Allah and no one at the time of the Prophet sallallahu ever spoke against him he said oh child abuser he married a nine-year-old even the kuffar the idol worshipers the Jews the Christians the Hypocrites the byzantians the fire worshipers nobody spoke why because this was normal by the way be pleased with her six years of age when the prophet proposed she was already engaged to someone else and the prophet Allah he engaged Abu Bakr said she's already spoken to for but let me ask the man he went and ask the father of the man who wanted to marry her and the man said no no I changed my mind alhamdulillah then the prophet saws proposed anyhow so after sauda we have zainab benjas and I don't have time otherwise I would have each one of them I would giving you a small preview saying I've been Josh is the cousin of the Prophet Allah before him she was married to whom I need I need to hear something no no I need to hear some loud and clear sound she was married too Zaid not Sabbath people usually mix between the two companions was the adopted son of the Prophet Allah so she was his daughter-in-law before adoption was revoked and prevented and prohibited zainab bent Josh foreign the only wife beside Khadijah who died in the life of the Prophet so two wives only died in his life and the rest outlived him then there is um and her name is hint bint ABI omaya um the wise woman who had children and her husband Abu Salama was the first to migrate to Medina and he died Abu Salama by the way was the brother of the Prophet Allah through suckling through breast milk there were three Hamza his uncle and the prophet assalam who were brothers through circling when he when he when when he died the prophet proposed to his wife and she said o prophet of Allah I'm an old woman and I have children and I'm extremely jealous I can't marry you so yeah a prophet with all due respect why go to this go someone you know enjoy life he said I'm older than you and your children are under my custody I will provide for them as for your jealousy I will ask Allah azzawajal to take it out and Allah took it out she was the only woman who did not feel jealous even when the parties of the wives and the prophets suffered a lot from his wives even when they took sides party a party B like elections huh when they had fights the one mediating was um because she did not need to take sides Hala she knows her position with the prophet she loves him he loves her she doesn't take sides no you're preparing Aisha over or you're preparing zainab then we have um Habiba who's um Habiba daughter of is her brother of Abu sufyan so she her name is and she is the daughter of the head of orange at the time [Music] and she has a story they are they were approximately 13 or 14 sisters married to most dignitaries of Horace and she's by the way the aunt of Imran Abbas and also she's the aunt of Khalid so imagine you know when you have this connection of who's related to who masha'allah you have a big family my poster keeps on falling and my picture is always on the ground keep it lying the brother every time he puts it up and it goes down and I feel sorry for myself and then move it and Danny get rid of it put it in the car or somewhere anyhow then we have joyria of course these names are most of you are said maimuna other names these are beautiful names for your daughters and by the way most of them are my daughters I've named my daughters most of them like this I have joyria I have maimuna I have Sofia I have uh the whole nine years I have 13 of them I have to go and choose and pick alhamdulillah foreign anyhow then we have finally Sofia and she was a Jew accepted Islam and the prophet married now these are your mothers you can watch the video again and document them because you will be asked one day in a quiz in a Masjid who are the wives of the Prophet Salam who are your mothers I don't know this is shameful now the prophet Allah when he came to the interaction with wives he was the role model to encourage women and Men to live in harmony but men had the upper hand so he used to always advise them he used to say the best among the men in Iman is the best in character and the best of them is the best to his women so you want to know if you're the best look how you deal with your wife bracket bracket as if you have more than one wife may Allah be with you but if you have one wife you're white alhamdulillah you believe in monotheism insha Allah and into heat but you have to be careful because it's a very thin line if you sleep you go to hell that is why the prophet said we will come to talk about this later on generally speaking with strangers we are very good in character we love we smile we're kind we we're generous but when it comes to our wives we are a different person and a lot of the women complain my husband is always grumpy my husband is always not communicating he doesn't speak to us few hours ago I had a counseling session with a couple from America and the couple were together the wife was weeping what's your complaint he never talks to me he never has any quality time with me he never Smiles in my face I only I'm responsible for the children so I spoke to the boy or to the man and I said is what she's saying true he said yes I said why I said I'm busy I'm doing work I'm collecting for the family blah blah blah I said to him two or three questions number one when was the last time you said to her words of compassion you don't know what compassion is I love you I miss you said I don't remember Allah says okay when was the last time you encouraged her and said Masha Allah the food is excellent masha'allah you look beautiful nice dress I love your makeup I like you the way you're wearing your hair I'm I said no never he said okay would you like her to heat it from someone else he said of course not said okay there's a void and emptiness in her heart fill it up this is what I do with my wife alhamdulillah after 40 years of marriage when I travel I text her every single day three four times I'll miss you I love you I want the days to go inshallah quickly so that I can see you again and she says what's wrong what's happening did you do something wrong confess This is how we roll This is how we work even if I don't want to I do it because this ignites the love and this is what you should do unfortunately a lot of the men don't do that don't follow the role of the Prophet The Prophet never ever lay the hand on a woman never beat his wife in his life alhamdulillah he's our role model I don't want to put you on the hot seat but if I said those who did hit their wives raise your hands I think everybody will leave so no need no need said a lot of the women came to my wife's complaining from their men that they beat them up by Allah the prophet swears Islam they are not the best of you you lay your hand on a woman you're not a real man you're a real man come and face someone your size go and do this with her brother or with her uncle or with her father you want it there because they'll beat the heck out of you but this wife this poor woman she's afraid of I divorce you she's afraid for the three four children she has she is afraid because she doesn't have qualification to work or to earn that's why she has to zip it up fear Allah azzawajal on the far extreme we have men who took off their pants this is not rated R don't worry took off their pants and made their wives wear them so the wives are the men of the house the woman goes and travels without mahram she mixes with men she flirts with men she does Haram things and the man is I'm happy she's a good woman okay this is Haram you have to do what the prophet did be kind gentle sweet but at the same time be firm when it is related to Halal and Haram issues also the way of the Prophet was Allah that he used to give a helping hand to his wives which most of us don't was asked what work did the prophet do in his home she said he used to work in assisting his wives until the Salat is called he leaves and goes for Salat so in his house he used to as she said in another Hadith he used to clean his clothes from any uh uh fleece he used to milk his own sheep or goat he used to serve himself saw his own garments uh uh um string his own shoes and fix his own bucket so this is the prophet Allah work at the house what do we men do in the house sit on our lazy chair have three remote controls in front of us and a big popcorn and give instructions give me water give me Diet Pepsi put some ice I need foot massage I need and this is what we do in the house we are like kings then we expect all of these things without giving in return and the prophet Allah though he had more than one wife he was fair and his fairness is that he divides equally the number of nights he's fair in expenditure of Finance money he doesn't favor one over the other and he sees them and this is something a lot of those who have wives multiple wives don't know of he sees them every single day Aisha says may Allah be pleased with her every single day the prophet used to pass by all of us nine wives every single house he passes every single day and he comes and approaches without touching just go how are you how are things are fine and he checks on them until he reaches the last one which he will spend the night and he stays there most of men who have two or more wives on the wife day or night he ignores the second one totally not talking to her not speaking to her not doing anything so the prophet Allah used to do this by the way twice a day after Fajr and after awesome after Fajr he uh he used to as even hajjar says after Fajr only Salam salaam alaikum everything is fine and he leaves in Fajr after IBN says is when he sits nine homes he sits for five ten minutes of our things any coffee anything talks normally and goes to the second third fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth and to the ninth house to settle there where does this beautiful when I have women coming to me complaining that their husband did not speak for that with them for the past three months written and sent to me in my Masjid and I read the letter it's from the daughter she's in her mid-20s she says my father did not speak with my mother for two years his soul in peace he died he was an airline captain and I know personally and she says if you can put some sense in his head two years he comes and leaves like a guest she irons she cooks she serves everything but he does not speak with her he lives in a room and she lives in another room what kind of a man is this is this the way of the Prophet I know men would justify this ocean you don't know what she did she did this she said that this is not a reason do what the prophet did and you will be a real man among the things that the prophet used to do and how much time do we have for this session uh 20 more minutes okay good alhamdulillah so a lot of the things that the men fail to do is to be considerate of their wives feelings how many times you came home you find your wife crying and he said don't forget to put the dinner you don't pay any attention you see her you know sad depressed she'll get over it she'll get over it why don't you speak to her oh if I speak to her she will open the Pandora box she is like three hours it's more than my iPhone she will continue to speak to speak and the better it doesn't run out she's a Nokia so why would I open this doesn't let her be she's depressed she'll get over it maybe one day two days this is not the way of the Prophet Allah the prophet Allah was very considerate he said in an authentic Hadith Aisha I know when you're mad and when you're happy so Asha said hmm interesting how he said when you're mad at me you swear by Allah's Name by saying no by the Lord of Ibrahim and when you're happy you say no by the Lord of Muhammad so I know when you don't use my name that you're angry of me she said oh yes so prophet of Allah I only leave your name but I can't leave anything else look at the devotion of mother so the prophet Allah though he was the head of the state the messenger of Allah this did not make him ignore his wife's feelings and coming down to earth and speaking to her like this who imagine that someone in his position would talk to his wife like this also once the prophet saw Sophia crying so he said why are you crying my love she said because hafsa the daughter of whom is criticizing me and saying to me you are the daughter of a Jew your father is a Jew and the prophet salallahu said to her while sympathizing with her he said say to her I am the daughter of a prophet and my uncle is a prophet meaning Musa and harun and I am married to a prophet so why are you boasting yourself upon me so he comforted her and gave her a lot of momentum to be proud of then he went to hafsa and he said hafsa fear Allah that's it it doesn't have to give a big lecture that's fear Allah full stop khalas this is how considerate was the prophet Allah and also mother when they were going for umrah and she had her first menses and she cried not necessarily first Menses but she had her Menses and she cried because she was wearing and the prophet came to her and said what is wrong did you get your menses she said yes and she's weeping he said no problem you do whatever the Hajj the pilgrim is doing except you don't go around the akaba for tawaf and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to tolerate things we can tolerate used to raise her voice and Shout at him and he used to tolerate this and not say anything while we would have done something different the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam was once engaging in a heated debate with Mother Aisha and mother Aisha was Raising her voice no you should not do that you should not do this when Abu Bakr her father came and he heard her raising her voice he took his slipper and wanted to beat the hell out of her don't you fear Allah he's the prophet you crazy and the prophet came in between and protected his wife so that's okay it's okay of course the book could not do anything the prophet is in the middle so the Abu Bakr left angrily the house was very angry and Aisha was terrified the prophet utilized the moment he said to her didn't you see how I protected you didn't you see how I made the man go away so so she forgave him diplomacy smart so they started joking and laughing Abu Bakr came back and when he saw this he said okay as you have engaged me in your War engage me in your peace what are you laughing for everything was normal wallahi can we do this man no once the prophet salallahu was sitting with his companions in the house and mother ayesha's house always mother Aisha always mother Asha because she was the youngest and the most favorite to the prophet Islam and she was the wisest the smartest but when it came to jealousy she's a human being and this is natural so a servant came with a plate with food but this servant belongs to zainab benjesh the other wife today is not your day what are you doing this is a cause of being angry you should not send anything in keep it until the prophet comes to you Allah so the servant came in front of the prophet and his companions when Aisha saw this she was outraged she stood up and hit the servant's hands and the plate fell on the ground and the food was scattered all over the ground the companions were terrified what is happening this is an earthquake let us go out I don't want any domestic problems what did the prophet do Allah what would you do men if your wife did this in front of your friends embarrassing you shaming you oh I divorce you masha'allah real man [Music] no this is what the real man did he stood up collected the food with his own hands and he said to his companions don't worry don't worry your mother is jealous it's okay this is an act of jealousy nothing is wrong this is an impulsive reaction don't worry sit down that's it yes then he went to Aisha okay where is the stick where is the baseball bat he's going to bash her now he said to her Aisha you broke her plate so I'm taking one of your plates as a compensation and the food is there alhamdulillah end of story that's it that's it this is how real men deal with women when they have their we have to admit women do sometimes Yani go overboard and this is where the terminology comes from damn if you do damn if you don't no matter what you do you're gonna be dumped deal with it live with it because Allah created them from a crooked rib this is what the prophet said if you leave it as it is you enjoy life if you try to fix it you will break it don't fix women this is the nature incubate them take them in whatever they do yes honey I love you too one hour two hours she becomes like your servant Palace it's gone but you try to fight heads on you'll break your head she will break your head take it from me if I show you my skull you know high heels and the thing that they make the dough with all traces here and here and here alhamdulillah but anyhow so the prophet salallahu also lived for Jannah so he dealt with his wives as such he used to encourage them to be more religious wake them up for night prayer teach them how to make Dua as in the Hadith of mother zainab I think when he came after Fajr she was still on her prayer mat and one and a half hour prayed Fajr and she is making vikr he said to her I said four words equivalent to all of your one hour and a half this is one of the ascarova of Fajr each one of us should know what is it three times you just say them it is equivalent to an hour and a half can you repeat no I can't you will find it in the Fortress of the Muslim over the morning on my YouTube channel I also was blessed by Allah to do Muslim fully and video so from cover to cover it is explained to you you watch it and it's free and you will inshallah benefit from it it's a beautiful book so the prophet is encouraging us whenever you wake up from night sleep wake up your wife to pray with you if she's asleep put some sprinkles of water so that she would wake up and he was also teaching them not the screen doesn't say the timer yeah how much time two more minutes please two more minutes okay how much much material I have oh yeah who cares half of them is asleep by the way so it's okay so the prophet also used to warn his wives from extremism so one of them was with the prophet assem when a woman came and she said oh prophet of Allah this is and she never sleeps the whole night she spends the whole night sleeping and the prophet said I some she doesn't sleep night no this is wrong take from the Deeds what you can tolerate and bear because Allah azzawajal would not stop rewarding you until you're bored and then you will stop and he will stop so he would also encourage them on a charity so many hadiths he indicates to his wives given charity how much did you give from this sheep to our neighbors she said I gave it all and the only thing that remains is the shoulder the prophet corrects us he says no you gave the shoulder and the remaining is the whole sheep because it's with Allah azzawajal and his Blessing and would also finally I would conclude with this due to time reasons he would not turn away when he sees monkar an evil he would not turn a blind eye to something Haram he enters the house he sees Haram he says this is Haram he becomes angry one day he came in the house he saw a curtain with drawings of animals he did not enter the house he came from a journey she said ask Allah for forgiveness and I Repent what did I do he said don't you know that the owners of these drawings are the most severely tormented in hell I ask you by Allah how many of us in our homes we have small statues a camel an elephant a a dolphins of crystals huh all this is the the norm in Muslim houses nowadays you have Idols in your home I went to a Muslim house wallahi and I found Buddha Buddha himself what is this he said well I was in Thailand and I saw this beautiful brown or golden statues very nice artifact so this is illah being worshiped Iman is don't be a hobby Iman is here this is problematic this is why we follow the footsteps of the Prophet Assam when entering a house I see something I said this is Haram I entered one of the brothers houses I don't would not mention the country and in the guest room where I was sitting next to me a portrait of his wife and his daughters I look at the wall wife daughters wife dogs are you selling them what is this exhibition don't you have shame on you why did Allah order for the hijab to conceal women what are you doing exposing your women you're not a real man with all due respect this is how we should follow the footsteps of the Prophet Allah foreign how many children did the prophet have seven three boys and three and four girls so six of them were all from mother Khadijah which means that wasallam had two boys and four girls from mother Khadijah the boys were al-qasim and the prophet was nicknamed by Al qasim he used to be called Abal a Sim and there is a Hadith where he says use my name but do not use my nickname what is his name Muhammad his nickname Abul qasim so who among you here is Abu qasim raise your hands okay so there are a number of people using this name so what would you do change your name or you're going to keep it the prophet said don't use my name my nickname what are you going to do you have to understand the Hadith when was the Hadith used when the prophet was walking and someone in in the street said yeah I will cause him so the prophet said yes and the man said no no I did not mean you here the prophet said use my name but do not use my nickname which means during the lifetime of the Prophet Allah it was prohibited for anyone to be called Abu qasim after his death the confusion is removed so good news you can keep your name as Abul qasim without any problem alhamdulillah the second son His Name by the way died of the age of two years and few months and this is devastating to the heart when you have a child of two years and few months you love the child you cuddle you play Within it's gone it hurts you but this is part of Allah's tarbia for his messenger what yes Allah chose Prophet Muhammad for himself that's why he could only be attached to Allah azzawajal how his father died when he was six months pregnant woman in his his mother's womb his father died he came to this world his mother gave him to a an Arab tribe to suckle him and raise him six years of age his mother died who took him in his grandfather Abdullah for two years he stayed with his grandfather the head of quraish his grandfather died who took him in his uncle Abu Talib and Abu Talib had half a dozen of children he was poor so he couldn't even take care of his own nephew that well but he gave him all the love he needs all these show you that Allah was selecting Muhammad for himself you don't need any of the humans you only need me so likewise when he was attached to his young boy Allah took him then Abdullah was born Abdullah had a number of names he's the same child and he also died at his infancy some say reached maybe the age of 12 some say younger older but he died and the third boy is Ibrahim in Ibrahim was born when the prophet was 61 years of age and just before he died the lesson by a few months Ibrahim who was also a year and a half old he died so you can see the devastation in the prophet saws when the idol worshipers say you have no male to take your name and carry your name you have no voice and this is mentioned in Surat al-kausa what is the last verse three verses the shortest Surah in the Quran what's the meaning the one who hates you the one who criticizes you that you don't have offspring that would carry your name is the one who has no mentioning all those who faced the prophet with animosity in enmity where are they nobody knows about them they're down in the dirt nobody knows their offspring or their lineage but his lineage continues till the day of judgment this is a bad game everything I put it falls down because it's inclined no that's okay I have to take breaks every now and then from a serious talk no problem okay what about the girls the prophet's daughters how many who has girls here raise your hands masha'allah masha'allah inshallah there will be your past to Jannah I have 13 alhamdulillah no boys so inshallah they will take me straight first class inshallah not not business Europe so the prophet had four girls he had zainab and zainab was married to her cousin mother is the sister of hadija so she married her cousin and um before uh yeah okay we will not go to details because this will take a lot of time the second daughter is married in the beginning to her cousin as well but when the prophet came with the message the enemy of Islam Surah cursing him condemning him to Hell said to his son divorce her so he divorced his cousin because of his father so he was not wedded to him they were married but she was not wedded or consummated and she married Khalifa So Abu Bakr the prophet married his daughter Romar the prophet married his daughter Earthman the prophet gave him his daughter Ali the prophet gave him his daughter see the bond through marriage is not an issue of huh how beautiful she is how young how rich no marriage is much way above this you're getting married to a family not to a woman so you have to select which family you're marrying from because they will be your children's uncles and aunts and their cousins they have to be proud of whom they're belonging to thirdly um also after the death of rokaya um was married to Earthman so if Ali was honored to marry one daughter Earthman was honored to marry two and this is why he's nicknamed as venue raining he's nicknamed as the one with the two lights because he has two daughters of the prophetu wasallam and both died at the life of their husbands Earth man may Allah be pleased with them all now Sofia Theory says it is the right of a child upon his father to give him a good name as a Father Allah will ask you about this what did you call your son Matthew are you Muslim yes your wife Muslim why do you call Matthew because Sheikh things are changing and English is dominating the whole world so we give him this name no give your son an Arab name even though you're a Muslim before you're in Malay or the different what are you now this is so that if I fall I can why did they put this in no no that's okay it's okay it's good I need someone if I fall that's foreign [Music] I keep this here because my back is too stiff so give you you are a Muslim first or a Saudi first or a Malay first Muslim don't ever think twice I am not anything but Islam because without Islam I am nothing even if you have a American passport Canadian passport you are zero you're a Muslim first my allegiance is to My Religion to Allah so give your children Muslim Arab names yes you don't have to give them names that people have never heard of but beautiful names that have a history the child is growing up what's your name my name is Roberta Masha Allah what's the history of your name it was one of the first to give the Pledge of Allegiance from the people of Medina in Makkah to the prophet Sam encouraging him to migrate you remember yes the prophet said some five prayers this is Hadith blah blah blah blah good what's your name sad what's your ancestry I have said uh known as one of the ten Heaven bound he has history what's your name Matthew what's your ancestry a Mark Luke Matthew John this is the Bible Habibi what are you talking about well this is the name they have given me this is why it's very important to give good names and the prophet used to love beautiful names and when Ibrahim was born the prophet came to his companions and said today Allah blessed me with a son and I have named him after the name of my father Ibrahim look at the connection it's a beautiful name it's a messenger's name it is my father so I call my son with that beautiful name and the prophet encouraged us to raise our children well he said whoever is tested with girls as daughters and he is kind to them they will be his visor and screen from Hellfire and this is out of experience girls are the best to have as children they are warm-hearted I don't have boys to know I have seven alhamdulillah grandsons I have seven granddaughters and seven grandsons I'm an old grumpy grandfather so and it's good to to be standing in front of you but I know that girls are a blessing from Allah because I see my other relatives who have boys a girl when you just sitting home and you do this you get two or three jumping Daddy what do you want my neck is hurting me I'm just doing this no no you want water you want tissues you want to bring you some juice you they just want to serve this is the beauty of having girls so though it's beautiful it's a huge responsibility I I look old I'm 37 but I look old they're laughing huh subhanallah no respect the responsibility of girls remains with you until you die who is going to marry them I am always doubt for Ya Allah who will come and marry they are not married we Allah send them a good man to marry and when they get married you're still in depression Ya Allah don't bring them back divorce Ya Allah make them happy Allah when they want to have children Ya Allah make her surgery good Ya Allah make this you're always afraid with a boy the hell with them he goes marriage divorces I don't care howas you're a man do whatever you want he lost his job he has a new job he's traveling I don't care I don't even call he doesn't quote he never calls but the girls always everything's fine how's your health oh take care of yourself it's beautiful but it has responsibilities and fearing who to marry them it's your responsibility to choose the right man so the prophet gave his daughters to the best of man foreign who can beat that on the seeding not tennis seeding but in the ranking they are the best of men of Arabia may Allah be pleased with them all and he would not force these good men upon his daughters like so many would do your cousin is marrying you Daddy I don't want him no no you're marrying him I don't know if you have this here or not in Malaysia in the subcontinent it is quite prevailing I get hundreds and thousands of women saying we don't want to marry but this person is pressuring our parents under my father is pressuring me and threatening me physical and mental abuse torture my mom is in hospital she has a heart attack because I don't want to marry what to do Sheikh don't marry my mom will die may Allah have mercy on her she will eventually die not this year next year five years but do not marry someone you don't want because you will come five years later with three children and saying Sheikh I can't move on in this marriage I can't he's not a real man what to do with three children what do you want me to say minimize the losses it's it's it's shameful and the prophet saws when he gave his daughters in marriage would not be extravagant like we do someone comes okay which hotel you're gonna throw the wedding Hotel I just started work last year I barely can make ends meet no I want a wedding for 300 people I have so many uh people that know me I cannot be shamed in front of them so it has to be in the Hilton or it has to be in the intercon and the food has to be Seafood I don't want meat I want Seafood and the budget is three hundred thousand dollars to under for what Miss Malaysia no she's your daughter what is this we know it and you know it so no the prophet salallahu used to say the greatest Baraka when a woman gets married if she is getting the least amount of dowry so don't take it as a form of boasting oh I gave a thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars this is not Halal the least you give the better Baraka Allah puts in your marriage and he was used to help in marriaging in in marrying his daughters so even when the husband was poor the prophet would help him with Furniture as he did with Fatima and this is not the dowry there is a difference between the Dowry and the subcontinent when men make money unlike everywhere else because this is a Hindu practice in Islam the man takes care of everything from a to z he pays the Dowry he pays for the jewelry he pays for the clothes he pays for the house he pays for the furniture he pays for the wedding and the Father of the Bride zero nothing in other countries according to the Hindus no the Father of the Bride gives the groom money he buys him a new Corolla he rents a house he furnishes it he buys him gold this is Hindu practice not from Islam but there is nothing wrong in helping if the man is poor and you buy furniture for your daughter you buy an AC you buy a refrigerator for your daughter not a dowry there is nothing wrong the prophet did that the prophet sallallahu dealt with his children in a moderate Wise Way when there is a fight between one of his daughters and her husband he would not bring the sword and solve it by force he would not intervene he would not interrogate why did you do this why did you say that no this is their life and this is an advice to every parent stay away from your children's marriages it's not your right to intervene it's not your right to ask it's not it's not your right to put your nose in it this only puts fuel to the fire so don't do this Whenever there is a fight the prophet salaam would just try to make things light without asking once Ali and Fatima had a debate an argument Ali got mad and left the home the prophet came where is Ali she said we had a fight and he left went to the Masjid the prophet did not say what was the fight about what did you say what did he say no none of my business he went to the Masjid so Ali lying on the ground sleeping on the ground and it's all Pebbles and soil so he made him get up took the dust off his shoulder and said he nicknamed him the father of sand because he had sand on he said his name is Abu Hassan his nickname his eldest son is Hassan his name is Abu Hassan we all know this Ali says by Allah this is the most beautiful nickname I was ever given he left Abu Hassan everybody calls him the prophet did not say what happened no no he's only sympathizing with him and he says come come to your home don't put your nose in people's problems and the prophet Allah among all of his children loved Fatima the most and he respected her the most whenever Fatima came the Hadith says Ayesha says you cannot miss the way she walks identical to her father whenever she came the prophet was sitting he used to stand up for his daughter and he used to say welcome my daughter and he would kiss her on the forehead and make her sit where he was sitting what kind of respect is this to our children and whenever the prophet entered she would do the same she would stand up welcome her father kiss him on the forehead and make him sit where she was sitting how do we deal with our children today do we respect them or do we criticize them every time they make anything we are like the religious police radar the moment he's breathing why are you breathing breathe slowly the X oxygen is not enough the moment he eats don't eat like this eat like that don't drink don't chew the uh the food I can hear your uh food being shoot take your plate criticizing criticizing criticizing and this puts our children down we have to learn how to encourage our children if you have a child every single day you say you're dumb you're stupid you your special needs you'll never succeed you're a big failure I don't know you're you're a mistake you came to this world by mistake we should have slept that day how will the child grow a but if you always say to your child Masha Allah here comes my son he is my successor mashallah is so courageous he's so generous when he gives a gift or one of his toys to someone else to play which is very rare children by Nature this is mine this is mine this is all mine stay away but sometimes they feel sorry they give a child a toy they don't want what do you do Masha Allah you're very generous you are a good Muslim look look Marshall well how does he feel s so I'm gonna do this again and take another one yeah what are you going to do I'll take a third one he's going to do this frequently he's going to grow up to be an Imam would you like this no no I will not tell you so this is how we teach our children encouragement motivation and turning a blind eye every now and then they did the mistake you don't have to show them that you saw it they know you saw it they're waiting for your reaction let it slip they will be haunted by it oh they know but they did not say anything I will not do it again no no I will respect their respect they're respecting me this this is how you lift the generation not by scolding and criticizing and banning we're good in Banning no social media no iPhone no Android no videos okay what's the alternative none of my business so shall I do drugs of course not give me an alternative you take something from me give me something in return so take them to the gym let them learn karate Taekwondo MMA but without hitting the face on hurting the others let them go uh horse riding let give them something to fill up their time you have to substitute and though the prophet had great love to assalam to his daughters yet they would not mix apples with oranges there's a red line of sharia to the extent that the prophet said the daughter of Muhammad ask me from whatever money I have I will give you because on the day of judgment I will not be accountable to whatever you do you go your way I go my way and he also said by Allah if Fatima Muhammad Where to steal I would chop her hand off so yes I love her I stand up for her I kiss her but if she makes an error she's like anyone else this is how she was brought up this is how we bring up our children not because my child is the son of the Sheikh or of the minister or of the king that he has privileges known you know I hope was one of the Great khulafa of the umayya era and he was known to be the fifth rightly guided Khalifa when he was 14 years of age his father was the ruler of Medina so he was in Medina and his father was giving the khutbah and he's monitoring after the was over he went to his son his son why were you late for the Salat today of Juma he said well my father my maid Was preparing my hair was grooming me you know after Russell she was fixing my hair putting hair gel you know curls I don't know so he said Masha Allah your hair made you late for Juma Barber come shave it zero this is what made you late zero khalas end of story this is how we bring our children Islam is a red line above it do whatever you want the moment you come to the red line with Haram there is no compromise at all and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to teach his children and grandchildren everything about Islam Fatima his beloved daughter comes and says father I need a mate look at my hands and her hands were all torn and hard because of grinding the wheat so he said I'll give you something better say subhanallah alhamdulillah before you go to bed 33 33 34 and that will be better for you than a servant diverting and substituting with something that is better also the prophet salallahu used to teach Ali imagine seven-year-old he comes to his grandfather and he says teach me something to supplicate in Whittier you're kidding me you're seven years of age he wants to learn Dua in with her seven years so the prophet taught him what we always say and with it you know this was taught to us only by who al-hasan who was the grandson of the prophet sallam and when we talk about grandsons who do we know among them give me names grandsons of the Prophet is an very good masha'allah if I had the fries I would give it to you al-hussein [Music] who else that's all no he had more sin Hassan Hussain the sons of Ali and Fatima may Allah be pleased with them and also um she is the daughter of Fatima and Ali never heard of this chick no I'll add something extra this is a bonus huh desserts for the lunch I hope you have desserts um was wedded to Roma and Omar was in his 60s when he married um kathum who was maybe 10 years of age and he proposed to Ali and Ali said she's like your daughter she's still so small he says I want to have a connection with the prophet Allah through marriage she said okay I'll send her to you if you like her she's your wife so he said to his daughter go to Khalifa Roma and do this in that and errand so Omar came and he checked her out and she was you know repelled by it he says if you were not a rumor and an old man I would have beaten you what are you doing so she went angrily to her father look at this old man daughter he's your husband and she came back to him and she loved him and she was married to him so these are the four children of foreign [Music] had a son from Omar his name is Zaid so this is also from the lineage of the Prophet Allah as well and also there is zainab the daughter of Ali married to Abdullah and Abdullah foreign [Music] and he died when he was six years of age Allah blessed them with Umama the name that you always hear and Umama is famous of the Hadith when the prophet used to pray he used to carry her in for prayer he's the Imam and whenever he did he places her on the ground and when he stands up he picks her up now if any Imam if I come and pray like this what will you do with me I'll get a kick in my back this is not this is Sunnah of the Prophet to show you how he interacted with his grandchildren he used to love them a lot and he used to nourish them from the very beginning you know what is technique what is technique technique is when the child is born immediately after his birth you take a small piece of dates you shoot until it's like liquid like and you take a very tiny piece and you put it in the ceiling of the mouth I was in Indonesia and a couple came to me with their son wanting me to do technique and I said when he was born they said three three weeks ago it's too late there's no use of that the first thing that should go into the child's stomach after birth is this dates why the doctors say one of the Fatal illnesses is the lack of glucose in a newborn and this is immediately solved with this little technique that you're doing because the lack of glucose would stop the child from breathing it would lacks the muscles and he would refuse to suckle the milk of his mom and it would cause blueness in the uh skin in some cases but this technique does all the job the prophet also sallallahu honored how much time you have five minutes yeah no no this is not feasible at all I will take some time from because one of the sessions here I don't like no problem so the prophet Allah also offered a set of rituals when his children and grandchildren were born such as slaughtering two sheep or two Rams for a boy newborn and one for a female newborn oh Sheikh I didn't know that I didn't do it do it today I get people 40 years of age my father and mother did not do it do it now no problem and this is a a very important the prophet salallahu himself slaughtered two Rams for al-hasan and Hussein which means it's not necessarily the responsibility of the father if my father-in-law comes and says I want to do it if my own father wants to do it if my my uncle my brother they offer it alhamdulillah it's a gift the Sunnah is to be on the seventh day and the seventh day I get frequently asked this question when is the seventh day it's the day prior to the date of birth so if the son was born on a Saturday his to be done on a Friday if he was born on a Tuesday is on a Monday this is the seventh day because Monday is the seventh day Tuesday is the eighth day so you don't want to do it on the same day it was born and the Sunnah is to also shave the head and shaving the head is a well-known Sunnah for males but it is also a Sunnah for baby girls and it's an issue of dispute for me myself I shaved the hair of all of my girls why the prophet said Allah when a newborn came to him he said shave his head and remove the filth meaning the skull has filth from the womb of the mother and this is only removed by shaving what's the difference between a boy and a girl nothing they were in the same womb so shave it this is stronger for the skull for the hair to become better and stronger insha Allah and the Sunnah is to weigh it and the weight of the hair how many grams maybe one or two and very light give it in silver in charity as the Sunnah so one says Sheikh I don't have a scale should I go to The Barbers to the jeweler shop and give him this hair he wouldn't put it on the scale Halas estimate give 50 Ringgit that's more than much more just give it in this in the cause of Allah and also naming the child on the seventh day oh should I wait seven days I already named my child before I was before I was even married I am known to be Abu Hadith and I was waiting for her for 40 years he did not come the son of a so-and-so so no problem you can name this child on the seventh day you can name him on the date of birth because in the Hadith we mentioned earlier the prophet named Ibrahim the night he was born he didn't wait for seven days but if you wait for seven days that would be fine maybe you would like to delegate and deliberate with your wife she says Muhammad I say Abdullah and until you reach a conclusion inshallah Sheikh she doesn't want to listen please wait stop your lecture and let's talk about this I am the father I said Abdullah she says no you have to call him Muhammad by the name of my father and we got into a fight her father intervened he said yes she carried him for nine months you didn't do anything so now they're fighting what should I do Sheikh what do you think it's the reef Soul responsibility of the father of the child he can consult he can ask at the end of the day he's the captain flying the airplane he says descent the co-pilot says descent the co-pilot does not have the right to say I think no we maybe go to calendar he said no we have to go to paralysis don't know I changed my mind no there's only one captain and in this marriage the father of the son is responsible today yes you have to as a father as a wise man see that if there is room to any compromise maybe one child for her one child for me and if the name is good alhamdulillah no need to be so stubborn and so stiff on these things uh the prophet loved his grandchildren a lot to the extent that he used to give Friday he's giving khutba Sherman and walks in al-hasan two years three years child tripping and he walks between the rows he leaves the khutbah goes carries his child and he says to the people o people my son just walked in and I could not hold myself from embracing his son Yani Grant's grandson he doesn't have sons but he calls al-hason my sons so I could not hold myself from embracing them Allah says in the Quran your wealth and your children are but a trial so the prophet is confirming this this is fitna but what can I do I'm a human being this is the effect s we have to show our children show them love show them compassion show them that you care for them not Simon Says do this don't do that no show them and encourage them and give them their childhood our problem is when our children are six or seven years of age we treat them as if they're 20 years of age we expect them to be men there's seven their children they have to act like children the prophet saw Allah once was in prayer in sujood and he prolonged the sujood prolonging five minutes not 30 seconds so one of the companions raised his head he said I thought that the prophet died five minutes something wrong and he found al-hussein on his back you know like children right their grandfathers back as a right when the prayer finished the companion said o prophet of Allah you prolonged too much he said my son took me as a right and I did not want to disturb him I just wanted him to play until he's finished and satisfied and Allah this is in Salat how are we with our children woman take the children away I I can't watch a TV I can't work I can't no no take them out close the door behind you no this is not the way you have to mix with them you have to play with them yes there is time management but you have to give them quality time and you have to even stop them when they do Haram even at a young age the son-in-law of the Prophet I mean remember um he married her Omar and some say um was eating with the prophet and he was four or five years of age and he was a young boy but he was eating from an older place from all the plate so the prophet said o my son eat with your right don't use your left hand by the way the audience I'm an old teacher and part of my job is to monitor people and observe them without them knowing a lot of you drink with your left hand I cannot stop my election said okay use your right hand I can't do that maybe he has a gun you never know so be careful of this do not ever eat with your left or right because let me rephrase that edit this huh do not ever if I don't know how I'm gonna eat with my feet do not ever eat or drink with your left because shaytan eats and drinks with his left this is what the prophet taught this five-year-old son boy yes eat with your right from whatever is in front of you don't go pick in front of people so even the children the prophet used to Allah not allow them to cross the red line once al-hasan saw a single date on the ground he picked it up as all children do put it in his mouth what did the prophet say no the prophet did not say he did he put his finger in the child's mouth and took the date out and threw it away fearing that it might be from charity and Prophets lineage do not eat charity and he said to him oh son we do not eat charity is teaching him what would we do if a child was holding a glass of champagne thinking it's apple juice it's okay it's coffee so we have to draw the line and by this inshallah we would be like the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam Muhammad is [Music] foreign religion of moderation of balance and the moment we lose this balance this imbalance causes disruption in the society and the community so everything is balanced in Islam among the things that is balanced is our relationship with the disbelievers Who are the disbelievers Islam defines things so that there is no confusion what does this mean a man came to the prophet Salah and he said o prophet of Allah what should a mushrim where meaning a person who's doing tawaf what should he wear now if the prophet were to list the same things he he can wear it would take ages he can wear this he can wear this he can wear this he can wear this rather he gave a different answer by saying must not where turbans shirts trousers and shoes full stop Palace anything that does not fall under these five categories you can wear this is the concise of speech that the prophet was given likewise one says what is halal for me to eat and drink this can be endless naming the fruits the vegetables the kind of meat the Halal things to eat and drink thousands rather Quran says to you don't eat that meat no pork no blood nothing that is slaughtered for other than for the sake of Allah and everything else go eat as long as it's not harmful for you medically so um clear way so when we say disbelievers who are they should I have a list Christians Jews Buddhists Hindus fire worshipers atheists Hypocrites blah blah no no it's too long so what is the definition of a disbeliever anyone who's not a Muslim boom that easy yes it's like what George Bush said George W bush if you're not with us you're against us if you're not Muslim you're a kafir and this is what Allah azzawajal clearly said in the Quran he says it is he who created you and among you is the disbeliever and among you is the believer why is this important because we have extremes Among Us we have people who treat the disbelievers as insects whenever you see one squash it with your foot kill the disbelievers wherever you see them spit on their faces jump on their stomachs treat them like trash and this is not from Islam why aren't they our enemies shouldn't we kill them listen to what the prophet says whoever kills someone with a covenant with the Muslims he will not find the fragrance of Jannah yet the fragrance of Jannah is detected 40 years traveling distance whoa just because I killed this Christian I won't find the fragrance of Jannah yes because you've committed a heinous crime in Islam this man has a covenant who has a covenant I didn't sign any Covenant well the ruler the Muslim government gave him the Covenant which is the Visa so he comes in he's he has a peace treaty with us we cannot harm him we cannot attack him we cannot do anything that is harmful to him otherwise you will not find the fragrance of Jannah so on the far extreme those who say kill them torture them spit on their faces but on the left extreme you find people saying they are our brothers they address the Hindus as my brother no he's not your brother or Sheikh we mean brother in humanity so no my parents are Adam and Eve Adam Hawa his parents are a monkey or something else I don't know so we're not Brothers Allah says in the Quran verily the Believers are brothers yes we are brothers and sisters we come from different ethnicities but we are brothers and sisters those who do not share our beliefs and convictions they are not our brothers so we end up by finding finding those who want Harmony you want Harmony go to a church they sing in harmony we in Islam don't have such thing as Harmony we have laws regulations yes this a disbeliever he has a covenant we respect him we honor him we give him dawah but we don't call him a brother we don't give him honor more than the Muslims we don't give him control over the Muslims he cannot rule Muslims he cannot be in power over Muslims because he is this is our conviction and belief according to Quran and Sunnah of course politics and diplomats maybe don't believe in Quran and Sunnah they have a different way we as Muslims have only one way one way to Jannah there is no second Highway or train or airplane only one straight path that leads you to Jannah and this is why we know the mistake of the Liberals when they come and say that he is our brother he is our companion he is the No No he is a kafir label him as such yes you don't have to meet the Christian and say hi kaffir what's happening this is bad for dawah you don't want to do this but in your heart you acknowledge if he dies like this straight to Hell first class no doubt in that but I give him dawah I try to be kind I give him some Busa I give him some soup and in Ramadan so that softened his heart to call him maybe if I manage to guide him Allah would reward me how Allah orders me in the Quran and do good indeed Allah loves the doers of good so you have to do good to the disbelievers and if they don't show their enmity they're not hostile towards me he's a kaffir he's a Christian he's a Jew he's a Buddhist he's a Hindu but he does not show any hostility against my religion against my Quran I guess my Prophet is what should I do listen to what you should do Allah says in the Quran Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes from being righteous towards them Allah does not forbid you from being righteous towards them and acting justly towards them indeed Allah loves those who act justly so how to do we co-exist by this I have a neighbor who sells in his shop he's a disbeliever what should I do be kind to him give him gifts greet him in the morning but without saying assalamu alaikum never ever begin a cafe with assalamualaikum what happens if the kafir comes and says what do you do full stop don't continue this is the Islamic way of doing it so how did the prophet Allah deal with disbelievers how did he deal with kuffar to the prophet would not leave any stone unturned when it comes to dawah so he used to use different methods and change these ways and methods diversify them so that it would suit each and every individual people differ it's not one size that fits all some people their scientists I speak to them with science prove to them some people are more inclined to Sufism and things that are brought up by the heart so I speak to them about Jannah and Nar Helen fire and you know teach them about some people are social so I talked to them about the social system man and wife and children how we're supposed to deal with them and they are shocked and Amazed by the beauty of Islam some people are very uh technical so you show them that this is the system in Islam the Sharia prescribe punishment marriage system divorce system inheritance when there is a crime they said whoa this is Islam so it's not one size fits all the prophet used to know who to address and how to address them he used to visit them in their gathering places Idol worshipers this was in Mecca so not because there are Idols I'm not going why because this is Idol no the prophet used to go there because he has two evils and he is wording the biggest evil with the lesser evil so he used to go to their clubs to their gathering places and he used to recite the Quran and he used to give them gifts and accept their gifts all of this trying to soften their hearts and this is found in the teachings of the Prophet Allah when he said to Ali by Allah if Allah would guide one individual to Islam it is best for you then all the wealth in this world which was manifested in huge big camels this is what the Arabs understood it's like saying giving you a mebach it's a form of Mercedes what is Mercedes never mind so the prophet used to give dawah and he would not select what's the number of attendees 500 no it's too little I'm not coming this is not the way of the Prophet Allah may Allah have mercy on his soul he used to he's one of the greatest Scholars of all times he used to give his lessons in the Masjid and those attending maybe 10 15. and he's the grand Mufti but subhanallah when one of the scholars came from Syria albani thousands of people attended his class so you know there are these deviant people who would like to throw the seeds of corruption and hatred they went oh Sheikh you're the greatest Imam and only 10 15 people were coming to you and this year coming from Syria thousands are attending his class how is this Fair what did the sheriff say this is the favor of Allah he gives it to whomever he wishes he didn't say no he is this he is that I'm more no no no this is Allah's favor so the prophet Allah did not concentrate on Mass how many we need to do a lecture Workshop in Paris how many people um 100 no too little too little if less than this I'm not gonna come no wanted to give dawah to whomever to the extent he had a young boy who was a Jew and he used to serve the prophet Allah how can the prophet take a Jew servant this servant was for errands outside of the home you have grab I'm making emphasize no grab okay edit this huh so you have a service that is for doing this and this and this and you have another service that is less expensive and for pity things so the Jew was for pity things but he was a servant among the Servants of the Prophet saws one day the Jew felt sick young boy of 15 years of age what did the prophet what would you do change him call the agency and get me five more replacement huh no the prophet went to his house look at the mercy a Jew you want to kill this enemy but use your right hands where you drink please no left hands okay again next time I'm gonna use my PP gun so the prophet went to his home for what visiting a sick person and not letting this chance go away he stood at his head and said boy accept Islam there is no compromise no diplomacy he's on his deathbed he's gonna die khalas he knows I'm Prophet Muhammad he's seen the signs and the Miracles no time some of us may have parents who are non-muslim what have you done I'm trying Sheikh for the past 50 years 50 years and they have not accepted Islam and slowly slowly they're in their grave already no be assertive you want to save them from Hellfire so the prophet said boy accept Islam the boy looked at his father his biological father and the Jew said obey Abel qasim Panama the Jew is telling his son Jew accept Islam okay what about you father no no no I'm too old for this so the boy accepted Islam what did the prophet do as he came out of the house with his face lit radiating light so happy he said alhamdulillah who saved him from Hellfire because of me one boy but still the prophet is working hard to save all of humanity regardless you're a young boy you're an old man you're a tribe you're a nation [Music] his Mercy to Mankind not to Muslims only even to the disbelievers and the prophet Allah was kind merciful and easy going Muslims us when we mention any name what we say Allah may Allah curse him may Allah kill him may Allah make him a an example to others we use profanity we use bad words I'm talking about a disbeliever a kafir an enemy of Islam said yes but if you're going to make Dua and you want Allah to respond which is best oh Allah curse Netanyahu or Allah guide Netanyahu people say curse we don't want him to be guided no so if you're making Dua to Allah and Allah is capable of answering your Dua make Dua for them in an authentic Hadith may Allah be pleased with him came to the prophet sallallahu and he said o prophet of Allah I went to my tribe which is dos the tribe's name is Deus nowadays they're known as zahrani in Arabia everybody it's a well-known tribe so he was fed up he gave them dawah gave them that they would not respond so he came to the prophet he said o prophet of Allah I did my best to guide them to Islam and they refuse so curse them and ask Allah to punish them so the prophet went to the public Islam raise his hands the companion said Palace they are doomed the prophet is going to curse them and the prophet said oh Allah guide those to Islam oh Allah guide those to Islam a few weeks later all the whole tribe came in Islam the whole tribe could not do anything darwah from the prophet Sam so never ever underestimate the power of Dua and never ever underestimate the power of kindness and gentleness which the prophet came to the prophet Islam said oh prophet of Allah make Dua against the mushrik our enemies and the prophet said I was not sent as a person who curses I was sent as a Mercy to Mankind and he also said those who curse will not intercede on the day of judgment and will not be part of the martyrs the prophet salallahu understood exactly what Islam was and so did the companions from his actions to the extent Allah be pleased with the man with his father once said the prophet slaughtered a sheep in his house one day and he kept on asking his family did you give our neighbor the Jew did you give our neighbor the Jew and they said not yet not yet the prophet kept on repeating so when they complained we we heard that you want us to give us some time why are you so anxious in giving our neighbor who is a Jew from this sheep he said jibril the Archangel came down and he kept on repeating his advice that I am good to my neighbor until I thought he is going to make him one of those who inherit my father inherits my son inherits because of this repetition I thought that um maybe tomorrow an Ayah would be revealed your neighbor give him one third of your inheritance so this is why the prophet was kind to the Jew and the prophet sallallahu sallam despite the Jews animosity hatred and enmity towards the Muslims he was always good to them when the city of Khyber was conquered by the Muslims the Jews raised the white flag and said okay we surrender We're not gonna fight so because of their surrender the prophet said to them stay in your village in your city give this percentage of whatever comes from the land because your workers for us in it you take half we take half that's a good deal for them because you don't have to migrate to Syria or go to another country you know they stay in their own homes they work in their farms and they give half the income to live honorable life under the flagship of Islam and if you look how the prophet dealt with the Jews he never killed a single Jew except those who betrayed the covenants and the treaties and they aligned themselves with the allies of the disbelievers and the fire worshipers and the idol worshipers those who plotted against Islam from the Jews after writing their Covenants Palace you broke your treaty your execution is inevitable and even the prophet gave them the right to remain Jews the Christians you have the right to remain Christians there is no compulsion in changing your religion in Islam never and when I went to Indonesia I was shocked like Malaysia like Singapore like Thailand how many armies came to this land how many soldiers zero where is it that Islam was spread by the sword 250 million Muslims in Indonesia not a single soldier came why did they accept Islam because it's a religion of Truth and look at them look at you you're all Muslims by choice if you want to change your religion can you do that who's holding you back oh we're afraid of being headed no you're not in torobora anything you can do but you will never find people accepting Islam and leaving it with the grace of Allah no apostasy in Islam when there is no compulsion if you want to leave Islam you can leave nobody's going to kill you but people who are Muslims they would never leave Islam because it's natural it's in their DNA it's in their blood so they accept Islam and they die on Islam with the grace of Allah the prophet dealt with the disbelievers by giving them the right to possess so when Islam comes to a land or a country it does not repossess the land takes the homes and the property no it's yours you live there you give the taxation and the taxation you give can be less than the zakat I pay as a Muslim sometimes they pay less than the zakat I pay and the jizier the taxation by the way is taken only from working men women don't pay zakat uh children don't pay jizier old men monks don't pay jizya only working men and why do they pay Jessica because if an army comes and attacked them sit home relax drink your water and cappuccino we will defend you oh yes I would like to carry arms and defend my country so no no no you're paying us you said we fight and die for you for this Christian for this Jew he doesn't fight we fight in his defense what religion does this in many countries they recruit people from outside and give them nationality to die for their cause in Islam it's not like this the prophet Allah made sure that justice prevails one of the companions may Allah be pleased with him disputed with the Jew over a plot in Yemen he said this is mine he said no this is mine they went to the prophet Allah and the prophet asked do you have any proof as I said no I'm a Muslim so he gave the land to the Jew he doesn't have a proof he gave it to the Jew this is the justice of Islam even when they're harmful to us the prophet taught us how to be just how the Jew anyone who knows his name have you ever heard of him we don't even read buhari what do you read Harry Potter you have to change before it's too late cast a spell of black magic on the prophet sallam and this is a well-known fact everybody agrees upon it and then jibril and Mikhail came down and did Rukia and told the prophet where the magic spell is so he sent his companions took the magic spell burnt it and covered the well which was in thus the Hadith goes that the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam did not avenge himself he was told by Revelation this is the man who did the Black Magic on you he did not kill the man he did not even show it the Hadith says whenever the prophet met he would not show him any sign of anger or resentment and would not mention it why did he do this to me the least you could do is ask why did you do this no the prophet let it slip and go not like us everything I have to interrogate and I have to get a straight answer if I don't like the answer I will put you in trouble and the prophet Allah wanted all the goodness for them we then Sharia our boundaries so he would give them gifts accept their gifts the prophet Allah would respond to their Salam by saying walaikum they used to sneeze or pretend to sneeze in front of the Prophet saws so that the prophet would say they wanted to hear the prophet say and the prophet would not say that because there is a red line I deal with you I give you gifts I do this but no mercy is in Allah's hand and you will not get it Jannah that's why we deal with the disbelievers by saying may Allah cure your illness may Allah bless your wealth may Allah bless your children may Allah have mercy on you may Allah Grant you Jannah I've heard people say this to Hindus what are you doing this is no sorry this is something a slip of the tongue I'm used to doing this no we cannot ask Allah for Mercy for uh uh Jannah for them guidance yes I say hadak Allah may Allah guide you this is all permissible how much time five minutes who wrote this too much this is a problem um now without any doubt being kind to people opens their hearts and being kind to disbelievers open their chests for Islam Allah says in the Quran and not equal are the good deed and the bad repel Evil by that deed which is better and thereupon the one whom between you and him is enmity will become as though he was a devoted friend when you deal with the disbelievers with kindness despite their hostility hostility they will what they will think one day that why is he doing this and this would open their hearts the prophet Allah accepted gifts from head of States like when he gave the prophet salallahu concubines and a mule the prophet did not say oh this is from a cafe return it no he accepted it the najashi of Abyssinian sent the prophet sallam a golden ring with a stone the prophet accepted it but he cannot wear gold so he gave it to his granddaughter Umama the king of Isla gave the prophet Assam a white mule so the prophet sent him a gift a garment that is expensive in return as an exchange of gifts okay there of Domin a suit and all of this is accepted in Islam Romar himself gave one of his brothers siblings in Mecca who was a kafir mushrik he gave him a gift so as long as this gift opens hearts then you should do this and try it it's a good thing the prophet even accepted the invitation of a Jewish woman in Medina she invited the prophet he said I slaughtered the RAM and I want you and your companions to come and eat from it the prophet did not reject it he said no no no you're a Jew no he came when he came he did not ask is this the biha is this Halal do you have stamp Halal certificate no she's from he did not ask her oh you're a Jew you deal in interest and mortgage and you take people's money unlawfully is this bought by harammani no no the prophet never asked he said Bismillah ate although it had poison but he took one mersal and spit it out and he said that Allah made the ram speak to me and tell me that it had poison in it so when the prophet deals with disbelievers in this kindness is he doing this because they have blue eyes and blonde hair no the Arabs had black hair and black eyes yeah you know my my intention of saying this did he do this because he wanted to be close to them the only reason was to call them to Islam and he dealt with the disbelievers with the kuffar in trade he bought from them he sold them he borrowed from Jews as well he used them as guide when he traveled from Makkah to Medina Abu Bakr they used a mushrik a disbeliever but he was a good guide he knew the the routes so he used him to guide them to Medina and I will conclude with this story again dealing with them has to be according to the rules and the Galatians of sharia we do not Empower them we do not allow them to have authority over the Muslims no matter how good they are Abu Muslim was the ruler of Basra may Allah be pleased with him is one of the great Companions of the Prophet saws so he was the ruler when pleased with him was the Khalifa every six months the Khalifa summons his rulers come show me your books show me the revenues the expenditures so that I can audit whether you're building a palace for yourself or getting a private jet I have to see this with my own eyes so Abu Musa came with his books records you know accounting and while in the Masjid Umar was looking very nice Excel sheet mashallah Microsoft 10 very good wow so everything was kosher everything was good he liked it and then he asked of course he knows Abu Musa did not do this because he didn't go to college so he said where is your accountant he said he's outside whoa that's strange why didn't you bring him in the Masjid he said he's a cafe he's a Christian he said [Music] why didn't you take a Muslim why did you hire a non-muslim didn't you hear Allah says saying all you who believe do not take the Jews and Christians as allies so Abu Musa said Khalifa may Allah be pleased with you he has his religion and I have his knowledge his religion is between him and Allah so Umar said I will not honor them when Allah has accumulated them I will not give them Pride when Allah azzawajal has insulted them I will not get them close when Allah told us to make them as far as possible Abu Musa said your highness he wouldn't say I'm just putting some spices on the story so that you don't sleep so he said your eminence basala bookkeeping cannot be done without him the guy is an expert in bookkeeping he knows every single penny that goes in and out so Romar said one statement he said the Christian yeah I mean the accountant is that um what does that mean go kill the Christian no he said to him the Christian is dead what will you do if he dies you will take a replacement khalas consider him that fire him and hire someone who is a Muslim and with this I conclude my whatever you call it talk or lecture or a bedtime story and we learn from it how to deal with the other the non-muslims with respect with care and with a lot of Mercy to call them to Islam not because they are citizens or because they look nice or because no the only reason that I'm talking to you is because you're a non-muslim and I'm trying to call you to Islam if there's no hope in you that I'll go utilize my time with someone else and Allah Knows Best foreign how did the prophet Allah deal with wrongdoers with Sinners and this is an important topic because we are one of them and we're surrounded by them so the best balance and the best way and strategy to deal with such segment of society is by following the footsteps of the prophet and This falls under the category of the Hadith every son of Adam is sinful but the best of sinfuls are those who frequently repent to Allah azzawajal the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to highlight and never water down the gravity of sins this is something we have to always keep in mind when I see a sinner part of being a good Muslim is not to say no no it's okay no problem you killed someone who's okay you stole money it's okay you fornicate have boyfriend girlfriend no problem no you have to clarify to them that gravity and seriousness of the sin may Allah be pleased with her once was talking with the prophet Allah we chit chat and talk with our spouses and Sofia may Allah be pleased with her who was a Jew and was among the last to marry the prophet Allah she was beautiful so Aisha was a bit jealous so when her name was mentioned she said oh prophet of Allah it is sufficient that Sophia is this pointing to that she is what short the prophet did not let it slide though he loved Aisha he adored more than anyone else he said you have uttered a statement if it were to be mixed with the water of the sea it would have spoiled it it would have been mixed with it of how bad you have said do you think Aisha would ever backbite again never alas she learned her lesson and if you have a mosquito you know mosquito in the house how would you kill it if you use a cannon it will die alongside everyone in the room the whole house would collapse so when you deal with problems you take the right solution if you have a headache and you take a whole box of Panadol you'll die yes you will be cured from your headache but you'll die so you have to take the right dose and this is what the prophet Allah taught us when we sin we when we see sinful people we have to deal with them according to the size of the sin not because they send khalas killed them no a man came to the prophet Allah and he said o prophet of Allah I did a sinful act Purify Me and flogged me or give me head the prophet did not ask him this is one narration in another narration the man clarified it more elaborate and he said o prophet of Allah I passed by a house I saw a woman I did everything with that woman except intercourse so I touched I hugged I kissed and blah blah blah blah so the prophet did not answer him and the prophet prayed that Isha the following day Fajr he said where is the man who asked me yesterday so the man stood up so the prophet said did you pray with us the five daily prayers the man said yes so the prophet said Allah has forgiven your sins whoa if someone comes to me and asks me this question what do I do I kick him in the stomach and then punch him in the face before I answer him why you don't fear Allah you did this you yes it's a sin but deal with the sin according to the circumstances and according to the consequences you want do you want the man to run and said okay if I'm sinful I might as well finish with the intercourse go then go to third base why would wait no you want to bring him to you and the prophet said Allah revealed this Ayah subhanallah for this sinful person Allah reveals and establish prayer at the two ends of the day and at the approach of the night indeed Good Deeds do away with misdeeds how beautiful our religion is and how beautiful did the prophet treat the sinful how do we treat someone who smokes or someone who watches pornography or some someone who lies all the time we look at them as insects and we would like to squash them why because I'm better I am a man who fears Allah I am a student of knowledge I'm a Sheikh all of your sins are going to hell no this is not the way of the Prophet Allah and again the prophet did not highlight sinners he would not go and expose them in public as we do today in social media one sinful act and everybody is talking about this sinner as if he committed exposing him putting photos of him putting his news this is not the way of the Prophet Allah when someone commits a major sin such as bribes may Allah be pleased with him companion he was appointed by the prophet Allah to collect the sadaqah so every ruler has workers who go to the Farms so mango tree image your department so how much he says five tons what is the car this much okay Bismillah they give him I find a herd of sheep how many okay five thousand a little bit you have to give this much he takes so he collects zakat from different regions this is your zakat okay very good and this was given to me excuse me given to you as what they're your relatives no no no that when I came they gave me as hospitality this much money the prophet was angry so he came to the Masjid and said why do people whom we hire them go to do erenza for us and say this is yours and this is mine wouldn't they sit in their mother's house if they're not appointed as rulers and look does anyone give them money yeah for example I'm in a government office I'm a minister people give me tickets people give me laptops people give me expensive pens and I say I like hadiya I like gifts I like this if I wasn't in my position if I was in my home retired fired would anyone give me one Ringgit no so the gift is given to you because of what your position that's why the rulers in Islam and the official workers would never accept a gift because they know that this is given to their position now the prophet when he said this Allah did he come on the pulpit of the Masjid and said I did this and this and expose him never the prophet would never mention Sinners by name he was always beat round the bush someone said this someone did that but he would never expose people because when you expose people you demolish them you end their life and reputation and the prophet would never do this this is how we should deal with sinners now how should we actually deal with sinners in softness or in heart in a hard way hmm what sleeping they're hungry bring them food their eyes too too much how should we deal with Sinners softly or in hardship and in hard way ah some say softy some say in a hard way some say there's a difference of opinion always when you're asked about a question in Islam say there is a difference of opinion Thomas you're safe holders of Islam this opinion and someone comes out with another opinion you lose but if you say in between khalas you're safe in the Sunnah when you read it you will find that there are cases where the Prophet dealt softly Allah with the sinners but also you will find cases where he was very hard so how do we differentiate by knowledge those who had knowledge the prophet was hard on them no excuse for you you're knowledgeable those who did not know the prophet would take it easy on them for example a man comes to the Masjid the prophet is sitting message of what of Medina the prophet is imagine someone coming from the desert while the prophet is sitting his companions and the guy said and starts to urinate urinating the Masjid what will you do BB gun shoot him this is what the companions wanted to do they all went to beat the man what did the prophet says leave him leave him the prophet is urinating in the message leave him do not cut him off because if you cut him off he would spread urine all over the place running away from you while if you leave him it is contained in a very limited space so they left him after the man who finished the prophet said pour a bucket of water on it now the ground is Pebbles and sand urine is 200 milliliters the bucket is three four liters overwhelms it becomes pure this is for those who have vuswas oh Sheikh I have a drop of urine maybe this splashes me water pure water overwhelmed the najasa dissolves it it takes it away but this is not our topic so I will leave that here so the prophet ordered the man to come now it's teaching time where's your stick no stick no stick is it my nephew these massages were not made for such filth they were made for Quran vikr and Salat end of story he urinated in the Masjid of the prophet in front of him no problem he's ignorant another man may Allah be pleased with him there in prayer a man sneezes foreign but the problem is what are you doing so the companion started looking at him in a when you angrily look so he noticed that he spoke again why are you looking at me like this he shouted in the message during prayer so they started clapping on their thighs and he shut up so he said okay after the Salat what happened the prophet is called him and said my nephew the Salat is only good for thicker or an and supplication and Dua so that's it end of story in a narration either this man or the old Nomad who urinated in the following prayer they heard him say Allah forgive me and Muhammad and don't forgive anyone with us and the prophet after the Salat smiled and said you have limited Allah's huge mercy no include everybody else so this shows you how your kindness with Sinners with wrong doers with ignorant people would help but when The Sinner is knowledgeable when he's ashamed you can't be soft with him you have to show him that the caliber of your sin is not accepted from someone like you Abdullah may Allah be pleased with a man with his father comes to the prophet with clothes died in Saffron you know there's afro you put in food makes it yellow the idol worshipers used to dye their food because of the scent the smell and the color it looked you know prestigious so he came to the prophet Islam once and the prophet look how he speaks to him one of the most companions who wrote the Hadith and narrated The Hadith so he said to Prophet to him did your mother order you to wear this into the Arabs when you speak about their mother I'm not a child or prophet of Allah but the prophet intended to be harsh because you're knowledgeable you are one of the rulema one of the companions Scholars and you wear this immediately without any debate or argument what did Abdullah say prophet of Allah shall I wash them did not argue I know my mistake I acknowledge he's knowledgeable so shall I wash them the prophet said no burn them so that would be a lesson to you losing such valuable money because of your sin you should not wash them burn them likewise one of the first to accept Islam tortured in Islam you know how he was beaten up in Makkah and his story is well known one day in an argument with Bilal Bilal is a black Abyssinian slave bought by Abu bakr's money may Allah be pleased with them and set free but he's a Slave So In the Heat of the argument he said you are the son of a black woman so my mother is black what color is bilal's Mother block but he did not say this as a description he said it as an insult so the prophet went Allah went to the prophet Allah and said this is what Abu dhar said o prophet of Allah and I did not reply the prophet saw in the Buddha and he said you are a man of ignorance and he said oh prophet of Allah after this age I'm in my 40s and 50s I've migrated for Allah's sake I did this I did that he said yes he's your brother what did Abu dhar do he went to Bilal to get even to avenge himself why did you report me to the prophet no he placed his for his cheek on the sand on the ground and he said put your foot on my other cheek you son of a black woman now he's not insulting now he's praising him says now you're the son of a black woman and you put your foot on my cheek Bilal went okay no no no no that's not Bilal he said may Allah forgive you my brother stand up stand up you're my brother this is how the prophet treated those who were knowledgeable ignorant people you 'll find hundreds of hadiths that shows you the diplomacy and wisdom a man comes a young man comes to the prophet he said oh prophet of Allah allow me to commit Zina to fornicate to have a girlfriend the companions wanted to beat the man you have no shame in your face asking the prophet like this the prophet leave him leave him let me talk to him so he said my son do you have a mother said yes do you like this for your mom she said no said likewise people don't like it for their mothers do you want this to your daughter no do you want this to your sister no do you understand your aunt no so the prophet kept on saying likewise people don't want this to their daughters their sisters or aunties Etc and then he put his hand on his chest and this is physical contact which is very important some of us always keep himself to himself nobody is going to accuse you of sexual harassment touch the brother a brother touch the brother and hold his hand make him feel that you have compassion and love for him the prophet lays his hand on his chest and he said to him oh Allah forgive his sin and purify his heart and protect his private part meaning from falling to Haram and then man never had these thoughts back again this is the way of the Prophet Allah and unfortunately we fail to do this in our daily lives we always jump to conclusion we always assume and then we apologize this is wrong make sure before you make a mistake once the prophet saw good dates he said I don't remember having good dates he's asking he doesn't want to jump to conclusion so Bella said yes oh prophet of Allah we had two tsar of bad dates not good quality so I took it to the market replaced it with one star oh Prophet said oh this is clear go and return it so you have to fix the sin and he explained it to him this always teaches us to give the benefit of the doubt you see something wrong ask I saw Chicago with a beautiful blonde what should I do you know corrupted one of my nieces who's not practicing is born I was in London and I was with my niece if you see me what would you say she's my niece I'm giving her tawa I'm trying my level best no serious she's my niece she's I'm her uncle but what I do now you jump the gun and like all social media put it on Twitter Instagram is that no this is Haram on you Allah will hold you accountable I will hold you accountable on the day of judgment people call me and say sure forgive me I back bite you and now I realize my sin I ask you for forgiveness on live TV I said I'm not gonna forgive you why Allah always forgives for me if I give you forgiveness you will continue to do sins major sins everybody will say no no I will backbite I will slander I will and then ask for forgiveness I'm not going to forgive and this is the way of saying by the way when people ask him for forgiveness he said no you committed the major sin ask Allah for forgiveness don't ask me so always don't jump the gun don't assume always think positive maybe he has this excuse maybe he has that excuse 6 7 10 20 30. until seventy and if you run out of excuses say maybe he has the 71st that I don't know of so I give him still the benefit of the doubt the prophet Allah used to how much time do you have the prophet used to teach sinners if they did not know yeah he teach don't criticize don't belittle what is this you don't know subhanallah how long you've been a Muslim all of your life and you don't know this you are an ignorant no no no no a man comes into the Masjid praise to raka comes to the prophet says go and pray again you did not pray oops okay the guy he prays to rakazi comes go and pray again you did not pray the third time the guy raises the white flag colors I don't know how to pray teach me now you're ready now I can teach you to do this and this and this and this it would stick in his mind in a nice way without making fun of him without making a joke or this or that and this is a very critical issue the amount of knowledge in Iman in your chest sometimes might be your worst enemy because Allah has given you Iman and has given you knowledge when you look down at people and think that I'm better than them this is arrogance and the one with an ant weight of arrogance in his heart will not enter Jannah so this is very serious but on the flip side a lot of the righteous people go to sinners and they say oh you're better than me you're closer to Allah than me he's an open sinner yeah but I don't know maybe he has something between him and Allah and I am this I am that so they put themselves down and they put the Sinners up and this is also not right some people the first category they give tax fear to people because they think of themselves as a higher level a better caliber and those other side they would think that the whole society is better than them so regardless of the sins and the munkar that is spreading this is okay they're better than me and this is an imbalance a man from the sons of Israel the prophet tells us in the authentic Hadith used to drink wine and he had a righteous friend and he used to tell him don't drink wine this is Haram this is Haram and when he did not stop after so many attempts he said wallahi Allah will never forgive you so Allah said who is this who swears that I would not forgive I have forgiven his sins and I have canceled all of your good deeds so never judge people never accuse people or think that you are better than them even sinners who openly sin the prophet prohibited us from cursing them once went and stonedia a woman who committed adultery and was pregnant the prophet said go until you deliver she came after eight months seven months with a child she said Purify Me I committed adultery he said go until you suckle the child until it can be able to eat solid foods she came after a year and a half or two years if she had not come nobody would look for her but she could not tolerate the burning fire in her heart because of the sin so she came with a child holding a uh some bread in his hand and eating it and she said oh prophet of Allah Purify Me So the prophet ordered her to be stoned they stoned her and Khalid was affected by the blood when it gushed out of her wounds and he got some blood on her so he cursed her and the prophet knew about that and he said Khalid do not curse her by Allah she repented the repentance if a tax collector repented it Allah would forgive him this is hitting two stones with one two birds with one stone so the prophet is showing how important her repentance was and how grave the sin of tax collector is but this is not our topic so I will not go there um the prophet sallallahu Allah too much material again who wrote this no no Salaam sometimes would order us to boycott sinners as in the case of the three who did not go with him in the Battle of tabuk and among them was a cabin the poet of the Prophet as mentioned in Surah now he ordered the companions to boycott them for 50 days and this had your is only valid when the consequences are positive so it doesn't work with everybody it's the easiest thing for us oh Sheikh my brother smokes so I boycotted him I did not speak with him for five years why because he's sinful and my sister doesn't wear the nikab so I don't speak with her and my father goes to movies so I don't of course nothing they don't have movies may Allah protect this country so I did it by cutting people is very easy you can boycott people easily this doesn't solve your problem you only boycott when there is so a father May boycott his son who doesn't want to pray in the Masjid I am a father he by Nature loves me he needs my money he needs my house so I boycott him this has an impact but if I boycott someone a neighbor or the hell with you I don't care so boycotting is one of the means of dealing with sinners and it was executed by the companions be pleased with a man with his father once was narrating a Hadith he said the prophet Allah said do not prevent women from attending prayers in the Masjid who said this foreign who said this how do you say it did not understand English who said this hello who said this the prophet Allah is it that difficult the prophet Allah to assalam said do not prevent women from attending this prayers in the Masjid who said this Bilal the son of Abdullah heard his father say this out of jealousy said wallahi we will prevent them what did Abdullah say he cursed him and said the most bad words the narrator of the Hadith I've never heard Abdullah say these words ever in my life he cursed his own son and he said I say the prophet said do not prevent them and you say Allah he will prevent them go I will never speak to you and he never spoke to his own son despite his apologies sending people until Abdullah was on his Deathbed and his son came father weeping forgive me Wallah I said it out of jealousy I did not reject the Hadith of the prophet and he would not speak to him until he died so this shows you the importance of Sunnah when people have knowledge do such things yes we have to treat it in the same uh extremity and gravity that of course this goes without saying that boycotting your brother Muslim for more than three days is not permissible unless it is for a religious valid reason and not any reason that comes to your mind is valid you have to ask ulama you have to ask you is this valid should I boycott should I do this so many times people come to me and say my sister married a Hindu should I boycott her what of course she is either a kafir or a fornicator if she believes that this marriage is Haram yet she's living in his house and having intercourse she's a zanya she's a fornicator but if she believes that the marriage is halal from a non-muslim she's a cafe she's an apostate even if she prays five times and goes for and goes for umra and gives charity she's a cafe so boycott her give her give her advice warn her show everything to her she still in Defiance boycott her and yeah Annie almost anything else so the prophet Allah ordered us to change evil with our hands if not possible with our tongues rhetoric if not possible with our heart who has the ability to change within his hands the ruler only or whom he appoints the father the husband they have the power in Islam to change with their hands you and I no so I see something wrong I do not change it with my hand and if I do they put me in jail and I am a criminal this is not my authority it's the authority of the ruler the Muslim judge the police force not mine but if you're a ruler this is your responsibility if I'm not a ruler what can I do I speak I wish you can do this you can Allah says he listens alhamdulillah win-win he doesn't listen win lose I gain reward with Allah he loses with Allah so I did my due diligence if I'm unable to change with the wrong doers by hand or by rhetoric then I change it by heart how I'm in a gathering and they're playing music I can't speak because I can't change it of course because they will put me in jail I can't speak because they might abuse me physically what do I do I have to go to the bathroom and go home call us your job is done because I cannot do anything other than that someone drinking alcohol his eyes are red and he has a revolver in his hand he's doing this between the eyes so I shouldn't do it no rhetoric here would kill me and this is the worst evil so refrain change it with your heart and stand up and go in conclusion with all what you have heard this morning what do we learn number one we have increased love to The Prophet by knowing his Sera by knowing how a beautiful human being he was we love him more number two we want Allah to love us we have to follow his footsteps Allah we have to follow his footsteps if we want Allah to love us as well thirdly you have to walk the talk you can't learn this and let it slip no you have to now this is upon you on the day of judgment Allah would ask you why didn't you treat your wife in a good way after you heard how the prophet dealt with his wives why don't you treat your children and grandchildren with compassion and love and teach them after you learned how the prophet did that why didn't you deal with the kaffar or the wrong doers in the same fashion that the prophet dealt with them oh I can't share I'm overwhelmed no this is not an excuse Allah sent you the prophet Allah the best of his creation so that you can follow him and do what he does because he is a human being but he is the best of all human beings Muhammad"
