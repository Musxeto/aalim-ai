  "transcript": "sumania from the UK so my question is sometimes probably on some other card sometimes I'm disconnect one word so for example saying so listen to my solar I didn't see the difference what was the difference between the two um instead of saying Allah will be like and connecting the whole world I say Al apples and I say this this is a negligible uh pause of course it's not recommended to have such a pause but if it happens unwillingly or due to difficulties and pronunciation there's no problem the the Fatiha is still valid and Allah knows best you have to practice and practice and practice till you reach Perfection Within illah thank you"
