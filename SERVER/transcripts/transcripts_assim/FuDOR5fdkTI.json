  "transcript": "says that a woman is desperate for a child and a large L did not bless them with one so she would like to opt for IVF and the majority of scholars the contemporary scholars say that this is permissible providing that the sperm is from the husband and the embryo is from the wife and the pregnancy takes place in the wife's womb so there is no third party involved and it is needed and it's a must it's highly recommended that this is done in an institution where sperms cannot be mixed because this is very vital and important and highly preferable and recommended that the treatment of the AI via IVF would be done by a female doctor so that we would not expose the woman to non muharram men without necessity but if this is not possible because there aren't any women who are qualified to do such work then in Charlotte's it's permissible but the previous conditions are essential the sperm is from the husband embryos from the wife and the wife is the one who's carrying a child in her womb and may allow social random the children that would satisfy them in this life"
