  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah and welcome to this first class in the first semester of this Academy regarding the topic dealing with f or Juris Pence this is an essential and important branch of Islamic Sciences because the first thing that a person is going to be questioned about on the day of judgment is his prayer and it shows us that whoever is in need of being saved on the day of judgment must know his religion the prophet saidat whomever Allah Wills goodness for him he will give him in religion he will give him understanding and comprehension in Islam and this is why this F is very important now if you go and look all over the world all books of Juris Prudence or F will begin with the chapter dealing with purification known as and why is that as mentioned earlier the first thing a person is going to be held accountable for on the day of judgment is his prayer and his prayer has conditions and one one of the most important conditions of prayer is to be in the state of wo known as Evolution or purification so in order to have your prayer valid then we have to have the process valid and you can't have that without knowing how to purify yourself PU ification according to the linguistic definition is cleanliness or keeping away from dirt and filth but when you come to the legislative and Islamic definition of it it's different I could be wearing garments with oil mark and Greece and I still can pray with that some would say and argue but this is not clean said yes but it has nothing to do withar that renders your prayer valid or invalid so when we come to the Islamic definition or the legislative definitions definition of tahara we find that it is divided into two types spiritual and physical so the spiritual part is definitely not needed here because it's not related to our subject and this is related to Islam Muslims are pure they are non-muslims they are are NIS they are impure spiritually because they don't worship Allah the almighty as he directed them and this is mentioned in uh Allah says oh you who believe indeed the poths are unclean they are NIS and the word in Arabic used is NIS or Nas and this indicates that this is a spiritual part of Purity now when it comes to the physical part this is the definition that Judah used to define what is so in Arabic they say and it rhymes which means that the legislative definition of is divided into again two types one is the metaphorical meaning which is something that we cannot see physically and this is called the ritual impurity the ritual impurity has to be uplifted so that my prayer is valid but what is meant by ritual impurity we have a major ritual impurity when we have a minor ritual impurity which we will come in to discuss later on as we go through these classes inshallah so the major ritual impurity if I have a person who who already has the ritual uh uh Purity and someone who has the ritual impurity if I weigh them they're the same weight if I look at them they the same physique what's the difference it's something that is ritual so if this person has intercourse he becomes in the state of ritual major ritual impurity or if he ejaculates or if it's a woman who has her mensis or she has postnatal bleeding once she's clean and the bleeding stops she cannot pray the person who had ejaculation or intercourse he cannot pray unless or until he takes a total bath known asul once he does this he washes his whole body as we will come to describe this ritual major ritual impurity is uplifted and he can pray so this is the first part which is the second part is the minor ritual impurity and this is when someone relieves himself in another uh um expression we say when someone breaks his woodu his Evolution either by passing wind urinating defecating sleeping or eating camels meat and there are difference of opinions to other issues but these are the main five ones so if this happens this person after relieving uh uh himself after answering the call of nature he cannot pray what should I do you have to perform Evolution so do I have to take a full bath and shower no no no no you just have to follow the sequence and the procedure of wo and this is known as Evolution or woodo that uplifts the minor ritual impurity and all of this revolves around p ification of the the the the person before performing Salat this is so what's the other part the other part is a physical one and what do you mean by physical one it's something I can see or can I can smell or I hope I don't have to taste and this is when there is impurity an impurity on one of the three substances my body my clothes or the area I'm praying on if there is an impurity I have to remove that and clean it before my prayer can be accepted how to do that by washing it off with water H interesting so if I have a stain of oil I cannot pray said I'm talking about impurities not dirty things impurities refer to what is known as NIS such as urine drops such as feis among other things that we will come to discuss later on with the grace of Allah so these are the two types of impurities the metaphorical one that has to be be uplifted either by or by performing woodo or Evolution and the physical one which has to be cleaned and washed off whether it's on my body I have to wash it off and it has no impact on my woodo but I have to wash it off or on my clothes and I have to wash it off or on the spot I'm praying on and I have to either change my position or wash it off or put a barrier on top of it so that I would not be praying on something that is [Music] [Music] impure for for"
