  "transcript": "yes so I'm very wor worried if something is considered as smoking the religion or not so there was a guy who who said in a discussion while while uh he said to defend what she is is that it is somebody who does nothing so if one speaks about what this guy said and laughs with one's parents is it considered mocking the religion or not well if this guy if this guy is mocking all Scholars of Islam this means that he's mocking the religion but if he's mocking sheim not the respected other sh and Scholars and Di and students of knowledge rather this individual I hate his guts welcome to the club many people hate my guts Sumi so if this individual hates my guts he doesn't like me and makes fun of me he's sinful but is he making fun of Islam no he's making fun of this poor individual and Allah will hold him accountable on the day of judgment laughing at his remarks is not kufur if he is mocking all Scholars because they Embrace and call to Allah's way and they are uh an advocate of Islam and Muslim then he is an apostate mocking the religion and Allah Knows Best"
