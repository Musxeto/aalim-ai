  "transcript": "Ali from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh there is this hadith where the Prophet ï·º was praying the Fajr prayer and the companions who were praying behind him were reciting something behind Imam even in a loud raka'a is mandatory and if not can you please explain this hadith? JazakAllah Wa Jazakum. This hadith was narrated by Abu Hurairah may Allah be pleased with him and in one of the versions of the hadith the Prophet ï·º said do not recite behind the Imam prohibited from doing such a thing afterwards. So from this hadith the scholars say that and this is mentioned in Sifat Salatu An-Nabiyyi ï·º the description of the prayer of the Prophet ï·º written by Al-Imam Sheikh Al-Albani may Allah have mercy on his soul. From this hadith the scholars came with the conclusion that this hadith was abrogated. Yes read that as well and if we look into the collection of a hadith governing this issue we will come to the conclusion that the school of thought of Imam Malik is the most reliable and authentic of all and this is what Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah may Allah have mercy is a fard, it's a pillar in every rak'ah for the Imam, for the follower and for the person individually praying alone if they are praying it silently. There is no dispute in that among the vast majority of scholars. However in loud rak'ahs such as the first two rak'ahs of Fajr, the first two rak'ahs of Maghrib, the first two rak'ahs of Isha, it is a pillar upon the Imam and upon the person praying alone. As for the follower, the recitation of his Imam suffices him. What if the Imam or what if the follower wanted to recite it when the Imam makes a pause? Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah says that this is totally fine but if he doesn't do it intentionally his prayer is valid and this is what I am inclined to follow and Allah knows best. you"
