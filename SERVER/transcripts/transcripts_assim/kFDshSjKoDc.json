  "transcript": "As far as the non-Muslims are concerned, if the non-Muslim knows what is awaiting from them in Akara that they're going to go to hell and a prophet said the least fire, the least pain if it reaches your soul, your brains would boil. So if the non-Muslims know what is awaiting for them in the next life even if they the most poorest man in the world they will think they in Jenna correct because they know what's going to happen there you're a little bit hot you know we want air condition we want this we cannot stay without it there the least punishment if the fire touches your soul your brains would boil imagine So even the worst human being who's a non-Muslim would consider this as paradise. So this is the explanation of the hadith of the prophet of Sai Muslim volume number 7 had number 7417. The glorious Quran the last and final revelation of Allah subhana wa ta'ala. It has the solutions for the problem of humanity. If it is a revelation and last and final and after that no other revelation will come. One of the requirement is it should have the solution for the problems of humankind. And the glorious Quran it is the solution for the problems of humankind. It is the furan it is the criteria to judge right from wrong. The glorious Quran has the solution for racism. Allah says in surah chapter number 49 verse number 13. Oh humankind, we have created you from a single pair of male and female and have divided you into nations and tribes so that you shall recognize each other not that you shall despise each other and the most honored in the sight of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala is the person who has tawa the criteria for judgment in the sight of Allah subhanana wa ta'ala. It's not color. It is not age. It's not wealth. It's not sex. It's not race. It is tawa. It's god consciousness. It's piety. So Islam has the solution for racism. Islam has the solution of terrorism. One verse of the Quran is sufficient to prove that Islam is against terrorism and has the solution for terrorism. Allah says in surah maida chapter number 5 verse number 32. If anyone kills a human being unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption in the land it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity. Allah says if any human being whether Muslim or non-Muslim kills any other human being whether Muslim or non-Muslim unless it be for murder or for spreading corruption it is as though he has killed the whole of humanity. And the verse continues, if anyone saves any other human being, whether Muslim or non-Muslim, it is as though he has saved the whole of humanity. So this one verse of the Quran is sufficient to solve the problem of terrorism. Quran has the solution for inequality, for injustice. Allah says in surah 4 verse number 135 that oh you believe stand out for justice as witness to Allah subhanana wa ta'ala even if it be against yourself against your relatives against your mother or father against your parents whether they be rich or poor Allah protects all so when you are giving witness to Allah subhananaa irrespective whether the witness will go against yourself against your parents against your relatives the rich for the poor. Allah protects all. Quran has the solution for alcoholism and drug addiction. Allah says in the Quran in Surah Maida chapter number 5 verse number 19, oh you believe most certainly intoxicated and gambling dedication of stones, divation of arrows. Please accept this handwork. Abstain from this handwork that you may prosper. So the solution for alcoholism is it is prohibited. It's haram."
