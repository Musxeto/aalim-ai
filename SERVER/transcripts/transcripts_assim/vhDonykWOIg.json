  "transcript": "and allah rabbul aalameen rasul allah wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD he wore a suit I mean novena muhammadin wa ala alihi wa sahbihi oh man yesterday we had he was the narration that he lay me Dean assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato and welcome to a new episode of ask Rudy where I will try my best to answer the questions that I have knowledge in answering insha'Allah and as we are waiting for your phone calls to come through I have a number of emails waiting to be answered and this is an email from a sister in the UK she says that in her university there is a group of students who have formed an association which holds Islamic lectures for about 15 to 20 minutes and each sister has registered her name those especially who are interested in giving such advice and giving such naseeha to the other sisters now she's saying that she is hesitant to apply though the other sisters are encouraging her to do so and she says that she knows that it is not to propagate Deen to the others unless you reform yourself your family and relatives so how can she compromise how can she behave in such a situation well first of all sisters Akuma hear me Allah says I'll reward you for your fear from saying something without knowledge and this is something that allows the Rogell has encouraged us to do and allah azzawajal has warned us from speaking without knowledge as mentioned in chapter 7 verse 33 where Allah tells us about the four forbidden things and on the top of the list is to say what you do not have knowledge of one takodana lying mallet on the moon however there are other hadith where the Prophet Ali salatu salam encourages us to propagate islam even if it was one verse of the quran he encourages people to deliver what they have learnt exactly as they had learnt it because those listening to them might be more knowledgeable and might have more comprehension to what they had learnt than them therefore it would not be logical to ask you to wait until you reform yourself your relatives your loved ones your neighbors your family and then after doing that you would propagate this is not logical simply because the Prophet Holly salatu salam did not do that once he was instructed to deliver the message he did Shaitaan did not come to him and say listen your uncle Abu Lahab did not accept Islam your uncle Abu Talib did not accept Islam this and that no he immediately delivered the message now this doesn't mean that you should not work on yourself you should work on yourself you should try to fix your shortcomings and to avoid them as much as possible but this might not be it would immediate effect this may take a little bit longer than you think however this would not prevent you from delivering from preaching from advising others with things that you have knowledge and you know that you can benefit people with it and if it were only for those who are perfect to preach and not for anyone else nobody no but no one would have ever thought of preaching or advising or lecturing others there for 15 to 20 minutes it's not a long period you can prepare something and you can also after preparing it ensure that you're the first to apply it on yourself so if you're going to take a talk if you're going to talk about night prayer make a 15 to 20 minute talk or adults or a lesson or a lecture but before giving it try to apply it in yourself try you yourself to offer night prayer and likewise in all the other issues as well"
