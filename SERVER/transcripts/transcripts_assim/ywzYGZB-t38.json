  "title": "The advice of Prophet ﷺ‎ to Muadh Ibn Jabal - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "answers we all know that by ask huda um youth talk mercy to the worlds amongst others on various tv channels and radio channels such as al-huda peace tv zad tv and saudi channel 2. on the invitation of local and international organizations shif asim also travels off into europe asia and middle east for delivering islamic lectures most of which can be found on the youtube uh before i hand it over to sheik we would also like to welcome jenny mark from cnn who has joined us today uh for the lecture uh shear cuts over to you i'll stop sharing at my end [Music] the topics muslims talk about are so many and the benefit of discussing these topics would be realized when we can feel and sense the change that such topics introduce to our lives i chose with the grace of allah to speak to you about a hadith a prophetic saying over an incident that took place 15 centuries ago most muslims know it by heart but the lessons that we should learn from such a hadith are many and the impact over our lives is enormous this hadith was reported the hadith was narrated by muhammad took my hand and said to me o muhat by allah i love you by allah i love you he repeated it twice so muad reciprocated and said and i love you as well o prophet of allah then the prophet wasalam said to murad um i advise you do not forget at the end of every prayer to say allah help me to remember you give thanks to you and worship you in the best way full stop end of the hadith that's nice but as they say a big loaf of bread but where's the beef so the dua is great the supplication the vacation is great the relationship between the prophet of some and his companion is great so what's the big deal well this is what we will attempt insha allah in the coming minutes to try and take a glimpse of how beautiful this hadith is now who is this individual whom the prophet allah is takes his hand and swears not only once but twice that he loves him who is this man never heard of him or adam jabal don't know him so who is this person well a spoiler alert he was one of the head of his tribes when the people of medina went to mecca on hajj on what is known as to give the pl their pledge of allegiance to the prophet allah and invite him to migrate to medina so they sent their invoice to represent all the different tribes of medina was one of them imagine that he was only 16 years of age yet he was a representative of his tribe he came and gave the pledge of allegiance historians describe him as being a tall handsome man with a sound intellect and he was obeyed among these people being 16 and having all these attributes in you means that you're one heck of a guy now not only he was obeyed by his people imagine that muad is the very one of the very few allowed to give fatwa at the lifetime of the prophet which means that this person is not something to take lightly there were many companions and scholars among the companions yet at the time of the prophet he was the reference you had the problem you go ask him but to delegate this to muat means that this person was one among the elite when it came to proper knowledge about islam quran and sunnah and this is why the prophet alaihis salat was singled four people of his companions that we should learn the quran from and when he said learn the quran from four who are they one abdullahi master root two obey for salim the freed slave of abu hudaifah so muad is not your average was a real piece of work the prophet said something about him that he never said about any other companion he said that on the day of judgment will proceed all the scholars by a stone or throw meaning that he would come ahead of them all due to his knowledge what this kiddo yep this kid was not something to just simply look into without paying a lot of respect to the prophet sent to yemen as a judge as a mufti as a teacher and as a ruler as well romar may allah be pleased with him the second caliph used to say whoever wants to learn phil he must come to muhammad so now you have you may have a glimpse of why would the prophet salallahu take hold of this man's hand and swear twice to him that he loves him now the prophet swore twice by allah which means that it is permissible to swear this is not taking allah's name in vain so if there is something that you would like to reiterate you swear so you i swear to say the truth nothing but the truth so help me allah no problem you can swear because when you are in a court the judge says to you swear so that i can tell that you're telling the truth when someone is not believing in what you say you say wallahi i said the truth so there's nothing wrong in swearing when there is a need for it what is not permissible is to swear on every tiny minute thing this is disrespectful to allah so someone asks you did you do excuse me i said an avalanche ipad fell on my surface pro we had a problem alhamdulillah houston we're safe so someone asked me did you do this or do that something trivial and i said well i didn't do it and i keep on swearing on every single thing that i do or don't do this is not permissible because this is taking allah's name without any benefit without any real need for that allah says in the quran and protect your oaths [Music] so we cannot use or say or swear like this without any justification okay what did the prophet isam swear over he said i love you now it is worth noting that the arabs use the the word love to mean real love not physical love like it's used in english now if you go to someone they say oh man hey bro i love you so excuse me i'm straight man don't don't talk to me like this their thinking of love is to do with something that is not natural in the arab world the arabs use the word to love meaning that to like to adore not physically but as a human being so this is common between the same gender without any bad intention uh uh intended and this is part of our religion to love one another and not only that it is part of our religion to convey to that person that we love him the prophet said in an authentic hadith if one of you loves his brother he must notify him he must tell him and there is another hadith where the prophet sam was sitting with his companions once and one of his companions said to him o prophet of allah do you see that man by allah i love him so the prophet asked him i said did you tell him did you notify him no i said no so the prophet said ali islam go and tell him so the man went to that brother and said by allah i love you for the sake of allah and the man said to him may allah azzawajal love you as you love me for his sake this is an etiquette that the vast majority of us have abandoned love can only be for the sake of allah can only be in allah the almighty and people nowadays have twisted things they love and hate for the sake of this life this dunya not for the sake of allah azza so i love you for what you have in your bank account for the authority that you can bring me you have what we call washita you can pull some strings here and there and help me get a job have a reservation to uh on an airline nobody's lying but keep on hoping and wishing and you can do a lot of things for me so i love you not for the sake of allah for the sake of this world and this is not part of our religion our religion is based on allegiance to allah and those who are with him and to love allah and those who love him the prophet alaihis salam described and gave us the example of this religion of being like knots when you have a knot and another knot tied to it so he said faith's not the faith of ima the iman and the knots of it are the the most strongest of all knots is to have the allegiance for the sake of allah and the enmity for the sake of allah and to love for the sake of allah and to hate for the sake of allah so do we have hatred in our religion do we have enmity in our religion yeah excuse me definitely we do we're not monks we're not robots we're human beings and these emotions are part of our nature however islam tells you to muzzle such negative feelings and channel them within the parameters of islam so that allah would approve of what you do when we have allegiance to our brothers who are muslims and practicing islam properly this is part of our religion when we have enmity and hatred to those who oppressed the muslims step on their necks kill them expel them from their homes and then you wait for me to give or turn the other chic we've been hit right left and center we're out of cheeks so yes it is part of their our religion we don't have enmity or hatred against others we have no beef with them it's not because their eyes are blue or green and they're fair in color i have many great muslims who are blonde and blue eyes our beef with these people is that they disbelief in allah they go against the law of allah and not only that they attack and oppress muslims this is where a muslim should stand up for his beliefs islam is a religion of peace without weakness islam is a religion of pride without arrogance islam is a religion of strength without violence but muslims don't know that and the people don't want you to know that they want you to bow down keep your head low and whatever people do to you just be the weakest lincoln swallow your pride this is not what true islam is you have to have the balance the honor and the dignity of islam so going back to our beautiful hadith was the only one whom the prophet isaiah loved definitely not the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam used to love many of his companions he used to love the people of al-ansar and he declared that i love the people of medina and they are the most beloved to my heart he used to love abu bakr and no one and i mean no one came to the level of abu bakr in the heart of the prophet he said he was asked by the asmr repeats with him and he's no prophet of allah whom is it that you love most so the prophet said his beloved wife ahmad said no no i meant from among the men so the prophet said her father he says father is abu bakr the first caliph and the best man in islam after the prophet also there are many hadiths stating that the prophet used to love his grandchildren al-hasan and hussein and he used to love his previously adopted son zaidan and many others so going straight to the hadith the prophet said to do not leave after every salat to say to supplicate to invoke to make dua to allah say what o prophet of allah we will dissect what the prophet alison advised and the time would not be sufficient for us to elaborate and people say come on this is an exaggeration there are only a handful of words what do you mean that the time does is not sufficient to elaborate because we tend to read and count with our eyes and not with our hearts so let's go on a journey of iman and belief and the first instruction was the prophet said say o allah help me to remember you o allah help me help you what do you mean by help you see allah's help to us allah's assistance to us is not something auxiliary that we can do without our existence is dependent on allah's help to us and you cannot live prosperous progress move on with your life if you cannot do that if you do not seek allah's guidance assistance and help and this is why if you want to gather the treasures of paradise on the day of judgment when you enter paradise for eternity and you see your home and you see that you have lots of treasures and you ask where did i get this from well the prophet says is one of the treasures of paradise when you say and this is not brainwashing this is heart cleansing when you say there is no power and no strength except with allah subhanallah if you say this phrase over and over again depending only on allah trusting only allah believing only in allah nothing can happen in this universe without allah's permission so when you want something to happen do not depend on your own intellect don't depend on your own strength and muscles don't depend on your qualifications your bank account all of this can turn into vapor in no time all of this can go and this covered 19 has proved to the whole world that we are weak and without allah the almighty we are helpless we have no hope and this is why so many people turned back to allah acknowledging their arrogance and ignorance and confessing that there is no strength or might there's no power except with allah almighty so o allah help me to remember you seeking allah's help is what the prophet used to alaihis awesome always advise his companions he used to say to bin abbas whenever you ask ask allah whenever you seek help and assistance seek it only from allah and asking allah azza is worshipping him and that's why every single salat every single prayer when we stand in front of allah minimum five times a day we recite in every unit we worship and you alone o we ask for help so you are poor unless allah makes you rich you're sick unless allah makes you healthy you're helpless unless allah azzawajal comes to your assistance and this is why part of the prophet's dua was oh allah assist me oh allah help me and don't help others over me or against me so help me to remember you and by allah this is one of the most beautiful things that you can ask allah we by nature are negligent we tend to forget we can forget our own kids the missus tells me buy this when you go shopping and i come back and i said well i forgot and seriously i forgot i forget things and this is human nature but unfortunately the most thing that i forget is allah so my priority list is long allah is not on my top choices so there's always my entertainment my business my cash my kids my wife my relatives my friends my hobbies things that i want to do and then at the end of the list is allah and this is totally wrong because we are dependent on allah azzawajal whomever whomever allah helps and assists you will find his tongue remembering allah 24 7. so he will always be reciting the reading the quran his er his protection the invocations that he says in the morning and in the evening before going to bed and after the five mandatory obligatory prayers before leaving home before eating before entering the toilet after exiting the toilet there are a set of supplications and invocations that we say those whom allah help would succeed in saying it and observing it and then it would rarely be possible for this person to be afflicted with an evil eye with envy with gin possession or with black magic because like you have anti-viruses in your pcs this guy is protected those whom allah does not assist and help you would rarely find him reading a daily portion of his quran he always complains of lack of time of being lazy and he didn't he does not know the poor guy that allah did not intend good for him and allah did not intend good for him not because allah doesn't love him because that person that particular individual he chose not to care for allah and not to remember him allah says in surat at chapter 9 about the hypocrites who did not march with the prophet hassam on the ninth year of hijrah to tabuk and they lagged behind allah says and if they had intended to march out certainly they would have made some preparations for it but allah was averse to their being sent forth so he made them land behind and it was said to them sit you among those who sit at home allah owns this universe allah created it allah provides for it allah is most powerful we have no other choice but to express our humility our poverty to him in submission and asking him 24 7 to help us and assist us to remember him to do thicker to engage in being conscience being conscious that he's watching us that he wants us to do the right thing that he wants us to be good to humanity to everything and this is our religion this is phrase one oh allah help me to remember you then what two give thanks to you so all praise is due to allah and whoever whomever allah assists and helps you will find him always expressing his gratitude with his heart with his rhetoric and with his actions allah says in the quran work you o family of the wood or family of david work with thanks but few of my slaves are grateful those whom allah leaves alone unassisted those whom allah does not help you would always find them whining and complaining of the lack of provisions of the amount of worries and trouble they're going through they never seem to express their gratitude to allah's many favors and blessings upon them so their eyes and ears are not protected from watching and listening to haram their tongues are not prevented from profanity and obscene words their hands are not extended to help the poor the orphans and the needy and their limbs do not or are not utilized in worshiping allah azza through prayer and fasting you need allah's help to be able to express your gratitude because if you don't express your gratitude then allah would punish you not necessarily today or tomorrow because we have the day of reckoning the day of judgment so many people think that it's me i know everything it's what i do it's my knowledge allah allah azzawajal got you out of your mother's womb to this world unable to see unable to speak and unable to think allah gave all of that to you and made you who you are and now this is pay time you say no i'm the one who went to college i'm the one who managed to pull different strings here and there and get a good job i'm the one who's successful in investing my money in different portfolios now i'm a rich man all of this can go but so many times allah keeps it on coming to you so that you still live in this big lie only to be shocked when death comes and the shock of all is even greater in your grave and what awaits you on the day of judgment is horrific may allah azza protect us all so oh allah help me to remember you to [Music] give thanks to you and finally and worship you in the best way why did the prophet say as um in the best way he would have he could have said and worship you because every tom dick and harry on earth claimed to worship allah so we all agree there's only one god so you go to the christians you go to the jews you go to the buddhist you go to whomever you want to go regardless of the number of gods they claim to have they all come to the conclusion that all of these are referring to one so even the christians when they say that jesus is the son of god they come to confess and say yeah before mary got pregnant with jesus he didn't exist there was only the father so alhamdulillah this is what we are hinting to there's only one god that exists in the beginning there was god there was allah and there was nothing and i mean nothing with him he created everything we see he's the first without a beginning and he's the last without an end he's unlike anything that could cross your mind and any person when he reflects on his own he believes and acknowledges that there's only one god one allah one creator of the heavens and the earth so we have no problem in that but the prophet says and assist me to worship you in the best way because all these religions claim that they are right and not possible to have all of them saying left right front back and then all be being right there can only be one religion and the acid proof is the quran that we have open it look into it and you will find that it is crystal clear you don't have to be a rocket science to understand the quran this revelation came 15 hundred years ago it is for all mankind for those who are laymen for farmers for new surgeons for people in alaska for people in siberia for people in the jungles of africa it is for all of them and it is had stood the test of time it's the only scripture on earth that was revealed 14 or 15 centuries ago and still intact we do not have virgins of the quran the revised standard virgin kings james version do a virgin and different copies of it it's one quran and it's in the same language it was revealed in so we don't have a translation of translation of translation of a translation and this language is used by not less than 400 million 500 million muslims on earth they speak it they know it they understand it if we were to gather all copies of the quran and burn them to the ground we have no problem because tomorrow we have more than 30 million muslims who memorize the quran by heart they will scribe it from scratch not a single letter added or deleted so the religion of islam is the religion accepted by the side of allah azzawajal and anyone who's objective would understand that this is the ultimate religion and the final revelation and the perfect way of life and it is standing that's test of time it is the only religion that people embrace in great numbers no matter how bad you tarnish its reputation through the media and the media is doing a great job in tarnishing the reputation of islam i know this i'm a man of the media and i've seen what they can do they can bring you a script they already have something in their mind they write a script of what we're gonna do and what is the conclusion and then they start shooting footage of 30 40 hours and then cut and paste and edit and make it come to life as they want it from the beginning so they're not objective they don't want the truth they want to convey to you what they believe islam is standing firm and people are coming into islam without any effort from our side i'm not doing anything it is allah who's guiding these people so when you ask allah azzawajal to assist you in worshiping him in the best of way that is to worship him according to islam and not only that to purify your islam from innovations from things that are not related to it because the perfection of islam depends and relies on you following the real islam the pure form of islam that came to us through the quran and the authentic sunna of the prophet sallallahu alaihi with the understanding of the three favorite generations the generations of the companions the generations of the tavern and the generation of tabari tavern they're the best and the cream of the humanity they know and understand the quran and the sunnah as it was revealed and given if you manage to worship allah and allah assist you to worship him subhanahu wa in the best of way then you are on the right track so we have like six minutes to go and inshaallah we are on schedule bear in mind the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam gave the muslim a strong warning of whom he warned us of the who is the adage the prophet told us that do not be fooled by the quantity of their worship focus on the quality and this is extremely important in islam and i had given a number of topics and lectures on this specific topic which is quality versus quantity and as an example the prophet told us that when you look at this you will look down upon your own prayer upon your own fasting because you think that this is children's play this is nothing they pray hours without end they fast days without end so that you would feel that you're nothing compared to them however though their quantity is far greater than yours the prophet said alaihis that they recite the quran and it does not go past their throats meaning that they don't benefit from it and he told us that they are the hounds of hell and that they are the worst people to be killed under the skies why because they have twisted understanding of islam they killed innocent people they killed discriminately they are giving tak fear to the muslims they don't believe in the quran and in the sunnah as they should but they come to one text misinterpret it and act upon it neglecting everything else they don't have scholars this fits as a glove it fits like a glove to the nicest which the media is calling isis and this is unfair they say that this is the islamic state of iraq and syria and we as muslims refuse that they're not islamic they're nicest they're non-islamic state of iraq and syria they have nothing to relate to islam and this is what the media is doing point zero zero zero one percent of the population of islam are doing heinous things and then they come and say look what islam is it's a violent religion it does this it does that and no one is supporting them all muslim scholars are standing against them most muslim scholars are getting death threats from them for standing in their way we don't care but nobody highlights this why because it is tarnishing the reputation of islam so if allah assists you to remember him to thank him and to worship him in the best of ways you my friend are the luckiest man on earth you are the richest man on earth you are the happiest person that could walk this earth because allah is with you i don't care if the military is standing behind me i don't care if the whole super powers are supporting me all of this is rubbish if allah is supporting me then i've got it all made and finally we um like have one minute to conclude inshaallah when the prophet said to his son say this dua at the end of your prayer did he mean that we should say it before salaam or after we conclude the prayer after salam it's an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion that all types of dura of invocation must be done within the prayer itself before you offer salaam this is what evantrania says may allah have mercy on his soul and his students and whatever there is in it remembrance etc you say it after the salam and from this we know that it is a big mistake and then innovation what many muslims do after concluding salat when they raise their hands and make dua yes if you do this once every blue moon no problem but if you do it after every five salat and make dua which the prophet had never done as sam nor his companions know those who followed them and not only that you may do i then you wash or wipe your face this is an innovation it's not at all permissible what is your intention when making dua said i want allah to respond to me i want allah to answer me to give me what i ask him of well i have good news and the good news is that the prophet said alice islam after you finish salutation upon the prophet during the salat you may choose and select whatever dua you want before salam so the prophet is telling you this is the time and the place for dua and you say no no no i watched my father my forefathers they used to do dura after salaam so i'm following suit well this is your problem my friend so i pray to allah azzawajal in these last 10 blessed nights of ramadan that he opens our hearts to his guidance i pray to allah azzawajal that he guides us to whatever pleases him and not please us i ask allah to assist us and to help us in remembering remembering him in worship in thanking him and in worshiping him m for sharing with us such a beautiful hadith and all the lessons there are in it for us we love you for the sake of allah thanks for being uh with us here today chef we have about 30 questions open and i have quickly reviewed gone through them so if it is okay with you if you allow me i can ask the questions and you could answer inshallah bismillah the first question is that uh i have heard that there's a specific seller in is that true and if it is then what it is this is not true there is no specific prayer for the night of decree and for those who do not know what we're talking about the last 10 nights of ramadan are the most blessed nights throughout the whole year these 10 nights include one specific glorious night and it's called the night of decree or layla and it's so significant for us muslims that allah revealed in the quran a chapter by the title and allah told us in this beautiful short chapter surah that this night is better than a thousand months and hence the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in the beginning knew which night it was but then allah azzawajal took this knowledge away from all of us and this night shifts every year every ramadan so it can be on the 21st and following ramadan on the 28th or 29th so it keeps on shifting so that we have to devote our time and effort and to strive in worshiping allah in these blessed nights so there's one night we don't know which one it is so to claim that there is a specific prayer devoted for this night the answer is this is not true there is a dua but this dua we can say throughout the entire ten nights and if you wish the entire year and it's a beautiful dua that shows your dependence on allah azza mother said o prophet of allah if we wear to see and identify this glorious night of decree what should i ask allah for so the prophet said to his beloved wife say you are merciful and you love to pardon so allah forgive me and pardon me that's it beautiful dua so short so concise yet so full of meaning of expression of your humility and poverty to him asking him to forgive you but the vast majority of us would say shrug their shoulders in shape forgive me for what i didn't kill anyone i didn't hurt anyone and they are neglectful they're blinded by their own sense that they don't see themselves doing anything wrong can a woman lead other women in prayers of course a woman can lead other women in prayer providing there are no watching or listening to her the only difference between men's congregational prayer and women's congregational prayer is that the woman leader the imam she does not stand in front of other women rather she stands among them between them so they are all in one line together if a woman is praying alone is it compulsory for her to say akama before praying for those who do not know are a number of phrases we say just before starting our prayers the the five daily prayers so in the masjid this is a call for those sitting waiting for salat for prayer once they hear it they all stand up and stand up in a line but if i'm praying alone it is not mandatory for me to stay it is highly recommended whether i'm a man or i am a woman it is highly recommended but it is not mandatory and it's only done for the five daily prayers the follow the prayers not for the sunnah next question is can i elope with a girl and marry her later is that marriage valid what do you mean by elope my english and then she ends up pretending to take some poison and you kill yourself and then the poison is was only energy drink no ahi this is totally prohibitive this is the brainwashing we were talking about she's the only woman on earth you want to run away with disgrace her family and yours anger allah azzawajal through committing such a sin if people acted like this then we would be living in chaos and mishap this is not how the world go you want to enter a house you have to ring the bell and come from the front door you don't jump from the window to enter a house that is not yours so if you love a girl and we're not talking about pre-marital relationships because we're assuming that you don't have any such prohibited relationships you simply saw a girl in you fell in love with her you can't go and talk to her spoil her corrupt her through premarital relationships go and propose to her father if her father says no he is her father he took care of her until she grew this old he knows what's good and what's bad for her so move on ahi with your life but to insist on following your dream which you've seen in so many movies in hollywood or bollywood or nowadays they have nollywood this is from nigeria i don't know if they're going to have something saudi calling it so we would you never know so um this is totally prohibited in islam and maybe you won't like this it does it wouldn't go down your throat well but if i reverse this and i said your sister your beloved young sister ran away with a man how would you feel about that would you clap and say keep on the good work sis follow your dream pursue what you want don't let anyone control you or you're gonna go and try to talk her out of it if not force her out of it so subhanallah it's okay for you not okay for the others so i hope this answers your question i'm from india this is from a sister uh in india there are differences in salah for men and women they pray differently i recently saw your video on youtube and i'm starting to pray the right way as you teach as per the sunnah my dilemma is that my father when he saw me he stopped me from that and he's saying i'm your father do not do it again so what should i do obey my father or do it as you have shared with us in the video pray whenever your father does not see you see what i taught in the video and hey i'm famous alhamdulillah um was the way that the prophet prayed through the quran and the sunnah there are different schools of thought that believe otherwise but they don't have the backing of the sunnah and this is what gives what people teach according to the sunnah credibility this is what gives them credibility that they have the evidence to prove it unlike those of other schools of thought that say well simon says yeah but why should you have to obey so to have a win-win situation most those in india are hanafis there are shafi's of course but they don't raise the hands when they give to kabir for roku and rising up from the record this is not mandatory this is not obligatory so if your father is annoyed by it don't do it just say allah your prayer is valid so you have to be wise you have to be knowledgeable and you have to know what to do and what not to do the best win-win situation is that you don't pray in front of your father or when he prays jamal you pray in congregation you pray with him he's in front of you he doesn't see what you're doing so follow the sunnah as long as he's not fine with it and he's not seeing you follow it but if he's watching you then try to be diplomatic and win his heart bit by bit don't be going into confrontation with him over things that are not mandatory take your time explain to him through knowledge show him that you have and possess the knowledge from the quran the sunnah never ever say shaykh asam says or says when you know that they won't accept it no say the prophet said that islam and show them that even the books of hadith people would not argue because oh it's a prophet then i'll accept that but when you say that tom dick or harry no i don't believe in these called wahhabis and so on can a husband keep his wife's picture in his mobile this is an issue of dispute and i follow a strict ruling which says that women's photographs are not permitted and not permissible because it defies the purpose of hijab why did allah instruct the women to wear the hijab and not the men because by default women are gorgeous they're beautiful so when they are not wearing the hijab they turn men's heads around men no matter how handsome they are they won't have the same impact of women over men so i believe that keeping the pictures of women is not permissible so she's my wife i have the original he enjoyed the original why keep the picture how would you feel if someone were to hack into your albums and take these digital pictures i had one of my subordinates one of the people who worked with me in the company who came to me crying after his honeymoon what's wrong he said i was on my honeymoon and i had a video cam and shamefully i did wrong things with it and with my wife and yesterday a man broke into my home and stole the cameras and the tapes and it's graphic it's really bad so i said okay why are you telling me this he said i'm contemplating on divorcing my wife what why is that he said i can't live with her these pics and and videos were leaked into the internet and became viral and i said excuse me whose idea was it to shoot such sex videos streamfully again he said it was mine so subhanallah you do it and you blame her for it no this is totally wrong you were wrong in the first place now you want to correct this mistake with another mistake subhanallah so my point of view is you have the original not only that people can hack to into your i know a friend who bought a used laptop totally formatted the hard disk was formatted clean he gave it to one of his tech savvy friends to install windows and office etc and the guy brought him the laptop the following week said listen i retrieved all the old data that was formatted and he he was shocked to see the pictures of families of women of girls of wives so this can be retrieved easily this is my own personal view of honoring and protecting women in my family that it's not worth it to take their pictures and then live in remorse and regret it the next question is that can i read quran by seeing it in voluntary prayers there's no problem in holding the quran and reading from it in talawi and tahajud involuntary prayers but in far prayers you should not do that a related question is that in fourth prayer i understand that i cannot ask dua in my own language in other prayers can i do what your understanding is telling you is wrong it is totally permissible to make dua in your own language whether in far prayers or in voluntary prayers providing that you do not know how to ask such things in arabic so for example if i want allah to forgive me i wouldn't say in my prayers o allah forgive me because i know how to say in arabic by saying so i have to say it in arabic but if i want to ask allah azzawajal to guide my nagging wife and to make her lose weight and to make her beautiful god this is too difficult to say in arabic so yes you can say it in um your own native language your own native uh language and by the way just for the sisters not to be offended if the sister wants to ask allah azzawajal to make her husband a more of a gentleman and to lose the uh beer belly and to lose this his awful mouth odor then this is permissible inshallah my brother has no savings in bank has no gold and unable to pay the house rent uh can i pay him zakat and do i have to worry about which category needy or debt he has some debt that maybe i can pay the money for this is a lengthy question that requires a detailed answer but i'll give it to you in a nutshell if your brother is classified as poor or needy how would i know the difference between poor and needy poor person who does not have what is sufficient so he has lunch but he cannot afford dinner a poor person is someone who is stone broke doesn't have money at all at the end of the month he receives his salary but in the middle of the month the salary is gone so the remaining two weeks he has to beg or borrow or do this this is poor full stop this guy deserves to receive zakat money a needy person who is a bit more well-off so yes i have my salary and yes i don't need money at the end of the month because my salary is sufficient however i don't have enough money to pay for my medication i'm a high blood pressure patient i have high cholesterol levels i'm diabetic and i don't have money to buy the medication or my wife is uh undergoing chemotherapy or my children need money to go to school but i can't afford to buy shoes and clothes and books for them but i have a salary that suffices me for the end of the month to pay rent electricity bill and food that's it this person is not poor but he's a needy he needs something to fulfill an honorable life so you can give him from zakat as well next question is from another attendee uh my uh my sister gives the card to everyone except the family members uh can she give zakat zakat money to my brother who is uh in need again if he is truly poor or needy as i've described earlier and he does not inherit the owner of the wealth the one who's giving the zakat there's no problem in that inshallah when i started my job my dad opened my interest account after his death i changed that to interest free account am i sinful for having interest for so many years and for zakat calculation should i minus this interest first then calculate zakat for the remaining money you're not allowed to keep the interest money so being included in the zakat is out of the question so you have to calculate how much interest was added to your money and take it out and give it to the poor and needy as form of cleansing your wealth and not as a form of making or sawab through it we had requested 15 minutes of your time for question and answers there are still 55 questions open would you like to continue for another few minutes like 10 minutes you can go until it's 2 o'clock no problem in the past years i gave my zakah to cancer hospital now i come to know that it is not permissible so should i pay again all previous years a cup yes because the zakat is a debt to allah azzawajal and you can only give them to the eight categories mentioned in surat verse 60 chapter nine so you cannot give it to someone who's not among these eight categories cancer patients can be rich can be poor can be muslims can be non-muslims so definitely your zakat was not placed in the correct place however you will be rewarded for it as a charity as a sadhaka but not as a cat next question is that i have a very poor memory uh do you have any dua for me that i could use to increase my memory uh what was the question i forgot i have a very poor memory i was joking you're talking to someone who has even worse memory than yours so no i don't have any dua to increase your memory except general allah azzawajal increase my memory and try to focus so many problems related to memory comes from the lack of focus we tend not to focus except on things that we love and we we have interest in i am among the very many people who have a lousy memory when it comes to meeting people so i meet someone salaam alaikum awesome and says my name is so-and-so after exactly 60 seconds your name again after 10 minutes is it ziad or ahmed i forgot because i don't concentrate this is my problem but there are exercises that would help you to concentrate to relate names to objects etc if you go through this you may find success and if you do give me a call because i don't have time to go through these things i'm too old for it so it's just more convenient to say i forgot and may allah make it easy for all of us back in the days of prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam they prayed in congregation for the reign my question is that if i have a specific uh issue or a problem can i call certain people and we pray and do dua in congregation for rain he didn't say just say this if there's something no he he definitely he's just giving an example that if the prophet prayed allah for reign then can i gather people and make dua to get my raise or to get a good bonus or to help me move from my house to another house answer is no such congregational dua for this person purpose is an innovation ask allah on your own ask allah when you are in prostration in salat ask allah azzawajal at times where you know that he answers dua and supplication most and there are many of them and insha allah you will get what you want we are now in 24 7 locked down here in kuwait in curfew uh i cannot pay zakatul fitter by going out can i ask someone in my country to do that for me this is one option you can call someone to do it for you second option is to look for trustworthy charity organization that would be deputized by you authorized by you to give it on time and there are so many in kuwait masha'allah i know that a third option if you know the poor in kuwait so i know that ahmed or they are all in need and they are worthy of receiving it i'd give them a call and say listen the lockdown is supposed to end 30th of may and i have rice for you here about like 50 kilograms so would you authorize me to keep it for you until the lockdown is cleared if he says okay he has received it on time according to the sunnah and after the lockdown is over you give it to him inshallah is the whispering of satan so you get these voices in your head telling you that there is one other gods with allah telling you to do blasphemous things to think evil about the quran about the prophet what should you do well first thing is you must block it because you know that this is from shaytan if i were to ask you when you're complaining to me i've got these whispers and i say okay these whispers halt them and ask excuse me who's talking to me is it an angel or a devil what do you think the answer would be and the man immediately says no it's the devil sheikh i know it's shaytaan if you know it is shaitaan why on earth are you listening to it why are you suffering when someone comes to you and says listen i'm a con man and i cheat people and i take the money and i run away so i'd like you to join me in an investment give me ten thousand kuwaiti dinars and uh i'll make it profitable for you would you give him of course not he confessed to you that he wants to harm you and you still obey him there's something wrong with your mind so likewise when you get these thoughts the glad tiding is that the prophet told us if you do not speak about these thoughts and you do not act upon them they're just merely thoughts in your head then allah would forgive them and it won't harm you so this is good news whenever you get such thoughts simply block it and move on can i divorce my wife with three talks at once no this is prohibited this is an innovative divorce and it is against the sunnah it is against the quran in the chapter titled divorce whenever you divorce o prophet of allah women that's for you and for those who follow you the divorce should be performed according to the prescribed times and etiquette and doing it three times in one setting or on one draw is an innovation and it's prohibited i owed some money uh to a person before i was married this is from a sister and now that i'm and i was working before i was married and i owed the money now i'm not working i'm married and my husband does not have enough funds to settle the debt and neither do my father what should i do i don't know this is your problem you have to you you borrowed the money so the guy or the girl who wants the money from you they either can wait you can explain to them your circumstances you cannot borrow from someone else you can not bottle with interest you simply say i don't have the money and this is all what you can do is there magic and possessions in islam of course this is mentioned in the quran as for possession is mentioned in surat al-baqarah chapter 2 uh this is not the time to translate it but it's mentioned in chapter two as for the uh the second part is magic yes magic and possession magic is also mentioned in the quran and prophet musa peace be upon him was casted the spell when he saw the sticks and staffs of the magicians turn into snakes and this kind of magic is called the imagination magic the image the magic of imagination is something that a delusion that a person thinks that he sees and the prophet alaihis our prophet also was casted as spelled by a jew by the name of labid where he thought he kept on thinking that he's being intimate with his wives while his wives say that he never came and approached us so this is also authentic it's in sahih al-bukhari and elsewhere should i go to jamaa prayer or any other parent congregation if they are practicing distancing well to me i am not a scholar i'm just a student of knowledge and i follow great major scholars of islam till this moment i did not see a verdict from the major scholars of islam on social distancing as it is being practiced in some places uh or in some messages hence my own personal opinion is that this is an innovation and it is best to pray home rather than participating in such an innovation when you give a fatwa and remember i am not a scholar i am not giving a fatwa i'm giving you my personal opinion and how to think because there is an absence of a fatwa from the major scholars till that time i can speak i can say i can voice my own opinion until our great scholars say i will refrain and follow what they say so i'll tell you where on how we reach this conclusion first of all we are muslims we follow our imams we follow our leaders as muslims they tell us don't pray jumaa don't pray congregational prayer we will be refrained i've been an imam for 32 years with the grace of allah delivering weekly sermon for 32 years now it's been seven weeks i have not prayed friday prayer why because my muslim leader ruler told me something i'll obey this is what allah told me to do to to comply with with his instructions i even sometimes joke with my friends and say i forgot is the sermon of friday before the salat or after the salah just to joke about it but when it comes to social distancing this is not a legitimate reason to keep your distance in a masjid and it is not even practical it's just something that the people in the west or in the east come up with and none and muslims are i don't know i i can say so many bad things but i don't know what i want to see i don't want to spoil my fasting but it is not practical okay in normal days before covered 19 the masjids used to be fully packed and people prayed at the at the outside of the masjid in the courts so now you're telling me to have social distancing and keeping a a meter apart are you crazy who would be able to do that who would comply if the messages are fully packed in normal times when you get leave these gaps do you think the people would pray outside or on the street or they'll jump in and pray next to you and next to the other one it's likewise in haram do you think that people would abide by this or can it be implemented no way jose this is not at all applicable besides everybody is saying that covered 19 is not fatal all the reports is saying that 80 of those infected don't know that they're infected and they get infected and healed without any medical intervention it's a flu 15 of those infected need medical intervention and they're out five percent some countries one percent some countries six percent the average is five percent die and their death is not attributed to only covet 19 but due to their immune system due to their age due to a number of factors so to jeopardize the well-being of 95 percent of the community for five percent for ten percent this needs to be relocked into but again i'm talking about prayers in the masjid with this gap no i would pray home and not pray in such circumstances until our major great scholars of islam come together and give us a fatwa saying that this is uh applicable and i don't think that they would do that if this is from a sister assalamu alaikum we love you for the sake of allah my brother and i my question is can we read quran by sitting in if we are suffering from some disease the prophet said the prayer of a person sitting down is half the reward of a person standing up scholars all agree that this is related to voluntary prayers so i have no illness i have no problem physically and i decide to pray sitting down i pray night prayer sitting down any problem no problem prayer is valid i'll be rewarded half of the reward but if you have a health problem or you're physically unable to stand your rewards would be equivalent to those praying standing up without any difference in sha allah should we read surah fatiha after the ibam in tarawi as well this is an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion without going into details is the opinion of imam malik may allah have mercy on your soul when he said that praying or reciting the fatiha in loud prayers is not mandatory it's up to you as long as the imam has recited it loudly this is sufficient for you and this is the opinion of islam and others we will take one last question if i calculate zakat during ramadan can i distribute it over the year over the next year this is not permissible once zakat is due you have to give it today so there's a cat of the previous year matures today today i have to calculate my zakkat and give it to the poor but if you have relatives orphans poor people that you don't want to give them the zakat as a lump sum because they'll waste it and the rest of the year there'll be need in this case the other alternative is today i gave my zakat of last year i will estimate that next year would be the same amount so i gave a hundred kuwaiti dinars for zakat over my wealth for the previous year so now the same hundred or another hundred kuwaiti dinars i will divide every month to give to the poor on installments but this amount i'm giving is from next year's zakat so when next year is due my zakat i'll calculate my wealth if it is 120 kd in this case i'm 20 kd short so i take k 20 kd and give it to the poor if it's less if it's 90 kd but i had spent a hundred then 90 would be for the zakat 10 would be charity and allah azza knows we still have more than 50 questions open while we have answered almost 30. thanks a lot for your time we really appreciate it here at ick and in kuwait jazakallah for your time and for giving this opportunity to be with my brothers in kuwait not physically but at least they know how much i love them and i miss them and i hope allah azzawajal would give us the opportunity to meet again and to meet in better circumstances without this a pandemic or this illness or this lockdown being imposed upon us [Music] foreign"
