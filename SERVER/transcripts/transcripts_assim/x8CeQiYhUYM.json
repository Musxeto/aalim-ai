  "transcript": "Ishaq from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So Sheikh the apartment building that I live in they have a prayer area where all the people of the apartment gather to pray the five daily prayers so in the past I used to pray all the five daily prayers there but after I discovered that praying in the mosque even in congregation is not the same as praying in a masjid I started going to the masjid instead but since then I've been having these thoughts that because my neighbors are not going to see me there in the masjid they might start thinking that I've stopped praying and might think of me as someone who stopped praying and these thoughts keep hitting me but then I tell myself that it's between me and Allah and I shouldn't be worried about what they think about me Allah knows that I'm praying so me having these thoughts is it a form of Riyadh that I want people to know that I'm praying in the masjid at least so should I at least let them know or be bothered about what people think because I came to know that what people think about you in this world will matter in the hereafter so please advise Sheikh. No there is nothing wrong in such thoughts because protecting your reputation is part of your rights in Islam so whatever may tarnish your reputation and you defend yourself that is a legitimate reason it was reported in the Sahih that the Prophet ﷺ one night during the last 10 nights of Ramadan he was performing seclusion in the masjid when his wife Safiyyah visited him to speak to him about something and when she wanted to go back to her home the Prophet decided to walk with her because it was night as he was walking with her to her home two of the companions saw him and when they saw that he was accompanied by a woman they turned their back and walked the other way so the Prophet ﷺ called them wait this is Safiyyah my wife so they were amazed in a sense and said oh Prophet of Allah subhanAllah do you think we are going to doubt you he said well Satan flows in your veins like blood does and I was afraid that he may throw something in your heart against me that may negatively impact your Iman and religion so to defend yourself and to explain to people listen guys something it's not what you think someone traveling prayed Dhuhr and Asr combined and shortened at the Dhuhr time he reaches his hometown before the Adhan of Asr he approaches his home and it's Asr being called and people are going to the masjid and they're looking at him while he's going home and he says salam alaikum I just came from travel I prayed Dhuhr and Asr there's no problem in that however the feelings and the whispers you're getting are not valid because what you're doing is the right thing that is going to the masjid instead of praying in the prayer hall in your building and that is what Muslims should do so keep on doing the good thing and ignore such whispers and Allah knows best"
