  "transcript": "we spoke in the last episode which was before eid about felonies or offenses and we talked about the deliberate killing and the semi-deliberate killing and killing by mistake and the rulings pertaining that and we stopped at the offenses or felonies causing physical injury and i know that this is a little bit difficult to a lot of us and it's also difficult for me to explain because this requires someone who is on the job frequently judging these issues handling and dealing with them and this happens to us maybe once in a lifetime and maybe it does not happen at all this is why when we study it if we manage to understand it in couple of weeks of time time it will all go and disappear and this is why it is important that one revises this knowledge as much as he can so that it does not go entirely away but he tries his level best to make the best of it and remembers the most of it so what is meant by offenses causing physical injury we're not talking about death we're talking about something which is lesser than death so any injury to the body that does not lead to death this is something that is part of a felony and we have to look into it and allah says in the quran as a form of punishment and compensation to the one who was wronged and transgressed against allah says a life for a life we spoke about that and then he says an eye for an eye a nose for a nose an ear for an ear a tooth for a tooth and a similar retribution for wounds and the prophet said alice islam according to the books according to allah's book a similar punishment is due and this was in a case where a young female companion broke the tooth of another female companion after they had a fight so these offenses which do not lead to death can be classified into three types either it is causing a wound or it is causing a loss of a limb or it is causing a loss of function of a bodily organ and we will come to discuss these things so first of all the wounds wounds are of two kinds wounds that are to the face and the head so this is a different category and then the wounds to the rest of the body as for the types of wounds scholars categorize it into ten types five of them there is no precise there is no getting even an eye for an eye no we cannot implement this here and what are these five types of wounds a wound that scratches the skin so i'm fighting with someone and i scratches scratch his skin a wound that causes little blood with the scratch there is some blood but it's not a lot of blood or a hemorrhage or a a wound that cut a vein for example thirdly a wound that cuts the flesh slightly but does not reach the bones fourthly wound that goes deep into the flesh but does not reach the membrane and that separates the flesh from the bone and fifthly a wound that reaches this membrane these five types of wounds scholars say that it is not possible to demand pisas or punishment equal to the transgression and it's also there is no prescribed indemnity or blood money for it is left to the judge to determine the compensation payable by the offender so we have one category that such an offense can be only determined by the judge whether the compensation is so and so in the person's wealth he has to pay a fine and dignity for the person who he had wronged or any type of punishment he sees fit the other five degrees are as follows a wound that cuts the membrane and exposes the bone and this requires five percent of the total indemnity payable in the case of killing what is the indemnity or the dia in the case of killing it is a hundred camels so five percent is five camels and secondly a wound that exposes and breaks the bone so this does not only expose the bone but it also breaks it this requires 10 percent thirdly a wound that dislocates a bone whether it exposes it and breaks it or not so maybe this location of a joint or an elbow or a shoulder this requires 15 percent of indemnity fourthly a wound that reaches the ma the meanings and the membranes enclosing the brain and fifthly and fourthly and fifty are the same compensation wound that cuts the men and manages and reaches the brain now this requires a third of the blood money which is 30 to 33 [Music] camels having said this also a wound that goes deep into the body whether in the abdominal area chest or back this also so if someone was stabbed with a knife in the abdominal area in the chest or in the back with a deep knife then this also requires one third of the blood money now having said that there are conditions and these conditions are as follows in order to have crisis or the punishment such wounds must be measurable correctly so scholars say that we cannot have an actual punishment that is not transgressing and not coming short from the actual transgression meaning someone stabs me now old days they could not measure exactly the wounds depth so that they can inflict a similar wound to the transgressor but they said that if the wound reaches the bone in this case it is easily duplicated but if it doesn't reach the bone then there is a possibility of transgressing going further than the actual wound or going less and therefore there is no point of doing it likewise with a tooth if you break someone's tooth you can break the assailant's tooth exactly the same place but what about if it ships it nowadays you can file it until it reaches the same place and the second condition is it has to be equal in name and place so if someone cuts another person's hand if he cuts the right hand we have to cut the hand of that person off the right side as well we can cut his left hand a right hand in exchange for a right hand a left foot in exchange for a left foot it has to be exactly similar if it was from the wrist it has to be from the wrist if it's from the elbow it has to be from the elbow but what about if it is in between if someone cuts someone's hands in between this is an issue of dispute some scholars say the victim is given the choice he is to make a choice of amputating the man's hand from the wrist and taking the difference in cash money for the area that we cannot measure and cut in exchange for that and this is something for the muslim judge again this is a very very complicated topic that deals with biology with human organs and with wounds and doctors may and surgeons to be exact may be able to do uh this so i cannot if a person amputates or causes the loss of a pinky of another person i cannot take the index finger of that person it has to be exactly similar in the name and in the side aside and this is what caused scholars to say that it is not permissible for a person to donate his body organs after death which is a craze a lot of the people are falling into so a person writes in his will after i die you can take my um a cornea or eye or whatever you can take my liver you can take my kidneys you can take my heart you can take whatever you want of body parts as if it is a junkyard uh full of cars and you just stripping it of spare parts this is not permissible this is not your body you have been entrusted with this body after you die it must not be um humiliated or treated in a way that is disrespectful to it this is not your body to play with or to donate to anyone and hence you are not allowed to do this what about um body organs donation while alive if the organ reproduces and there's no harm on your life this is permissible as i was told that donating part of your liver is permissible because it grows back again but to give an eye which you cannot replace nor it cannot grow back again this is this is prohibited to donate your blood is permissible because this regenerates if you have two or three kidneys and you donate one and there's no risk on your life insha allah this is permissible providing that there is a cause and a reason for that and it's not financial because selling any of these things is totally prohibited in islam third condition is that both organs that we are comparing so if somebody someone amputates another person's organ and his organ the victim had only three fingers working and two disabled and the assailant's hand the right hand is all full and good and working we cannot just simply come and say okay take this for that no because the victim's hand was not totally uh similar in health etc and therefore we do not make such a punishment and he has to pay for that in money um so i think this is about it and in terms of why five percent 15 10 a third this was taken from the companions may allah be pleased with them and no one ever objected to it which means that they agreed to it and accepted it and um this is in regards of wounds now in regards of loss of limb we spoke about that um briefly and we mentioned the conditions and the scholars say it is similar to killing murder because it can be deliberate loss of limb it can be semi-deliberate and it can be by mistake or an accident and there are three conditions to be observed the first one is that we mentioned that it has to uh be accurate without any form of abbreviation of the injury and nowadays almost all types of injury can be measured by doctors so a surgeon says any type of wound i can measure it i can fix it and i can easily uh duplicate it so scholars contemporary scholars say against what the old scholars used to say because the old scholars did not have this facility so they totally prohibited it but nowadays as long as the surgeon can duplicate exactly the same form of aggression as a punishment then this is permissible uh and the three conditions were mentioned earlier okay the third type what do we mean by the third time we said that offenses are of three type either wounds or loss of limb or loss of function of a bodily organ and the loss of function is not possible to measure and to duplicate and this is why the scholars say that we cannot inflict a punishment similar to the crime so if someone fights with another and causes him to leave to lose sight maybe or to have a reduction of sight so he loses 60 of his sight but he is not blinded his eye is still in its place in its socket so this cannot be precisely duplicated and measured because we can't tell exactly how much it is so he must pay the victim the full indemnity or half of it or a quarter of it depending on how we judge it so for example a person has one mind he has the ability to hear the ability to see the ability to smell the voice the taste the chewing the ability to have intercourse some organs we have two of them so if something happens and he makes me lose function in one of my arms and i cannot move it then this requires half of the blood money if i lose both hands i require the full indemnity which is a full blood money or the d and etc now when we come to the chapter or the section that deals with the we'll find that the dia is either 100 camels or 200 cows or 2 000 sheep in some in some narrations 800 dinar etc it has a specific value that may vary from one another but at the time of the prophet isa sam it was almost similar yet the benchmark in blood money is the price of camels so a hundred camel is what is supposed to be given to the victim's family allah says he who kills a believer by mistake must uh must free a believing soul from bondage and pay an indemnity to his family unless they forego it by ways of charity okay let's talk about killing if a person kills deliberately see me deliberately or by accident are or is the indemnity the blood money the same the answer yes and no what do you mean first of all the person who kills deliberately is ordered to pay a hundred camels so she may deliberately and accidentally are also supposed to pay a hundred camels but they are different in a number of things one if a person kills deliberately he alone has to pay the blood money we do not in islam we do not go around as people to help him it has to be taken from his own wealth while in the semi-deliberate and accidental dia or blood money the one who pays it is his apila means the next of kin or his kinship because this was a calamity a catastrophe a something that was not anticipated so they collaborate and produce the blood money in the deliberate killing it has to be now so 100 camels you have to pay them now in the semi-deliberate and accidental killing it can be paid over the period of three years so there is some leniency in it in the deliberate killing it has to be in some narrations divided into four types 24 25 bent mahal 25 one year two year old three-year-old four-year-old camels in the semi-deliberate and accidental it can be 25 categories 20 she camel and 20 and then the other three categories 20 20 20. so more lenient other scholars said in the deliberate killing there has to be 20 or 40 pregnant tree camels and this is more expensive and more rare to find to make it even more punishable for that murderer to taste his crime and to pay for it dearly from his own money and wealth and to make it difficult for him but this is according to the judge's judgment um as for the indemnity for the killing of the believer 100 camels we've gone through this the indemnity should be paid in the form of camels their value we've gone through this by requiring 40 of these camels to be pregnant and we've covered this so in essence this is almost what is there for us to learn about as i said this is not an easy topic this is something that is difficult i have summarized for you 200 to 300 pages of the books of if you go through them it is confusing because there are tens of names of the types of wounds and it describes the impact whether it's it exposes the bone whether it's in the face it has a different name than if it's in the body whether it reaches this much amount of the flesh exposes it and each type of wound it has a name and each name has a specific amount of camels as compensation when it can be implemented as a punishment and inflicted upon the assailant and when it so many details that confuse you but at the same time it shows you the magnificence of islam when you transgress against someone physically you don't expect that to go unquestioned and without account islam had placed almost a detailed explanation and description of such injuries so that everything can be taken care of it's not jail time that you spend for an attack against another human being there is retribution there is punishment there is indemnity there is pain to be inflicted upon you to taste what you had made others go through and this shows you the fairness and justice of islam we have questions pending from a very long time so diamond says can i ask something video call married in islam is it halal i think we've answered this like many times but again for the benefit of the doubt video call marriage is permissible when there is no ambiguity of the identity of those participating so i am now with you guys in a video call and i claim my name to be abdullah the son of abdul rahman and i would like to get married to your daughter uncle the uncle doesn't know me he doesn't know if my name is abdullah or my name is asam he doesn't know where i come from what i do so if he doesn't know me and the witnesses do not know me i don't know her father whether he is her father truly or just an imposter coming to give his approval because the girl is with me in the same city and we met over the internet or we go to the same school or we work together and we would like to make our relationship halal so i said i'd like to marry you and she's an easy-going woman she said okay let's get married no no it has to be done properly where is your father well my father is back home okay let's get his approval she knows that her father does not approve of it so she talks to an uncle to the janitor of their building back home and she tells him i'll pay you a hundred dollars and you pretend to be my father and i see him on a video uh uh chat or uh skype or whatever and he says yes my son i give you my daughter in marriage and i say i accept her marriage and there are two witnesses whether in my side or on her side this marriage is invalid you have to identify and make sure of the identity of the participant if this is possible then the marriage is legit insha allah yet we have to always give the warning that i get tens of cases every month of people complaining that they got this type of marriage and now the girl doesn't know where the boy is and she wants to call this marriage off she wants to divorce but he is not divorcing and she cannot find file any type of huller because the marriage was not registered well um it is your mistake it is your father's mistake don't ever do something that is not documented because you will suffer later on for breaking the law for trusting people who do not deserve to be trusted and allah azzawajal knows best zohara says can a couple reconcile after a divorce this is too generic where you have the ability to reconcile the third divorce if it takes place they cannot ever reconcile and they have to part their ways until she gets married a real marriage for the sake of the second man and she lives with that man and have intercourse like any spouse would do and after a while they get divorced only then she can get married to her first husband so if this is the first marriage first divorce or second divorce it is either they want to reconcile or he wants to reconcile and revoke the divorce while she's in the idda or after that if you divorce her once she has three monthly cycles as edda generally speaking if she's not pregnant and he does not revoke the first divorce he does not reconcile with her until the third menses is over and she sees her purity they're total strangers now he wants to reconcile tough luck you can't reconcile you can propose to marry her again with a new maha with the approval of his and consent of her guardian with two witnesses and if she agrees and this is done then your man and wife again but now you have two divorces left because the third one is consumed is gone so you have two divorces you do the same thing again the same process if it is within the period yeah you can reconcile you revoke the the divorce i divorced her now a couple of weeks later i said listen i revoke the divorce and we are man-wife again that's good even if she doesn't want to this is legit she's your wife two divorces down one to go once the third divorce is uttered that's it kiss the baby good night and you cannot reconcile with her until she get married again faison says can you tell me about the proper procedure and distribution of urbani well the time of qurban is over but as you might know by now there isn't anything prescribed by the prophet the only thing that is found is the saying and the opinion of abdullah i'm beloved and i'm the lovely master with me i'll be pleased with them all these three companions used to say that or as known in urdu the islamic name so we should stick to it the is divided into three portions one is to be given to the poorest charity the second is to be given to relatives neighbors and loved ones as a gift no matter who you want to give it to even if you give it to non-muslims there's no problem and the third you should eat from that but if you mix these portions and they're not equal so you give half of it for charity and you eat the second half no problem if you give a little bit in charity and call your relatives on the rest no problem if you give it all to charity and eat this little bit no problem insha allah but to do the third is what the companions used to uh say and and recommend zade says can a woman give her fellow women in marriage as her walid answer is definitely not this is not permissible a welly or a guardian who has the authority to give a person another person in marriage can must must be a man and he must be related in normal cases 99.9 cases he must be the guardian of the woman her father if not then her uh grandfather paternal if not then her son if not then her brother if not then her paternal cousin if not then that is her paternal uncle if not then her paternal cousin if she doesn't have anyone then the imam or the muslim judge or the muslim ruler would be her guardian romana says can i do rookia for curing diabetes the answer is yes rakia can be done for any illness whether mental or physical you are suffering from we do that all the time whenever i get stomachache or heartburn or inju an sports injury i do rookia to it myself alhamdulillah and i find tremendous recovery through it because this is a blessing from allah azzawajal that he gives every individual every muslim express your poverty your humility your need to allah azza recite the quran drink them some water if you have do your dua and inshallah you'll be as good as gold jihan says um spouse are destined for allah is this hadith true i always get this question and i wonder what is meant by it so after some pondering i think that a lot of the people try to comfort themselves when they say that a potential suitor came and left and we regret that he or she rejected our proposal so in order to comfort themselves they they they say that spouses are destined and uh um by allah so this was not meant to be so it will not happen also when a woman marries a man and he is abusive or he's not practicing she goes to the elders and complains seeking advice seeking divorce and they comfort her by saying it's destined by allah you have to live with it and this is not entirely true in the sense that it should not be meant to accept mistakes and to live with these mistakes to the end of your life just because it was destined by allah no allah tells us to seek a cure and solve our problems if i'm starving if i'm hungry this was destined by allah but also allah azzawajal has told me to go and look for food and eat if a woman has an abusive husband or someone who does not practice or someone who oppresses her when it comes to religious practices we don't tell her it's destined by allah keep your mouth shut and live like a slave no you have the right to file for divorce you have the right to go to the police and complain about his physical abuse if you can back this up with evidences medical reports etc you have the right to file for horror if he is not suitable for you and to your family and your children so yes marriage is destined by allah your spouse is destined by allah but so is your divorce so is dying so is illnesses so is everything that happens in this world nothing happens without it being destined by allah azzawajal says one so many muslim men travel abroad and married to christian or atheist women having contract he pays her some money to be able to get residency [Music] maybe for passport but actually she lives her life with a boyfriend and so what islam says about this this is totally prohibited and it is cheating and lying a real man doesn't do this a real man gets into marriage whether to a christian woman or to a muslim woman for the sake of marrying her and yes we do not have what the christians have till death do us a part but we believe that marriage in islam is to stay so when i marry a woman it is not something that is timed and that after three or four years i'll divorce her and leave when i finish my scholarship and my i get my degree no this is not in islam it's not an islam to use my marriage to get a green card or citizenship or permanent stay in that country this is not manly this is not islamic and cheating and lying to the authorities like this is prohibited having someone registered as your wife at the side of allah yet having boyfriends and living her filthy life like this while she's your wife this is a clear indication that you are a the youth and the prophet said ali susan three types of people will not enter paradise among them is that the youth so the companion said oh prophet allah what is a day youth he said the youth is a man who approves sins and filth to his wife so if a man is married and he allows his wife to have a boyfriend or to chit chat with men and go out with them and he has no jealousy he has no shame he doesn't feel that this is wrong his wife is dancing with his best friend or his wife is uh having a a meal and and laughing and her head off with his neighbor and it's it's all cool i trust her this is the youth and he will not be admitted to janna may allah protect us all and the second question for karima if a man conditions to establish marriage to his fiance is to have a certain job in a certain country or else no marriage can we consider this as a condition conditional marriage is it permissible in islam this is not a condition because as stated before here or somewhere else i don't know a man does not stipulate conditions because he has the authority to divorce whenever he doesn't like something it's the other way around it's the woman who stipulates conditions before the marriage contract saying that i stipulate the condition that you'd never stop me from working or you never prevent me from pursuing my uh degree and she has the right to ask for that and he has the right to refuse and if he refuses there's no marriage if he accepts then he has to abide by this condition because if he does not fulfill it in three four years time she has the right to call for a divorce it does not give him anything and she leaves him she dumps him but for the man to um make it as a condition that his wife works in a certain country this again is not a real man he falls under the same category of the youth we spoke about earlier and allah knows best thirdly if someone proposed to marry a muslim both are in a foreign country and her family approved it is it okay in islam to call or introduce her as a friend not as a fiance now this is a little bit overboard they're not allowed to communicate to begin with and they're not allowed to chit-chat or date or go for a coffee or to have a meal together just because her family approved their engagement he's a total nun to her and all the time they're spending in all the chit chats they're having these are sins compiling over them over their shoulders and they have to pay for it and by the way a lot of such engagements end in breaking up so yes he does talk to her family and they say yes we approved the engagement but the marriage did not take place they consider themselves fiancees and they date they go out and sometimes they even have intercourse because she trusts that he is her man and after a year or two of engagement they break up because this is what they see in the west this is what's happening in america and europe celebrities getting engaged for a year or two to their fiance and they you see the rock if you like it put a ring around it so he gets engaged to her they live like man and wife after two years maybe she even conceives and gives birth to a kid or two they're not married yet and all of a sudden a change of heart a change of went and they break up so the woman now is not even divorced but she was consumed and used and thrown like a bone to the dogs islam does not allow or permit this islam protects both the man and women if they want halal engagement they know the procedure and they have to get married and allah knows best he not says if a person is dead and you want to do a qurbani for them or is it permissible if yes should the person taking the qurbani take for him as well or can directly take qurbani for the dead one is due upon the living in my own sacrifice in my own realm i include my wife and children and all dependents living under my roof i also include my dead father my dead grandmother my dead mother-in-law etc in the same sacrifice without any problem but if i have a deceased father and before he died he said son you see my wealth i have allocated a building for charity so this is on rent and people pay rent every year and we give the rent to charity this is called walk endowment he says every year i'd like you to slaughter an audreya for me and give it to the poor so then i have to fulfill his will if he did not leave money behind and he ordered me to do it from my own wealth this is up to me i'm not obliged to obey it because this is not an obligation it's a request so i can simply sacrifice my own algae and include him in it but if i have wealth and i'd like to fulfill his wish i can have two here two two sacrifices now if i understand the question truly i've answered this if i did not understand it correctly maybe he now was asking about if i offer a sacrifice on behalf of the dead do i divide it into three types eat one type give one type and donate for charity one two one third one portion or because it is on behalf of deceased i have to give it all it's an issue of dispute the hambury school of thought they say that yes i'm representing the deceased and i have to do with it as if he was alive and divided into three portions as we've stated earlier and allah azza knows best zinat says for the last 27 years after the father had died and mother died 17 years ago but sometimes some of the siblings don't understand and are holding the property for themselves neither dividing the and neither selling so what islam says regarding these siblings who do not want to sell inheritance property what is the ruling and punishment for not distributing the inheritance or and property this is sinful they have no right in withholding it like this against the other heirs will if i share with other siblings a property i demand that they give me my portion of it in cash if they refuse to sell then they must buy my portion and give me my cash and if they refuse this as well then they are transgressors because they're depriving me from having my own god-given share so the easiest thing is to go and file a case against them in court and the court would force them either to sell and distribute the money or to buy those who want cash according to the prices of today and unfortunately i've seen so many similar cases and millions of dollars were wasted because the siblings are too soft take them to courts and no he's our brother he's our elder we don't want to shame him he's a thief what do you mean by you don't want to shame him if you don't want the money for yourself care about your children because if you die today definitely your children will have no right in calling for it no evidences but now while you are you're alive it's haram throwing your wealth down the drain like this um who are those people entitled to the heirs i don't understand the question if you're talking about who are the heirs of a deceased well we went through this in the chapter that dealt with inheritance and we said that there are types of heirs that have a percentage like the wife the husband the mother the daughters or daughter etc they have a percentage of a quarter half an eighth a sixth two-thirds one-third etc and there are those who inherit through virtue of kinship they don't have a percentage such as the sun such as [Music] others so it depends upon the fact that who died and who did he leave behind and then we can understand this insha allah number 20 and we conclude with this question inshallah lyric shala says if reed is prayed in the mosque instead of open place there is a musa should we attend it or would it be an innovation to pray in a mosque because the prophet elizabeth prayed aid in masala please clarify this is an issue of dispute if there is a allah you have to go and pray in the open area but if you are in a city where they do not allow people to pray in open areas and they can find them to pray in messages only in this case you should pray in the masjid and not disable this great ritual that islam has brought and allah azza knows best this is what happened here in saudi arabia this last aid we were prevented from praying in open mosallah so that the social distancing can be implemented and all the prayers were prayed inside the masjid we didn't like it but we had to comply with the instruction with the orders and we prayed the eight within the masjid may allah islam and return the blessing and favor of allah upon us where we used to pray shoulder to shoulder foot to foot in masjid without any delay or fear islam was"
