  "transcript": "foreign that shows us about the time of praying Juma Time start and when does jummah time ends and Hadith 139 talks about this and who will read it for us yes brother narrated we used to offer the Juma prayer with the prophets Allah and then depart at a time when the walls had no shade we can use ourselves narrated by bukhari and another narration in another narration we used to perform Juma when the sun was in Decline and on our return we would be looking for shade okay this Hadith was narrated by Salama and he was one of those who took the Pledge of Allegiance under the tree known as the people of the three what tree is that the three that the prophet Allah took the pledge of death when was that this was in the soul in the sixth year of Hijra when the prophet Allah went to perform umrah and he went along with his companions not taking any arms with them except individual arms a sword and that is it no heavy armor no Shields nothing and when they reached they were prevented from entering the pagans the Idol worshipers came to them said no you will not and this was a first because they never ever stopped anyone coming to pilgrimage or to visit the Kaaba as they were the Guardians of the karma this was the first time in history that they've stopped someone and they refused that the prophet would enter and they signed the treaty as you all know before signing the treaty the prophet Allah wanted to send someone to Makkah so that he would negotiate with the dignitaries of Makkah to allow the men he suggested that Roma would be sent an Umar declined instead of prophet of Allah I don't have people I don't have tribe strong tribe and Makkah I am strong by myself but I need the backing of My Tribe but if you send Earthman earthman's tribe is bigger and we know that Usman may Allah be pleased with him was from Benny um so fian and all these sons of Malia which is a prominent tribe of Makkah we're there so he went the minute he reached there he was in his arm they told him come and offer umrah our cousin and he said by Allah I wouldn't offer Umbra and the prophet Allah is waiting outside and he's not able to do this I would only offer it with the prophet so they honored him and they kept him for a while because he did not come back quickly the prophet and the companions thought that they had killed him so the prophet wanted to attack and avenge His companion and his son of law so he took the pledge of allegiance to die fighting under what is known as the tree and it's called this is what is called as and this shajara has another name it's called samura and Samurai in Arabic means and this is what the prophet called the companions on the Battle of her name when they went to Taif and this was on the eighth year of Hijra when they conquered Mecca in the he went to tithe and they ambushed him and everybody There Were Ten Thousand of the Muslims two thousand of the newly reverted or from the people that who were from Mecca and 8 000 from his companions among the tribes different tribes joined forces ten thousand when they ambushed them early morning they retreated except the prophet is along with and also one of his cousins and the prophet Allah started marching to the enemy on his mule saying I am the prophet without any doubt I am the son of Abdullah now the prophet had only three or four maximum seven people with him marching to the enemy Army saying so he's announcing it and he wasn't on a horse Allah he was on a mule that does not move this to show you how strong his confidence and dependence on Allah was is saying I'm trying to keep the prophet salaam's mule back and then the prophet said samura those who give me the Pledge of Allegiance under the tree and once he called them they immediately came back to him and said ya rasulullah here we are and those who could not slaughtered their right and walked because of the flow of the people they just went back and they started to form defend the prophet and then they defeated the enemy the prophet says whoever kills someone he is allowed to take all his belongings it belongs to him he said that four of their men came to attack me while I was on the top of the mountain he's on foot when their leader came he said what's happened where is the rest of you he said since morning there was a man throwing us with arrows and saying take it I am the son of al-aqwa and he said that this guy has burdened us a lot he had caused a lot of trouble to us so the leader said couldn't you send four men to take him out transforming so they sent four men up to the mountain to attack him and he is saying to them in Arabic today is the day of those who are stingy and mean in Arabic means that stingy and mean why are they called is from suckling and a mean person who's stingy instead of milking his goat so that the people would not hear him he goes to the goat and drinks directly from it so that's why they're calling anyone who's mean and stingy who doesn't want his neighbors to know he is from the rudba they went up and he said by Allah any man of you coming next to me I'm gonna kill him I am IBN akwar and one of them said you wish they attacked him he killed them all one of them fled and he said whoa this man is unbelievable he kept on following them until he took every single camel of the sadha and he took their goods and he took everything they left everything and went and this was approximately about Sunset when the army of the Prophet Assam with the prophet came and the minute he saw him the prophet smiled and said Salama you've done something well he said prophet of Allah I request you give me only 30 men on Horseback and I will go and I will annihilate the whole tribe I will completely destroy the whole tribe only give me 30 men and the prophet said meaning that you have won so keep it be generous be something like that we have a short break we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back so the prophet Allah spent that night and he ordered one of the camels to be slaughtered and he ate part of the meat and he gave Cinema as a trophy part of it and they spent the night and they slept the following morning they headed back to Medina how many hours did Salama jog run climbed up mountains went up fought almost 12 hours on their way back a man stood from the ansar saying is there anyone who is man enough to raise me back to Medina on foot is there a man worthy of raising me are you all afraid Solomon said Hadith says I waited patiently and then I could not tolerate this and I said don't you have any shame in you addressing us like this in front of the Prophet Allah go anal ratio I was shocked I consider myself to be an athlete I like sports but a man who does this not a marathon the whole day fighting and climbing going stretching and doing and the following day he has the capacity and the air to race he says so we started running towards Medina and I kept my energy he's a marathon runner he said I kept it in me until we were at the outskirts of Medina and I started to see the houses I let it all go and Iran and Iran and I ran until I came behind the man and I hit him in his back I hit him slapped him in his back and I said now you know who's the winner and he said you wish and I raised him until I reached Medina and he won now this is why the prophet said in the beginning in the middle and the end and in Hadith the prophet said the best of those who walk on feet of our soldiers is and he is the one who is telling us about this great Hadith may Allah be pleased with him he's telling us that we used to pray with the prophet Allah prayer then depart at the time when the walls had no shade the Wolves had no shade what is the time of the it is the time when the sun leaves the meridian and starts to decline and there is a shade pointing towards the east so when he tells us that we finished prayer everything and we left home and the walls did not have any Shades meaning that it was not even time for Zohar prayer and another narration we used to live and try our best to find the shade to walk in meaning it barely there are few Shades that can be walked under from this Hadith the scholars differed the three schools of thought of Malik and they say that the time of jummah is exactly similar to the time of War Ahmed may Allah have mercy on their souls say the time of jummah is similar to the time of Eid time of eight which is about 15 minutes after Sunrise until the time of Asura they all agree the schools of thought they all agree that the time of Joomla ends exactly the same time as the hor ends and when is that when aser is being called they all agree Juma time ends though her time ends when the answer is being called but they differed in the beginning and without any doubt the majority be pleased with them stating that it is not permissible to be prayed before this is wrong because the Hadith of Salama the Hadith of jabber the different hadiths reporting and describing to us how they used to perform they used to come out of jumrah before zawal before noon prayer this indicates that the time as Sheikh bimbaz and say that one is permitted to pray jumua about maximum an hour before noon prayer but not before that so if it's a half an hour if it's an hour before the actual this is permissible but to go up to the early morning at seven o'clock or eight o'clock there is no evidence to support this so this is the most authentic opinion where do we get it from not for schools of thought we get it from the Hadith of the Prophet Allah where Salama describes it jabber describes it that they used to finish the prayer and the noon time is about to enter so this means that half an hour or an hour before is the suitable time for Juma do we have any questions yes Facebook as we know from the earlier hadees that the proper time the best is to pray at the earliest time so is it the the same for Juma because here in India due to the less of space in Masjid sometimes we have many jamas wherein people playing queue they stand for Q to get the JAMA one Jama is over then after sometime the second Jama start so is this right to have different Jama until Asar we have so that every people get a chance to pray if there is no place for them to pray then it appears that repeating the jummah is permissible repeating the Friday is permissible if there is not enough space but if there is enough space then no it has to be one jumua unless we're talking about non-muslim countries in areas such as universities when it is not possible for them to attend the same jummah maybe then it would be permissible but there isn't a specific time for Juma and therefore you remember we said that when it is hot and summer the Sunnah is to delay the Zohar prayer just before user this does not apply with Joomla at all this does not apply with jummah because the prophet Islam used to always prayed ahead of time yes brother my question is that it's related to the earlier question that if they are making more than one Jama so that's one khudba suffice for it and one more that especially in that due to lack of spaces we have jamas Rose like three people are praying on the roof four people over here so is this correct in regard to your first question is one hotba sufficient the answer is no because the hotba is sufficient for those who prayed those who did not pray they have to have their own again I'm unable to understand how it's possible not to have enough space because you have the streets and you have the adjacent areas so all of this can be a place of worshiping and this answers your question there isn't enough space and people pray on the streets a little bit far away on the roof as long as they see the rose and are able to continue and to pray with the congregation and the reason they're not praying along with the congregation because there isn't no space available in this case it is permissible for them to pray in such a way yes brother example when Imam sits on the pulpit we see that usually his level is above the level of shells besides the pulpit we are copies of Quran are kept is it okay yes there is no problem in that sitting where the Quran is next to you is no problem I've seen a lot of the brothers complain when we put a copy of the Quran on the ground there's nothing wrong in that is my intention to humiliate the Quran no so what is wrong in putting the Quran in the same place where I put my forehead there's nothing wrong in that and hence when someone sits on the pulpit and the same level of the Quran there is nothing wrong because the intention is not to humiliate the Quran yes there are certain mosque in Bombay where the Namaz is delayed to a certain time to accommodate a certain section of the people like butcher so is it uh advisable you're talking about Friday or Friday prayers where the the Namaz is being delayed to Assad near Assad time to accommodate certain section of the people like some butchers to another time to uh as stated before what is the last time acceptable to pray Friday as our prayer so if someone prays Friday prayer at three o'clock an answer is called at quarter to four this is permissible especially if the need of the people is there there is no problem in delaying it till this hour yes brother my question is related to the earlier these in which we discussed the time for coming early before the jummah so is there any specific deed which is to be done when we come early there isn't any special deed that you are prescribed to do however there are hadiths where the Prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam said that when you come to the jummah you pray as much as you wish and there is no time forbidden for you and if you stop until the Imam comes and delivers so this is one of the things that Muslims and worshipers are instructed to do reciting the Quran of course offering Salat on the prophet Allah in the day of German and the night of the jummah is one of the greatest Deeds the prophet instructed us and said offer as much as possible of salutation Muhammad as much as you can on the night of jummah and on the day of jummah because your prayers will be displayed to me and zikr in general knows best what is the significance of two azans at the time in the jummah the jumua at the moment has two azands originally it had only one Azan this adhan is the one that follows the entrance of the Imam when he says so what is the significance of the first Azan which usually takes half an hour or an hour earlier this was introduced by Earthman even afan may Allah be pleased with him the third caliph when Medina the third caliph when Usman may Allah be pleased with him was the caliph Medina expanded a lot so he thought that whenever we call for the Adan those who hear that by the time they reach the Masjid the prayer would have been concluded so he suggested and recommended that we make another Adan prior to the first alarm and he did so and it continued until today one would say wouldn't this be an innovation and the answer is no why because the prophet said abide by Sunnah and the Sunnah of the four righteous caliph after me bite them by your teeth so any Sunnah of the companions of the four rightly guided companions or caliphs is the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah that we are recommended to follow this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
