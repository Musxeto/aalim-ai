  "transcript": "know me says what to do if my parents don't care what my sisters do I try advising but it seems their hearts are no not inclined or so inclined to the careful way of life and don't care about the Sunnah when brought to them it's so hard to let go as it's my own sisters and it boils my blood noticing them hang out with Catholic girls they talk right in front of me talk to guys slowly coping their clothing and attitude I do not know what to do unfortunately this is the price tag families have to pay when they migrate to Cafe countries and when they don't upbring their children according to Islam to Quran and Sunnah all what they care about is their school their grades and how they do in life when it comes to earning money other than that the hell with everything else I've seen in my own family unfortunately the focus over how well they do in examinations and at school and at work the focus on getting early prepared to school wearing the uniform getting their books ready and the last thing they ask is prayer so sometimes I ask one of my grandchildren who's probably seven or eight years of age have you prayed Fajr as they're going to school and they say no and I look at their parents what is this you guys memorize the Quran by heart you are imams and you are leaders in your community calling to Islam if your own children don't abide by Salat on time and you keep Salat at the end or the bottom of your priority list what Islam are we preaching so unfortunately when you migrate to a kaffir country this is what you would Harvest girls and boys who are so saturated with the kaffir way of live of living that they don't care about Islam anymore so know me I know it it hurts and it it boils your blood but at the end of the day this is not your responsibility you have no control or authority over your sisters whether you're a boy or a girl you have no control the control and the responsibility and the accountability is all on your father's head then on your mother's head they're the ones who are going to suffer in this life and if they don't care they're the one who's going to suffer underground underneath earth when they are placed in their graves and they're being tormented till the day of judgment and then when they stand in front of Allah azzawajal they'll be held accountable for the responsibility that Allah had entrusted them with with and they've simply did not pay any attention to it what to do all what you can do according to Islam is a lot of Dua in your sujood to guide them back to Islam even if it takes 20 30 years keep on making do every single day every single night every single prayer in every single sujit secondly laid by example always think of the consequences of your actions and of what you say because the end result is what counts not the process so if the process was a bit good or you thought you were doing something good but you know that the end result is going to be negative stay away from that thirdly keep on trying to change your strategies and this is what I always tell people we have to adopt we have to evolve if we've if we've been trying a particular strategy or a way of dawa for a period of time and no results are apparent change it even if you have to change it 180 degrees no problem but do not stick to something that has proven to be a failure do something that might encourage them to change and Allah Knows Best"
