  "transcript": "hadeeth number 313 this 313 page to one tree chapter chapter the believer is not a Defamer okay abu hurayra may allah be pleased with him said the prophet sort of I never said I'm said a person with two faces cannot be a trusty authentic and sound so a person with two faces what do I mean by two faces and like putting a mask what is meant by two faces two faces person is a hypocrite who comes to the sinners and he enjoys sins and he's having fun and he's saying you're the people to hang out with then when he goes to the righteous people he pretends that he is righteous he holds the prayer beads for lost or lost of Allah so such a person is two-faced person and he also or this also can refer to a person who transmits chit-chatting and gossips so he goes to this group and talks to them and listens to what they have to say then goes through the other group and says they said so and so on so about you so they retaliate and say bad things about them he goes again to them and say well are they responded by saying this and this and this he causes what because it's enmity he causes friction he causes tension between the Muslims and this is why Allah Azza WA JAL cannot or this person cannot be trusted how can you trust someone with two faces not only that the Prophet said in the authentic hadith alayhi salatu salam whoever has two faces in this world on the day of judgment he will have two tongues of fire this is his punishment that his father his tongues will be split into two and they will be a fire torturing his interior his inside because of the lies of the deceit that he used to do now we have a question we have a hadith in sahih al-bukhari where the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was sitting among his companions when a man sought permission to enter so they told the prophet of islam so-and-so is seeking permission to enter shall we allow him in the Prophet said our will to bila in a sense and translation roughly the worst of the tribes son or the tribes brother is so-and-so naming him by name allow him in so he came in and to the surprise of mother aisha she said that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam smiled in his face made him sit beside him talked to him and then the man left now you can see the difference the Prophet said the worst of the people's son or tribe is this man who's coming in but then he met him with a different face if she said o prophet of Allah you said so-and-so and then you dealt with him in a different fashion the Prophet said or Aisha the worst of people is the one who people protect themselves from him fearing his evil and foul language now this hadith caused the compass callers to look into it by no means it is two phases from the profit that is Ursula is the profit can be that like that no way no Muslim would think of this so how can we interpret how can we understand this the answer is meeting people with kindness is something that you do of your own good for example he took my money and I said keep it I forfeited my right is there in Harlem in it is it in Harlem no he insulted me I said I forgive you is there in Haram on me no he is drinking intoxicants in my presence and I remain silent is there in Harlem on me yes so this is an Arabic called Buddha Hana and Madara muda Hana is to give in in the Islamic aspects this is prohibited Allah mentioned in surah and palem what do low to the he no Fayed he noon they wish that you compromise your religion so that they can compromise and you come to a mutual ground this is not permissible in religion you have to draw the line when it comes to your own favors and your own rights and your own possessions Islam tells you give away so what the Prophet did allah√≠s a lot o Salam was this type when the man sought permission to come the Companions were sitting around the Prophet noticing every single thing he does the Prophet feared because of his nature of meeting people with a smile being generous to being kind - he was afraid that the companions would think that this person is a righteous pious scholarly like so they would think great of him and would be misled so he had to make it clear to everyone that this man is one of the worst people on earth but because it is my nature that I do not reject people or treat him treat them rudely I'm giving you this warning so when he came he behaved as usual this is not two phases the two phases is the one who causes corruption who meets a righteous and pious person and he talks with him nicely masha'Allah and he goes through the other to say this guy is evil he does this it is that just to cause problems between people so I hope this makes sense to you"
