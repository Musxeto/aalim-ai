  "transcript": "Mawlana said, I just came from Saudi Arabia, so if I do not speak clearly, because I haven't slept for about 20 hours, so listen to what I say and don't pay attention. We are here insha Allah for the coffee, for the food, have a good time and then go. But the good news is, Allah will put barakah in this gathering. We come here to get reward from Allah, the angels will bring dhikr to us, sakinah will descend to us. Alhamdulillah, we are winners. Yes sir. I will ask you to speak closer. Okay. No, they can hear me very well. I know my voice is very distinctive. People recognize me from my voice, unfortunately. So, what is the topic? It's not on a globalized world. It's not over here."
