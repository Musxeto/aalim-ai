  "transcript": "Mouni from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. There is a website I used to trust that said a person with OCD can take the easiest of the scholar's opinions in some things to help his OCD get better. So I used to have like problems with how much water goes up my nose and stuff. So I used to take the nose, mouth, and ears as Sunnah. So like are my past prayers valid especially that I used to pray as an Imam? First of all, it is not permissible for a layman like yourself to follow any random opinion on a website or an opinion said by a scholar or a da'i or a random person who speaks nicely. This is not permissible. Religion is not a game that we play with and simply, I'll Google it. Or as they say, I'll consult and ask Sheikh Google. He will answer me. No, this is not valid anymore because this is religion as Muhammad ibn Sirin said, May Allah have mercy on his soul. This knowledge, the knowledge of Sharia, of Tafsir, of Fiqh, of Hadith, of Aqeedah, this knowledge is religion. So look who you're learning your religion from. It is not permissible just to randomly check the internet and whatever option or opinion that suits my whims and desires and I find it more appealing than other opinions I could just pick that up and implement it. No, this is invalid. From now on, you have to search for a trusted scholar whom you believe is to be knowledgeable, to be trustworthy, to be religiously practicing and committed, and you follow him in whatever he says. Whether you like it or you're not, you don't. You have to follow one specific individual who'd be your guide to paradise and who would take off the heat from you on the day of judgment. Cherry picking and fatwa shopping like you're doing is not permissible and it's totally out of the question. As for your prayers, your previous prayers, I hope that they are valid due to your ignorance and due to your lack of knowledge. Now that I've explained things for you, from now on, you cannot adopt this opinion that says any easier option would do because this is not how Islam is based and Allah knows best."
