  "transcript": "Uh she I recently went to Umrah and during my uh trip after the Umrah um I knew to cut all sides of my hair but my female relatives cut only one strand. So my question is are they still or was this even valid to complete the um the sunnah for men when they want to exit the state of aam after finishing their rituals is to either shave or to cut short clip from all over their hair. For women, the sunnah is to gather all the hair and to clip approximately an inch or less from all of it from what they have gathered. Now, not all women can do this. Sometimes their hair cannot be gathered in one hand due to the nature of the hair or to any other reason. This is why the schools of thought have differed whether doing one quarter of the head is sufficient or one strand is sufficient or it has to be from all over the head or it has to be from all over the hair at the bottom for women. So she should clip all of it. And alhamdulillah if this was done due to ignorance or following a school of thought and they took a strand of the hair inshallah this does the job but it is not according to the sunnah they should have done as I've stated gather all their hair in a bunch and then just uh clip a cimeter or an inch or less from that and that would be sufficient."
