  "transcript": "so I have made certain promises to Allah in the past committing to obain from a particular action no matter what however I ended up doing that action later on does this fall under the category of breaking an Kasam or oath in Islam and should I the kafar for this be the same like the oath or not how did you do the oath for example I was saying like Ya Allah I promise with you that I will not do this action no matter what a promise you just break a promise you did not take the name of Allah and said W I will not do this oh Allah I will not do this by Say by taking Allah's name so it's an issue of dispute whether saying I promise you I won't do this is considered an oath or not most likely to me I would be on the safe side and expiate it just to be on the safe side but technically speaking I don't believe that this is an oath nevertheless if you go through the ayas of for example chapter n those who promise Allah that if he were to Grace us with his favors and give us money we would give charity but they broke that and Allah Asel sealed their hearts with with hypocrisy this is frightening nevertheless if you did not take the name of Allah and said W or I swear that I will not do this sin again I it seems to me that this is not an oath that needs experation but as I said better safe than sorry and Allah Knows Best"
