  "title": "Can we pray maghrib prayer after eating food (after breaking the fast #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I have a question uh in Ramadan can we break uh can we eat and pray after uh 30 minutes after Adan uh are you referring to M yes the answer is it is permissible to pray after you finish eating because the Hadith stated that whenever supper is served and is called for begin with your supper and then go pray so and also the prophet said there is no prayer perfect in the presence of food and a person who fasted for 16 or 18 or maybe more hours when the food is served his mind is totally focused on on the food not on the prayer so there is no problem in eating and that would probably take maybe 10 15 maximum 20 minutes maximum unless you want to chitchat and in have a good time and drink coffee and tea afterwards and some halawa or bastila or the likes no well hold your horses the prayer time is very short of M sometimes it's 50 minutes sometimes it's an hour after Sunset so if it is between 20 to 30 minutes this is fine but one should not exaggerate yet one has to eat and fulfill his need so that when he prays he is not distracted and Allah Knows Best"
