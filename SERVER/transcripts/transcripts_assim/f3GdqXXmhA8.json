  "title": "Oh Allah Please accept our Dua in the Sadaqah of the Prophet ﷺ, is this permissible?",
  "transcript": "Abdul Mateen from India Subcontinent while they're making dua while completing dua they say oh Allah please accept our dua in the sadaqah of Prophet ﷺ is this permissible to say like this Jazak Allah Khairan No this is not permissible this is an innovation it was never done by the Prophet ﷺ nor by the companions or the tabi'een or tabi'at tabi'een so this is a clear innovation the Prophet ﷺ does not need your sadaqah or your forms of worship because everything we do is accredited to him because we learned it through him so whenever we take a umrah whenever we pray whenever we make dua whenever we give charity it's all accredited to the Prophet ﷺ and he gets a portion equivalent to ours and Allah knows best"
