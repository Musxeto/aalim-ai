  "title": "If my parents tell me not to go out with my friends & still I do, am I sinful? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh your parents they say you're not allowed to go on you're not allowed to hang out with friends and these are you sinful if your parents hmm order you to do something and objectively speaking what they're asking you to do has grounds and has validity you have to obey them what does that mean if you're 16 years of age and your parents tell you don't hang out with these friends of yours don't go out because you will come back at nine and there's a curfew you have to come back before six o'clock and you insist on disobeying them definitely you're sinful but if you're a grown-up man and you're independent and they tell you not to go out with righteous friends or to the Masjid or to normal Gatherings that have no negative impact on you personally or on your religion or on your life and there's no threat to them no you're not obliged to obey them and I hope this makes sense"
