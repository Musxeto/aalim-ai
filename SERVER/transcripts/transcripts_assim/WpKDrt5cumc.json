  "title": "Subcontinent preacher says covering head is sunnah. Why do gulf sheikhs cover head? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is the famous preacher from subcontinent says we are covering head for men is Sunnah and he also quoted some authentic hadees from sahili Muslim Volume 2 book of Hajj and he says Prophet Muhammad sallam after conquering Mecca he gives speech in Black turban wearing covering with a black turban and he also says then why they always cover their heads thank you with all due respect this is not true the shuyu where this because it's a cultural thing they're not wearing a turban the prophet used to wear a turban he did not wear this rutra or this shumar so you can object to this also the prophet did not wear a kufi he were a turban so if you want to follow the Sunnah follow it the right way or don't claim it's Sunnah thirdly I wear this only when I come to make my program or when I go for Friday 24 hours I don't have anything on my head you can say it's topless but people would understand it the wrong way so yes I don't wear anything on my head because it's a cultural thing and the culture now has changed fourthly the prophet Allah always rode a mule and sometimes a camel but he used to commute within Medina basically on a mule so would I say that this is a Sunnah would I say that wedding Izar a waste rapper which the prophet used to wear a list of some and all the Arabs is the Sunnah come on give me a break there is a difference between saying it's a Sunnah meaning that the prophet recommended it and said if whoever does this has this and this reward and Allah would put him in Jannah Etc and between what the prophet did out of customs the Arabs used to braid their hair men so would we say that this is a Sunnah of course not therefore we have to look into the things that are backing it up putting all of this aside what I always condemn and criticize not wearing the coffee 24 hours seven this is your preference there's no problem in that if you want to do it I wouldn't say it's Sunnah but it's totally permissible what I condemn and criticize is that when you come to the Salat you take a handkerchief or a piece of towel or anything and you place it on your head to pray with it as if you are a woman in order to cover your hair and this is totally bogus and not from Islam so I hope this makes some sense"
