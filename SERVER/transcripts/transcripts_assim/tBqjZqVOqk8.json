  "title": "Hay Fever is really bad, pollen gets caught in beard & I inhale it, can I trim it? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mustafa from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh so I have an allergy to Poland here in the UK and the allergy or the hay fever I get people say is unlike the hay fever they've seen on anyone else and actually sometimes it can get so bad that I'm even if I'm in my bedroom I have to wear a face mask so Sheikh when I actually go outside there's a risk of catching pollen in my hair in my eyes and I wear sunglasses and a cap to protect myself but there's nothing to protect my beard so and you know my nose is obviously above my beard so I can inhale this pollen that I catch so I was wondering until I'm in the UK and I don't make hijra can I trim my beard to prevent the severity of this allergy and then once I make hijra I can do as per the hadith which is to let the beard grow. JazakAllah Khair. Wa Jazakum. I cannot answer your question because I'm not a medical doctor and I cannot judge the severity of your case so many people come to me with similar situations but it turns out that they're just wanting a way out to trim their beard or to even shave it so this is something between you and Allah Azzawajal do you think if you shave your beard anybody is going to complain or judge you or maybe punish you of course not it's only Allah who's going to do this so unless it's an emergency it's something of urgency you cannot do that because it goes against Islam who's qualified to judge a truly Muslim a practicing Muslim a doctor specialist who would say that yes this is 100% definitely the cause of your illness and it's dangerous and it's going to cause you this and that but if the allergy is just sneezing so welcome to the club there's nothing wrong in that or something fatal in that so this is something to be determined by a Muslim practicing righteous Muslim specialist who would advise you and weigh the consequences of keeping it or trimming it and Allah knows best"
