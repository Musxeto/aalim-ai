  "title": "Entry fees for tournaments, Winner gets cash prize permissible? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "alta from tanzania he says we organize um games so they have like a stadium or a playground where 10 teams participate in a tournament they take from each team a chunk of money as a an entry fee and they organize the charts when the games are to be done and at the end they give the winner trophies or prizes first place second runner-up etc so what's the ruling on that this is gambling this is totally prohibited if as organizers you take an entry fee for people to play and the winner goes empty-handed as well as the loser there's nothing wrong in that what you take is for organizing the tournament and for uh renting the place but the moment you take a portion to give the winner this is gambling because the nine other teams lost everything including that entry fee but the winner got a trophy got a prize got some cakes or whatever and this is gambling and it's prohibited you"
