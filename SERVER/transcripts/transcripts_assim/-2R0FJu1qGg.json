  "transcript": "sonia says is it permissible for me to complain about my in-laws in front of my mother or about a fight that we had with our friends or relatives or is this considered as backbiting what's the definition of backbiting sonja backbiting is to mention something that the other party which is not present would hate if they were to know that you're mentioning their name so let's assume brother ahmed he's not with us and i'm talking to you and say do you believe that ahmed steals money from the cafeteria or do you believe that ahmed cursed me and said very vulgar words to me and if ahmed were to hear this he would be upset so this is backbiting even if this that i'm saying it's true ahmed is short he's really tiny ahmed is fat ahmed is stupid his iq is low all of this is true yet because that individual does not approve of people talking behind his back in such a way this is backbiting now there is a difference between this and someone who is oppressed allah does not like people to publicly announce something that's evil and less for those who were oppressed so if your mother-in-law oppressed you and she shouted at you and said bad things about you and your family and that you are a fat cow and you don't work and she has no right to say these things to you if you go back to your mom's house or to your family and say to them do you believe that my mother-in-law's my mother-in-law said so and so and so and so about me she's an oppressor you can say these things about her because she transgressed she wronged you and she said these things awful things that you're entitled to avenge yourself by saying these things behind her back but if it is a dispute she didn't do anything you did something wrong she replied to you so both were of you were in the wrong it's unfair like so many people do they come and complain my husband did this and this and this and this and this okay this is counseling this is not backbiting but they do not say their side of this their part in the story so he shouted at me he almost hit me he threw me against the wall he never pays back uh his dues he never stays with me okay why don't you say your side of the story because human nature always want to portray themselves as the victim and never say that yeah i used to turn off the lights and the air conditioning in the middle of the uh uh the day or when he was asleep and take off his uh glasses and break his mobile and nag his head off that's why he did what he had done and i'm not taking sides but people have to be fair in order to reach a conclusion therefore if there is a dis such a dispute it's not permissible for you to go and backbite people because there's a dispute there's no transgression and you have to be wise now when you're angry with your in-laws and you go and tell your mom next week maybe they'll make up things and give you a present and please you and apologize you will forgive them most likely your mom will never forgive them till the day of judgment for the hurt they had caused you so you have to be really careful in choosing what to tell your parents and in your your family about your in-laws so that you would not cause more harm you"
