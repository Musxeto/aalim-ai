  "transcript": "among the eates of the Masjid that before I conclude that you try your level best not to bring children to the Masjid however no one has the right to scold or to reprimand someone who brought their children see there's a balance yes I'm a parent I am not supposed to bring my infant to the Masjid because I know that my infant would make cries and annoys the people attending however if I am thick or if I have a reason that no one knows about and I bring my child to the Masjid everyone in the Masjid should respect this you don't have the right to say what are you doing you're wrong you're this you're that I I remember once I was in my Masjid and while praying a child started to cry as a as someone who knows the Hadith I concluded my prayer like a jet plane quickly finished my prayer in like 5 minutes of course the majority said keep up the good work she wow this is good man I wasn't anticipating Landing this early why did I do this because the prophet was praying once and he heard a child cry so he immediately concluded and hastened his Salah and when he finish the companion said du what what what why is this he said I heard that child cry so I hastened my Salat fearing for the heart of the child's mother Allah abbar he did not care about the worshippers because the worshippers want to pray he cared about the heart of the mother who is you know dying to take care of her child this is the mercy sent to mankind wasam so this is the Sunnah you hear the child crying conclude your prayer quickly so when I did what I have done unfortunately every Masjid has Elders uncles one of the uncles you know he's like 250 years old Mah he stood up and said why do you bring your child he started shouting and and and and and uh uh reprimanding the man the man had a 5-year-old girl and I think a three-year old girl and the man did not say anything he just carried his children and went out of the door but the uncle made a scene out of it and everyone he made a sin by raising his voice in the Masjid you're not allowed to I'm a Sheikh I'm giving you a sermon I raise my voice as I want you can't you cannot sue me you cannot touch me alhamdulillah but you can't see this is one of the advantages of being a Sheikh so immediately after making such a scene I went from my special door out and to meet this man so I met the man yeah forgive the uncle they don't understand you know and these guys are so old H and they have temper and they don't have diplomacy and maybe this or that so please forgive him wall the man started to cry Wallah I don't know him he was in his mid-30s he started to weep and cry he said what should I do yeah I don't know what to do my wife left me and my children four months ago and I'm almost getting sacked of my job because no one is going to take care of my kids I have to work in the morning but who will sit with the kids and nobody's taking care of them my family their family and I felt once in four months that I wanted to pray to Allah I came to the Masid and this is what happened Subhan Allah when you don't feel your brothers with they're suffering don't judge people don't jump the gun and consider yourself always right maybe he did this maybe he did that maybe he had circumstances you never know so so when you hear a child cry don't start to blame or to look you know some of the sisters I know they would look at the sister who has a child like witches you know you getting horns and maybe they they broom groom I don't know they have this some of the sisters are evil the brothers are mashallah the uncles no but this Masjid inshallah they're good uncles are safe and let's let me leave in peace inshallah nothing happens to me so this is the best way of doing it that you don't bring the children in but if they come and they C cause confusion don't scare them so many of us children when they are 15 years of age said why don't you pray in the Masjid he said well I remember two years ago one of the uncles slapped me on the face because I was playing around one of the uncles pulled me from the row and he said no don't spray in the first row one of the uncles shouted at me one of the uncles scolded me remember your action has consequences"
