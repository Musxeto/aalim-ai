  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the UK is our first caller all \nright so there are some things in the religion   that could affect the person even if they are not \naware or know about them for example most people   know about the fact that someone can make bad dua \nagainst them and there is a possibility that this   the duacould be answered even if they have not \ndone nothing wrong to them and are saying athkar   in the morning and evening such as Bismillah three \ntimes in the morning and evening and I say in the   free quls three times in the morning evening so a \nlot of people know about this but a lot of people   don't know as well so my question is say if bad \ndua is made against a person who did nothing   wrong who does not have and this person does not \nhave any knowledge of it and does not know that it   could affect him would Allah be more lenient in \nnot answering the dua that is made against them   compared to a person who knows about it and knows \nit could possibly affect him first of all is a   weapon which an individual can use against others \nor in the favor of others and when you make Dua   Allah either answers it or deflects harm that was \npredestined to come your way or stores it for you   on the day of judgment and we've answered so many \nsimilar situations before so when you make Dua   for yourself or for others this is what \nhappens now if you make Dua against others   there are a possibility of two either you are \noppressed and you're making Dua against the   one who had oppressed you and in this case Allah \nazzawajal deals with your Dua in the three ways   either answers it or deflects harm that's coming \nyour way or stores it on the day of judgment   the second option is that you were \nnot wronged you were not oppressed   rather you are doing it unjustly and you're \ntransgressing by oppressing others with your Dua   in this case Allah does not accept nor answer your \nDua because it includes either transgression or   the severing of kinship and this is something that \nAllah does not answer or accept at the end of the   day as long as you have done your due diligence \nand you observed your athkar in the morning   and the evening after Salah before going to bed \nbefore leaving the house these are athkar that are   supposed to protect you you are with the grace of \nAllah protected unless Allah Wills something else   for a reason that we cannot see or understand or \ncomprehend at this moment but we trust Allah's   judgment and Allah's wisdom and we are content \nwith it and I hope this answers your question and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All thank you"
