  "transcript": "Louis from Germany I working with a guy that wants to wants me to build a funnel and he says he you work you work as a guide no no I I work with someone that wants me to build a funnel and he says he makes 20K a month but I feel that I have to add with the grace of Allah and he said that I only have to it's only in the mind that you have to think that the blessings are from Allah and not have to say it Allah I don't understand your question correctly but if what I understand is correct and I hope it is correct you're asking about saying with the grace of Allah to whatever achievements we make so if I'm making €2,000 a year so I say I make 20 ,000 with the grace of Allah but if someone does not say it would he be sinful the answer is no he's not sinful because this is what he's making however what's in his heart is what counts if he attributes this €20,000 to his own work and to his own power and to his own knowledge excluding Allah's favors and blessing that would be sinful and that would be problematic and Allah Knows Best"
