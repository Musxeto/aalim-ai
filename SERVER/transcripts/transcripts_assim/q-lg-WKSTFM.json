  "title": "Can we move our fingers over Quranic text in tafseer book, without wudu? - Sheikh Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "our first question for this Q&A segment is from Satya she says can we move our fingers over the quranic text in the deficit book without woudl last episode I think or the one before we talked about the ruling on touching the Quran without woudl and a conclusion is that if the book you're holding has more text than the Quran itself whether a translation or tafseer this means it is not a Quran any more so it is a book of tafseer hence you are allowed to touch it if you are not in the state of Woodill and as well you can follow and move your fingers over the quranic text however it would be far safer to read it from your PDA from your mobile phone from your electronic gadgets because this does not require google at all"
