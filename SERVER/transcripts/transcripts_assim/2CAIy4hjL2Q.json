  "title": "Zakat on Investment Amount or on Returns (Capital or Profit)? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so brother Nia's is asking about an investment when you invest money whether in clothes in groceries in cars you sell and buy you sell and by n then you get a profit is it as a cat on the capital amount money invested if these are commodities that are being sold and bought the answer is yes the zakat is on both the capital and in the profit yet the profit does not require a whole year the profit belongs to the capital so at the moment it is a full year round the capital being invested and you have to pay there's a cat today you have to pay it as a cat on int on the profit as well today even if you receive the profit yesterday only one day in your possession you have to give 2.5% of both capital and profit but if the investment is in something that is not being sold or bought for example you've invested five lakhs in a consultancy office an office a desk chairs machines computers there's nothing being sold or bought there's no zakat on it the zakat is in on your income someone building a factory machinery cars someone who's who has an agency that trends cars he doesn't sell and buy so there's no zakat on the capital invested the zakat is on the return analyzer in those best way"
