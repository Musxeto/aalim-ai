  "transcript": "from the emails Muhammad says I had seen in the papers saying that Pepsi and Coke contain alcohol they say it's not enough to get a person drunk is it still permissible for me to sit with others who do not want to give it up or do I have to explain that what gets a person drunk in small amounts is the same as what gets a person drunk in big amounts how do I go about this subject or or is it still permissible to drink it the short answer is it's permissible to drink it the detailed answer would require much time but I'll give it to you in a nutshell what is prohibited for a Muslim to drink is whatever intoxicates him and regardless whether he is Intoxicated by that material if drunk in small quantities or large quantities it is prohibited and this is what why the prophet said it's the other way around as mentioned in Muhammad's question whatever intoxicates in large quantities then small quantities or small amount of it is prohibited so every juice has a percentage of alcohol very minute that is negligible and that's why if you drink like 10 cans of soft drinks Pepsi or Coke or whatever you probably harm yourself due to the sugar in it or due to the caffeine but you will never be intoxicated so this means that it is not Haram for you to consume now if we have a juice or a drink that has like 7% 10% of alcohol in it maybe if you drink a can of beer this wouldn't intoxicate you but if you drink three cans of beer it would in this case even the smallest drop of that drink is prohibited for you why because a large quantity of it intoxicates you this makes even even the smallest amount of it haram for you to consume"
