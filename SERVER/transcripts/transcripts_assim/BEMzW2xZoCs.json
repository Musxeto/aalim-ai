  "transcript": "says a lot of the hanafi scholars say that the majority of scholars of schools of thought say that wiping over normal socks is not permissible it's only permissible to wipe over socks made of leather and they say that only bimbas bin ethemin and albani say otherwise is that true probably yes but not everything that the four schools of thought say is a must to follow allah azzawajal did not mention the four schools of thought in the quran or in the sunnah rather he mentioned quran and sunnah so sheikh bimbas they are well known to follow the quran the sunnah the understanding of the favorite three generations known as the self assad and because they do this we follow them in the sense that we respect all schools of thought we respect the school of al-hamafi maliki ashafiri and al-hambeli but at the end of the day they do not all agree they have their disagreements and allah tells us in the quran that if ever there is a disagreement refer back for arbitration to the quran this is what will determine this is the decider in such disputes and difference of opinion so when we come to the hadith of the prophet islam and how the companions used to wipe over at the sachin things that they wrap around their feet to keep them warm which was not made of skin or of leather we understand that wiping over the socks over the shoes over over whatever a person wears on his foot is made permissible in islam without classification of the material as long as it sticks on your foot and you wear it as a footwear then you can wipe over that if you have any uh objection to this you may implement it upon yourself but you can't force others you can't push it down their throat that yeah they should accept what these schools of thought say when we follow to the level of to our level best the quran de sunna with understanding of the seraph"
