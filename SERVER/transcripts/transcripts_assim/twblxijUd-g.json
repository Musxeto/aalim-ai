  "transcript": "brother Mohammed is asking about the tab Leary Gemara and everybody knows that tab Leary gemma is one of the large groups of Muslims who are widely spread in the subcontinent so India Pakistan and Bangladesh and they have their annual convention in Bangladesh in Dhaka if I'm not mistaken they have a lot of things that are good and they have a lot of things that are bad so they are the kindest of the groups they're peaceful the very generous they're nice easygoing people I know a lot of them and they used to visit me in my home and we used to talk very kind very generous they abide by a lot of the Sunnah such as growing the beard shorting the table using the miswak observing salat in the Masjid reciting the Quran making vicar all of these things are beautiful in them however they have a lot of innovated things like their six or soul depending on tablet lean is up the book and Fuzzle Armel which is filled of innovative and fabricated and weak hadith they depend on their self seclusion with the group so it is a form of Sufism where they tend to travel for three days a week ten days forty days and they go from one place to the other usually stay at messages eat together sleep together go visitation between the harasser and maghrib or Maghreb Anisha knocking doors of Muslims inviting them to come to the message it making vicar they have also the Bayan we're people after Pfizer stand up and say that I did so and so on so yesterday and this happened to me and some of it is true and some of it is fabricated or they tend to lie sometimes in order to draw people to join them but not this is not the norm but I've seen this so in essence they have a lot of good in them but they don't promote jihad they do not promote scientific circles of knowledge because they think that this fuels dispute whether this is hilarium so they refrain from learning a lot of the knowledge and that is why you don't find a lot of academics among them and if you listen to their leaders all of their tales and hadith the vast majority of it are fabricated they have no knowledge in Sharia yet they speak and they're storytellers in short as people they are good if they visit you welcomed them in give them food talk to them try to draw them a little bit to the Sunnah as much as possible going out with them is totally not recommended except for those who have knowledge so if you are a highly decorated student of knowledge and they're willing to listen to you and they invite you to go with them for three days go in these three days give them that one infuse them with knowledge of following the Sunnah of the correct Ikeda of submitting their will to Allah or not to their leadership and if you succeed in that that's a lot of good insha'Allah Allah knows best"
