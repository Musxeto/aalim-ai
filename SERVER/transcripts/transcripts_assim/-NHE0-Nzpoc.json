  "transcript": "asks a frequent question a lot of those living in Europe face the difficulty of praying on time and their bosses due to racism due to different reasons would not allow them to pray on time so he says if I pray before time this is not possible and if I pray after the hard time then this is father so what to do he you must pray on time full-stop Allah says in the salata cannot idle mini natty turban malpua very deep prayer has been prescribed at given times so you must pray your prayer on these given times now to my knowledge you have the ability to answer the call of nature so if you have to go you have to go so if you want to go to the toilet will they say no you have to sit simply you can just go and go to the toilet you have breaks people usually have a break to go for a smoke or to go for coffee break and this usually happens every hour or couple of hours so these breaks you can go perform Moodle pray your fault prayer without the Sunnah and this would not even take more than seven minutes of your time but photo and if you're observing your ruble it may take only five minutes of your time so you can do this you don't have to announce it listen this is my flag I'm going for prayer no I'm going to the toilet you go to the toilet you didn't say any lie and you pray afterwards because this is the prayer of Allah soldier now postponing the prayer until the time is out this is not permissible unless there is a legitimate reason a surgeon operating on a patient though her time comes and if he stops to pray over her there will be problems and consequences so it's permissible for him to deliver her and pray it with a sir this is an urgent matter and this is not every single day a person who is having a midterm exam or the final exams of the year and it coincides with Mahadev and Asia so he goes before motherland sunset and it extends until a time in this case we say combined model even Asia no problem but for you this is a make-it-or-break-it issue so you have to pray on time there is no problem in having a compromise or an agreement with your boss that listen I'll stay half an hour after working hours to compensate any loss of my time but other than that no you cannot delay your prayer without a legitimate reason may allah azza wajal make it easy for all of the brothers and sisters living in kerala"
