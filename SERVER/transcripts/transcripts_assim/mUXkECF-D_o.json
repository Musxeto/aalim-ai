  "transcript": "let's go to number one Provident funds it is to my understanding either something that is mandatory by the government the law of the country states that you must give a portion of your salary to this fund and the company gives a portion from its site you have no control you cannot object to say no I don't want it they take it by force so there's no control for you on it or the voluntary type of Provident Fund where you go and pick a scheme and you say okay I'd like to give like 15 percent of my salary or ten percent of my salary the company gives like 20 percent of it or something equivalent to it so that the Foro 401k or whatever they call it it would material materialized after you retire the first one is permissible because it is done forcefully so whatever comes to you after retirement is Helen and there is no zakat on it the second it is prohibited to contribute because it's gambling and it's by your own will no one is forcing you to do it so you have to pay on that zakat every year and it is prohibited for you to benefit from it afterwards because this is gambling you may live like 40 years after your retirement and consume all what you have saved with your company savings in the first five or ten years and the rest is a bonus this is gambling and you may die the following week and lose everything and do not get any a possibility of anything benefiting from this fund because you're already dead and another one bites the dust"
