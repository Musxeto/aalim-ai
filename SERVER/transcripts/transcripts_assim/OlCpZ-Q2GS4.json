  "transcript": "um Miriam says is it from the Sunnah to perform two units of prayer after which tell BIA is recited three times loud signifying the entrance into a Haram some of you may hear this and think this is a puzzle what is it I'll tell you a Haram is a state which means that I with my intention enter in in order to perform Umrah or to perform hajj and how is this done it is done by the Sunnah having a ritual bath and then wearing for a man the two towels the upper and the lower garment and then make the intention in the heart that now I am in the state of a haram the Sunnah is to verbally say that tell via lava columnar Umrah but this is not obligatory this does not affect your ROM so I said it now verbally does this mean that I'm a mom no lebec ilaha mohammed no problem it's just liquor the Sunnah is to do this intention after a prayer and when people read in the books of trip that the Sunnah is to make your harm after a prayer they say okay we prayed ah sir and I did not make my harm I went back home I took a shower I wore my clothes for harm I'd like to make a hump there is no sooner after a sir so what to do some people advised one another pray to soon a voluntary and make your Haram afterwards yes but what is this to sinners they say these to record Sunnah of a Haram so they've invented a new prayer and hold it solitude Haram or ricotta Allah Haram and there is no such thing in Islam so what to do well simply if you are leaving after the you wear your garments don't make any intention go to the message pray over her then pray Sunnah if you want to present if you don't want to present after the prayer say Lebec Alejandra and intend with your heart that I'm in the state of a harem now Oh Miriam said that we should recite this three times lebec Elohim Umbra loudly in order to signify the entrance in the state of a harem and this is an innovation it's not part of the Sunnah first of all saying it is a Sunnah so if I don't say it no problem your Army's valid saying it three times definitely is out of the question because there's no hadith stating this saying it loudly is sooner so that you can hear yourself and maybe let others know about it however the state of a Haram is an intention so I can have a shower I can wear my garments of a Haram and I look like a mushroom but then I said hmm tell you what I'll postpone it to next week take off my rom wear my normal clothes no problem it's an intention the moment I put Rahman is not does not mean I am wearing the minute in my heart I said ok now I'm in the state of Aram which signifies that if someone comes and said share put some rude some perfume I said nope I'm in the set of a harem why don't you clip your nails I'm in a city of a harem why don't you put a cap or something I'm in a city where um these are all prohibited in forum to do in this case yes you are in the state of a harem so I hope this answers your question"
