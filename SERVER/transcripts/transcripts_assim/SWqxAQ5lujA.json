  "transcript": "Fatima says can we do business of putting H design on women even though we know that they might not cover in front of non Maham if it is something that is concealed if you live in a cafir country and a woman comes to you who is not wearing the hijab and she tells you to put a tattoo on her shoulder which is already covered not a tattoo that is H designed I don't see anything wrong in that but if she tells you to put it on her hands or her face or her thighs which is then this is not permissible for you to apply and it is not permissible also for her to come out uh where showing this to the others but if she comes to you in her if you're in a Muslim country she's totally covered and she wants these designs there's no problem in that"
