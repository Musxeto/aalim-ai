  "transcript": "so Shake um I'm attending a Catholic school but and in this Catholic school we all are four S religion classes and currently I'm unable to quit the school but um my question is actually more about the seating chart see I'm seated next to like the lights where like the lights like the rooms turn on and off and sometimes the teacher when she when he wants to put on a video he asked me to turn off the lights and when he and when and when he wants to continue the lecture which he says KU and Sh things or teaches kufer and wrong things he has me to turn the lights on and also to my right above me there's like a big cross because the school is a cross right and I'm unable to quit the school so one is me is me turning the lights on and off is this helping him in his and Sh and is it sh for me to sit there when there's a cross there why would it be impossible for you to leave the school Abdullah me uh it's it's hard because the contract it says that when you start the school year you're not allowed to leave when if he leaves what happens I mean I mean I don't know the that's what the contract says there is no contract there is no contract that binds you to stay you just quit school drop off school and nothing would happen now you're asking me about turning on the lights and turning it off while the teacher is the whole day teaching you kufur and and shik it's like someone getting his W his girlfriend pregnant and then he comes and asks me about the ruling of abortion so when I say to him why did you do this why did you fornicate with this woman without using a condom and he says to me well she they told me using condom is Haram are you what is this using condom is Haram and forn in and getting a woman pregnant is okay so it's the same concept what you're doing is far far sinful than turning on and off the switch light may Allah protect us"
