Can you use what? Tamim Okay, tamim is only permissible when a person cannot use water either because it's unavailable or Because of his inability to use it For your case if you're in a hostel and it's too cold those living in New Delhi, for example and You don't have access to warm water. You don't have any ability to heat the water so that you can perform wudu with it and you fear for your safety if you Use the cold water and this is between you and Allah in this case. Yes This is a legitimate reason to use tayammum and Allah knows best You"
