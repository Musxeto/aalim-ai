  "transcript": "milla rahman al rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen sallallahu wasallam o Allah hobby hero rosula he nabina muhammad in Allah early he was a beard remain and my back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh abu sa'id a hoodie may allah be pleased with him narrated that the prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam said no zakat is due on anything less than 50 up and knows a cat is due on less than five camels and knows a cat is due on less than five what's what is this this is the measurements and the numbers and what the cat is due in now remember we mentioned before that there are how many categories of the CAC there are four here we have three only and let's go through them one by one the first one the Prophet says laser FEMA doona Homs Allah Sedaka our is the plural of Opia and opia is a means of measurement of gold and silver so the Prophet are a solid wassalam is saying to us that the nisab the limit of silver is 50 piya each oak Lea is equivalent to 40 dirham so these are the coins at the time of the Prophet erased alot of Salaam so 200 dirhams these are the nisab of silver how many grams are there so that we can know scholars say it is 5 95 grams of silver 500 and 95 grams of silver if you have this or more and a whole year passes while it is in your capacity while it is in your possession then you have to give 2.5% as the cut if you have 490 grams and a whole year passes do I pay the cut nope because it is below the nisab if I have 600 grams of silver but 11 months passed and then I gave it away do I have to pay the cut because the whole year did not pass so these are two conditions understood by the Prophet did not mention gold Ali his salat wassana but it was mentioned in another hadith where he said that 20 dinars is then his up for gold and how much is twenty dinars scholars calculated it and said that if you have 85 grams of gold then you have to pay the cat if a whole year passes 85 grams of gold what kind of gold is it important to know yes of course why because if it is 16 karat gold it's different than when it's 24-karat gold so the prophet is talking about pure 24 karat gold because 16 karat gold is not pure it has copper it has other materials with it so it is not pure so you may have a hundred and 80 grams of gold of 16 carrot or 18 karat and there is no sir cut in it why because if I take it to the Goldsmith and I asked him how many pure grams of gold are there in this amount of gold that I have and he calculates it and he weighs it and he tells me there is only 70 grams this means that there is no zakat on it and this helps you when you calculate there's a cat on your gold on your wife's gold sometimes your wife gives you this bunch of gold and you're happy that martial law this is a lot and you take it to the jewelry shop he measures it he fixed it he looks into it to know what carrot of gold is he having and then he tells you this is only 75 golds what 75 grams suggests it's not fully original it's not pure it's not so and so so you don't have to pay the cat for that here is this understood now before going on to the second and third part what is the ruling on money so if I have euros if I have reals if I have rupees if I have dollars if I have whatever so how can I give the cat on that should I calculate it on silver or on gold yes brother our calculation should be based on the amount of gold present for example then the South level of gold is 85 grams so we should have money which is equivalent to the amount of 85 grams of gold this is one of the schools of thought that says that monetary and banknotes are calculated with their equivalent of 85 grams of gold but the other scholars say that this would be depriving the poor because then we would have only a limited segment of people who have this amount of cash how much is one gram of gold costs nowadays ionno it in Real's is 200 plus so you're talking about approximately maybe 20,000 Rios of savings for a whole year not everybody has this and this means that the chances of the poor getting the cat is not as much when we say that the saab is 5 95 grams of silver because then the nisab would be approximately 3000 reals or 4000 reals so the difference is extremely big and that is why shape ibanez a mean and sharing baths and others great scholars say that the money should be calculated by silver and not by gold and as I stated it's an issue of dispute among scholars but this is the most authentic opinion so this is money this is gold this is silver we got it over with there are so many strings attached however what is among them is if I lend someone money let's say I gave someone five thousand euros as a loan do I have to pay the cat on that or not scholars said you have to look into the situation first when I gave the money to that brother was it indefinite or was it time-bound if it was indefinite I have to go to him every single year and say brother do you have the money can I have it back or not if he says I am broke I don't have money or he refused to give it to me he said no you don't have anything prove it do you have any papers you have any witnesses so if he does this scholars say that this loan is as if it is lost I don't pay the cat for it for the whole period until he gives it to me whether it's after three years five years 10 years 20 years once I get it I give the cat only for one year so this is case one if he is saying I don't have money at all I'm broke I apologize or he is rejecting the fact and he's lying and he's denying that he took money from me the second situation is if I know that he is able to pay but I'm too shy to ask him this happens a lot you give someone money and I don't need the money if I ask him maybe I would embarrass him whenever he has the money he will return it back in this case I have to pay the cat every single year over that 5,000 euros and when does the nisab or when does the hull begin this is an issue of great confusion among the people when do I pay the money the scholars say that you have to pay the zakat when a full year passes nowadays we get money coming in and out every month so how can we calculate when the year starts and when the year ends is difficult every month i'm getting my salary the only way to do this is to have 12 wallets or 12 balls and one is for Muharram so far Rajbeer drama bond the ledger and every month I get my salary or my income I take what I need and I throw it in one of the wallets and after one year I calculate what's in the wallet and I gave 2.5% but this is not realistic because usually your wife will not leave you anything in that to go and clean it all and if she doesn't clean it it is difficult because now I have to fix my car where should I take my money from from Harlem or from Ramadan and then I get some money somewhere else orc we should i put this so scholars say the best way to do that is to designate one day in the lunar year and that day let's assume it is the first of Rajab let's assume so whenever first of Rajab occurs next year you calculate everything you have whether it came into your possession a year ago or it came into your possession last month and you give 2.5% and that is it don't think about what you have until the coming first of Rajab one would say yeah the money that I got one month ago why should I pay 2.5% if a whole year did not pass I say you don't have to but I'm telling you that this is the best way and the only way for you to relax and not be confused we have a short break stay tuned and shell out assalamu alaikum and welcome back so this is the only way in the best way of not being confused set a date and regardless the money came a year ago six months ago yesterday you give 2.5% and this is found in the sooner that is giving there's a cat in advance this is found and we will get to read this inshallah after a while so this is regarding the debts you have likewise people say and claim I borrowed 20 thousand euros from a friend so when my date for the cat comes I have 5,000 euros so can I deduct this from that dance or no your loan is a separate issue of the money you have in your possession if I have forty thousand euros in my bank account and I borrowed 20 thousand but these forty thousand a whole year past should I gives the cut for the 40 or 420 you should give the saccade for 40 because if you want to save yourself from the Sekot money give the 20,000 back to the owner before does the cat is due but keeping the money in your possession and not wanting to pay the cat no the Prophet erase a lobster when he sent his rulers to collect this a cat they did not go and ask the people this is all yours or did you borrow some they used to get there's a cat from whatever they found regardless if the man says this is not mine I borrowed it or not as long as it's in his possession they'd give the cat out of it the profit goes on re salatu salam to say that there is no saccade you unless than five camels so now we know that there is a certain number of camels that you give the cat for and there is a certain number of cows that you give the cat for and there is a certain number of sheep that you give the cat form so if I have 39 ship there is no the cut if I have 40 sheep there is a cut one sheep if I have five camels there is one ship if I have four camels nothing and likewise so these numbers they are not of that importance to us because we do not have livestock but those who do it's very crucial for them to know what are the numbers needed to know so four cows are they 20 or 30 and when they have to give a sheep or they have to give account of certain age in the case of camels five you get one cheap but then the multiplication of that you give a certain age of camels so everything has its zakat and rules that governs it to me I don't know them I never keep them by heart simple because nobody asks me about them so I memorized them and I keep them by heart three four weeks nobody asks me I forget them because you don't need it it's not always there unlike other questions where you're always asked about it you know it so to us we don't have livestock so we pass this and sha Allah but you need to determine what is a cat in your livestock this is very easily calculated and then the prophecies that there is no zakat do on less than five watts and arousal and the Lewis is a big thing that you put what you would like to measure in so as in the case of liters a liter is a means of measurement by size or weight by eyes a kilogram is by weight so the what's up is a means of measurement by size and scholars say that a wassup is equivalent to 60 saw do you remember saw we took this as a measurement when we were talking about lucid and the Tsar is composed of how many mood for is composed of four mood and what is the mood it's one hand or two hands full it's one hands full so whatever you can collect in both of your hands this is called mood four of them is considered to be a Tsar and once on is necessary for the cattle footer right so this is four times now L what's up which is measurement by size for the crops is equivalent to 60 Tsar so 5 x 60 is 300 so on so if you have your crops more than 600 saw this is Zeke a table and if it's below that it is not Zeke a table and the saw is equivalent in weight to two kilograms and 40 grams so drop the grams it's about two kilos plus so if i have my crops that approximately ways 610 or six hundred and twenty kilograms then i have to pay zakat less than that i don't have to pay the cut okay is the cat do in fruits no we've said it that what about vegetables again no it is do n things that can be stored and can be measured by the Tsar and that is why scholars differentiate between or by the method of watering so they say if the crops are in a farm and my farm has a stream going in so it is watered by the stream or continuously watered by the rain or from a spring or from a river meaning I'm not putting any effort to water it in the water is always there then i have to pay 110 of it for the cut the percentage wise ten percent how much is the percentage when it came to gold silver and money 2.5 so they call it this is quarter of a tenth and if the crops are being watered without any effort from my side it is one tenth or ten percent is the cata beware ever the crops is being harvested what about if I have to dig a well and then put motors and methods of pulling the water from underground to water these crops they say in this case the cat is half of the tenth which is five percent so whenever there is an effort from my side and not the effort is by digging canals no the effort by drawing or pulling the water from underneath the earth by motors and so on or by camels or by animals drawing the water up this means that I pay only five percent of the saccade going back to the livestock any livestock that I have I have to pay the cat know if the livestock is eating most of the year from the open ground there is the cut but if I am feeding I'm buying the grass and I'm buying the hay to feed m then there is no circuit at all there's a cat is when the livestock is eating from the ground meaning I have nothing to spend on it it goes and eats from the grass it goes is from the farms no problem in that I have to give this a cut but if I am feeding I have livestock of a thousand sheep and i buy trucks of grass every day and I feed them at the end of the year there is no zakat unless they are used for selling so approximately this is what needs to be discussed about this issue we have to discuss it further more next time we meet do you have any questions you just mentioned a point about the animals if they are eating from outside then there is no sucka there is the count them and if you're feeding them then there is no the cup what about for example in that country which says the rainy season and for some time of the earth they're eating from outside when the grass growing and then Mendez you know the dry season you're feeding them so in that case what happens well scholars say that it depends on what prevails so if it is most of the year eating from my own crops and some part of the they eat outside there is no Sekot but if the majority of the year they eat outside in some 3-4 months I feed them myself then there is the circuit Salaam alaikum Quran you told about gold that for 85 grams of gold there is 2.5% Sekot suppose for example if I have 50 grams of coal and somewhere around 400 grams of silver and some cash but the total amount is equivalent to what is more than 85 grams of good will I have to pay zakat it's an issue of dispute among scholars whether it is permissible to join different types together so some say that as long as the money the silver and the gold is owned by the same person so it should be considered to be one type some say no the gold is different than the silver and likewise the cash is different than them all to me I cannot decide at the moment I cannot tell you because it appears to me that as long as the owner is one then he is considered to be having one type of money just you said that if the crops are irrigated from natural waters or you are not doing it it is 110 and if you are using your efforts then it is one-fifth and you told that is five percent not one-fifth it is half a tenth which is five percent which is less gold and silver the zakat is quarter of a tenth which is 2.5 if the crops are being watered by me by my engines and by my efforts it is half a tenth which is five percent if it's irrigated naturally by rivers or streams of Springs without any effort from my side it is one-tenth which is ten percent I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah
