  "transcript": "Ameena says how do people's names affect them well this concept is found a lot in the subcontinent and in people who do not know Islam well they believe that if a child 2 years of age 3 years of age is constantly sick or there are calamities in the house poverty lack of jobs lack of provisions they blame the name and they say the and they say we went to a scholar to a great eylem and he told us that change the name of the girl or of the boy and all your trouble would go away and when you ask what is the girl's name they say Fatima Subhan Allah what is the boy's name they say Amit so what's wrong with the names although we don't know this is what the Sheikh said and he said unless you change the names the calamities would increase and continue this is totally bogus totally fabricated and not only that it can reach to the level of Sheikh because this kind of superstitions this kind of believing in bad omens is shirk the Prophet said a little minute and the hadith out Liara to shirk that believing in bad omens is shirk even miswrote says that all of us have this belief in bad omens but allah azza wajal saved us from it by having telecon by depending relying and only trusting a large the orchard so the feeling of mmm this black cat that is dead on my way means that my day is gonna be horrible I'm gonna fail my interview I'm gonna not be able to get the woman I'm proposing to to accept marrying me so I'll go back this is if you continue to do what you want to do this it means that you have to occur on a larger so the names in this context does the names do not affect your destiny your destiny has been written but names may have impact on your personality sri de minimus aiib one of the great tibetan he said that my father and messiah said that his father whose name was hasn't has an in Arabic means rough and tough and difficult so hasn't the Allah be pleased with him who was a companion went to the Prophet I am so the Prophet asked him what's your name so he said hasn't meaning difficult rough so the Prophet said no no you are sad you are easy so the man may Allah be pleased with him said no I'm not gonna change a name that my father named in with now his grandson is native nilma say one of the great Severine he says since then toughness and rudeness and hard harshness has been in all of his descendants meaning that the name has an impact on the individual's character not that it has an impact on his destiny whether he gets a job whether he gets provisions whether he's healthy or not it has nothing to do with that"
