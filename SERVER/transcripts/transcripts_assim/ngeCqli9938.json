  "title": "Can I correct people if they're doing smth wrong even if I don't have much knowledge Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um would it be okay for someone like me with a little knowledge of islam who sees people like some relatives who are very hopeless of praying on time or a classmate who says they don't pray to tell them that not praying on the time without a valid reason is like a major sin and not praying it kind of doesn't feel right because of my lack of knowledge and that's why i'm asking okay nasra first of all people vary in their knowledge so you have all the right to give advice in regards to the issues that you have knowledge in you are wise in delivering this knowledge and finally you have the perseverance and the tolerance to tolerate whatever comes when it backfires in knowledge we mean when you see someone falling in fornication or doing drugs or drinking booze this is something known to all muslims by default that it's haram so you've got the knowledge you can it's not something an issue of dispute secondly you have the wisdom so you don't go to them when they're intoxicated and may act in a way that put them in harm's way all you me may put you in harm's way someone who's totally wasted and he has a 45 magnum in his hand and and revolver and he's playing with it and he's trigger happy and you can see that sparks are coming from his eyes he wants to shoot someone and you go to him and say listen this is haram what you're doing is sinful allah is going to throw you in hell because and 40 days of your prayers are unexp accepted and you will drink from uh this and that river in in hellfire and you know that's gonna put a cap between your eyes definitely this is not wisdom likewise you don't go to people and throw it in their faces you guys don't pray you delay the prayer and whoever doesn't pray until the time is over he's a kafir and he's in eternity in hell nobody's gonna accept this from you so you have to have the wisdom how to crack it open to them how to approach them in a nice way that might be acceptable thirdly you have to be capable of tolerating whatever comes your way you're an extremist you are this your dad who are you to talk to us you you are uh a fundamentalist you're a taliban you're this you're that you shouldn't be angered by that or wanting to retaliate rather you say alhamdulillah the prophet sallam was also abused in the cause of allah azzawajal and he tolerated this so don't let shaytan prevent you from saying the right thing at the right time as long as you have knowledge in it it's not an issue of dispute and you can present it in a good way and allah azza knows best"
