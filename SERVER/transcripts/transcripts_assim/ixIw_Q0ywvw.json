  "title": "Ruling on Praying behind the Imam of Makkah by watching the TV and best way of seeking forgiveness",
  "transcript": "our first question is from Brother ABD Rahman and he is from New York he says that I'd like to know if one is sick and cannot go to the mosque can he pray Friday prayers Salat by watching the Juma prayer in Mecca also what is the best way to ask Allah for forgiveness regarding the first part of the question whether it is Friday prayer or the daily congregational prayer you cannot pray it unless you are with the congregation and that is why it's called Sal prayer in congregation so if someone lives in a highriser in an in an apartment and just below him there is a Masjid and the people pray in the Masjid can he Overlook the Masjid from his house from his bedroom pray with them in congregation he hears thean he hears the he hears the recitation of the Quran the answer is no and the reason is because he is not with the congregation therefore his prayer would be invalid now it is even worse if a person prays behind a TV set or making the TV set his Imam so he is in Mecca but instead of going to the Haram to the holy mosque he decides that he wants to go well actually he decides that he wants to stay home and he wants to pray in his living room and this is not permissible and his prayer is invalid you have to be with the congregation if you are sick with the grace of Allah Allah has given you the permission to pray in your home Allah does not want you to kill yourself or to torture yourself it does not benefit Allah and Allah does not burden us with such things if you're sick and you're unable to go to the Masjid you have the excuse to pray in your home as for the second part of the question which deals with the best way to ask Allah for forgiveness there are numerous ways of doing that but we have an authentic where the Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam told us about the master of seeking forgiveness meaning the master of supplications and it's a long and beautiful Hadith not that quiet it's not that long all what you have to say is and you go on saying the Dua well this can be also uh what I've just coded can be for reciting the Quran and concluding the the Quran but begins with oh Allah you are my Lord and there's no God worthy of being worshiped except you you've created me and I am your servant and I am to fulfill your pledges that is my pledges to you and to be on my allegiance to you and Promises to you and then you go on to confess of your shortcomings and to admit Allah's blessing and favors over you and then you seek Allah's forgiveness it's a beautiful Hadith that the scholars have explained and interpreted to us though it does not need an interpretation this is what the prophet called the master of Supplication of now if you would like to only ask Allah for forgiveness by saying or you say all of these are possible and uh acceptable few say what Adam and Eve said peace be upon them also this is acceptable so the sky is the limit any way that you seek Allah's forgiveness by repenting to him by showing him sincere and uh uh true remorse and by saying it it with your tongue I seek Allah's forgiveness or saying the master supplication of seeking for forgiveness this is all inshallah uh valid sister"
