  "title": "Ruling on asking Allah for a Dream as a Sign for a decision I'm trying to make",
  "transcript": "Sh. Abdul Aziz from Sri Lanka. Sheikh, my question is what is the ruling on asking Allah for a dream that we need to see? Like if we are in between a confusion of making a decision or we are unable to make a decision on our own and we are struggling, and we've tried all of our best possible ways to do something and we don't see a proper answer for it, can we like ask Allah for a dream that He guides us to a dream because we don't have anybody who can guide us? You can. You can ask Allah Azza wa Jal. However, if you see a dream, this does not mean that it is from Allah. Shaytan can be messing up with your head. So this is not a way to find out whether this decision is right for you or not. And Allah Azza wa Jal knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
