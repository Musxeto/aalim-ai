  "title": "Does giving zakat or charity both from halal, haram earnings nullify whole amount? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I hope your Ramadan is going great inshallah it's excellent thank you so much Shake I asked you a question recently but um I didn't quite get the answer perhaps it was a little misunderstood please allow me to convey it briefly briefly sh to simplify yes I I'll be very brief Shake just just to simplify if a person has $50 $20 of which are lawful but 30 are unlawful he did not separate the $30 gave the entire amount $50 in account I just want to know would the entire amount remain nullified just because the total amount included a portion of Haram bu um no no the whole amount is valid the $20 that are zakat are valid and the $30 that are Haram are considered to be cleansed you will not be rewarded for them there is no charity in them there is no Sak in them because Allah is and does not accept except what is Allah subhah wa tala does not accept anything that is not pure so the $20 that are Halal these are accepted among the zakat the $30 that aream these are wasted in the sense that you've cleansed your wealth from it you have to get rid of it but when you give it to the poor you will not be rewarded for that and Allah Knows Best"
