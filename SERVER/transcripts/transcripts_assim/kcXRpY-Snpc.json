  "title": "Should he travel with his Mom & Sister who attend Mixed Gatherings & Anniversaries - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "fasi says share my family still goes to mixed weddings and death anniversaries since my father had died I'm the only Muharram that is available to go with my mom and my sister I know that it is not permissible for a woman to travel without a Muharram so what should I do I already told them that it was not permissible but they did not follow my point fasi it seems to me that whether you go or not they will go so is it permissible for me to facilitate sin for them is there traveling from one destination to the other to attend mixed gatherings weddings and and and anniversaries of a deceased is the purpose of going halal there's no in this case it is not permissible for you to collaborate with them and give them a helping hand so they will go without AMA from here they will go to another Muharram this is their sin and the sin is on their heads not on me because I cannot stop them but at the same time I cannot collaborate with them and help them and assist them so you do not go with them and this in my opinion is different than if they want to go for example to school or to a hospital or to a shopping mall to buy groceries the reason for going to these places is halal is legitimate the means that they're following which is not being in hijab is Haram so should I drop them or should I leave them take a cab with a stranger to take them there the list of the two evils is to drive them yourself this is different than going with them as a muharram to something that is Haram which is mixed weddings this is how I'm to attend weddings with music to attend deaf anniversaries all of these are Haram occasions that you should not help them in and Allah knows best"
