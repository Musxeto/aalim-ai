  "transcript": "the next question is is practicing or learning yoga forbidden in Islam yes it is because yoga is based on Buddhist Hindus Hindu Traditions so and they're facing the sun in some postures and they have these yeah uh uh worshiping other than Allah in this kind of sport though the stretching is good so if you can have a routine of stretches that has nothing to do with yoga or the name or the practice there's no problem in stretching it's good for your muscles but when you say well I'm going to my yoga class this is my yoga mat this is my yoga pants and you have the same postures and facing the Sun at certain uh uh names and and and pauses and the likes this is totally Haram"
