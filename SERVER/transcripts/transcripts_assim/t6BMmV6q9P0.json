  "title": "Working for insurance company - #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as for working for an insurance company the majority of insurance companies are not Islamic and therefore it is not permissible to work for an insurance company that deals in commercial insurance because this is a form of gambling you pay premium of 2,000 you're covered up to half a million if nothing happens to you during the year your 2,000 is gone but if you required something up to half a million we will cover you this is gambling it's like buying a lottery ticket and you may get a Porsche and you may just lose your five hundred dirham this is complete Harlem this is gambling without any doubt in it so the same thing goes with this and allah azza wajal knows best"
