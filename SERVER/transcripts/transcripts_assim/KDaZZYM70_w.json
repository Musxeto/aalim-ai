  "title": "I know Non Muslims cannot enter the Arabian Peninsula, is my income haram if I have an Airbnb?",
  "transcript": "Khamees from the Emirates. So Sheikh, I know the hadith about the, I kind of know about the Arabian Peninsula where like you can't really have other religions other than Muslims. But the thing is I have my dad working in Airbnb and I kind of work with him. So maybe non-believers can enter the apartment. Is my income Haram? Now this is something that is way above your pay grade in the sense that the instruction and the order of the Prophet ﷺ not to allow other than Islam to remain in the Arabian Peninsula has been explained by scholars in many different ways. Among them is that they should not reside and they should not be from the people permanently living there, building their temples, building their churches, building their synagogues. This is totally prohibited for the Muslim and this prohibition is in the neck of the Muslim ruler. If he defies this and if he does not care about what the Prophet ﷺ ordered, he'll be held accountable among a bunch of things on the Day of Judgment. So this is not for you and me to decide. As a Muslim, when you meet a non-Muslim who is in the Arabian Peninsula, there is nothing wrong in dealing with them nicely, treating them nicely, renting them Airbnb or a hotel room or selling them groceries or having commercial ties with them. There's nothing wrong in that and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
