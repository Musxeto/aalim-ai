  "title": "Should I ask my mom for forgiveness if I disrespected her when she was not looking",
  "transcript": "Isa from the UK Hamza from Sweden Sor sorry sorry okay um I sorry I may have deliberately disrespected my mom behind her back when she was not looking several ways like maybe making a bad face intentionally I may have also deliberately done something disrespectful to my mom when we were talking she was looking at me I feel like sometimes I have OCD about these issues I would like to know if any if I've done anything wrong I know this has become his issue now because I may ask my family members to forgive me or I say sorry to them and some of them even get irritated by how many times I say it but my mind tells me to say it just be put just to be on the safe side and so and so they don't they can't me the the war which the op pressed make against me and it being accepted first of all it is a major sin to disrespect one of your parents or both of them and this major sin is a major sin for those who do that intentionally deliberately as for those who are not certain whether they disrespected or not or it was done without or against their will due to their compulsion due to your mental state and the likes such people are not held accountable now the question is should we after every time we do such a sin ask for forgiveness from our parents if you notice that they are agitated and angered by your consistent and continuous apology then you should not do that rather you should ask Allah Asel for forgiveness and repent to Allah especially when they did not notice your disrespect but if you've done something that angered them and it's obvious that they're angry because of what you had done in this case you must ask for forgiveness and ask them to Pardon you and promise them not to do it again and Allah Knows Best"
