  "transcript": "foreign [Music] used to select a specific dua as reported when he used to offer the prostration of recitation what is the difference see normal prostration we know prostration of recitation is a prostration a muslim offers when he is reciting the quran and he passes by a position where there is a requirement of prostrating and there are 15 places of prostration in the quran so what did the prophet allah say whenever he passed by such dua he used to say that allah my face fell prostrate or i prostrated before he who created it and brought forth its faculties of hearing and seeing by his might and power so blessed is allah the best of creators this is one way of course we know that if you say subhana rabbi that would suffice but this is another virgin of what you can say as well the prophet also used to o record for me a reward for this prostration and remove from me a sin save it for me and accept it from me just as you had accepted it from your servant there would peace be upon him also this is another dua and why that would of all people because in uh surat saad the prophet uh prophet dawud prostrated to allah azzawajal so this is similar as a sign of gratitude to allah the almighty and seeking his repentance so either virgin you you take that's recommended and you're rewarded for it and if you just simply say subhana rabbil that would suffice insha allahu azzawajal so now we're through with the sujud with the roku or with sitting in between what do we say in the first the shahood the prophet alaihissalatusam taught us how to say the first to shahud and he said we should say all greetings is for allah all acts of worship worship and good deeds are for him peace and mercy and blessings of allah be upon our prophet peace be upon us and all of allah's righteous servants i bear witness that none has the right to be worshipped except allah and i bear witness that muhammad is his slave and messenger now this is called a tashahud and the the shahood is a pillar of salat it's not mandatory only it's a pillar in the last rakah of the salat but it is mandatory in the first sitting if the prayer is composed of three or four rakaas some folks think that this is a dialogue that took place between allah and his messenger in the miraculous night journey in the mirage when the prophet was ascended and taken up to the seventh heaven and this is not weak hadith this is fabricated it has no origin to it so definitely it's 100 bogus and not true this is what the prophet taught us allah to say in our prayers now after that we offer what is known as the salutation upon the prophet allah and this is called ibrahim some people call it sharif and the root is not an islamic terminology nor an arabic word so it's the salutation upon the prophet what do we say in it we say allah muhammad muhammad [Music] [Music] send prayers upon muhammad and the followers of muhammad just as you had sent prayers upon ibrahim and upon the followers of ibrahim verily you are full of praise and majesty o allah send blessings upon muhammad and upon the followers of muhammad just as you had sent blessings upon ibrahim and upon the followers of ibrahim verily you are full of praise and majesty remember this is known as the companions were the ones who asked the prophet sallallahu alaihi how should we salute you and he taught them this what's the ruling on it some say it's a sunnah some say it's mandatory some say it's a fart i'm inclined to say that it is mandatory to be said in the last the shahood and insha allah this would get you closer to allah this would get you closer and sitting next to the prophet and you would be fulfilling the sunnah of the prophet alaihis salah to wasallam this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi foreign foreign"
