  "transcript": "There is a good example for you in the messenger\nof Allah, for those who hope for Allah and the last day and remember Allah a lot. In the name of Allah, the most merciful, the\nmost compassionate. Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. And peace and blessings be upon our Prophet\nMuhammad and his family and companions. As for the rest, dear brothers and sisters\nin Islam, peace and blessings be upon you. And welcome to this new episode of the role\nmodel, peace and blessings be upon him and his family. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,\nindeed was the perfect human being. And it's not true that he was always sad and\ncontemplating and thinking of the hereafter, because this is inhumane. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,\nwas the perfect balance. He used to be sad and he used to be happy. Whenever there is a reason to be sad, he used\nto be sad. And when there was a reason to be happy, he\nwas happy. He was pleased when things needed to be pleased\nwith and he was angry when he needed to be angry. As a perfect human being, he was filled with\nemotions. And he used to become happy at times. Yet his happiness was in the direction of\nwhat pleases Allah, Azza wa Jal. And not for worldly matters. We are happy when we buy a new car, a new\ngadget, when we receive gifts, worldly things. This was not the case with the Prophet, peace\nand blessings be upon him. So we will list a few things just to understand\nhow the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, lived his life and what made him happy\nso that we may rejoice with such things when it happens in our lives. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,\nas described by the companions, whenever he was pleased or happy with something, his face\nwould lit. And his companions would recognize this in\nhis face. So in a sense, he didn't have what we call\npoker face. No, the emotions would show on his face, peace\nand blessings be upon him. And they would know by the change that they\ncan see. For example, when people embrace Islam, revert\nto Islam, especially when they are part of the elite or the dignitary of Quraysh, the\nProphet would be happy because he knows that there will follow them a lot of the people\nand follow suit. Ikrima, may Allah be pleased with him, he\nis the son of Abu Jahl, the fierce enemy of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,\nand of Islam. He is the pharaoh of this Ummah. He tormented Muslims, killed them, plotted\nagainst Islam, did everything he could till his last breath. Such an enemy, you would hate everything that\nis related to them, and you would have wanted to kill anyone related to them, even their\ndogs. Not the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon\nhim. Ikrima, when he heard of the conquest of Mecca,\nfled and traveled all the way to Yemen. His wife traveled to him, trying to convince\nhim to accept Islam and not to fear for his life because whoever comes to the Prophet,\npeace and blessings be upon him, accepting Islam, the Prophet accepts that from him. So he traveled back to the Prophet, peace\nand blessings be upon him, and accepted and reverted Islam. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,\nwas very happy, and he jumped to him and gave him his cloak and took the Pledge of Allegiance\nfrom him when he came, and this appeared clearly on the Prophet's face, and this shows you\nthat the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, did not have any hidden agenda. If he were to hate someone, he would have\nhated the son of Abu Jahl for what he had done, yet he was happy for him accepting Islam. Likewise, he was happy when Adiyy ibn Hatim\nal-Ta'i came and accepted Islam. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,\nsmiled in his face, and his face was lit when he announced that he came as Muslim. Likewise, whenever the Prophet, peace and\nblessings be upon him, learned something new that would confirm a fact that people denied,\nhe would be happy. We spoke before about his adopted son, Zayd\nibn Harithah, may Allah be pleased with him, who was his son till adoption was abolished\nin Islam. The Prophet loved him as a real son and continued\nto love him. Zayd was when described as white as cotton. The Prophet married him to an Abyssinian slave\nwoman who took care of the Prophet when he was young, peace and blessings be upon him,\nso you can imagine how old she was. And she gave birth to a young boy by the name\nof Usama. However, Usama was as black as night, so people\nusually hinted that, hmm, Usama is not the legitimate son of Zayd. Zayd is white, Caucasian, and Usama is black. How could that be? And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon\nhim, was discomforted by such comments, and he did not like this. He loved Usama and his father Zayd dearly,\nlike a son and a grandson, until one day, one of the trackers, his name was Mujazziz\nal-Madlaji, entered the house of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, when Usama\nand his father Zayd were lying down, covering their faces, only their feet showing from\nunderneath the blanket. Two white feet, two black feet. As a tracker, as someone who has insight of\ntracking people, knowing things, they have this ability and gift from Allah, and he did\nnot know the story behind Usama and his father, and what the people say. He commented the moment he saw these feet,\nand he said, these feet are from one another, they belong to one another, meaning that they're\nrelated. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,\nwas so happy that this man managed to notice this without being hinted to, and revealed\nwhat is a fact and the truth, known to the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,\nbut unknown to the others. We all know that the Prophet, peace and blessings\nbe upon him, was tested and tried by a huge and severe calamity, when the hypocrites slandered\nhis beloved wife Aisha, and accused her of adultery with Safwan, one of the companions,\nmay Allah be pleased with him. And they started spreading rumors and slandering\nher everywhere. The Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,\nwas dismayed, and for a whole month, revelation did not come down to show her innocence, or\nto reveal any of the truth. And the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon\nhim, could not judge an issue by mere feelings. He needed proof. So, after a whole month, and after this ordeal,\nAllah Azza wa Jal revealed her innocence in Surah An-Nur in the Quran, and the Prophet,\npeace and blessings be upon him, was so happy it would show on his face, and he would come\nto Aisha laughing, and the first thing he said to her, O Aisha, Allah has proven your\ninnocence. So, he was jubilant and happy with such a\nrelief from Allah, subhanahu wa ta'ala. Not only that, as a human being, the Prophet,\npeace and blessings be upon him, was frequently bombarded by his beloved wives. There were nine of them, and they all demanded\nmore money. Not to the extent that they wanted to buy\nVersace or whatever, they just wanted a normal life. And we know the hardship the Prophet, peace\nand blessings be upon him, and his family went through when mother Aisha said that we\nwould pass two months, two months would pass upon us without lighting any fire in the house\nor cooking. And what did you feed upon? She says water and dates for two months. You can imagine the hardship, especially for\nwomen who came from rich families, like those whom the Prophet had married to, peace and\nblessings be upon him. So, when they came and complained, the Prophet,\npeace and blessings be upon him, was angered by their consistency in demanding and demanding. And so he took a pledge not to come close\nto them for a whole month, and he took a small room in the Masjid and kept himself in seclusion\nfrom all of his wives. And everybody was thinking that he's going\nto divorce them. After this month was over, he went, peace\nand blessings be upon him, as Allah has revealed to him and gave his wives the choice. And among them was Aisha. So Allah says, O Prophet of Allah, say to\nyour wives, if you want this worldly life and its adornment, come. I will provide for you and set you free. I will divorce you. If you want Allah and his Messenger and the\nHereafter, then know that Allah has prepared for those who do good among you a great, huge\nreward. So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon\nhim, said to her, listen Aisha, I'd like to mention something to you, but don't give me\nan answer before consulting your parents. And he recited the ayah. So he gave her the choice. And she said to him, why would I consult my\nparents? I want Allah and the Prophet, peace and blessings\nbe upon him, and the Hereafter. So the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon\nhim, was so happy with that, it could show on his face, because this is what he wanted. He loved his wives, but this is his mission\nin life. This is his lifestyle. This is how Allah made him and he cannot rest\nwith the adornment of life coming to him like everyone else. Among the things that made him happy, peace\nand blessings be upon him, were confirmation of things about the future, prophecies that\nhe told his companions. Of course, all of his companions believed\nhim, undoubtedly. But sometimes it would be nice, it would feel\nnice, if you get a confirmation that would reiterate what you had told them earlier. And this happened when Tamim al-Dari, may\nAllah be pleased with him, came and he told the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him,\nabout his encounter of the Antichrist, al-Masih al-Dajjal, on an island. And some of the prophecies that he gave, and\nit coincided exactly with what the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, had told\nthem about earlier. And it fit like a glove. So the Prophet gathered all the Muslims, all\nthe companions in the Masjid, and he told them, Tamim was a Christian, and he encountered\nfew things while on a sea journey, that coincide with what I told you earlier. And he told them exactly in the very long\nHadith, how Tamim met al-Dajjal, and how the Dajjal explained to them about the lake of\nTabariyya, about this, about that, how many days he's going to spend on earth. Then the Prophet said, alaihis salam, had\nI not told you about this before? And they said, yes, oh Prophet of Allah, you\ntold us exactly these things before the story of Tamim. So the Prophet, salallahu alaihi wa sallam,\nwas happy that this Hadith of Tamim coincided with whatever he used to tell them about Mecca\nand Medina and the Antichrist. The Prophet, salallahu alaihi wa sallam, also\nwas happy whenever something good happened to any of his companions. Ka'b ibn Malik, for example, one of the three\npoets of the Prophet, alaihis salatu was salam, when he did not catch up with the expedition\nwith the Prophet, alaihis salam, to Tabuk on the ninth year of Hijrah, and the Prophet\ncame back, the hypocrites came to give their apologies, oh we could not come and catch\nup with you because this, because of that, and the Prophet would accept their apologies. Ka'b ibn Malik and two other men from the\ncompanions said, oh Prophet of Allah, we will not lie, we had no excuse. So the Prophet ordered the companions not\nto speak to them. For 50 days they were boycotted by the whole\nof Medina, nobody would communicate with them or say salam or talk with them, until Allah\nrevealed their, his acceptance of their repentance. So when this happened, the Prophet salallahu\nalaihi wasalam called Ka'b and Ka'b came and the Prophet's face was lit with joy and happiness\nand he says, have the glad tidings, oh Ka'b, with the best day since your mother gave birth\nto you, today when Allah has repented upon you. And he said, is this from you or from Allah? He said, this is from Allah. The Prophet was happy for Ka'b. And the Prophet alaihi salatu wasalam would\nalso become happy whenever he was supported by his companions at times of difficulty. Whenever he heard beautiful words like, when\nal-Muqdad ibn al-Aswad, may Allah be pleased with him, was with the Prophet alaihi salatu\nwasalam and they were about to encounter the enemy forces and the Prophet salallahu alaihi\nwasalam was afraid that he would not have the support of the people of Medina because\nhe did not give them the pledge of allegiance to accompany him outside of Medina, outskirts,\nbut rather to defend him while being within the limits of Medina. So when he had to go out and fight, he was\nhesitant, he was afraid, maybe they won't back me up. So al-Muqdad ibn al-Aswad, may Allah be pleased\nwith him, said to him, oh Prophet of Allah, we will not say to you like the Jews said\nto Moses, peace be upon him, go, you and your Lord and fight. We are sitting here, we're not coming with\nyou. Rather, we will fight to your right, to your\nleft, from in front of you and from behind you. Meaning that we will be with you around the\nclock. Don't be afraid. So the Prophet salallahu alaihi wasalam's\nface lit and he was pleased with that. The Prophet alaihi salatu wasalam, and I will\nconclude with this, was also happy whenever there was a cause to be happy, whenever the\nMuslims benefited. So whenever the Prophet heard some news that\nwas positive, that was helpful for the Muslims and for Islam, he would prostrate in happiness\nand showing his gratitude to Allah. And this happens only in something that does\nnot reoccur. Unlike what many ignorant among the Muslims\ndo nowadays. After fajr prayer, all of a sudden after dhikr,\nthey just go and prostrate. Akhi, what are you doing? Come. He said, I'm prostrating to Allah azza wa\njal, showing my gratitude. And I said, but this is not permissible. He said, subhanAllah, the Prophet used to\noffer this sujud as shukr. And I said, yes, but old scholars say that\nhe used to do this when something that does not reoccur happens, such as the conquest\nof a country that was in war against Islam and the Muslims, or the saving of a Muslim\nprisoner and the release, or something that happens once every blue moon. Because if we were to be grateful to Allah\nand show our gratitude with this sujud for his blessings and favors, we would not stop\nprostrating. He gave us the sight, he gave us the hearing,\nhe gave us the health, he gave us the wealth, he gave us the shelter, so many things. So we will keep on prostrating till the day\nof judgment. This is not the way of the Prophet, alayhis\nsalatu wasalam. So what you're doing is an innovation. Don't do this. When you receive your paycheck at the end\nof the month, don't prostrate for gratitude because this is coming every month. But if your father goes into ICU and he undergoes\na surgery, a major surgery, a life-threatening surgery, and he makes it, yes, you can make\nthis sujud because this is once every blue moon. And the Prophet, alayhis salatu wasalam, would\nalso be happy and show his jubilation when the Muslims come and give for charity. As in the case when few nomads came into the\nmasjid with torn clothes and signs of poverty over them, and the Prophet was angered by\nthat. And you can see it in his face. So he started encouraging the Muslims on the\npulpit to give and shelter themselves from hellfire, even by half a date. And he recited the verses that would encourage\nthis. Nobody moved. Everybody was sitting until one man came with\na big bag of food and clothes that barely he could carry. And he placed it in front of the Prophet,\nalayhis salatu wasalam, as charity. The moment the companions saw this, they immediately\nran to their homes and brought all what they can until they made a big pile of food and\nclothes and things that they would benefit from. Then the face of the Prophet, alayhis salatu\nwasalam, lit. And he was pleased by their reaction to his\ncall to help those in need. This is how we should react. This is when we should be happy. Not for worldly things, not for seeing sins. When we hear of people coming to Islam, even\nif they were enemies of Islam, we're happy. When we see Muslims benefiting from charity,\nwe're happy. When we see glad tidings for Islam and the\nMuslims, we become happy like the Prophet, alayhis salatu wasalam."
