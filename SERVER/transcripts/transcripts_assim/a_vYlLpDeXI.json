  "transcript": "FIA says there's a Masjid in my Colony we recently came to know that many years back the Masjid was made on a graveyard is it permissible to offer Salat in this Masjid first of all we have to understand that it is totally prohibited to pray in a Masjid that is built over a grave let alone a whole Cemetery this Masjid has to be demolished because it was unlawfully built now this is not a generic answer rather we have to go into details if the graveyard before building the Masjid the workers took all the remains in these Graves and now there are no human remains in the land and then they built the Masjid on top of it that was a grave mistake but praying in the Masjid is permissible why because there are no human remains underneath it so one way of looking at it if the graveyard was there for thousands of years so we can guarantee that by experience there are no remains none whatsoever it's all gone building a graveyard on top of it if it was done already building a Masjid on top of it if it's done already this praying in there is is permissible or when the graves and the remains have been taken away from it unless this area this land was dedicated by the owner to be a cemetery for life and this is called wak endowment if I dedicated the land to be a cemetery or a graveyard no one has the right to sell it it cannot be inherited and it cannot be shifted to something else because it's mine and I made it a w like when I make an endowment of a Masjid nobody can come and demolish this Masjid and say we need it for this or for that so if this is the case no human remains are there in these Graves of in this Cemetery praying in this Masjid is permissible but if the graves were not dug out and the remains are still there then it is totally prohibited to pray in that place"
