  "title": "Is it permissible to label people as Kafir? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "see we cannot and this is a very important issue we cannot say to everything that we see that this is kufur and implemented on individuals there is general kufur whoever prostrates to an idol is a kafir there's no problem in that but to see tom or ahmed or john prostrating to an idol and condemn them as kufr we have to be a bit patient and taking it slow and verify what they are doing maybe they would say that we were not prostrating we dropped our sunglasses and we're looking at it and you thought that we were prostrating maybe they think that this is not an idol and they're praying to the direction of mecca and there are so many reasons so there are conditions to be fulfilled there are obstacles to make sure that they do not exist before we give the label of takfir so people who play such games are definitely sinful if they disbelieve in such idols or in such powers that they're being given but they just played for the fun of it it's a major sin but if they believe that this idol does give life after death or does give benefits or does do things other than allah azzawajal this is shirk but nobody does this so we have to be a bit careful before jumping to conclusions and allah knows best"
