  "transcript": "uh kashmir and this is the last question i could not understand to tell you the truth he's asking about calling your son amin this is not logical why don't you call your son dormat or call him a chair or call him a camera because everybody would laugh at you likewise i mean it means o allah respond or allah answer in arabic so when i say i mean where are you people look at me and laugh is this a name so definitely you don't call him that the second name i did not hear ya seen also is not one of the prophet's names as many people think they think that paha and the asin are names of the prophet and this is not true it is like all of these are divided letters of the alphabet that some surahs were begun with and they don't have a meaning that we know of but we recite them because allah revealed them as such so is it permissible to call a child taha or yasin this is not recommended would i say it's prohibited no i would not say that it was pr it is prohibited but i wouldn't say that it is recommended uh and allah azza knows best you"
