  "transcript": "from bangladesh says we are in an exam and if someone was asked to write a an article or answer a question about same-sex marriage or about lgb qtfw or about haram things what should one do we have to look if this is something that is voluntary something that you can skip or change the subject you have to object and say i can't participate in this so if it's an essay and the teacher tells you to do this say with all due respect this goes against my religious beliefs i have to decline give me something else and if it is a test that your graduation is dependent upon and you will be harmed if you don't answer it i would say that you can answer it according to what makes you pass meaning that you write an article from their point of view and you write a disclaimer that this is according to the exam or to the subject or to the teacher but as a muslim we uh totally oppose this and this goes against our religion and our quran and our sunnah no matter who says what it's totally prohibited and you this disclaimer inshallah saves you on allah's best"
