  "transcript": "hadith number 313 313 page 213 chapter? [Host] Chapter: The believer \nis not a defamer [Sheikh] okay [Host]   a person with two faces cannot be a trustee, \nauthentic and sound. [Sheikh] So a person with two   faces, what do I mean by two faces and like \nputting a mask what is meant by two faces?   Two faces person is a hypocrite \nwho comes to the sinners   and he enjoys sins and he's having fun and \nhe's saying you're the people to hang out with,   then when he goes to the \nrighteous people he pretends   that he is righteous he holds the prayer beads, \nAstaghfirAllah..AstaghfirAllah..AstaghfirAllah.. So such a person is two-faced person and he also \nor this also can refer to a person who transmits   chit-chatting and gossips, so he goes to this \ngroup and talks to them and listens to what   they have to say then goes to the other group \nand says they said so and so and so about you   so they retaliate and say bad things about \nthem he goes again to them and say Wallah   they responded by saying this and this and \nthis he causes what? He causes 'enmity'   he causes friction he causes tension \nbetween the Muslims and this is why Allah azza was jal cannot, or \nthis person cannot be trusted.   How can you trust someone with two faces? Not only \nthat, the Prophet ﷺ said in the authentic hadith   whoever has two faces in this world on the day \nof judgment he will have two tongues of fire!   This is his punishment that his father his tongues \nwill be split into two and they will be of fire   torturing his interior his inside because of \nthe lies of the deceit that he used to do. Now   we have a question we have \na hadith in sahih al-bukhari   where the Prophet salallahu salaam \nwas sitting among his companions   when a man sought permission to enter \nso they told the Prophet ﷺ so and so is   seeking permission to enter shall we allow him \nin the prophet said, AuthuBillah in a sense, in translation roughly the worst of the tribe's \nson or the tribe's brother is so-and-so naming   him by name. Allow him in, so he came in and \nto the surprise of mother Aisha she said that   the Prophet ﷺ smiled in his face made him sit \nbeside him talk to him and then the man left   now you can see the difference the Prophet said \nthe worst of the people's son or tribe is this   man who's coming in but then he met him with a \ndifferent face she said oh prophet of Allah you   said so and so, and then you dealt with him \nin a different fashion? The Prophet ﷺ said the worst of people is the one \nwho people protect themselves   from him fearing his evil and foul language now \nthis hadith caused the scholars to look into it by no means it is two faces from the Prophet ﷺ. \nIs the Prophet can be that like that? No way!   No Muslim would think of this so how can \nwe interpret, how can we understand this? The answer is meeting people with kindness is \nsomething that you do of your own good   for example he took my money and I said keep it \nI forfeited my right, is there any haram in it? is it in haram? no he insulted me I said I \nforgive you is there any haram on me? No.   He is drinking intoxicants in my presence \nand I remain silent is there in haram on me?   Yes! So this is in Arabic called mudahana and \nmudara. Mudahana (definition) is to give in, in the islamic aspects. This is prohibited. \nAllah mentioned in surat al Qalam  [ وَدُّوا لَوْ تُدْهِنُ فَيُدْهِنُونَ ] \nthey wish that you compromise your religion   so that they can compromise, yani come to \na mutual ground this is not permissible,   in religion you have to draw the line. When it \ncomes to your own favors and your own rights and   your own possessions islam tells you give away so \nwhat the Prophet did alaihis salatu was this type   when the man sought permission to come   the companions were sitting around the \nprophet noticing every single thing he does   the prophet feared, because of his nature of \nmeeting people with a smile being generous too   being kind too he was afraid that the \ncompanions would think that this person   is a righteous pious scholarly like, so they \nwould think great of him and would be misled,   so he had to make it clear to everyone that \nthis man is one of the worst people on earth   but because it is my nature that i do not \nreject people or treat him treat them rudely,   i'm giving you this warning so when he came he \nbehaved as usual this is not two faces the two   faces is the one who causes corruption \nwho meets a righteous and pious person   and he talks with him nicely masha allah and he \ngoes through the others and say this guy is evil   he does this he does that just to cause problems \nbetween people so i hope this makes sense to you."
