  "title": "Jews & Christians don't dye their hair (Go against kafirs) Is dyeing hair mandatory assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign that do the opposite of what Jews and Christians do I've taken this to be a must afford on us so I was just confused about Hadith where he said that um dye your hair because they don't do this so I'm not sure what does this actually mean do we like make our hairs red blue or what does this actually mean first of all the instruction to go against the Jews and the uh Christians and the idol worshipers usually this is an order and in Islam in the order verb is an indication of obligation unless there is another evidence that reduces it to recommendation so an example the prophet says I used to forbid you from visiting graveyards now visit them because it reminds you of the hereafter the verb visit them is an order so by default any order is an obligation but the scholars of usul say well actually this is true unless there is evidence to reduce it into a recommendation what is the evidence the evidence is any order that comes after a restriction this restores it to the case it was before the restriction so before prohibiting us from visiting the graveyards what was the scenario everybody used to go to graveyards if they wanted this is not obligatory this is not prohibited it's permissible so after the prohibition was uplifted by the order it takes the same ruling before the prohibition which is permissibility another case Allah says in the Quran foreign you may hunt fostardo is an instruction a verb go and Hunt so does this mean when I clip my hair or shave my hair after a Haram I take my shotgun or my rifle and go and look for a game to shoot no because before which is a Prohibition for hunting what was the ruling hunting is permissible it's not neither obligatory nor recommended it's just permissible in this case it goes back to the same status now coming back to your question the prophet says go against the Jews and the Christian Idol worshipers grow your bead honor your beat let go of your beard any Hadith reducing this to recommendation nope then it's a must it's mandatory okay the prophet said go against the Jews and the Christians and die your white hair for they do not die okay this is an order any Hadith reducing it the answer is yes one the prophet himself had white hairs he did not die two the prophet himself said that do not pluck the white hairs you have on your face or in your hair because they will come as light on the day of judgment and many others so this Hadith show us that having a white beard or white hair is okay the recommendation is that you diet how to diet you can diet with any color that is suitable and that does not make you stand in a crowd nobody says okay what about Green or pink no this is a little bit any a new new wave type of colors the norm is to dye it with brown or with Hina as it is the recommendation in so many things in the uh Sunnah so is quite reddish um sort of or orange color so if you mix it with alcatum it becomes dark brown but the prohibition is from dyeing your hair with black and this is totally prohibited and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
