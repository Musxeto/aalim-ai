  "title": "Authentic Hadith: Reward for praying Tahajjud (10, 100, 1000 Ayat) is Fatiha included in this? Assim",
  "transcript": "as allah from canada says there is a hadith where the prophet isam talks about whoever prays night prayer reading a thousand verses so there is a hadith which says whoever prays ten verses he will be among he won't be among the heedless and whoever stands up for night prayer of a hundred ayah he will be among the kani teen those who prolonged their standing reciting the quran and those who offered one thousand ayas one thousand verses they will be registered as those who have wagons and lots of treasures and etc with them which is a very highly uh rewardable thing is this authentic definitely it is is the fatiha one of them the fat hey seven verses so can it be considered part of it i have no idea my own feeling my own inclination would be no because the fatih is a pillar so without it the prayer is invalid it these 10 100 and 1 000 verses of the quran should be something external than the pillars of the salat and allah knows you"
