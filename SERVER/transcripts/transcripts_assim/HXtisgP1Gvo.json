I'm your host Arkham Rashid in this episode we will be speaking about living between fear and hope of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala uh the hope of his mercy and the fear of his wrath so let's start off by welcoming our wonderful and welcome to the show uh she so you know let's start off with the very Basics the concept of Hope and the concept of fear so if you can give us a brief description of what the concept of Hope is and what the concept of fear is in Islam the concept of Hope and fear was mentioned in the Quran and it was mentioned in the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam and it is a characteristic that all Scholars and righteous people and Muslims have with them from birth till they die Allah asael praised The Messengers of Allah by saying they used to invoke Allah invoke us Allah says in fear and in hope so what do we mean by fear and hope Allah has his beautiful names and attributes so when we hear that he isur forgiving R merciful compassionate subhana tala when we hear these beautiful attributes and names of his we have hope that he will forgive our sins and he will give us his Jenna because Jenna of paradise is Allah's Mercy as stated in a Hadith and remind if I forget this Hadith I will mention it to you and when we hear about the beautiful names and attributes of Allah of being mighty mhm of being severe in torment of being AV Vengeance or if this is the right uh word of it I don't know uh the correct um adjective of it when we hear this we are fearful of Allah when we read about what Allah had done to the previous Nations before us some whom he had drowned like pharaohs and those with him some whom he had made the Earth swallow them some whom he Allah drained stones and rocks over them Etc we're fearful of him so we are afraid of entering hell which is Allah's anger and wrath in the Hadith Paradise complain to Allah asael and said oh Allah why only the weak and the poor enter me while all the strong and Tyrant Enter Hell so Allah and this is theith of the Prophet Allah the prophet is telling us what had happened so Allah says to Jenna to Paradise you are my Mercy that I bestow upon those whom I love and Allah tells hell that you are my wrath and My Punishment so when we hear this and we see our own shortcomings we have to have this balance of hoping and of fearing because if you make an imbalance if you make a mistake you have a problem problem imagine if you only worship Allah by hoping for the best this means that if you don't pray F hope for the best Allah will forgive Allah will forgive if I didn't pray for a couple of years Allah will forgive if I'm indulge in sins no problem keep up the good the good work and keep wishing and hoping in Allah's Mercy but at the other side of the scale if you don't have any hope and you're always fearful of Allah this would make you fall into despair no matter what I do Allah is going to put me in hell no matter how many times I pray or what good deeds I do Allah would not accept anything from me because I'm afraid that Allah is so magnificent and great to the extent that all what I do is nothing to him and I'm doomed and this would cause a person to uh go uh uh Rogue as they say yes uh so you know in the Quran and in thei of the Prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam it's mentioned that Allah subhana wa tala is the most merciful it's he's the most forgiven he's all forgiven he forgives everything that he wants to he Allah subhana wa tala can forgive your sins without anything happening to his Mercy his Mercy will not decrease at all if he forgives all of everybody's sins uh so with this concept being said and and then there's a Hadith speaking about the punishment of Allah subhana wa tala don't you think this is a contradiction or how do we understand this no there is no contradiction none whatsoever see Allah is both merciful to those who deserve his mercy and severe in torment and punishment to those who deserve his wrath and this is why a True Believer has to have this balance and through going through the Quran and the Sunnah you learn more and more about Allah the almighty and this is why those who have drifted and deviated from the straight path had a problem with this so on one hand we have and these are the who went into extreme fear of Allah so they thought to the extent that anyone who makes a major sin he's a cfir and those on the other side of the equation are the who are so hopeful in Allah's forgiveness and mercy that you they said you can do the whole nine yards and Allah would not uh burden you or uh punish you for what you do are the middle path and that is why the scholars say that the conviction of a Believer is like a bird where the love of Allah is the head of the bird and the fear and the hope are the wings of the bird so if you don't have love in your heart to your lord to your creator to your provider to your sustainer then it's like chopping the head off the bird would we have a living creature no the bird would be dead and if you have immense love to Allah but an imbalance in one of the wings so if you are hopeful more than you are fearful then the flying of the bird would be tilted it wouldn't be correct and if you don't have one of the Wings the bird would definitely fall won't won't be able to fly so you have to have this balance so that you can sustain your conviction and belief so it's uh just a recap of what you've said so far is that uh obviously there's fear fear on one side or we can say One Wing of the bird and then there's Hope on the other side and our path is the middle path like you've explained over many episodes that we always take the middle path Sheik I want to continue this conversation and maybe even get into into how we can create this balance because you know the concept is one thing then trying to create this balance and keeping a balance you know we're going to get into this inshallah but before that we're going to go for a short break so soon as we come back inshallah we will start speaking about how we can create a balance between fear and hope so stay tuned welcome back to contemporary Islamic Concepts on Huda TV now before we went for that short break we were discussing the balance that we need to create between hope and fear and the Sheikh gave a wonderful example saying that hope and fear are two wings of a bird and we need to be balanced so that the bird can fly uh now we said that theoretically speaking the the the balance between hope and fear you know it's all there we understand it but how can we actually apply this how can a person start creating a balance sometimes he feels that he's scared of the punishment of Allah subhana T and if you fall into this that you're always constantly scared of the punishment of Allah subhah wa taala you start thinking and doing of everybody this is K that is K and on the other side you know if you have too much hope you start leaving your prayers you stop you know uh worrying about fasting Allah subhana wa tala will forgive me so how can we start creating this balance you can create the balance only with knowledge Allah stated in the Quran verily that only the knowledgeable the scholars fear Allah among his servants so what kind of knowledge are we talking about is it the phds and the master's degrees you have or is it the amount of hours you spent learning and writing and and and uh doing these things no the knowledge that leads you to fear Allah is what makes you a scholar so if a person is a Layman or illiterate doesn't know how to write his name yet he fulfills the criteria of feeding Allah Asel by doing what is needed to be done and by avoiding what is Haram then this person is a scholar while on the other hand if you have a PhD holder who does not abide by Islam and he just has a highly decorated person but he is not practicing this guy is an ignorant because once you want to pose a question who is the most ignorant person of Allah what would the answer be the one who doesn't believe in Allah give me a name uh Shan yes though Shan was the given a status close to the angels yeah he was there he was ordered to prostrate to Allah to to Adam and he disobeyed so his knowledge did not qualify him to be a scholar or someone who fears Allah he's an ignor ignorant person so in order to strike the balance you have to have knowledge knowledge of what Allah Asel has given to those who obey him and knowledge of what Allah has prepared for those who disobey him now sometimes have as you've correctly mentioned we get a little bit imbalance a little bit of imbalance is good see you cannot maintain the same balance throughout there has to be a little edge of one over the other and this is why Scholars say during our lifetime when we're healthy when we like we are now living and uh enjoying ourselves we have to have the fear a little bit more than the hope why is that because they say fear prevents you from falling into sin and it prevents you from not doing good things not doing your obligations towards Allah but when it comes to the time of your deathbed so if you're dying you should have your hopes greater than your fears because now you are about to meet Allah and the prophet said that Allah told us that I'm at where my servant thinks of me which means that if you think well of Allah Asel if you think positive of Allah then Allah would treat you in a positive fashion if not then Allah will treat you as you think of Himel now okay let's let me give you an example and see your thoughts on this uh now this balance that I'm trying to create I personally you know pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala and at the same time you know I enjoy my life and then I'm when I'm enjoying my life I try to remember Allah subhana wa tala's punishment and then when it comes to prayers I try to remember that Allah subhana wa will have mercy but what about you know in in order for me to create this balance what about if I'm praying and stuff and sometimes they're like okay I can leave a prayer or two Allah subhana T is all forgiving to create this balance are you allowed to leave major Islamic Concepts to create this balance or this is in terms of even after performing all of your far and everything that is asked of you that's when you establish the balance you will not be able to establish the balance until you are actually balanced see the notion the concept of I can skip a prayer or two this means that there is an imbalance and the reason of this imbalance because of the overkill in hoping and wishing when you don't actually know and realize your shortcomings for example someone who is 24/7 intoxicated doesn't pray and he says inshallah Allah loves me what kind of hope is this this is a false hope because your track record proves that Allah doesn't love you otherwise you would have not have done these heinous acts and if you sometimes think otherwise go back to the Quran and Sunnah so many times we are swinging between hope and fear so the minute the scale is a little bit for hope the fear comes in and kicks in says wait watch out so sometimes I go and make and I finish my om and while driving back I know that omra erases all of my sin sins so I'm happy say okay why not listen to a song Some Music I've done my fear part now let me I've have I have a clean record so I'm entitled you know I have credit like you know when you top your mobile now I've just topped my record uh uh book of Good Deeds so I can afford this this is an imbalance and the reason of this imbalance is that because you are dealing with Allah with good deeds and bad Deeds as if you're exchanging currency and this is a huge mistake the prophet told usam that a woman was admitted to Hell Fire why did she kill someone did she Rob did she commit an act of kufur the pro the prophet tells usam that she withheld a kitten a cat she kept it in captivity in her house without feeding it or giving it water till it died I will be admitted to hell because I did this to a kitten this is in theah the prophet tells us yes then you have to fear Allah if this is what will happen to someone who starved a cat to death what will happen to those who kill innocent people or bomb others who are innocent and and by standards or spread terrorism all over the place on the account that this is Islam this definitely they will Enter Hell before everyone else so once you have the knowledge in this case you can balance see the balance comes when while you are offering Good Deeds so you're hopeful that Allah will accept them the balance comes when you commit a sin and you're fearful that Allah would not forgive you the balance comes when you repent and ask Allah for forgiveness here it is portrayed beautifully because I made the sin yesterday today I have repented 10 years from now someone asks me did Allah accept your repentance what would I say Allah knows I don't know how how can you say such a thing it's been 10 years you've sought repentance and Allah's forgiveness and till now you're not sure yes this is the balance that's the balance I repented I'm hopeful that Allah will forgive me but at the same time I'm not claiming or trying to convince myself that I'm forgiven so that I would not go into false hopes so who would you say could be described as those who fear Allah subhah wa taala these are the people that fear Allah subhana tal who could be described as this they say the scholars translates to a person who's afraid of Allah is not someone who uh uh sobs or uh weeps and then dries his eyes of the tears a person who fears Allah is the one who abandons what Allah has prohibited so many times we see muslims praying Twi you know night prayer in Ramadan in congregation and they cry and they show fear of Allah which Allah will reward them for that definitely and the minut the prayer is over and they go out they light the cigarette listen to music and start backbiting people what is this contradiction this shows that you have an imbalance or you are failing to prioritize your deeds and actions according to what Allah loves so uh what I can extract from uh what you've described your description there is that hope in Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is when you hope that Allah subhana T will forgive your sins that you've already committed and accept your good deeds that you are doing for the sake of Allah and not the other way around not that you do bad Deeds with the intention that Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala will forgive you is this correct this is correct because when you have this idea then you're thinking negatively of Allah how to have good thoughts and positive thoughts of Allah by believing and and having the conviction that if I do well Allah would reward me and if I do bad Allah would punish me not the other way around and this is why we have to work hard on understanding The Hope and the fear alassan albash was approached by his companions and said that we sit with people that they terrify us when they remind us of Allah they intimidate us they throw fear and ohe in our hearts from Allah he said by Allah it's best for you to sit with people that would scare you until you reach a safe place rather than sit with people who would calm you down until you reach some place where you are terrified with or by uh she alhamdulillah we've you know came to the end of our episode and uh I want
