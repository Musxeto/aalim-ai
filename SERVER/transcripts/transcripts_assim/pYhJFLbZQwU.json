  "transcript": "and then another question that we also would have uh is the fact so which matters of ibadah have been legislated from our believers is um coming them during this time what will allah give us in terms of reward if in this time okay okay when we look at what we should do in these last 10 nights alhamdulillah that allah did not limit us to a specific ribada otherwise as humans we may get bored so imagine if we i can only recite the quran a lot of us would find this difficult and complain so i can't recite the quran i get bored i get sleepy i get this i get that subhanallah allah azzawajal with his grace did not limit us to reciting the quran the vast majority of the prophets time islam used to be spent in prayer and in prayer you do a lot of reciting the quran but you also do a lot of rakuwa which you do a lot of zikr in it and a lot of sujud which you do a lot of vikar and dua so it's a combination of prayer which is the highlight of the nights of reciting the quran which is the month that the quran was revealed in in zikr in dua said in the hadith that you all know the o prophet of allah if i were to detect laylatul qatar what should i say so the prophet said also to him and in some narratives the one who pardons and you love those who pardon others so pardon me very few words very profound meaning so this is time for dua and i am shocked for of those who have debts of those who have calamities of those whose family or relatives are sick and they go on knocking on people's doors seeking help when it is the time where allah azzawajal says who's asking so i should give who's supplicating so i should answer who's seeking forgiveness so i should pardon allah is calling you to him allah extends his hand in the evening so that those who had sinned in the morning would repent and he opens his hand in the morning so that those who sinned in the evening would repent this is the time for you to knock on allah's doors so you can alternate between these good rivals of prayers of reciting the quran of making vicar and of making dua"
