  "transcript": "part of being just and fair with your wife is to fulfill the Covenant that you took when you got married to her is to overlook her shortcomings her flaws her mistakes and not to audit every single mistake she does because life cannot go on like this this is a ccept well known in Islam it's called in Arabic and it is to overlook the shortcomings this is strongly cemented and and founded well founded in Islam it's found in the Quran it's found in the Sunnah it's found in the books of everywhere you go and the prophet said this clearly he says no believe man should hate a believing woman if he hates one of her characteristics he will be pleased with another seriously speaking we have a problem as individuals I've seen like 70% 80% of men and women cannot let things slip why did you do this why did you do that I have a friend who has a driver back home in Saudi and whenever he asks him to do something he Court Marshals him I told you to bring Manish why did you bring this why did you bring that and he questions every single thing he does and he shouts and his blood pressure goes to the roof and I say why do you do this said he has to learn I said Subhan Allah this is an individual problem I said what is his job description if he could have communicated with you and understood what you said and executed you ex not you excuse my work edit this please huh terrorist uh executed what you told him to do he should have been an assistant or a secretary not a driver imagine Islam and the beauty of Islam a man came to the prophet and he said oh prophet of Allah the servant of mine and when the Hadith said says the servant it is referring to a slave and slavery is something that is well established in Islam this is not the time but I can elaborate on it but no sugar coating it so oh slavery we have slavery it's in the Quran but there is no religion it's it's in every religion it's in every nation before us and after us but there is no religion on Earth that tells you if you do this free a slave if you do that free a slave if you uh swear and and make a you break your your oath free a slave if you so many things ordering you to free all the slaves you have but a man came to the prophet he said oh prophet of Allah the servant of mine how many times should I forgive him they make mistakes the prophet did not respond to him so the man repeated the question oh prophet of Allah the servant of Mine He's my slave I can sell him and buy a new one with sunroof and headlights 2024 Edition what how many times should I forgive him a day the prophet said 70 times a day a servant making mistakes times a day and you forgive him I ask you by Allah our own spouses wives and and husbands our own children our own colleagues our own subordinates at work how many times do we forgive them Subhan Allah how many times do you would you like others to forgive your shortcomings and mistakes a gazillion times a day so why don't you reciprocate and do the same because your Iman is this much if ever existing so this is how you should deal with your wife"
