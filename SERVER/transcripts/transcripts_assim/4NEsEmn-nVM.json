  "transcript": "her dilemma is that she has approximately 50 days of missed fasting and now she she is suckling her child and what to do the majority of Scholars say that no matter how many days she had missed once the excuse once the reason behind her not being able to fast is lifted is gone then she has to make up and I have a lot of sisters asking that they have not fasted for approximately 10 Ramadan so you're talking about 300 days the reason either pregnant or uh breastfeeding or in her uh postnatal bleeding so there is no problem in that the scholars differed whether she is obliged to feed a poor person for every day miss or not while making up for that M days and the most authentic opinion that there is no feeding at all all what she has to do is simply make up for the these M days according to her ability so for example if inshallah in 3 four years she's not pregnant and she's not feeding uh uh breastfeeding in this case she can fast every Mondays and Thursdays or every uh white days the 13th 14th and 15th of every month and this is approximately 11 days 10 days a month so she can easily finish this in two three or four years and Allah knows best uh s from Saudi"
