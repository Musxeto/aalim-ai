  "transcript": "[Music] bioenergy is something that is new i have not read into it but i'm speaking logically it depends on the people to my knowledge bio energy means that i have control over the energy in your body and i can divert the flow of energy so that it goes to the injured or the uh or the old the organ that is suffering pain so i can just put my hand over this place and then or on top of it and then imagine that the pain is in here and then just think of it and have all the energy coming into it and masha'allah boom you're you are cured this is hocus pocus stuff come on we don't have anything in the quran we don't have anything in the sunnah it is all here in the mind and i heard the story so many times the doctors say that whenever we have a patient who constantly comes to us complaining of suffering different illnesses and we made thorough checks upon him and he is you know as as strong as a horse there's nothing wrong in him and we are just fed up he's been coming for the past five years and there's nothing wrong with him until one doctor smart doctor came and said well subhanallah how couldn't they put sports in your x-rays this is extremely dangerous well alhamdulillah we can manage to solve this problem inshallah we're not too late take these pills but remember you have to take them exactly at ten past five every single morning ten minutes at five a.m and if you don't i don't bear any responsibility these those they are you know compiled from uh the mountains the of himalaya and from the dungeons of uh torah and whatever it will fix it and the guy comes after one week he says masha allah it's working and i say okay yeah you have to keep on checking every single month don't come every day once a month inshallah and you will be uh as good as new and once he's gone the doctor says did you know what i gave him said no what he said a tablet of salt and uh some minerals so what happened to the man it's all in the mind actually is why i believe that this bio energy is a a bunch of crap with all respect to those who are practicing it i believe in the quran i believe in the sunnah and i don't believe in anything else except what the scientists what the physicians with the doctors with the surgeons have experimented and put on the table saying that these are the facts and this is all legit otherwise i would consider it to be nonsense"
