  "title": "Is it permissible to sell Cork openers? - #assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign let's say you have a store where you sell Cutlery items like tools and kitchen tools and and the likes such as a corkscrew or as they call it a wine opener would it be permissible to sell something like that when you know like 99 chances they're using it for wine bottles because no no such other drinks use corks anymore I don't see anything wrong in selling uh cork openers because there are other things and other bottles that use corks if not in the U.S in other countries where they use it with um olive oil and and the likes so the device itself is halal what you use it for is what makes what you use it for Haram so if a person refrains from selling knives and his justification is that there might come a thug and use this knife to kill people this is not a justifiable reason because you can say the same about water selling bottles of water to people that they may use to make ice cubes to drink with their scotch so duh no you can't go so far overboard because the device itself can be used in so many things and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
