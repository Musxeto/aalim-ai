  "title": "Is nutmeg impure (traces in pots & plates) Is Alcohol najis (wine, marijuna etc) #assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I searched in Arabic in English maybe for hours I send a question to Islam create so on I didn't find the answer I don't know I don't know who to ask after you so my mom cooks could not make it's like one teaspoon per week or so and I removed the nutmeg so she did it in the past but what remains is these very small trays it's unstable you can't notice them on the plates like 0.1 grams or so and I had one wine drop in food is too much so if we say nutmeg is not nauseous and it's cooked in a pot and then the pot is wiped with a towel if it was an edges it would save images do we have to remove every single phrase like I would do with Michelle so it's like this unseeable amount of excuse I hope I hope I hope it's clear it is clear those who say that nutmeg is prohibited due to being an intoxicant they do not say that it is nudges the issue of whether wine is nudges or not is an issue of dispute and great Scholars of Islam stated that it is not just physically because there is no Aya or Hadith that states that it is not just physically the Ayah that stated that it is rich also with it in the Ayah was mentioning gambling and drawing the lots and the idols and these are not physically nudges so it has to be spiritually nudges sentimentally nudges but not physically and among this the evidence is that some Scholars have used was the Hadith of anas when the prohibition of wine was revealed in the Quran all the companions poured it on the streets of Medina and the prophet did not tell them to avoid walking on the streets or to cleanse their shoes before praying because of its impurity or najasa therefore coming back to nutmeg even the scholars who say that it is intoxicant they say that hashish or a cannabis whether marijuana or hash or whatever or pot they say that physically it's not nudges if I touch it I don't have to go and wash my hands before prayer because there is no impurity in it physically therefore what you have done is sufficient and Allah Knows Best"
