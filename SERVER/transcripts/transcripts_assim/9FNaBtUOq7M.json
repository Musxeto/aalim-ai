  "transcript": "he says how can we stop bad habits and you stop by bad habits by not doing them and specifically how can we stop looking at women not lowering our gaze first of all by learning the beautiful names of allah this gives you background to who allah is and it helps you strongly in fighting such bad habits secondly cut all means that facilitate it so most likely you're not sitting on a cafe in amsterdam drinking cappuccino and watching the uh people walking by because it's expensive to pay three or four euros for not three foot five or eight or maybe 10 euros for a cappuccino what is this go and migrate to a muslim country it's much cheaper you are most likely involved in watching haram stuff on your mobile phone on your pda on your ipad on your tv screens so you have to cut these means throw your smartphone and get an old nokia with no internet and try to eliminate anything haram in your home make it public so that everybody can share it with you if you were to be involved in seeing something haram this would make you more bashful and shy from watching it and so on don't remix try your level best to lower your gaze don't socialize with the opposite gender and try to get married as soon as possible you"
