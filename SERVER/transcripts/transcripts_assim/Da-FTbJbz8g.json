  "transcript": "says that it's common that whoever is buried away from his hometown that he would get a bigger place in Jenna than a person who is buried in his hometown does this have any authenticity and the answer is no this is totally baseless it is uh uh part of the Sunnah that a person is buried wherever he dies so if a person from Saudi Arabia dies in India the Sunnah is for him to be buried in India if he dies in the Philippines if he dies in the US he's to be buried there what people are doing nowadays transporting the body of the deceased after his death to his uh uh country and what surrounds this journey hardship and the decay of the body and so many uh uh trouble uh uh resulting out of that this is totally unlike the Sunnah and it shouldn't be like this whatever whatever you die let them bury you there's no point trans porting someone to his birthplace not only that some people even make in their will that if I die in jida you have to bury me in mecah or bury me in Medina and all of this is not part of the Sunnah and Allah knows uh best I'm done"
