  "transcript": "in question that if a person misses congregational prayer is it best to pray home or in the Masjid no the best is to pray in the masjid as long as there is a possibility of you finding someone to pray with you beside that if you're missing the prayer was for a legitimate reason and you still go to the message to pray even if you pray alone Allah would give you the reward of praying in congregation"
