  "title": "The Prophet's ‎ﷺ  kindness to Hudhayfah assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "We can solve things. Nobody is perfect. Similarly, the Prophet said to his companion Hudhaifah ibn al-Yaman, when he sent him to bring him the knowledge of the army forces besieging Medina in the Battle of the Trench. So it was freezing cold, but the Prophet made dua for him and he felt like he was in a sauna all the way there and all the way back. And he told the Prophet about the information he needed, alayhis salam, then the cold came back to him. So the Prophet gave him his cloak to warm up with and he, because he was tired, went to sleep. In the morning, the Prophet woke him up and said, Qum ya Nouman. Again, Nouman, the sleepy one. So the Prophet is not saying, calling him by name, is nicknaming him to show his kindness, sallallahu alayhi"
