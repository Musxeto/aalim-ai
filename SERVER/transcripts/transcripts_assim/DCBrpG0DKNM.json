  "transcript": "Mu'izz from Saudi. Mu'izz. Hi Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum. Salam Wa Rahmatullah. Yes Sheikh, so my question is I have a couple of socks which are a bit worn out so it's got holes in it and if I've got my Wudu in it and I wear my shoes and I'm outside and specifically you know I'm just outside where I have to pray, would my Wudu still be valid in those socks? I mean. I think Mu'izz you mean would my Wudu be valid if I wipe on such socks, correct? Yes, yes. Okay, the answer is it's an issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion as per Ibn Taymiyyah and others that the companions, may Allah be pleased with them, did not have skitchers socks that were fine and good and strong and without any holes. They had rags wrapped around their feet and they travelled in the deserts and over rocky mountains and the likes which made holes in their socks yet this did not prevent them from wiping over it. So as long as it holds the title or the description of a sock and it sticks by itself, it doesn't fall off, then you can wipe over it without any problem, insha'Allah."
