  "title": "Turkish tradition of paying Mahr only after divorce! When to pay Mahr? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um in Turkey there is a tradition of paying only after separation so they don't pay it until there's divorce so the brother wants to know if it is in accordance with Islam and if there's a possibility to pay a part immediately and another part at a later time or generally change the timing of payment okay first of all a dowy or a Mahar is a woman's right when a man marries her whether this is given before the consumation of the marriage or during the marriage contract or at a later time even after the consumation of marriage it's all permissible it's a debt upon the man once the marriage contract takes place now some people would agree and write in the marriage contract that my Mahar is divided into two installments one instant and immediate here is a $1 bill as a Mahar and the last portion of it if there were a divorce then I will pay the rest which is $1,000 and the woman agrees and they sign and that's it now this $1,000 is a debt upon the man he has to pay it ASAP now if he doesn't and the woman is fine with that this debt the woman has to give zakat each and every year because it's her money and she lent it to someone who's capable of paying it so she has to give zakat for it some people exaggerate and say that yeah give us immediate effect $1 as the first installment the second installment is $100,000 to be paid if you were to divorce now this is used as a deterrent to stop you from divorcing and it never works because most men if they want to divorce they will just wait they will not see their wives they will not go to them they will not provide for them until she files for if she files for then she has to give up her dowy which she did not receive in the first place and the man goes free and this is not a smart thing to do now if the Mahar is given up front $1,000 he's $1,000 but the woman makes a condition in case you divorce me you have to pay me $100,000 or $110,000 and he agrees for that this is not Mahar this is let's say a late payment payment fee call it whatever you want a penalty but this is binding because both of them agreed to that so I hope this answers your question"
