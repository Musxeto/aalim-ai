  "title": "Islamic ruling on something happening by Luck, Chance or Coincidence.... #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I mean so my question Chef is that um I there's things there was things like today going on like happening like I was watching some video and there was a brother who said oh I was giving dawa to this person and it was by the Qatar of Allah that I was there and he said oh I don't believe in chance so by that I was getting these thoughts like I was thinking about what's what's the Islamic ruling on using the word chance like I was thinking like what's what's what does it mean to use the word chance when you say for example oh don't go to this Fitness gym because the chance is that you might be sinful so what's the ruling on this like I'm there's nothing there is nothing wrong uh from uh in using the word chance because it is similar to a possibility if you cross a busy highway like in uh in Germany for example where they don't have a speed limit in some of their their highways and if you cross it there is a big chance you're going to be run over by a car so there's a possibility if you mean a coincidence or luck even the the terminology luck was used in the Quran great Fortune great luck and a coincidence to to our understanding is something that was unplanned what a coincidence I met your brother yesterday by coincidence it was unplanned by both of us but no one of us would even think in their Wildest Dream that this is not part of Allah it is part of Allah and it was a coincidence as well so I hope this answers your question"
