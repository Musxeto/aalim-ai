  "transcript": "says what to do this Ramadan the messages are closed how do we pray taraweeh should we pray a tracker or 20 is taraweeh an tahajud the same or we should pray 200 after taraweeh MD Mohammad Asif if you ask me this question on Twitter I would have most likely ignored it or blocked you because you're entitled only to ask one question you ask mashallah six or seven which requires a whole lecture but let me start by saying this yesterday I was fortunate and blessed by Allah to give an hour plus lecture to our brothers in Chennai India and it was about what to do during Ramadan at times of lockdown let's on YouTube you can find in inshallah and I spoke there about the things you can do okay Ramadan is not taraweeh people highlight a number of things and they consider doing them during the month of Ramadan is the top thing to do and we can fool around the rest of the day which is wrong Ramadan is not only fasting it's not only giving your zakat it's not only offering taraweeh and then later on - had you that the last 10 nights of ramadan it's a combination of so many things it's a combination of dhikr of dois of charity of feeding the poor of being kind of being submissive to Allah Azza WA JAL of remembering that you are a servant and not a master and you fulfill your masters commands to you it's a package you taraweeh his one part of it which we are all saddened by the fact that we are deprived from praying it in congregation in the Masjid but this is one of Allah tests in a series of tests to us so we have to pass the test inshallah pray home until the lockdown is uplifted with the grace of Allah and I pray to Allah that it is done soon so that we can go back to our messages you can pray individually but it is best to pray with your family members it strengthens the bond you can recite the sewers you know by heart and if you wish you can have the Quran held in your hand and you read from it the Prophet used to pray eleven Rekha's and sometimes thirteen records for night prayer you can pray that or if you feel that increasing the number of Records and shortening the duration of prayer is more convenient for you rather than praying long records and restricting the number to 11 this is permissible how many raka is at most the sky's the limit it was not prescribed so praying at eleven thirteen twenty forty it's up to you and East are aware and two hundred the same no salary has only prayed during Ramadan in congregation if you're not praying it in congregation then this is regular night prayer if you praying it in the last third of the night this is the hatchet and it is best for you to postpone and delay your taraweeh and pray it at the time of the hatchet because this is more beloved to Allah but if is not convenient and you would want to pray it at the beginning of the night totally legit"
