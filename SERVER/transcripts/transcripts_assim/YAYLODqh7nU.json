  "transcript": "[Music] every muslim knows that all forms of worship require two conditions to be accepted by allah and these two conditions are sincerity and compliance allah the almighty says so whoever would hope for the meeting with his lord let him do righteous work and not associate in the worship of his lord anyone so when allah says let him do righteous work this refers to compliance to actually doing the work the forms of worship according to what the prophet saw has taught us how to do it and when allah azzawajal says and not associate in the worship of his lord anyone this refers to sincerity to what is known as and you do not intend anyone while doing this form of worship except the face of allah the all mighty azzawajal is cascaded a lot in the quran in the sunnah allah says the almighty he who created death and life to test you as to which of you is best in deed says the best indeed is that which is sincere and most correct so if your form of worship is sincere but it is not correct it's not according to sharia to the way of the prophet it won't be accepted and if it is in accordance to the way of the prophet sallallahu salaam but it is not for the sake of allah then it is not accepted either and this is why the prophet said alaihis wasallam allah does not accept any deed unless it is sincere for his sake and his face is sought afterward after it now sincerity is when all an individual's good deeds whether secret or public is intended for the sake of allah azzawajal like allah stated in the quran and they were not commanded except to worship allah being sincere to him in religion inclining to truth and the person who's most sincere is the one who doesn't care if people resent him if his love was extracted from their hearts providing that his own heart is pure for allah azzawajal a real sincere person is a person who does not want others to know about his good deeds even if they were as small as ants now if we go to hajj and umrah we find that this beautiful ritual which is a pillar of islam it's one of the five pillars of islam has ichlas has tawheed has sincerity from a to z and this house this structure found in mecca that we called al-qaba which we also name as the house of allah this was the first structure where people were commanded to worship allah azzawajal and it was built on pure sincerity for the sake of allah allah almighty says and mention o muhammad when we designate it for ibrahim peace be upon him the sight of the house saying do not associate anything with me and purify my house for those who perform tawaf going round the kaaba and those who stand in prayer and those who bow and prostrate to establish tawheed the prophet alaihis wasalam took great interest in purifying sincerity for this umm and for his followers he portrayed such sincerity in all of his actions and deeds in all of his words and teachings specifically in hajj anas willimanik may allah be pleased with him narrates that when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam performed his hajj it was on a saddle and some sort of cloth that was worn out and costs only for dirham and maybe it does not cost that much even and when the prophet allah is started his journey for hajj he said and proclaimed o allah this is a pilgrimage where i do not show off in it and seek no reputation out from it so the intention of this hajj is sincerity pure and simple it is for the sake of allah there's no boasting there's no showing off there's no taking selfies as many people do the accepted hajj is the one that fulfills the conditions where you do not show off where you do not seek a reputation that people name as in so many muslim countries people are known with this prefix before their names awesome ahmed what is this this is the type of showing off that the prophet sought refuge in allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam and in an accepted hajj does not have intimacy or disobedience or the likes it has no arguments and debates and it is performed with halal so the intention of hajj is to be made for the sake of allah and this is why allah commanded the muslims by saying and complete the hajj and umrah for allah the hajjan umrah cannot be for worldly matters cannot be for people it's only for the sake of allah the almighty and this is why a pilgrim always in the state of telbia while he's in his haram what is talbiya it is to proclaim allah bake translating to here i am oh allah here i am here i am you have no partner here i am verily all praise and blessings are yours and all sovereignty you have no partner here i am i'm proclaiming i'm responding to your call oh allah the almighty when you called us to come to hajj here i am the prophet said alaihis allah an accepted hajj brings no less reward than paradise and it can't be accepted until you intended for the sake of allah the salaf used to say so many writers and few are performing pilgrim pilgrimage so many of them this year a million maybe a million point five pilgrims will perform hajj and we pray to allah that he accepts his their hajj but how many of them are going with sincerity how many are them are fulfilling the conditions this is why when you look at pilgrimage as a pillar of islam once in a lifetime you will find that some forms of worship are physical like fasting like prayers and some forms of worship are financial like zakat in charity hajj is both physical and financial so you have to do this once in a lifetime so if you do it do it with utmost sincerity only seek allah's face by it and do your level not to brag and not to show off and not to boast about it don't fall into the same mistake that many muslims do one of satan's traps where they keep on taking selfies and they step by step publish on their instagram or snapchat or their social media facebook or whatever everything they do and now i'm going to take to raka tahiti masjid and now i'm going to drink zamzam water here we are in arafat what a beautiful sight here we're doing this we're doing that who are you addressing my friend some may say that this is a form of dawah it can be but not for everyone and only allah azzawajal only allah knows your intention so be careful from falling into the traps of shaytan make your deeds sincere for his sake and this is a one life journey one in a lifetime journey that you must try your level best to be accepted because if you succeed you will be one of the lucky ones whom allah erases all of their sins as if it is the day their mother bore them but if you failed you've lost time energy money and gained a lot of sins in the process i pray to allah azzawajal that he grants me and you a sincere hajj and that he accepts all of our deeds and makes them all for his sake alone [Music] i"
