  "transcript": "my question is regarding sahih al-bukhari and i am not a disbeliever to hadith but i want to know how can i be sure that the hadith books that we see today are still unchanged and hasn't been changed from the real text like the previous scripture were made and i know that allah said the quran he will guide it from corruption but the hadith that is not guided by himself generally it has to be changed and i know the manuscript that we follow are the egyptian manuscript of buhari so the question rises because i found that the bengali version of bukhari isn't identical in number of arabic version of buhari which i found in darus publications so i couldn't find some hadith on it my local hadith book so how can i check that the one i am following this is the original version of hadith so i don't know the name of the brother and i don't know if he if he can hear me or not but he's asking about how can we be certain that the hadith that had reached us are authentic well this is an issue that you have to refer to the experts when you have pain in your throat you don't go to a dentist you go to a specialist doctor when you have pains in your knees you don't go to a car mechanic you go to an orthopedic surgeon likewise when you have issues with hadith you don't go to oriolentis or to people who do not believe in islam you ask scholars of islam you said that allah has pledged to preserve the quran this is true but he did not pledge to preserve the sunnah this is not true when allah says when allah says that we have revealed the vikr and we shall preserve it this includes the sunnah as well as the quran and there are many evidences in the quran to prove that vikr means sunnah as well number one number two your bengali virgin if there are a hadith missing simply because the original bukhari is this big so there are a number of hadiths that are repeated in different chapters of the bukhari those who translated the bukhari translated the concise version of it where the repeated hadiths were deleted because what's the point in repeating the hadith of umar in the book of uh in the beginning of the book and in salat and then in zakat and then hajj in everywhere that requires niya we bring this what's the use of repeating it so they said we make it concise and they deleted it but hadith is there somewhere else so you may have a virgin where they deleted it in the beginning but kept it in the middle or at the end you can't know until you read the whole book searching for that hadith and then you say it's not there and if it's not there then it's the publisher's mistake it's the print house mistake not the bukhari the bukhari in arabic is everywhere and it's in the egyptian virgin is the indian virgin is the damascus library version it's a turkish version it's always there and the manuscripts are there and they fit as a glove so just because you found a version that does not fit doesn't mean it is wrong thirdly how do we know i usually in my counseling sessions shock my clients so when they have ocds and i feel and i do this i say listen are your parents alive say yes i said okay which orphanage did they adopt you from and they get offended no no i was not adopted i said how do you know were you there when you were born did you see them get married maybe you were adopted so no no i know said how do you know why is it when doubts come to your mind you accept this is maybe there is impurity maybe i didn't wash my arms well in in wudhu and when it comes to your lineage and your parents said no no no i was not adopted maybe you were so the same concept happens here why do you doubt al-bukhari simply because islam is based on hadith islam is not based on quran alone it can't be because in the quran it doesn't say how many prayers we have to pray and how many raka has for every prayer and it doesn't say the percentage of zakat and it doesn't say how to perform hajj in details all of this is found in the sunnah so if you come and try to cross the concept of sunnah explaining and translating the quran to us then you've demolished the deen and this is why some people may hint to the fact that um a hadith they're not that reliable or we only accept muthawater ahad is not that reliable this and that and these people are ignorant they have zero knowledge in hadith sciences yet they don't even know what's the difference between this and that and they try to demolish and destroy the religion so be careful my friend and don't fall into that trap of shaytan you"
