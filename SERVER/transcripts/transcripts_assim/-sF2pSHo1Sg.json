  "transcript": "perfect with no flaws at all are the laws of a love a way of life a way of life a way of life away we praise him and we ask allah to exalt the mention and grant peace and send his blessings upon the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam his companions as wives and all those who follow them on the righteous path until the day of recompense brothers and sisters in islam welcome to this episode i'm your host abba musa aguas de akiri to my right is brother abdul rahim green and brother sullivan and brother asim and we will be discussing a very hot topic there is no room for celebrity in islam number one the prophet saw made it very clear to us okay he said there's no celebrity in islam that's number one the marriage it is the one of the synonyms means the things that are natural and innate and it they are obligatory they're synonymous so we have to understand this the prophets and messengers allah mentioned them with their the examples they have families and they had progeny children of spring the prophet sallallahu alaihi was encouraging the us to reproduce and to have more children so all these things come together they give us the idea about the ruling of the marriage in islam the issue that the eurist discussed is it obligatory or is it recommended they are discussing this issue from fikki perspective for example a person who has no time like many of the imams ibn tamiya imam now yeah they had no time for this either they are behind bars or they are fighting behind books behind the books and teaching the ummah okay imam ahmad rahimahullah he said i fear that i stay one night without a wife without being married many many of these salafs he would come maybe this seems i mean harsh okay to the sisters he just buried his his wife and he's getting married he was afraid to meet allah not married exactly so there's no room for celebrity in islam based on the hadith of the prophet salallahu and here i would like to encourage the youth actually and and carry the parents to help them their children to get married as soon as possible for example especially the girls because soon you will reach the monopoles and that's at 40 average normally it will take 15 years okay imagine because you see subhanallah allah the creator knows you have repository store stock of eggs in your ovary and every month you are losing one so a time will come when that will be depleted you don't have any more this is a shechem also it's a problem that we found not only in the west as well i think even in some of the islamic countries where girls are pursuing an education exactly they're pursuing a career they reach 25 27 32 and they are now finding it impossible to get married and what you said to make haste is actually this is a hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi said that the haste is from shaytan except in how many things but one of those things he said was to get your daughters married so hastening to get your daughters married is something the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam has told us just wanted to add is that what you're saying that's true subhanallah i receive many calls okay from brothers okay i want i'm looking for a sister to marry okay we have lists of sisters alhamdulillah he said tell me what is the age i said 16 18 maximum 19. tell him she's in her 20s i thought you know he's like my mom he's too old for him it sounds harsh but this is the reason this is the reality this we have to face it so the sister when the sutu the right partner comes the righteous pious comes even if he hasn't finished her education her colleague or her university he should not reject you should not uh say no okay i won't accept sorry friend we will have to address this issue the idea of uh rejecting the qualified the spouse or the potential spouse and that is a very prevalent you know phenomena amongst the people because of nationalism and tribalism and different things of the sort but i think since we spoke about marriage and we addressed some of the important aspects of it perhaps the benefits of marriage so the audience will actually can get familiar with what we're saying because people say what is it what's in it for me okay so i get married they only think of the negative aspect responsibility rent children schooling education i mean it could be a headache unless one is prepared but what are the benefits which would make one look forward to getting married well there are a lot how many plenty man i just you know the sky is the limit among them see if you look at the quran and the sunnah like the just mentioned that it is the sunnah of not only our prophet hassan but all the prophets of allah and elijah mentioned that that o prophet of allah we had not sent a messenger before you except giving them wives and offspring and all the messengers of allah were married without exception except maybe for jesus and we don't know if he was married or not we know that he ascended to the heavens but we definitely know that he will descend at the end of time and he will have a wife or more and he will have offspring so if you look at it stayed in the quran that he was married and ibrahim had two wives sulaiman prophet solomon had 100 wives and in the authentic hadith he once told his companion that tonight i will sleep with all of my wives so that each one of them will conceive a warrior that fights for the cause of allah and as the companions that say insha allah he didn't say inshallah and we know the rest of the story so it shows you that the objective of getting married is not only for the sake of fun look at his objective like omar's objective um when he married um the daughter of he was like in his 60s or or so and she was a young girl and ali told him why do you want to marry such a young girl and he said well i don't need marriage and i don't desire it but i'd like to have this bond between me and the prophet susam so that i may have one of my offspring to be related to the prophet salallahu so and this is one of the advantage is of getting married from the very initial steps when he asked allah for he made it offspring not only that when you get married you have in-laws and i know that in in some everyone is is grimming now he's like oh yeah i know i've tried it personally i have with the grace of two wives and i have two families related to me in-laws and i feel proud i'm related to that family and to this family and this is why the prophet alison had so many in-laws why so that he can get this bond and connection with all the tribes with his companions and they strengthen the brotherhood and they become family subhanallah so this is one of the advantages of getting added as far as fornication and adultery the comfort you get out of marriage is second to none want to say listen come on if i get my black notebook and i check into my addresses and my exes i'm in heaven i have so many girlfriends i've got a brunette i've got a blonde i've got this i got that restricting me to one wife this is hell it is not there was this professor from otago wellington and new zealand university and she made a survey over 35 000 cases in tens of of countries and she concluded she's not a muslim the doctor she concluded that marriage reduces stress now every married person excuse me no this is true it reduces stress it reduces mental problems and it produces comfort in the house those who again have illegal relationships who fornicate who have you know relationships here and there they're not comfortable even if it's a one-night stand the amount of pressure mentally and physically is unbelievable unbearable where a person and his wife they're having the life of their the best time of their lives a way of a way of life is it safe to say then when a viewer right now is listening and he hears these words that according to the study there's less stress less problems and and the person feels otherwise can we safely say that's because we as muslims or some of us have misunderstood the nature of the marriage relationship the contract we haven't applied the sunnah in our marital life therefore we are not benefiting we're not actually benefiting from it as we're supposed to that's why we have stress that's why we have problems because the whole marriage idea and what it's supposed to bring about some of us might have failed in identifying the critical points in it and we have we've turned our marriage into uh perhaps more like what we see what people see on tv if they do watch you know the various channels and so this is part of the reason do you think that it's we failed in understanding the nature of marriage the way i see it and maybe the brothers can comment on it that those who suffer in their marriages they suffer elsewhere in the profession in their relationship with their siblings and friends it cascades down why because we have a problem in identifying the rights and responsibilities we know our rights very well we always fail to recognize our responsibilities to the others and that's why problems happen in marriages but this is not right one of the things i'd like to point out without going because actually this topic that i'm going to introduce itself could be a whole we could spend the whole another series talking about this but um when we say marriage i think it's very important and for all the listeners to understand something very important here we're talking about islamic marriage and so when the woman is observing hijab properly not just wearing a cloth on her head but she understands the spirit of hijab she understands what hijab really means you know when the men and women are not mixing freely when the husband is lowering his gaze when he his wife knows that she will not be in a room alone together with a strange woman she will he will not be shaking hands even with a strange woman so when you find these etiquettes are observed there is trust the man can trust this is one of the most beautiful things i found about islam i can't tell you the fact that i can leave my wife and not even have to worry one single little bit that she is going to be treacherous to me because she will not apart from anything else she will not even put herself in a situation where that can happen the same with me when i'm traveling she can trust me because she knows that i will not even put myself in the situation where that can happen i'm sure you will find in marriages where there is tension i almost can guarantee you will find there is some free mixing taking place there is this lack of trust because there are things that are taking place that are not within the teachings of islam the trust begins to break down the jealousy begins to creep in and this by the way you were talking about you know the list of the girlfriends and all the boyfriends in the case of the sisters yeah this is something that with the whole girlfriend boyfriend relationship is one of the most horrific aspects of it it is the jealousy it is no it's the fact not just the jealousy then you have to kill your jealousy because for you to feel jealous it's like somehow not cool to be jealous and you know the whole time you're fighting your nature you're not living it's not peaceful you know okay so you get a few minutes of enjoyment of sexual enjoyment but the rest is a lot yeah mashallah it depends you know whatever it may be half a night a few minutes depending you know but the point is it's brief compared to the amount of suffering that you have this is the point and no affection no no repose very limited and honestly anyone who experiences the way in marriage you can develop a relationship even sexually it cannot be compared how can you in having sexual enjoyment is something that takes effort and experience to know what makes your husband happy what makes your wife happy how do you know each other how do you know what pleases each other this is something that takes time and experience you can't experience this in a one night stand true you can't experience this in the one night stand i feel so sorry for these people who think that sexual intimacy is about this one they wouldn't yeah and this is the difference in marriage you subhanallah has so much and this is barakah this is the blessing yes exactly you just said it it is a blessing from allah and allah reminds us so allah among his signs that he created for you mates partners the purpose of the marriage so that you find this sakina this serenity this calmness tranquility this tranquility this inner peace absolutely that is really you come tired from your work eight hours or twelve hours in your toes your boss is shouting at you and you go home now this is your paradise on earth and this is my i invite every sister to make her home paradise on earth your husband is longing for that make him he misses you he calls you from the office i miss you darling what if he doesn't okay who are you talking about i see no no no no believe me so we mentioned we need to work on this yes we need to work on this you need it men and women both of course and women in particular they like to hear you will be shocked maybe sometimes or surprised that if your partner your wife comes to you one day stands in front of you like this do you love me and you go ah the poor girl is wants to heal it from you wants to hear from you i love you all these things they are in need of that so this sakina calmness so your part he receives you at the door hugging you he already did had daily chores he already took a shower not that he meets you with all the problems children did this you're tired you had enough already so that's where you'd find sakina calmness underline this he puts this affection and mercy to some both mercy and affection subhanallah it is a medical a woman you didn't know we know an islam node is dating stuff and all that you know that you propose you see the girl maybe once or twice and that's it till the night after the wedlock the moment the wedlock is signed you feel he is part of you who has put this it is allah subhanahu wa and i think this is something sheikh you know this that you hear people talk about barakah yes you know it's uh intangible undefinable unquantified you can't measure it maybe you could measure it scientifically i have no idea but how is it huh you can measure the financial yes you probably i mean i don't think anyone's tried but there is this amazing thing that something that you know something small a plate of food for example that normally you would expect would feed you know four or five people it feeds 10 people 20 people 30 people how is this and it's the same with marriage there's this blessing in it that something allah subhanahu ta'ala special gives it to it because you're doing something to please him because this is halal you know subhanallah and this reminds me of the i love this saying of the prophet sallallahu alaihi when he's saying that you get rewarded for having intimate relations with your wife yes and they say ya rasulullah we get rewarded for that and you can imagine this we get rewarded he said if you did it in harambe would you not get punished this is so beautiful for those who are married imagine when this is the only way for him to get this form of worship yes otherwise if he's not married he's not going to get this strategy not only that were you talking about intangible benefits the quran tells us that it is tangible and so many times if you remember if we when we spoke about this in the car so many times people say that financially i'm unable to get married yes and we put burdens where if they were to be poor allah would grant them from his grace so this is a promise because the the beginning of the ayah let those who are unmarried get married you should do this you should work to do this and in conclusion allah says if they are poor if they were to be poor allah would grant them from his favor so don't think that it is you that has all the abilities so many times we depend on ourselves we trust our abilities we have reliance on what we know and we forget and neglect allah azza not knowing that allah azzawajal got us out of our mother wombs knowing nothing and then he himself as always granted us the hearing the seeing and the ability to comprehend so originally all my certificates all my knowledge all my health and power and wealth is nothing it's all a gift and a blessing from allah azzawajal therefore do not think of marriage as an obstacle think of it as a blessing of allah azza not only that he will help you the prophet said alissa has pledged to support them and one of them is a man seeking marriage to preserve his chastities and sheikh you know what now what's happened is you answered the the sort of question i posed in the beginning about how when marriage is half of the deen and the deen is about you know worshiping allah and worshiping allah is about knowing allah and you have just now exactly articulated because what have we learned from marriage from all of this that allah is the provider that's subhanallah i have eight kids in my house people are there you say how how can you have a kid listen how do you afford this than that allah is the provider you learn this you look you know this is not from yourself this is only from allah subhanahu wa island this is exactly this is really what we find in marriage as well this beautiful connection we make with allah it seems then that we have to as muslims bring a relation between spirituality faith in allah and marriage they go hand in hand and if we were to focus on one without the other there would be some defect and with that inshallah tala we conclude this particular episode however this will not be the last we will be discussing more on the issues of marriage in the next episode barakallahu kuma salaam alaiki oh"
