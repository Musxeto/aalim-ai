  "transcript": "about he says are all good deeds better than a thousand nights they're a thousand month in the night of al-qaeda allah says the night is better than a thousand months so allah did not identify the deets he just simply identified the night this means that you should do the things that the prophet had done praying all night making vikka reciting quran going to give sadaqah is not mentioned at that particular night like some people say every single night give a particular amount of money so that you would hit the uh gold pot or the jackpot others say no let's go and visit our uncle because it's better than a thousand night all of these were not mentioned so we don't say it will be included or not this isn't allah's knowledge but it is not what the prophet did is"
