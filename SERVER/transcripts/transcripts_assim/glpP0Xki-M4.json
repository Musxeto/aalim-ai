  "title": "Can I share my business journey & revenue on YouTube to build trust so others will buy my courses?",
  "transcript": "Ahmed from UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wassalamu Alaikum So Sheikh I'm running a business and I want to like document my journey on YouTube and all the social media accounts and like eventually I want to start selling course to teach people how to do it and to do this I have to like show how much money I make like the revenue and all of the profits and stuff so people believe me and want to see the result before buying the course so what's the ruling on this? Jazak Allah Wa Jazak The Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam said The Prophet says Alayhis Salatu Wassalam when going to execute your errands and to execute your projects keep it low profile don't publicize it because every person who's gifted and blessed by Allah will be envied so no one in his right mind would go and say to people well I made my first million last year last year I made a forecast of X, Y, Z and I managed to secure this amount of money and then comes after a couple of months complaining that he lost all of his wealth you deserve it Achi why would you expose yourself and tell people how much you made and logically speaking if your projects were fruitful and making money who in his right mind would leave the goose that lays the golden eggs and go teach courses for peanuts what the hell with everyone else go and focus on your business and make more money rather than going to them and showing them charts that I made so much money and I'm willing to give you a course I would have second thoughts Achi you're phony if you're making this much money why are you teaching me a course go and make more money triple it quadruple it invest more and devote more time to your business that generates much more than such courses and Allah knows best"
