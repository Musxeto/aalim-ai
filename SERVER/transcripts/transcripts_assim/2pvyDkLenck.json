  "transcript": "ossama says if we made a quick hustle by rinsing the mouth and nose on a Friday or a day which does not include the widow in the beginning do we need to make a separate will do or this quick also is sufficient now this is a frequently asked question and I think that I'll try my level best to give you an answer that would explain things to you would o is a ritual is a form of worship you cannot pray without being in the state of would agree agree Waddell has pillars mentioned in Chapter five Surat al-ma'idah where Allah says whenever you or believers want to pray you have to pillar one wash your faces pillar to wash your arms till your elbows pillar three wipe your head pillar for wash your feet up to the ankles pillar five the sequence the order so it has to be face arms head and feet so this is in sequence and pillar six simultaneously it has to be simultaneous so I cannot wash my face and then go right few words on my word document in a novel that I'm writing and then go back and wash my arms and then text some of my friends about tonight's dinner and then wipe over my head this doesn't work it has to be simultaneous one after the other these are the six pillars of woudl without your Wordle is invalid agree sounds good now if I make that is wash my whole body rinse my mouth and nose did I follow the sequence the order says nope then my order is invalid okay sounds logical but sure I have a small question if I wear in my major ritual impurity state after intercourse or after nocturnal emission or if I were a woman just finishing my menses and I take a major ritual impurity or hustle so hustle means to wash to uplift the major ritual impurity so this hustle just washing my whole body raising my mouth and nose or dipping myself in the ocean rinsing my mouth and nose and coming out with the intention of uplifting my ritual impurity is my ritual impurity uplifted the major one the answer is yes so do I have to perform ooodle dance there is no why you just said that the order has to be followed and I did not follow the order here so why when I make whistle for jhamora it is not valid I have to make Odle and when I make hole for uplifting a major ritual impurity I don't have to make wudu this doesn't make sense share it does make sense when you perform what do what are you doing I am uplifting a minor ritual impurity which is caused by sleeping eating camel's meat urinating difficut in passing wind so to uplift this minor ritual impurity I have to perform model true true when you make whistle to uplift a major ritual impurity this minor ritual impurity is included by default so the smaller form of worship goes under the bigger form of worship and I give you another example the Prophet said that Islam do not sit until you pray 2 rakats in the Masjid I came into the Masjid a karma was given I prayed with the Congregation for AHA's door this is my fault I finished should I pray to raka of the hiatal Masjid which the Prophet said re Salam do not sit until you pray it says no why because the bigger form of worship took in the smaller form of worship a third and last example in Hajj the Prophet said Ali sought asylum let it be that path is the last thing you do when hash is over so the last thing you do in Mecca is to make the Tawaf this is known as farewell Tawaf a person who did not do the Tawaf in the beginning which is the day of eight and this is a pillar too awful a father he postponed it until the thirteenth day of the Hitcher the last thing after everything was over the only thing remaining for his for his hatch to be complete is to go round the Kaabah so he makes his tawaaf of an a father seven rounds do we say okay make another seven rounds for powerful with that there is no this power of a father is a pillar that includes underneath it this minor beta which is tofu al-wada or farewell therefore I hope this clears the issue your Russell does not suffice for your wooden except when this Russell is to uplift a major ritual impurity resulting from either ejaculation intercourse nocturnal emission or from being clean from your menses or your postnatal bleeding niphas but if you perform a hustle that is not uplifting a major ritual impurity such as the whistle of read the whole of Friday the hustle for ombres for a harm docile for just cleaning up and cooling down this does not suffice for Moodle and Allah knows best"
