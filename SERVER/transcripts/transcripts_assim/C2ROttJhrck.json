  "transcript": "and this is extremely important issue to understand now what we're referring to are soothsayers fortune tellers palm readers those who look into a crystal ball and they claim they can understand or know the future in arabia we have this turkish coffee that we drink and then afterwards they turn it upside down and after a couple of minutes they look and they find that the traces of the residue of the coffee leaves marks on the walls of the cup and people start to predict that i see in your life path this will happen someone will propose to you you will lose your trade all of this is blatant kuffer and this is why if you go to these people if you read the zodiac if you read the signs as they call them because i'm a scorpio so it says scorpio will have this and that this week if i read it for the fun of it not believing in it at all this would render my prayer for 40 days invalid but if i read it and i believe in it so it says you're going to have an accident today and i don't go to work today i call in sick then i have committed an act of shirk of kufur and i have exited the fold of islam these things are important and very essential to understand now"
