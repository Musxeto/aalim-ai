  "transcript": "so when i uh when i uh when i reset the surah in salah only for salah i repeat verses every time so it happens in 9 out of ten salah uh every day so if i ignore this whispers and just go and just go on with the uh and just recite the surah one once and if there is any um if there is any uh mistake in it will my prayer be valid okay and see my friends okay i will answer you inshallah mahdi has a problem that a lot of the muslims suffer from and why do muslims suffer from it simply because shaytan is setting them up shaytan is preparing them so that he would confuse them depress them and eventually make them leave salat altogether so many people get these ocds and they don't treat it on time it escalates it becomes chronic and eventually they become despair and they say what's the use we're going to hell because allah will not accept our prayers so they leave the salat altogether to shaytan to satan this is mission accomplished this is my program this is my objective this is what i wanted and it happened now the the the weird thing is and the funny thing is all those who suffer from such whispers they come and confess i get this with swas i get i get these whispers and you say whoa you know these are whispers i said yes who are they from he says shaytan subhanallah how do you accept your enemy to do whatever he wants and you do it willingly let's say your most fierce enemy comes to you with a mug you know that he killed your parents and raped your sister and took your money and put you in jail and did all heinous things he wants your demise he wants your death and he comes to you with a mug and he says drink this my friend it's very good for you will you drink it he says no why he's my enemy i know that he's poisoned it or at least there is some things going bad going to happen to me says subhan allah that's good why then when shaytan comes to you with these whispers you repeat these verses over and over and over again or you repeat the wudu ten times who's making you do this immediately they say shaytan it's okay why are you replying to him and doing what he's telling you to when you know that he's your enemy they say well we're afraid maybe i did not do the wudu correctly maybe i did the mistake in i've said this so many times and it's on my youtube all the time if you watch my series on um which is very beneficial and it's free it's on youtube you will benefit tremendously with the grace of allah the rule of certainty is not affected by doubt this what i'm wearing on my head is it pure or negis the default it's pure maybe one of my grandchildren touched it with soiled hands maybe a mouse came and urinated and left i don't know maybe so would i allow this doubt to jeopardize certainty of course not what's certain is certain so likewise you perform doodle but maybe a shaykh i didn't no you have to be crazy to think like this the default is you done will do everything is washed you didn't miss anything so if you go with this whisper you'll go down the drain and you are entering a rabbit hole you'll never know where you'll end but if you abide by islam if you trust allah and be positive and say nope i know this is my enemy i'm not going to give in even if there is a possibility the possibility does not rise up to be certainty so i'll go with what is certain i recited the fatiha and i have no reasons to doubt it i don't recall making a mistake so i'll move on if you push yourself acknowledge the fact that allah will not hold you accountable [Music] because if you made a mistake allah forgives it if you done an error allah forgives it if you forgot something allah forgives it if you acknowledge this and you think positive positively of allah you are safe and in good hands insha allah you"
