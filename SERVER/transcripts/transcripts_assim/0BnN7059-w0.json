  "transcript": "Adnan from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Sheikh if someone abandons prayer for a long time such as a year then says the Shahada but doesn't repent and then he prays on and off would he be a Muslim in the fact that he didn't repent and what if he dies on it? In what we see in what we consider he's Muslim whether Allah accepted his repentance or not because he wasn't remorseful this is in Allah's hands so to us we deal with him as if he's Muslim when he dies we bury him as a Muslim but if Allah Azza Wa Jal ruled it and judged him not to be Muslim he will be taken and thrown into hell for eternity without a problem."
