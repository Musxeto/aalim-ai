  "transcript": "but I have a question um of when we make to uh do we have to firmly believe that Allah will accept it like if we are having some kind of a sauce or OCD and we make Dua that Allah all of us and do we have firmly believed that one day he will of course I've mentioned this in the beginning of the session but probably you did not join at that time the prophet himself stated that when a person makes Dua Allah answers it in three ways either Allah gives it to you o Allah grant me a thousand dollars boom you get a thousand dollars or Allah deflicts harm That was supposed to come your way and would have costed you a thousand dollars I was so destined to smash my car against another person's car but the last second I avoided that alhamdulillah that would have been a horrible accident that would have costed me a thousand dollars or Allah would store this for me on the day of judgment so I come and see a lot of rewards and hasanat and I said I didn't do any of those and then I'm told that you made Dua and Allah answered you do and re and stored it for you today on the day of judgment so you have to make Dua with the firm belief that Allah is going to respond to you and Allah Knows Best"
