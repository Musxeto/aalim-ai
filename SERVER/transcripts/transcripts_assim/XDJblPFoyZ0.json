  "title": "If we make dua asking Allah to pardon our sins, will it still show up in our book? Major & Minor sin",
  "transcript": "Faisal from Canada if we ask Allah to Pardon us will our sins be like like completely erase like it was never there because I heard because I know that if we actually for forgiveness that he will forgive us but uh on the day judgment we'll still see our sins but I also heard that if we ask all through partners by saying that Dua that like our sin will be like it never existed like it will even be there is this true is that girl um Allah forgives the sins for whomever asks for forgiveness but major sins require repentance so the Dua itself is not sufficient it has to be accompanied by repentance remorse uh quitting the sins pledging not to do them again asking Allah for forgiveness it's a whole package deal but minor sins yes the Dua would be sufficient inshallah whether you will be shown your sins on the day of judgment or not despite the fact that you were forgiven this is the norm each and every one of us even if he repented and sought Allah's forgiveness must be shown his sins and must acknowledge them so that he would see Allah's favors upon him on the day of judgment you had done something wrong and there are consequences yes you sought Allah's forgiveness Allah forgave you but still Allah has to show you this sins so that you would appreciate Allah's forgiveness upon you the only difference is that Allah conceals you from everyone else so no one knows that Allah is showing you your sins and that you had committed these sins in the past so it's between you and him and Allah azzawajal Knows Best [Music] all right and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign"
