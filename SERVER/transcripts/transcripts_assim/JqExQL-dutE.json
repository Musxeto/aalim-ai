  "title": "Can a woman share her photo with an employer when applying for work? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if a woman wants to seek a job at home working online or doing freelance work most places don't let you proceed with that uh with the registration process unless you upload your picture recruiters will see this picture is this permissible the answer is no a woman's photograph can only be used for essential things such as admission to school she has to study such as traveling she has to have a passport ID card to get into a hospital when she's working at a company for identification these are legitimate reasons but to do something from home which is not mandatory for most women and they require your photograph this is unheard of why would they require my my photograph if I have my bank credentials if I have my uh website my certificate everything is legit so if there is a necessity then posting your or giving or sharing your photograph for the the sake of that necessity when it's limited is permissible but to have it uploaded and everybody sees your face and you're AI woman there is nothing that calls for this at all and Allah uh Knows Best"
