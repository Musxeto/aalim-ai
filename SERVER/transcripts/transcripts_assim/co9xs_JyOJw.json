  "title": "Accidentally showed SLIGHT frustration when talking to parents, do I STILL have to apologize? assim",
  "transcript": "Salma from the UK. I know you have to apologize to your parents if you like disrespect to them. But if you like accidentally show the slightest frustration like in your voice, you still have to apologize to them. Do you want Allah to punish you or do you want to risk being punished in your grave and then on the day of judgment, yes or no? No. Then in this case, apologize. Don't allow arrogance and pride to push you away from the straight path. Your parents are your gateway to Jannah. No matter how abusive they are, no matter how rude they are, no matter how ignorant they are, no matter what they do to you, they're still your test from Allah Azza Wa Jal. Imagine if they were sweethearts, giving you a thousand quid every day, not allowing you to do any work in the house, no chores, serving you breakfast in your bed, complimenting you in front of the guests, she's the best daughter on earth, she's the love of my life. Would you be dutiful to them? Of course, Shaykh. Even if I were an animal, I would have been dutiful for them. Where is the test? The test is when they provoke you, when they agitate you, when they force you or pressure you, or mentally abuse you. Here is the test that would elevate your level in Jannah. Never raise your voice, never look at them in a stern way. You know like you can tell when a child is displeased with his parents by the look, even if he doesn't open his mouth. The facial expressions is sufficient to show how undutiful you are. Breaking their heart with an arrogant response, even if you apologize, it wouldn't fix it. I wouldn't go to a child and slap the child and give him a piece of candy and then think that next time I can slap the child and give him another piece of candy. The child is going to run away from me. Yeah, you did this once, I accepted it, but no, you can't do this as a habit. So fear Allah Azza wa Jal and choose your path, whether to Jannah or to Hell."
