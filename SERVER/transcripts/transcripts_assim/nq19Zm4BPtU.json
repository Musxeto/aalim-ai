  "title": "Is abortion permissible if the foetus has an abnormality? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "embrace says the doctor is telling us to undergo a test and the purpose of this test to check whether the pregnancy whether the fetus is healthy or there's a possibility of having complications such as down syndrome or a deficiency in the body or something that is serious and they would recommend to terminate the pregnancy if the test is positive so he says is this permissible the most authentic opinion is if the pregnancy is below 40 days old you can terminate it you can abort it it's like the having the after um after night pill i think they call it the after pill which a couple may take after having intercourse and it would terminate any possibility of pregnancy so within the 40 days it's permissible after the 40 days it is not permissible unless there's a legitimate confirmed reason so from 40 days till before 120 days the soul has not been breathed in the fetus because the prophet prophet has told us when the fetus is 120 days old the angel comes and breathes in the soul now it's a human being so if the tests are confirmed that the fetus does not have limbs or it has extreme problems with the heart or it has no brain or it will have down syndrome and this is verified this is checked and authentic by many doctors in this case it is permissible to abort once the child is 120 days old the the fetus all over then you cannot do that anymore even if they confirm that there is something serious because the child is a human being let it be after birth if allah chooses and wills to end its life alhamdulillah you did your due diligence and you have nothing on you inshallah"
