  "title": "Is it Sunnah to make Dua every Wednesday",
  "transcript": "say is it from the Sunnah to make Dua every Wednesday it's an issue of dispute and the reason is that there is a Hadith from jabdah may Allah be pleased with them that the prophet Alam asked Allah in the the Masjid of fat on Monday and he asked him on Tuesday and he asked him on Wednesday and Allah responded and answered his supplication on Wednesday so jabber used to select uh praying or asking Allah I think it's between and every Wednesday and he told always came uh true but the scholars say that this Hadith is not authentic and therefore one should not follow this because there is no uh evidence in it that this is a time of uh preferred time of Dua all what there is in the Hadith is that Allah answered his prayer on that day so if Prophet n for example asked Allah for 50 years for something and then after 50 years Allah answered his called this doesn't mean that that time of answering his Dua is the preferred time for Dua it means that Allah chose for a wisdom that his answer would be on that specific time and Allah Knows Best"
