  "transcript": "okay so I got three questions for your shake my first question is what's the proper method for making the intention for will do for a whistle and for Salah like do you say it out loud or do you say it in your mind or what's the proper method that's my first question okay intention in Arabic and Nia so how do I make Nia for Woodill for whistle for prayer so what is intention this is something no one knows off is it not true when I say to someone okay your intention is evil you want it to do this and this and this II would say are you God only Allah knows the intention and this is why the jurors the fokaha say the intention is in the heart what does that mean meaning that no one knows about it except me so for example if someone puts a dish of biryani in front of me do i Archer and say I intend to reach out and grab a bite if I want to go to the bathroom and answer the call of nature do I say before entering okay I talk to myself I intend to go and do my 101 or 102 nobody does this so the intention is something that is firm in your heart that you want to do it so one is walking after making water in home to the message it enters the message it says Allah Akbar Shaitaan comes to him ah you did not have intention for fart said are you crazy all what have done is my intention so actually intention is something in your heart you do not verbalize it you do not say it verbally no you say it in your heart so with your lips sealed you don't say I intend to pray the whole four raka at 1 p.m. on the twenty what is it on the 10th of February behind Imam share so and so all of this is an innovation you do not say anything you know that this is lower time or us or whatever and you simply praying the prayer of the time in the Masjid you simply say Allahu Akbar you you begin your prayer so this is intention"
