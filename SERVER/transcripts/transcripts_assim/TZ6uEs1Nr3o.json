  "transcript": "foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I can't understand what do you mean elaborate a little bit more like for example in the religion we're not allowed to run another person it's true correct or like oppress them correct or like take away from the right so how can I know if if I've done it because for example I made you a Quran with someone and they take it in the wrong way but I never intended for them to get angry but turn off if I don't know this is something actually that cannot be easily detected if you are a person who overthinks or the other party is a person who's too sensitive because no matter what you do you will never ever please the people so always keep it at the back of your mind have I sent no did I do anything that is considered to be impolite no did I hurt a person's feelings to my knowledge no then I haven't done anything wrong why would I be concerned well they might have felt bad that's their problem if they have an issue they come and say to me you hurt my feeling you said so and so I can then relate to that but when I overthink this is bad news because I'll keep on thinking that oops maybe I touch the worshiper next to me's Toes by mistake maybe he's offended maybe I have to apologize to him no you don't the default is that you live normally and you do your thing without taking too much concern of how people feel as long as you're not breaking any rules or doing anything harsh don't allow shaytan to mess up with your head yes if someone comes up to you and say okay you did this and it hurt me we can apologize we can ask for forgiveness otherwise nobody is coming to me and saying Sheikh you said this is wrong Sheikh this was offensive Sheikh you hurt someone's feeling where I can assess myself nobody's coming to me so why would I care or overthink this is not natural and I hope this answers your question [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah foreign foreign"
