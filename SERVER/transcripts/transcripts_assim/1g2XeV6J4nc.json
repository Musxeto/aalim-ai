  "transcript": "[Music] today's lesson is number fourteen and this is chapter six from the book for surf the islamic faith and this deals with what we believe about allah's beautiful names and attributes so allah azzawajal as muslims know have beautiful names that we cannot count as there are so many yet we were told about 99 of them that would admit a person to paradise just to know them understand them and act upon them as per the hadith of the prophet so this chapter deals with what is it that we believe about allah's beautiful names and attributes because this is part of the hate and without it a person's belief in allah would be distorted and missing so in the beginning the sheikh says allah has beautiful names and fine attributes no one knows him better than he knows himself therefore we deny what he has denied of himself and confirm what he has confirmed in his book and in his messages sunnah so this is a very important rule in our belief whatever we call allah azzawajal by it has to be coming from allah in the quran or mentioned to us by the prophet islam in the authentic sunnah full stop which means that the companions may allah be pleased with them can't give allah azzawajal a beautiful name unless it is attributed to the prophet allah that they heard it from him the tabi'in cannot give allah a beautiful name or say that this name is good we should call allah azzawajal with it and therefore when people say oh my god we say to them this is wrong for a muslim to say they said why god is the or allah is the god of the universe i said yes but god cannot be referred or cannot be used to refer to allah with we say that the greeks had gods so we make it into plural and allah is one without a second we can make it feminine by saying goddess and allah azzawajal does not be getting is not begotten does not have a wife does not have a child he's one and only subhanahu wa so we cannot describe allah or call allah we stop with something he did not name himself our brothers in the subcontinent when they leave one another they say khuda hafiz is not one of allah's names he was never mentioned in the quran or in the sunnah so we cannot call allah azza with the name that he did not call himself so this is a very important point that we have to understand and believe in then the sheikh says we say in general that every negative thing is inapplicable to him and we confirm to him in detail every attribute of perfection we do not try to assign any from any we do not try to assign any form or likeness to him and we do not compare him to anyone or anything so we say in general that if that every negative thing is inapplicable to him why do we say in general because sometimes humans think of something to be negative when actually it is not when described when describing allah azzawajal in general yes we say allah azzawajal is free from all negative things but sometimes we have to be a little bit specific to what humans may think it's negative when it is not so for example for me and you as humans if we say that a person we know has insomnia never sleeps stays all night long would this be a good description and an attribute of that person or a negative one definitely it's a negative one it's a sign that indicates an illness a deficiency something that is not human something that is not healthy at all now when it comes to allah this is a description and an attribute of perfection so we say allah azzawajal does not sleep and he cannot sleep otherwise the whole universe would be destroyed if he were to sleep subhanahu ta'ala so this is negating a specific saying that allah does not when usually we do not have to go into specifics rather speak in general terms and we confirm to him in detail every attribute of perfection now when it comes to attributing talking about the attributes of perfection of allah we don't talk generally we talk in specifics and details that he is kind that he is generous that he is merciful most beneficent and we detail these things because it makes allah's glorification in our heart grow and it roots it down in our hearts strongly when we speak about allah in such a fashion we do not try to assign any form of liken likeness to him and we do not compare him to any one or anything and this is part of what creed is about we do not talk when we talk about his beautiful attributes that it is like so and so or it is similar to so and so or we will compare allah's knowledge to someone's else knowledge no this is totally impermissible to give a form or to [Music] try to compare because allah azza is unlike anyone or anything you know if anyone attributes to him any negative thing in detail ah now someone is describing allah azzawajal negatively in detail we deny it in detail just like he has denied that he ever had a wife or a son so someone claims that allah has a wife or someone has a claim that allah has a son we can't talk general now we have to specifically deny this allah says how can he have a child when he has never had a concert and allah says he begets none nor is he begotten he also denied what the jews said when they accused him of miserliness so we talk in details allah is generous allah is giving allah stretches his hands to give without account these are details in attributes of perfection but when someone describes allah with a negative inappropriate description we have to reply in details allah says the jews say allah's hands is shackled it is their own hands that are shackled rejected are they for what they say indeed both his hands are outstretched he bestows his bounty as he wills so here we have a detailed defense of allah azzawajal to reply to their negation to reply to their negative attributes that they are trying to attribute to allah we accept what is stated in allah's revelation such as allah's names and attributes what does accepting it means it means that we confirm the truth of these attribution names and understand some of their effects but do not go beyond that because nothing is comparable to allah he says about himself nothing bears even the slightest compat com compatibility to him he alone hears all and sees all what does that mean allah describes himself that he is all hearing all seeing that he is mighty powerful that he is wealthy that he is knowledgeable now we understand the meaning of these attributes everybody understands what it means to be all seeing all hearing and we know the implications of it so when allah says he hears everything we know what healing is and that allah that allah's knowledge encompasses everything including the the things that are hurt but we do not go beyond that and we do not try to describe allah azza and explain things that were not explained to us so we do not compare him to anything we do not allow intrusive thoughts to cross our minds about do's and don'ts because this ayah always resonates in front of us nothing bears even the slightest comparability to him he alone hears all and sees all so whatever crosses your mind that allah is like he is unlike that you must limit your thinking to what allah has described himself by and what the prophet has described his lord by so why do we emphasize on this point simply in regards to his attributes it is wrong to draw an analogy between allah and anything whatsoever an analogy requires two parties main and secondary now before we continue analogy is chris so if we have a ruling and we would like to cascade this ruling over something there are things that must be fall uh found and there is a process that must be followed so we have to have a main and secondary things before we do the analogy let's assume that we would like to know what is the ruling on doing drugs the consumption of drugs whether meth crack heroin cocaine opium pot grass marijuana you name it whatever your name you want to give so we have a main pillar which is wine and liquid intoxicants and we have a secondary that we would like to make it catch up and fall under this category which is drugs and we have what is known as which is the reason the common denominator which is intoxicating the mind covering it handling it from making the correct decision and the right choice etc so now when we come in regard to his attributes of the almighty it is wrong to draw an analogy between allah and anything whatsoever why because any analogy requires two parties main and secondary allah is one without comparison hence there is neither a secondary to draw close to him nor remain to compete with him how can we do any analogy with allah azza you have to have something to compare the almighty with and there is nothing that can be compared with allah subhanahu ta'ala i remember like almost 40 years ago when i started seeking knowledge i read that wearing gold for men is hana so as a young man it came to my head that okay why is gold haram and silver not so it came to my mind that maybe because it's jewelry and it's expensive and then an ingenious idea came to my mind saying that diamonds are more expensive so diamonds by default should be haram this is my analogy so i spoke to one of the scholars at that time 40 years ago and he was of egyptian descent so i said to him sheikh can we make the analogy that diamonds are haram for men because gold is haram for men and the sheikh exploded in my face literally i still remember it the way he scolded me he said who do you think you are to make analogy like this analogy has men who spend their life studying knowledge knowing what is permissible to apply the rules and the process of analogy to and what is not and what do you think you just hatch from the egg and you stop allah i was so ashamed of myself but it was a very very beneficial lesson till date whenever i want to put my own input into something i think i remember what he said who are you to think you're not qualified to make such an assessment and likewise multiplied by hundreds and thousands of folds allah the almighty we cannot compare him to anything and hence we cannot bring an analogy so that we would compare him to because he is the one and only there is neither a secondary to draw close to him nor remain to compete with him he is the one and only allah the eternal the absolute he begets none nor he is begotten and there is nothing that could be compared to him subhanahu azzawajal it is very important when you understand what allah is that you study his beautiful names and and attributes a lot of the muslims today when i sit and speak to them and i find that they have problems and issues in their lives in their marriages in the process of thinking most of that is attributed to the fact that they do not know who allah is you get people fighting cursing maybe slandering others for what because they want to pray the prayer before the end of its time you had two three hours before that why didn't you pray it and now when you squeeze into a corner you claim that this makes you say things that are blasphemous divorce your wife all of this is because you don't know who allah is you just want to get rid of this the prayer it's a burden it's a heavy weight that you carry on your shoulders you just want to get it off your shoulders this is not how muslims deal with salat with prayer when we know allah azzawajal when our hearts are filled with the love of allah subhana wa when we know the beautiful names and attributes of allah the almighty we become like our prophet used to deal with salat what or how did he deal with salat whenever salah was due he used to call bilal and he says bilal relieve us with it meaning our relief our comfort of our hearts is allocated is found in salat because we know allah we know who we will pray to the moment we say allahu akbar all our worries are on the ground and we have nothing to worry about except pleasing allah whom we're praying to nowadays we do not say bilal relieve us with it because salat is not a relief we say bilal relieve us from it let us just pray it and get it over with and this is why we have a problem when it comes to prayer when it comes to our personal lives when it comes to our daily activities when we don't know allah azzawajal this would be the result the says the human mind is like a machine created by allah it compares what it hears to what it sees this is natural so if i tell you oh i saw a new mobile device that has the following features one two ten so you were comparing this device which you had not seen this brand to a device that you may have and you're making the comparison so the human mind is like a machine created by allah it compares what it hears to what it sees it listens to what allah tells us of himself and because he is unseen the mind compares him to the closest object it has seen every mind imagines his attributes according to what it has seen before and develops its understanding on this basis this is what normal people do without putting much thought into it now this however god allah is without compare in all mind you cannot compare allah to anything or anyone and this is a fact that helps you block such intrusive thoughts allah is without comparing all minds therefore we must not negate any of his names or attributes because of any bad comparison people might have expressed why did he mention all of this so thinking about allah when you hear his beautiful names and attributes is a human factor islam overrides this and it tells you to believe without going into details so allah azzawajal sees everything you don't go saying how this is not part of jamaa's belief in allah's beautiful names and attributes you don't ask about how you don't say similarly to you don't negate by saying yeah he hears but he doesn't actually hear like the jamiyah say and some of them are tesla as well no we believe in what allah described himself with while blocking our heads and minds from trespassing into territories that are not allowed for us to do so however allah is without comparing all minds therefore we must not negate any of his names or attributes because of any bad comparison people might have expressed ah those who do not limit themselves to quran and sunnah and to the belief of the three favorite generations start to develop bad thoughts so they think if we say allah does this or that as he described himself oh no no no this is not possible how is it possible that allah azza has two hands no this is not appropriate to give similarities to allah like us we have two hands and like animals and like other creatures no no allah does not have hands because hands can only be for creatures not for the creator where are you getting these evil thoughts from from the devil himself because allah described himself and you say yeah yeah but he didn't mean that he meant something else the quran is in arabic when allah says that the jews say that allah's hand is shackled and allah says this is a lie their hands are shackled while allah's hands are outstretched we're talking about hands that we know the meaning of we don't know the how we understand it as it is as we understand that the lies are alive and we are alive but allah's life is not like our life and so on so we must must not negate any of his names or attributes because of any bad comparison people might have expressed this is a case of negating the comparison by negating the attribute of his name so because they wanted to negate the comparison they thought that it is easier and best to negate the whole attribute so instead of saying that yeah yeah allah's hands are not like his creations hands this is negating the comparison that's good instead they said no no allah doesn't have hands to begin with allah described himself as such now you're coming to negate something that allah has described if we do so we commit the error of negating an invalid comparison and denying a true statement this is what allah described himself by what we should negate is the bad meaning that people might have expressed while confirming what allah has stated of his names and attributes without adding anything that's simple as that allah says in the quran he knows all that lies open before them and all that is hidden from them whereas they cannot have thorough knowledge of him so when you deny something that allah has confirmed simply because your bad thoughts took you some place unsafe and not healthy this is because of your ignorance not because of anything else you should affirm what allah has affirmed for himself and deny the bad comparison allah says no power of vision can encompass him whereas he can or where he he encompasses all vision he is above all comprehension yet is all aware allah is above all comprehension no one ever can comprehend what allah is or how allah is and this is why we rely entirely on our nature on our conviction that he's one that all beautiful attributes are due to him that all negative attributes are denied and inappropriate and cannot be attributed to him the almighty allah allah is established on the throne of his almightiness in heaven this is a fact mentioned in the quran in many places seven i believe the prophet islam confirmed this that allah is upon his throne and he is above all in heavens and nothing of his creation surrounds him nothing of his creation allah is in need of allah doesn't need the throne doesn't need the universe so we have to believe in this he is subhanahu wata'ala as he described himself he is the first and the last the outer and the inner he has full knowledge of all things it is he who created the heavens and the earth in six days and established himself on the throne he knows all that goes into the earth and all that comes out of it all that descends from the skies and all that ascends to them he is with you wherever you may be and allah sees all that you do beautiful verses of suratul hadid in this ayat allah confirms his establishment and his knowledge of all things allah confirms establish his establishment on the throne allah is above the throne allah is upon the throne and he tells us that he is always with his servants and this is a bit confusing to those who do not comprehend what they read and and hear allah says in the ayah he knows all that goes into the earth and all that comes out of it all that descends from the skies and all that ascends to them he is with you wherever you may be now lots of the people have gone astray when they think that allah is with us physically and even physically quote unquote is not something that we attribute to allah so we do not confirm it nor deny it so people say does allah have a body it was never mentioned in the quran that allah has a body so allah is bodiless has no firm form has no image wait wait wait wait that also was not negated so what do you want us to believe well we have to look into what you intend by saying allah has a body or does not have a body if you mean that does allah have a physical presence that is surrounded by his creation that can be physically limited to this or that no allah does not have this at all but if you mean that allah azzawajal has hands has a face has fingers has his legs and in this i said yes allah has all of the those but he never described them as a body but we affirm that this is what allah has and these are his beautiful attributes now when we come to saying allah is everywhere and this is what some of the ashari's maturities say because they deny allah is established above the throne and they think that this is metaphorical so they say allah is everywhere and this is problematic because the ayah says that um he is with you wherever you may be and this peop those people took this and said okay he's with you so we ask them is that is allah azzawajal in the sense you guys are talking about everywhere in the dustbin in the toilet in the sewer system what kind of nonsense is this allah cannot be in such filthy thing places allah cannot be surrounded by any of his creation is greater than all so what are you guys saying they said well this is what the quran says he is with you wherever you are you may be being with you doesn't mean that he is physically there when we travel at night and it's full moon we may travel for five six hours and we say that we've been traveling and the moon is with us does it mean that he's with us in the cockpit in in in the car itself no it means that we see it and when allah is with us whenever we are you will always find that allah mentions in the beginning or in the end the knowledge and this is why in the end he says and allah sees all that you do is didn't you know that allah or didn't you see that allah knows and at the end of the ayah where wa and he's with you wherever you are allah says at the end of the same ayah it began with knowledge and it ended with knowledge so allah is with to all knowledgeable so he is with us in the sense that with his knowledge he sees all and hears all not only that and with his power and he controls all so he's actually with us because this is what being with you entails full control and full knowledge and definitely allah azza has both he tells us that he is always with his servants with his knowledge hearing and sight as he says in the quran he is with you wherever you may be in the case of the believers he is with them in all these respects as well as with his support and care so there is what is known in arabic a special uh companionship so allah is with everyone allah is with us wherever we are whether we muslims or non-muslims but for the believers he's with them in these respects with his support and care just like he said to moses and haroon aaron have no fear i shall be with you i hear all and see all so this is protection allah allah's will is complete and embraces everything whatever he wills is realized and whatever he does not will shall never take place we confirm this as he has stated without engaging in any further discussion so we believe in allah's divine will unlike rationalists who try to speak about impossibilities and combining what are manually contradictory let me read that again unlike rationalists who try to speak about impossibilities and combining what are mutually contradictory etc allah says he answered thus it is allah does what he wills but allah does whatever he wills lord of the throne the glorious he does whatever he wills many places allah azzawajal repeats describing himself to do whatever he pleases this is the definition of allah he does not answer to anyone he does not need to justify anything he owns everything in this universe if he were to throw all his creation in hell fire that would have been out of his justice and if you who if he were to admit them all to his paradise that would be out of his generosity so we are in between these two things his justice and his generosity we confirm all his names and attributes that are stated in his revelation and stop at that we accept them we do not deduct or cancel any and we do not add and increase to them any we also negate the negative qualities that reason indicates to be inapplicable to him even though they are not stated such as grief weeping hunger etc it was never mentioned in the quran or sunnah that allah does not feel hungry but these are logical negative attributes that much must be negated it was never mentioned that allah does not weep but this is a human deficiency that can allah can never have such a thing or a grief all of these are inappropriate though were not stated in detail that allah does not grieve allah does not weep allah does not this and that but we negate it because it is inappropriate disrespectful and can't be uh uh described can allah cannot be described by them and allah azzawajal knows uh best so we move on to the questions in the remaining time we have like 15 minutes uh sergio says can you answer which are the signs that someone has no iman can you tell me what are the signs that prove a person has no iman sergio this is a genetic question now eman as we've explained before can refer to something that is genetic which the opposite of it is disbelief kuffer so whenever you say what are the signs that a person has no iman i would tell you all the things that nullify islam so one of them is sufficient if a person mocks the quran or allah or the prophet or the rituals of islam makes fun of it he's a kafka no iman if a person deals with sorcery in black magic and worships the jinn and asks them to tell him the future he's a kafir there's no imac and the list goes on you can revise series number 8 9 10 11 these four episodes of our book and you will find that we mentioned the things that notifies islam but when you talk about the branches of iman which when one of them is not found it does not invalidate the fully man rather it reduces it there are many so we know that the prophet said four characteristics if a person has them all he's a pure hypocrite and if he has one of them he has a branch of hypocrisy and the prophet mentioned us a number of them even in different hadiths lying breaking your promise not fulfilling your pledges you can go on so all of these are signs that iman is diminishing it's getting less and less until a person is a full-fledged hypocrite and in this case we say that he has no iman at all and allah azzawajal knows best masuma says i'm your regular listener and your answers satisfy me alhamdulillah but i have a question regarding eating or receiving gift in form of food from non-muslims on christmas diwali etc you said it's permissible to eat if they send you so then please clear that then nazar niyaz or or from any dargah graveyard you are participating in it if someone sends then can we eat that food i hope i explain it properly hope insha allah you answer my question first of all i never said that it is permissible to participate in such haram gatherings whether muslims or non-muslims it is totally prohibited to attend the maulit of the prophet saw or uh quran or a diwali or uh the shabby barat or and the likes all of these are totally prohibited for you to attend now the confusion masuma has is with the food if it comes from a place where shirk is committed or at least innovation how is it possible that i eat and consume this food diwali is a hindu festival so they send us sweets and we know that these sweets were placed in front of their gods and they recited their prayers on it now they're giving it to us i'll make this as easy as possible inshaallah let us assume that this is an apple if i take this apple and i place it in front of buddha and all the buddhists say their prayers and i don't know what that is but i mean this is their prayer and they do this for half an hour or an hour or a full day then they take this apple no pun intended this is apple so happens they take this apple and they give it to me can i eat it or not you would probably answer without thinking by saying yes you should not eat from it because it was given to the gods of the disbelievers i said i understand but is this apple turning into something haram is it nejis no is it something that i have to throw in the dustbin or it's still an apple that allah azzawajal sent the rain to the tree so that it grows up and i can get it all foods in islam is halal whether it's coming from the disbelievers idol worshipers christians shoes atheists the food itself is halal except animals that need to be slaughtered living creatures other than sea creatures no we're talking about land creatures land animals here we're told uh you muslims cannot eat from that meat unless it is one slaughtered two the person slaughtering has to be either a jew christian or a muslim and one other condition that we don't know of that you have to be certain that they did not mention any other than allah's name so if you heard them mention the name of allah other than allah it's haram done okay done understood therefore the candies the sweet they send us as long as it is halal in itself there is no non-veg ingredients in it there are there are no harmful things in it even if they decide their prayers a thousand years it remains halal to eat what is haram is for us to participate in their gatherings or to give them in their festivals a gift this is totally how and the fourth caliph the companion of the prophet the husband of his daughter fatima may allah be pleased with them all he himself was given a plate of sweets and it's called faludas from the fire worshipers on their neiru's festival so not they're not even jews or christians but it's sweets it's though sugar nuts etc so he ate from it and he liked it and he said whenever you guys have something like this send it over which means that the food itself does not turn into haram if it was prepared for a haram event unless it is non-veg it has to be slaughtered for the sake of allah if it's slaughtered for their idols or for the grave's sake it becomes haram and i hope this answers your question and um yeah we'll still have some time left so duruta says i want to ask about hijab hijab is obligatory for women is it please explain i'd like my daughter not to have any doubts about hijab i'm wearing hijab and i am about 15 years a muslim make you steadfast on islam there is no doubt none whatsoever that hijab is mandatory he is mentioned in the quran in suratul and in surat and it's mentioned in the authentic sunnah of the prophet alaihis wasalam and it is the consensus of all scholars of islam that it is mandatory upon women to wear the hijab they differ so they all agree that a woman must cover her whole body from head to toe with an outer garment that does not expose her bone structure her body curves it does not show what's underneath it because it's not transparent and it's not tight and it's not flashy drawing people's attention to it among other it doesn't resemble the disbelievers attire among other conditions the difference of opinion is whether nikab there is the covering of the face to the with the exception of the eyes is mandatory or not and it's an issue of dispute i believe that it is mandatory but this is up to the individual's preference and you're asking about the hijab we believe that nikab is part of the hijab as it covers the most beautiful thing in a woman and that is her face and allah knows best fz tim says is it permissible that we women pray and obligatory before obligatory prayer before the ipam what fz tim is asking about is a misconception especially in the subcontinent when women in their homes do not offer their fault prayer until the iqamah is called in the adjacent masjid so let's assume it's isha prayer the adhan is called at eight o'clock and at 8 15 the iqamah is given in the masjid where the congregation will pray in the subcontinent on some other countries among the muslims they have this conception that women must not pray between 8 and 8 15. and this is totally baseless and is not related to islam women children elderly sick people people who are not praying in the masjid the prayer is due as soon as the time enters so as soon as eight o'clock that's an example is due and it's time for isha they all can pray even if the that is not given for one reason or the other if the electricity is cut off or the immune is home eating his biryani and late for adhan and nobody else to give the adhan or to open the masjid so now it's eight five eight seven the then was called seven minutes ago there's no problem at all at eight o'clock sharp for you as a female to pray uh your isha prayer allah knows best last question of today abdelkader says is it allowed to do bike insurance because in london bikes are always stolen it is a great loss for the owner insurance as we've repeated before many times is a form of gambling you pay 200 quid 200 pounds to ensure your 3 000 pounds motorcycle a whole year could pass nothing happens your 200 goes down the drain someone steals your motorbike once twice three times and every time the insurance company compensates you with a new brand new 3 000 pound bike is this halan the answer is no this is gambling it's like buying a lottery ticket you may lose a pound and you may win a hundred thousand and hit the jackpot now this is the same with life insurance medical insurance property insurance and car insurance however if the government the authorities impose this mandate this fine those who do not take such insurance in this case out of necessity it is permissible for you to apply for such a policy and if the bike was stolen and they provide you with one no problem availing uh what they had given you because you were forced to give them and pay them and not of your own will and allah knows best and with this we come to the conclusion of our episode until we meet next month [Music]"
