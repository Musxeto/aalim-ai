  "title": "Imam says to Read Surah Ikhlas & Read Quran during Burial? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "And the second question is that during the burial if someone die, then people during the burial people will try to recite Surah Al-Ikhlas maybe seven times, they try to read the Quran during the burial, I have witnessed this, someone say no this is not the Sunnah of the Prophet, we have to ask Allah to give him. It was a big fight, the Imam say we have to pray for him, we have to read the Quran for the disease during the burial. Second question, when we are doing the burial they say you have to recite Surah Al-Ikhlas a number of times and read the Quran and this and the Imam says this is what we should do, do you have any report that the Prophet did this Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, oh Imam, he said no but this is a good thing, we read the Quran, there is nothing bad about it. Do you know more than the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam again? This is an innovation, the Prophet when he Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam finished burying his companion, he said to his companions who were around the grave, ask Allah Azza Wa Jal for forgiveness for your brother and ask Allah to make him steadfast because now he's being questioned. No Quran, no Hadith, no Ikhlas, nothing. So if the Prophet did not tell them to recite such Surahs, do you know more? This is weird man, so this is the beauty of Islam, you don't need someone to come and give you a seal of approval. All what you need is to open the Quran, open the books of Sunnah, find the way, whether it is the way of the Prophet or not, and then you have your answer. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
