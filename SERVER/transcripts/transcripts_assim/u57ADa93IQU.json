  "transcript": "Brother Dawood from the US. I do like car detailing and I go clean someone's car that I know he makes his money from haram money and he pays me. Is it going to be haram for me or not? So you have a garage or a shop where you detail cars and someone comes to you with his Ferrari Roma and says I'd like you to detail it and put spoilers and mufflers and the likes but his income is haram? Is this your question? Yeah, but I go to his house and I'm like I only do car detailing, not like muffler and yeah. First of all, generally speaking, if I am providing a halal service, the income of the person who's buying or getting the service from me is none of my business. Otherwise if I have a supermarket and someone comes to me to buy a bottle of water, would it be logical asking him, what's your income? What is your IRS statement? Where are you doing this? What are you doing in your life? Of course not. So whether their income is totally haram, meaning they work in insurance, they work for a conventional bank, they deal in entertainment, they sell tobacco or intoxicants, they have a bar or a nightclub, this is on them. The service I'm providing is not related to their sin. I'm selling them water, I'm detailing cars, I am a tailor making suits and the likes. There's nothing wrong in that insha'Allah because it's not related to their sin. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
