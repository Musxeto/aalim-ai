  "title": "Why is covering feet for women mandatory in prayer when hadith of Umm Salama is weak assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign [Music] that is long enough to cover her feet and this Hadith is graded daive malpur by albani Mela have mercy on him too and I personally believe that covering feet while praying for women is mandatory but sometimes people come and ask me why are you doing this then when I say them that this is mandatory by some yeah sorry this is mandatory and I show this Hadith they say that this is daive and they don't believe me now I wanna know why we believe that this is mandatory when the Hadith is weak is this the only Hadith you know of yeah okay uh let me check because I am not a halfers who can memorize these um the issue of covering the feet in Salat is an issue of dispute the hanafi school of thought and some Scholars say that it is not mandatory the majority say that it is mandatory to cover the feet and this is Aura according to the malikis and the chef is and this is the school of thought of hanabila that they chose and some of the hanafi school of thought now whether the Hadith you're referring to is authentic or not I don't know because I have to check the authenticity of it and what the scholars have graded it by but definitely it is not the only Hadith for example the Hadith and which all agree that when a woman reaches puberty in Salat she has to cover everything except the face and the hands the feet are not mentioned and they the vast majority of Scholars agree upon this so when we come to such verdicts of schools of thought and we don't have the time to check for hadiths or references having it as the vast majority is sufficient nevertheless if you have time you have to go and scroll and look and search and you will find evidences that instruct women to cover insulat and outside of the Salat because if you say that a woman's feet are not to be covered what we notice today in the Haram we see this we see women walking with their shin exposed not only their feet so is it only the foot itself to the ankles or some of part of the leg as well we see women not paying attention not caring insulat or outside of the Salat this is why we say that we have to go and choose what is safer for a person whenever and this is a side note whenever we talk about covering the face is the face hour or not we say to them look around you countries that used to cover the face had no problem with Fitness showing the hair showing the neck showing the arms because the moment a strand of hair appeared everybody said cover cover this is Haram this is this and that while countries that had only the face covered felt tempted to show a little bit of the hair the resistance is far less than when the full body is covered and little by little this is what's happening now in Muslim countries women now in even conservative countries don't care about covering their hair their necks their part of their chest their arms they're adorning themselves makeup is this Islam nobody dares to say no it's not Islam but at the same time everybody's doing it so this is why Islam surrounds the areas of Haram with lots of high fences if you pass one you'll find another one and the third and the fourth but if all defenses are down then everything is exposed and you fell into the hardcore Haram which Allah prohibited Knows Best"
