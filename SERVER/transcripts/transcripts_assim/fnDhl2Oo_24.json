  "transcript": "ahmed from the uk says now i have a problem i have this eczema on my limbs my face my heels my foot my arms and i have to put a special cream so what to do some scholars say that you have to combine so he says what's the reference for that well if you were to study the books of you will find a number of evidences for that and one of the most famous hadith is sahibu shaja the man who had an injury in his head so they were at an expedition and the man had a blow to his head which caused him to bleed and he wrapped it so that it stops the bleeding and he was suffering and fajr time comes the man wakes up injured in battle and he finds that he had nocturnal emission or what they call wet dream so he asked his companions what should i do if i perform russell i think i'm gonna harm myself and the wound may suffer and i would suffer because of that and they said to him you have no other alternative you have to perform muscle to uplift your major ritual impurity so he did so and he died and hadith says that the prophet salallahu salaam said allah they've killed him may allah killed him killed them wouldn't they have asked because the knowledge can erase the ignorance of the ignorance if they did not know ask and you will not be an ignorant and in some narrations but these are weak some of them authenticated that he should have performed russell but skipped the area and white over it so there is one way of doing it that if i have a blaster on my hand i perform normal wudu if i cannot remove the blaster or the cast then i just wipe over it sufficient what about if the person is unable to wipe over it as in the case of creams or in the case of severe burns so a person gets may allah protect us all of us from hell fire gets severe burns on his arm so he can wash his right arm face wipe his head wash his feet but what to do with the left arm so scholars here say that he cannot wipe over it there are no bandages over it so they said that for not washing his limb he performs tayammum so why not perform them from the beginning yeah but he can wash the rest of the body so this was left due to a reason so scholars say that yes it is possible to combine between wudu and taehyung in such cases where you are unable to wipe over it and allah azza knows nozbe"
