How can I help you? I want to ask that what are the Sunnah Adhqar after the Nawafil prayers like Tahajjud and like Tahajjud and Salatul Duha? As for the Sunnah prayers, there are no Adhqar to be said after it. Subhanal Malikil Quddus, Subhanal Malikil Quddus, Subhanal Malikil Quddus, prolonging it in the third time. This is the only Adhqar mentioned to us as far as I know and Allah knows best."
