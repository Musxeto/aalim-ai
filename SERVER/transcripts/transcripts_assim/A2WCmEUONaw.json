  "transcript": "sri lanka says i work in a mixed bank that has islamic windows and none and conventional transactions which is ribba-based so what do you advise me if you work for both then you have to leave the job if you're working in a department that only deals with halal transactions has nothing to do with the riba based transactions as in the case of a bank trying to separate and split their transactions to be islamic and non-islamic and a number of banks are doing so to the extent that even if they have their offices in the building of the conventional bank that they belong to they pay rent annually to the conventional banks so that their income would be totally separated and segregated from the income and transactions of the back if this is the case and you are aiming to establish an islamic transaction department or bank or branch then this is permissible but if you are doing both jobs so someone comes to you said i need to do muraba so okay here's the form and you help him through and someone else says i need a hundred thousand dollars um loan how much interest are you going to charge me for i said okay we're going to charge you this and that no this is totally prohibited and you have to quit"
