  "transcript": "uh there's another question from the sisters she's asking is a charge for someone to say that they're going to spend their time working for and spend most of their time in the MK and other religious related activities it see and Allah will give give them risk no this is not acceptable Allah ordered us to work in order to get risk if you sit in the Masjid with a prayer beads 1,000 beads and you just sit here all day long saying like my GMC car 1994 I used to have a a beautiful car big suburban and you put the ignition on I used to think that Mah is wa what a car but would Allah give you risk no when the prophet s wasallam was in an expedition and there were two brothers one sitting worshiping Allah making Vick and the other one is working and feeding his brother the prophet said he is more rewarded than the one sitting for vicker it is totally against Islam to sit in the Masjid and beg people for food or for help because you will be then the lower hand and in Islam the upper hand is better than the lower hand the upper hand is the one that gives that helps that contributes to the community so if the sister is referring to someone who instead of working and striving to feed his family depends on sakat on charity on people giving him giveaways no this is not right"
