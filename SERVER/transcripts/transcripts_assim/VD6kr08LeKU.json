  "transcript": "ald the prophet sallallah alai wasam said in an authentic Hadith I declare before Allah that I have no and that is a close friend from among you for Allah has taken me as a as he took ibraim peace be upon him as a but if I were to have taken anyone from among you my um as a KH I would have taken Abu Bak as a may Allah be pleased with him now if you look at this Hadith it tells you that the prophet did not have a close friend therefore we should drop the lecture by saying the prophet as a friend he did not have close friends but we have enough time to invest so that we'd rather go on trying to beat around the bush the prophet could not have a close friend a because the meaning of is the Friendship the strong close love and friendship that goes and intermingles with your heart and leaves no space for anyone else and that is why it's a a common mistake when people say that the prophet is and ibim is so they differentiate between our Prophet Muhammad and our prophet ibraim and they say that Muhammad is Hab the beloved one to Allah where ibraim is the of Allah or the close friend of Allah and this is wrong this Hadith indicates clearly that the Prophet sallah alaih wasallam was the of Allah and if you say he is you're degrading him this is a lower level the highest is so if the prophet was not a close friend to any of his companions then what are we doing here we have to look at the prophet Alam from our perspective not from his is he did not have any close friends among his companions but they all had him as the closest friend to themselves and ibraim and this is something that we have to know Allah took him as a as a very close friend but when Allah blessed ibraim with a child and that is is peace be upon him he was about 80 years old and when you're 80 and you don't have any children and all of a sudden you get a child of your own and you see him grow up how would you feel towards this child and this child is a messenger himself he's not any Tom Dick or Harry you know this is is he's the messenger of Allah he's the grand great grandfather of prophet Alat what kind of a man was he so he grew up until he was 13 14 years of age when Allah sensed that ibrahim's love to is is not sufficient for a as a KH you cannot love anyone else more than Allah now ibraim there is room in your heart for is Allah does not accept people associating others with him how is it with the of Allah and that is why Allah the almighty instructed ibraim to do what to slaughter his son and that was not a revelation by jiel it was a dream so even Satan if he wanted to intervene he would have convinced him that this is a dream maybe you had some something you know heavy before going to bed so don't look into this no he knows that the dreams of Messengers are a revelation he went to his son and he said my son I seen the dream that I'm slaughtering you so what do you think he's not asking for his opinion he's informing him but he's trying to make it easy on him that young child that young boy what did he say my father do as you are commanded Subhan Allah if we just take this sentence and apply it in our lives are we doing what we commanded if your son comes to you father you have to pray in the Masjid father you have to obey your parents my grandfather and my grandmother father you have to be kind to my mother father you must not eat riba interest you must not deal in Haram you must not lie this is not from your son this is from Allah do what you're commanded and the minute he submitted Allah sent the sacrifice to sacrifice or to substitute the slaughtering of is and now he's back to becoming the so the prophet did not have any KH peace be upon him sallallah wasam but what did he have well the compan I of themselves had him as their and in so many narrations when you read in the Sunnah you would find for example abuur may Allah be pleased with him would say my or instructed me to do this and that as well he would say my would tell me to do this and not to do that which meant that the love the companions had to the prophet what was at its Optimum but he did not have them as their close as his close friends okay what relation was it for them to him it was a relation of Brotherhood and a relation of companionship that's it from the prophet to his companions and the close friendship in this life can only be with the Believers with the true brothers and the true companions because in the day of judgment this friendship would turn into enmity unless it is for the sake of Allah Allah the almighty says in the Quran friends on that day that is the day of judgment will be foes one to another except or these are the pious uh uh people people and Brotherhood in Islam has a great role and importance the prophet Alat wasam told us in the Hadith that he has brothers and he has companions in the Hadith when he came to a graveyard sallallahu alaihi wasallam said peace be upon you the neighborhood of Believers he's speaking to the dead he's offering them Salam and [Music] supplication and with the grace of Allah with the will of Allah we will soon follow and this is everyone's Target that you're going to die and this is positive so if I know that I'm going to die I'm going to sin less and I'm going to do what I'm commanded to do more but you have to understand that you're going to die you're going to leave the wife you're going to leave the children you're going to leave the house you're going to leave the car you're going to leave your bank account so do as much as you can to be ready to meet your maker subhanahu wa'ta'ala because he'll hel hold you accountable for every single thing you did or say the prophet said afterwards I wish I had seen my brothers so the companions said oh prophet of Allah aren't we your brothers so the prophet said no you are my companions but my brothers are those who did not come yet then this means that inshallah all of us are his brothers as this Hadith clearly states but do we feel this Brotherhood towards him sallallahu alai wasallam do do we feel the love in our hearts towards him which is expressed not by throwing a mid every now and then it's it is not expressed by saying supplications or offering duas orar that are baseless showing your love to him sallallahu alaihi wasallam is displayed by following his Sunnah in every single detail he did this I'll do it how was he with his wives he was great um this is difficult I'm not going to skip I'll pass how was he with his exterior uh uh appearance external appearance he was this he was that it's difficult I can't live like this how was he in his prayer he used to pray five times in the Masjid I have many reasons and excuse is not to do this then where is your love to the prophet oh I love him dearly and I love him deeply okay prove it inshallah inshallah I will so this is a big problem the prophet Alam hoped and wished that he meet us so when he does try your best to be fit for such a meeting the prophet said the most people of my umah who love me are those who come after me but each one of them would have wished to sacrifice his self his wealth and his family his children just only to see me do you want to see the prophet Alat do you love the prophet have you seen the prophet Alam no one of the students came once to his Sheikh and said she I love the prophet so much but I still can't see him in my dreams and we know that if you see the prophet Alam in your dream then you have seen him truly but this is a misconception that a lot of the Muslims have they come to me and say sheh I I saw the prophet in my dreams I was so happy Mas there was light there was Thunder there was rain masallah I was in Birmingham mashallah good good that's the dream is okay can you describe the prophet wasam I no I can't I saw light other one comes and says yes yes I can describe him as if I can see him he was you know uh 4 10 and and he had you know eyes of Chinese eyes and and and and his color was yellow or so he was thin and masallah he was wearing Kung Fu outfit the other one says no he was like 6'4 like the basketball players he was black you know was curly hair and he was broad shoulders and you know muscular the third fourth one says no he was like this have they seen the prophet Alam no Scholars say that for you to see the prophet Alam in your dream you have to be able to describe him as his description he was not tall he was not short he was not uh uh dark he was white with with with redness in his face his eyes were wide his hair was like this he wasn't fat he was not thin and so on so this is or this is where when you will see the prophet so this student goes to his sheh and says she I'd like to see the prophet but I'm not able to do this I love him so much so the sh tells him okay stay the night over at my house inshallah uh uh we will see what we can do and he stays with his Sheikh and the Sheikh presents him with dinner and he puts all the spices and all the salt you can imagine in that dinner it's like you know the Indian or Pakistani food mashallah they put so much spices as if they want to torture you and I've tried it this year and mashallah yeah the guy in the unit is eating and eating and eating he sweating and eyes is red getting red and he says sh can I drink water he said inshallah just finish up after dessert and then he brought the desserts and the guy had the desserts and the guy is you know shoking out of thirst can I have water in inah and after half an hour they said let's let's go to bed he said can I have water said well we're unable to get water inshallah after F so he wakes up after before fuder he prays night prayer and he's he wants water to drink is unable to do this they go to uh Salat they come back from from fjer prayer and then he asks him the Sheikh what did you see in your dream last night he said oh I saw Rivers rain Lakes wo water all around as if I was in a submarine he said mashallah your thirst was sincere that why your dream reflected that and if your love to the prophet Alat wasam was sincere it would have reflected in your dreams as well so when you want to see the prophet Alam your love should be sincere and you will see him sallallahu alaihi wasallam companionship there are levels of companionships and that is why the prophet Alam had levels of companions they were they were not all in the same level and that is why the prophet because of his character he did not show people how different they were so whenever he met anyone he would meet them in a very nice manner to the extent that they thought that they were the Beloved people of oh to the Prophet this is this was his character he wouldn't meet Abu Bakr in a way and then meet someone else in another way may Allah be pleased with them all he would meet them all in the same fashion and show them the same love and respect he's one of the companions who whose Islam was quite late it was approximately an on the eth year of Hijra which meant that only two years he was with the prophet Alam he says never ever I met the prophet Alam without seeing him smile in my face whenever he sees him he smile and this shows you how friendly the prophet Alam was with everybody I know a lot of not a lot this is understatement erase this if you can I know some shakes who are so vicious you know when you meet them I just what do you want yeah it's so bad why why are you doing this the prophet used to treat everyone with a big smile with a friendly Soul that's why we love him and we miss him sallallahu alaihi wasallam this is what J says may Allah be pleased with him another Hadith who was a fierce enemy of Islam who even went to ABIA to try and talk the Nashi out of accommodating the Muslims who migrated to abasia to that extent he was a fierce enemy of Islam once he embraced Islam and accepted Islam this was also before the e8th year of of Hijra very close to Alat so his time was very limited with the prophet Alam he was one of the smartest Arabs around he was you know uh someone with strategy iic planning and he was good at it and he says that whenever I went to the prophet Alam the prophet welcomed me he smiled in my face until something came to me and said listen I think that you are the most beloved companion to the prophet let me check this out so I went I said oh prophet of Allah who is the most beloved person to your heart he's asking this question and anticipating the answer to be you so who is the most beloved companion to your heart oh prophet of Allah so the prophet says said well wrong the gender okay no no I did not mean from women I'm I'm talking about men the prophet said her father that is Abu Bakr so I said okay I know I I I got the wrong number so the prophet dealt with everyone with ease and love to the extent that they thought that they were the closest friends to the prophet Alat wasam and this we have to underline how do we treat our brothers how do we treat our wives our children why is it that we have two faces or some of us inshallah none of us but why do some Muslims have two faces when they meet their friends mallah the smile is from here to here it's cosmatic surgery I don't know how you can do this but this is the case they're so happy they're joyful they're having fun and the minute they enter the house it's a grim face serious face why did you do this why did you do that cursing the boys cursing the girls shouting at the woman why is this is this Islamic and the problem triples or quadruples when this person is practicing mashallah the beard is long the thob is short and the mwak is all the time and he's praying he's attending lectures attending talks spending weekends in different cities if this does not reflect on your behavior with your wife and children you're doomed because you're almost a hypocrite it has to reflect on how you treat your neighbors how you treat your co-workers how you treat everyone else because it's not the exterior that counts it's part of what counts but what counts most is your behavior is your conduct and this we can see in the prophet's behavior sallallahu alaihi wasallam and to illustrate more the levels of the companionship what do you think of KH a great companion is he what was he nickname The Sword of Allah sa amen imagine someone with such a nickname and the prophet Alam used to love him because he's a great warrior and a great leader so he was a close companion but look when he disputed once and argued once with ABD rman and who's abdan one of the 10 heavenbound so now this is far superior to KH but to us they're great Companions of of of the prophet and there shouldn't be so much so much difference once they disputed and argued the prophet Alam got angry and he spoke to khed and he said may Allah be uh uh peace and blessing be upon him he said do not curse my companions he's talking to do not curse my companions by Allah if one of you and he's talking to KH again if one of you spends the weight of Mount UD in Gold how much would that be a lot it would be even enough to buy the center next door with the parking area inshallah you will be able to div buy this inshallah if one spends Mount ud's weight in gold it would not be equivalent to one of their mud that is his companions or half of it what is a mud what is a mud one or two it's what you can carry in both Palms of your hands this is called Mud and when you want to perform woodo the prophet used to perform wo with one mud imagine it would be almost less than a cup of water small plastic cup this is the wood of the Prophet Alam one mood or half of it so whatever ABD and his companions spend with one hand is equals Mount UD of gold from KH then what would we be considered to have equivalent to that in our times whole of Europe in gold and no wonder those who are astray curse the companions of the Prophet Alam and this brings to your attention that whoever talks negatively about one of the companions of the Prophet then he is a hypocrite and he's not a True Believer Brotherhood has rights it's not something that I say that W is my brother abdah is my brother Muhammad is my brother Brotherhood has right rights and everything has rights your wife has rights your neighbors have rights and if we take care of these rights and do our obligations everything goes in according to plan but when we when I ask for my rights I'd like my rights for my wife okay what about my obligation towards her I let her go to hell then the the balance is not correct and the the bird does not fly with One Wing at all and what are what are some of these rights Abu tells us may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet said that there are six rights for a Muslim over his brother Muslim and what are they the prophet says if you meet him give him Salam and if he invites you attend his invitation and if he asks you for advice advise him and if he sneezes and says alhamdulillah you should say and if he falls sick or ill you should visit him and if he dies you should follow his funeral this is the right of a Muslim over a Muslim these are the rights of a Muslim over a muslim okay was the prophet Alam doing these rights to his companions definitely if he if you meet meet him give him Salam the prophet Alam used to give his companions Salam he used to pass by children and he used to give them Salam how would the children perceive a person an old person when he comes and gives them Salam with respect and love but when you pass by the children and give them you know an angry look or frightening them who why are you doing this why are you doing this you're not supposed to do this you're supposed to make them respect you and love you so you have to spread Salam and they would respect the elderly they would respect those who are practicing who look like real true Muslims this is what the prophet used to doam and he used to always give Salam to their friends before they give him whenever he could but definitely they would always race to give him his respect am the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam again if he invites you attend his invitation how was the prophet was with this so many places in the Sunnah you would find people inviting the prophet and he would answer their invitation and this is because of his humbleness a lot of us have this arrogance in them when they they're invited they apologize no I can't I have engagement I have recording I have this I have that the prophet was not like thisam he says about himself if I were invited to a meal of a sheep's foot what would you find in a sheep's heave or foot of meat would you find any meat nothing but the prophet says if I were invited to a meal of a sheep's foot I would accept and if I were given a sheep's foot as a gift I would accept would you find people resenting your gifts to them do you find these people when you give them something they look at it yeah would you find people like this the prophet was not like this whatever people gave him as a gift he would accept it and he would pray for them not like the arrogant people who look down at you because the gift is not suitable for them this is not a muslim's doing the prophet says if he sneezes and says alhamdulillah then uh also say and before I go to that do you remember any time the prophet was invited and attended do you have any recollection of this in a Hadith no I'll give you I I'll remind you was he invited ever by a Jew to what what was the food what's what was the menu no they didn't have it at the time what what was the menu a Jew woman invited him and he attended and he accepted but what was in that sheep poison yet the prophet did not say ah she's a Jew ah Jew I will not attend an invitation by a Jew and she's presenting me with a sheep is this Halal or is it from McDonald was it slaughtered no no the prophet went and ateam and we should learn from this attending people's invitation for the sake of Allah as the prophet used to do do am the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam uh it it goes oh we we jumped into the sneezing bit uh before that the prophet says and if he invites you attend his invitation and if he asks you for advice advise him did the prophet give advice to his companions Alam he fulfilled that whenever someone says to him as in thei ofi oh prophet of Allah advise me but be brief look at this request of the companion advise me but be brief he doesn't want a lot of words that make him forget he wants something to to the point and the prophet told himam whenever you stand for prayer Pray as if you are bidding farewell and to the to the rest of the Hadith a lot of the people come to the prophet say advise me the prophet says do not get angry and he says okay advise me again do not get angry do not get angry do not get angry another one comes and says advise me the prophet says weep over your sins and let your house be sufficient for you to stay in instead of mingling with people Etc a fourth one fifth one a 10th one come and say advise me and the prophet Alam give them a proper advice if you want my companionship in Paradise you have to prostrate as much as you can meaning you have to offer Salah as much as you can the other one tells him you have to uh always remember Allah and your tongue is always uh uh running with Allah's mentioning Etc so he used to advise his people and they used to seek his advice to the extent that at the end of his time he was overwhelmed mother AA may Allah be pleased with her tells us that he would not pray sitting down until the people overwhelmed him they had so many questions the many problems to solve to the extent that when he went back home at night he was so tired he could not pray standing up so he used to pray sitting down sallallahu alaih wasallam because of people's questions and from this we learn what a lot of the Muslims do which is wrong when they pray M healthy people mallah after they pray M they pray the sitting down what are you doing said this is Sunnah this is not Sunnah yes the prophet prayed sitting down he prayed sitting down when he was old and night prayer because he was unable but you're fit masallah so no no this is Sunnah this is wrong this is not part of the Sunnah um sneezing what is the ruling when someone sneezes in a room where there are 15 people inside the room what's the ruling on sneezing the other 14 will say get him out of the room we don't want to catch cold no I'm talking about Islamic ruling do we say yes no we don't unless he says alhamdulillah if he doesn't we do not say it the prophet Alam had two people in his Gathering once both sneezed one said alhamdulillah so he said the other one did not so he did not say anything so the man complained prophet of Allah you supplicated you make Dua for him this is Dua from the Prophet this means that Allah will forgive my sins why didn't you say it to me he said he gave or said alhamdulillah and you didn't so the ruling is when someone sneezes and says alhamdulillah in a room where there are 15 people how many people should say all of them all of them that's true all of them each and everyone who heard him say alhamdulillah it's mandatory upon them to say but it's different for from giving Salam if someone enters a room with 15 let let it be 13 15 is let it be with 13 people in the room and he says if one of them says it's enough the rest are not obliged to say this as for visiting the sick the prophet Alat used to do this whenever he heard of some of his companions is ill he used to visit him not only that he used to visit even non-muslims in theah or in in the authentic Hadith the prophet had a neighbor who was a young Jew a boy and he got sick so the prophet went to visit him because he was ill and he spoke to the boy and said accept Islam it's very short very straight to the point not sugarcoated accept Islam and the boy looked at his father the Jew and his father said obey abim obey him so the boy accepted Islam and the prophet went out of his house with his face sparkling and glowing Al wasallam he said alhamdulillah who guided him and saved him from Hellfire because of me he used to visit non-muslims as well now these should be underlined how we treat the non-muslims it's not like a lot of people say we can do this and we can do that we can attack them we can uh uh uh slunder them we can spit in their faces break their windows and why you have to coexist you have to live and above all you have to treat them as the prophet used to treat them the prophet used to visit for example may Allah be pleased with him when he got sick and he thought that he was dying in the famous Hadith of uh giving a will before you die and how much we allowed to give a will what's the percentage half 1/3 so this of course all of you have your your Wills ready and written right or you don't have anything to anyhow you have to have your will ready because you do not know when you will die and the prophet said as in the may Allah be pleased with him and and with his father that your will should be ready and it is not permissible or lawful to have three days pass without having your will updated and ready also in the Hadith where may Allah pleased with him who was injured in the battle of the trench and he died a month afterwards the prophet visited him with Abu Bakr and Omar and they were all weeping except the prophet Alam and used to uh uh uh hold his his beard whenever he was uh emotionally involved with such tragic uh uh incidents following a funeral when a when a Muslim dies you should follow the funeral is it rewardable definitely what is the reward for praying the funeral prayer whoever does this would have aat what is aat a carrot not Bugs Bunny's carrot no it's a carrot carrot of gold is it come on you have to know what is a carrot the prophet said the equivalent of Mount in Good Deeds if you only pray over a funeral and if you follow the funeral until the man is buried you will have another carrot so two for this simple task but it has magnificent effect on your heart because today you're carrying the dead body tomorrow people will be carrying carrying you the prophet Alat also told us that part of his companionships and part of our companionship that when you love someone of course of the same gender huh when you love someone tell them that you love them I maybe they did not hear this you have to this has to only to be to the same gender you don't go and see your neighbor a girl and say listen I love you for the sake of Allah no this is only for the same gender so you love someone you see someone and you love them you have to ident notify them because this grows the bond between you as brothers in Islam so did the prophet do this definitely he used to go to all of his compan Companions and say I love you for the sake of Allah and imagine the impact on the companion the prophet as M may Allah be pleased with him tells us he said the prophet was walking once and he was holding my hand we do this a lot in Arabia I haven't tried it here but I I think that it's a culture you know men kiss each other in Arabia on the cheek that is so it's it's normal it's a culture so the prophet was holding mu jael's Hand by Allah if he was holding my hand I would never let go but he was holding his hand and he was walking with him and he said mu by Allah I love you and then he followed this with an with an advice and he says shouldn't I teach you words that you should say at the end of every prayer and mad said yes so so the prophet taught himam say Allah oh Allah support me and give me help to remember you and to thank you and to worship you as you wish and we say this every single prayer before we conclude the prayer before we offer the Salam we conclude this by saying some Scholars say you say it after Sal but the most authentic opinion that it is to be said before the end of the prayer the prophet alam's Brotherhood and companionship was displayed in spending his time his health his wealth and his reputation in helping people he in helping his companions without any uh uh return there was a woman by the name of bar she was a slave girl and she came to and may Allah be pleased with her requesting her assistance in paying off her price because she was a slave she had a a deal with her owner listen I'll give you 10,000 quid and you let me free said okay if you if you pay me this much by calculation with inflation with economical crunch okay does the job so she went to AA and AA gave her the money and he freed her now she's free but she had a husband his name was was and M may Allah be pleased with him was a slave as well but when a woman a slave woman is freed she has her choice whether to stay married to this slave and she's a free woman or she can seek separation and the husband has nothing to do with it because it's a different level Al together so she chose to let go she wants her Freedom she wants to she's a free woman she wants to be a free woman not the wife of a slave and M was devastated he had so much love for her he didn't know what to do so what do you expect him to do he went to the prophet Alat his beloved companion his beloved KH asking him for intervention so the prophet went to B and said why not stay with why not stay with him as a husband and look at the beautiful answer of this wise woman she said prophet of Allah are you instructing me what does that mean if it's an instruction it's done I will comply so the prophet said no I'm not I'm not ordering you I'm just trying to give advice kidding me going I do this uh and and when the prophet said no I'm not commanding you she said I have nothing to do with him I don't want him and the the story says that they used to see walking in the market M walking behind her with his tears wetting his beard of Love of uh uh to his uh uh wife the prophet used to advise the Companions and this is part of the Brotherhood and the companionship a Woman by the name of FMA comes to the prophet Alam and she says that there are two men who are proposing to me muah ab sufyan and Abu J so who which one should I accept and this is very wise and the time does not permit but you have to ask for those who are proposing to your W to raise this who are proposing to your sister or your daughter a lot of the Muslims the minute he sees someone proposing mashallah yes I accept and after a week he discovers catastrophes you have to make a check he's marrying your daughter he's marrying your uh uh sister check in the Masid check in the workplace check check his ethics his behavior his background this isn't a business deal that you you know just touch and go no it's something that is far serious so she goes to the prophet ask him for advice he tells her well mua is broke he's got no money he's not good and Abu jaham he's a harsh man he never puts the stick over his shoulder meaning he's always carrying the sck or whatever whatever you say he does this so you don't want this but marry us and US was the son of the adopted to be son of the prophet and she married him and mashallah she tells us about herself it was the perfect marriage she was so happy with him um the prophet used to socialize with his friends with his companions and this is part of his character as a friend as a beloved friend Sak says I asked jabb Sam may Allah be pleased with him did you use to sit with the prophet definitely yes so what were your sitting with him was like he said every time we used to pray f with the prophet he used to sit with us and after prayer we used to talk about things that took place in Jah in pre-islam time what do you think these things would do ah you remember when we uh uh conquered that tribe next to us we came at you know after midnight they were sleep and we killed them and they start laughing and we did this and we did that and we sold and we uh uh all of the things in the Jah pre-islam and they used to say things that were funny and the prophet would smile to them now he was not what we do monitoring everybody's shortcomings ah drink with your right ah don't do this sit sit tight don't wear this don't do that why you laughing why you crying what some of us are like this you know some of the fathers some of the brothers every negative thing they see don't you see anything positive why don't you say masallah I like the way you recite the Quran mashallah I like the way you acquire knowledge masallah I like the way you treat your parents why always do we see only the negative things well this is unfair but Mish um the prophet used to check on his I'll take a couple of minutes more the prophet used to check on his friends and this is something we fail to do or sometimes we deliberately neglect if I see hardship on my friend I'm not watching tough luck if I know that he has debt on him or um he has problems with his brother or with his his parents or with his wife oh keep me away we have a saying in Arabia if you intervene between the uh uh the outer skin of the onion and the onion itself all what you gain is tears so say way it's not my problem no it is your problem the prophet used to check on his companions for example Malik may Allah be pleased with him when the prophet went to and this is mentioned inah chapter n K Malik and two other Companions and he was the poet of the Prophet The Prophet had three poets one Malik that's old okay two hit three who was marted in one of the three who died the leaders no close no cigars abdah may Allah be pleased with him so was of the close friends of the prophet he did not go toab every day he said tomorrow in the day after until it was too late so the prophet was in tabuk and he's looking it says where is Malik he's checking on his friends he knows them because they're close to him he also they told him oh prophet of Allah there is someone there's a rider in the horiz and we can't figure out who he is the prophet said be AB this is wishing I hope be ab and when he came they said yes he is Abu because the prophet was hoping that he would not be late Abu may Allah be pleased with him tells us that we passed through hardship and I was you know he he he accompanied the prophet Alam for nothing except what fills his stomach he didn't work he didn't do anything just to be with the prophet Alam to eat and he says that I went through so much hardship to the extent that I was so hungry but I do as a Muslim I do not beg so I used to meet Abu Bakr and I say Abu Bakr and I meet him in the street in the message what is uh the interpretation of verse so and so in the Quran andak would tell him well this means so and so he says by Allah I know it more than he does I just want him to look at me and say now you look tired do you look hungry I used to meet Omar and say the same until the prophet came out of his house and he looked at me and he figured it out he says Abu he didn't say Abu Hur he said Abu follow me so he said I went with the prophet to his house he entered his houses and said do you have anything and they said no prophet of Allah except a cup of uh uh uh milk so I said bring it over so he brought the milk and Abu was you sharpening his teeth and this is food this is a great meal and says Abu hura go to the Masjid and call the people of sua there's 60 or 70 poor people who have nothing at all like you but they're sleeping at the Masjid and the guy you know dropped his jaw down B what do you mean well the prophet gave me an instruction I have to go so he went and he called come on the prophet tells you said what we can't understand this come come follow me so they went with with with the minute they went to the house the prophet said let them come in you know the house is not big enough it barely takes like three or four people in in in the room of the Prophet so he gave four or five of them to drink and they all drank and did their will full and the five another five another five until they finished the 60 or 70 people from the same cup and Abu was astonished this shouldn't be anything left then he said the prophet gave me the cup and he said drink so I drank and I was full and the prophet said drink so I drank again until I was extra full and the prophet said drink and I said by Allah there is no passage for air I can't even breathe oh prophet of Allah and the prophet smiled and he drink he drank afterwards Sall alhi wasallam so he was checking on his companions and this is an obligation in our community we're Muslims we we're living in this huge and vast country if we don't take care of each other if we don't take um care for one another and look for one another then we have a big problem I'm afraid that we have a lot to cover but inshallah what you have heard displays enough information to you how the prophet Alam our beloved Prophet was the greatest companion and the greatest the greatest this brother to all of his companions"
