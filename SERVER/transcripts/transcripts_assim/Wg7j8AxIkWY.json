  "transcript": "what is the minimum distance required to of someone who's praying some people cross in front of praying individuals in Mecca is that allowed okay what is the origin of this question the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam said whenever you or whenever one of you pray he must pray to a sutra that covers him from the people sutra in arabic means a visor screen something that you put in front of you so that it would indicate that you're praying and people can pass from behind it because if they pass from between where you're standing and the sutra this violates your space and you're obliged you must prevent them from doing this and the length of the sutra is about a foot long a little bit shorter so if it's one span of your hand a little bit higher this is the length of the sutra and this is the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam now is it sunnah or mandatory some scholars say it is mandatory like cheryl albani and other scholars and the majority of muslims say that this is soon why because a prophet as salam was reported to have prayed during half of the people in mecca and he had nothing in front of him between his standing position and the kaaba and the people used to perform Tawaf so they said that this is not mandatory but it is highly recommended to pray to a sutra whether you praying home alone or in the masjid or anywhere else where as for drawing a line in front of you this is not authentic the hadith by itself is weak the sutra does not have to be of a particular width so even if you put a stick or a spear that does the job the height is what counts and in Mecca it's like anywhere else so you should try to pray to a Sutra in Mecca some scholars like share members say that Mecca is exempted but there is no authentic evidence backing this up and the hadith all state that it is highly recommended if not mandatory to pray to a Sutra openly whether in Medina with a mecca whether anywhere else so this is a Sunnah that one should do what if a person prays without the Sutra so I'm in the Masjid in the middle of the Masjid I'm praying so a man wants to pass in front of me and he says hmm 1 meter 2 meter 10 meters I don't know what should I do well the scholars say if I'm praying to nothing meaning that there is no Quran holder or a napkins box tissues or person standing or sitting I'm just praying in the open in this case my space would be from my feet till the position where I place my forehead if you pass 10 centimetres away from that you have no sin on you but you cannot violate my space between my forehead and my feet this is mine and it's my mistake for not praying to a Sutra so I hope this answers your question"
