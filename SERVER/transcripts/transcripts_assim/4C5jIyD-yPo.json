  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] Alhamdulillah. Dear brothers and sisters in [Music] Islamab Allah be pleased with him said I once asked the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and said oh prophet of Allah tell me of what is lawful for me and what is unlawful. And this is part of being direct. No sugar coating, no long speeches. Give me something. Give me straightforward answer. What is lawful? What is unlawful? Now the prophet could have listed all the unlawful things and that would have taken a lot of time. But the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam being a man of wisdom. Abu Talib says he looked at me attentively and then said righteousness in Arabic the word is righteousness is that which brings peace to the soul and tranquility to the heart. where sin is that which unsettles the soul and causes unease in the heart. Even if those who issue verdicts, scholars and people of knowledge, even if they give you rulings otherwise, this beautiful hadith needs to be pondered upon. First of all, al in the Quran and in the Sunnah, this beautiful minute word al has many meanings. One of them is to be kind to others. As in the hadith, righteousness or is defined by good moral conduct. When you see someone with a big beard and short th praying in the first masjid, doing all the sunnas he can muswak and the whole nine yards, but he's rude. He lies. He's stingy. He breaks promises. this person is not righteous because you can tell from his moral conduct. So al is to be kind to others specifically to be kind to the parents and this is why it's called to be dutiful respectful and obedient and it is mainly mentioned with all humans all others that's righteousness Omar may Allah be pleased with him and with his father used to Okay. He used to say righteousness is an easy thing. A cheerful face and soft and kind words. This is what righteousness is. The second meaning of encompasses all good deeds whether apparent or concealed. Allah says in righteousness is not that you turn your faces towards the east or the west but true righteousness is in one of who believes in Allah the last day the angels the book and the prophets and gives wealth in spite of love for it to relatives orphans the needy and a whole list of good deeds. So righteousness or bir here encompasses all good deeds that Allah loves such as the belief in Allah, the angels, the books, the messengers, the forms of worship that we can see such as expenditures and and in the way in the means of uh uh that Allah loves establishing salat and fulfilling your promises and being patient over what calamities may strike may may strike you. The third ma meaning of or righteousness is what your heart is inclined to and you feel that this is the right thing to do. In other terms, your gut feeling. This means that allahel has created us to know what is right and what is wrong. And he made it in our DNA that we feel inclined to doing good things and feel to be repelled from bad things. And in these lines we can understand what may Allah be pleased with him said. He says whatever the Muslims see to be good then with Allah it's good. And whatever the Muslims see to be bad then at the sight of Allah it is bad. Now this hadith is not a cart blanch is not an open invitation for any one of us to follow their guts because this is specifically to those who have a pure natural inclination pure fra that is not tarnished and not changed. Sometimes our gut feeling may contradict Sharia what to do. Satan could come and say when Allah ordered the angels to prostrate to Adam, I had a gut feeling I shouldn't do this. Oh, are you crazy? Allah is giving you a clear directive and you're not following it. This is insane. So your gut feeling is not always something to follow. spec especially if it goes against the Sharia. Sometimes the prophetatam would order his companions to do something and they would not do it and he would be angered by that in Hajj. For example, when he told them to reduce their Hajj which they intended into Omrah, they thought that I how could we do this? How could we shave before the day of Eid? when he told them to slaughter their sacrifice, when they were blocked in and they were prevented from completing it, they had to go back to Medina. How could they go in the state of haram and come a year later and remain in state of haram? So this was a he told them to slaughter their sacrifice and shave their heads and wear their normal clothes. They did not like that. When the prophet had a treaty with the idol worshippers, they didn't like that. So should have should they have followed their gut feeling? The answer is no. So this hadith does not apply to issues when there is a clear evidence backing it up. This hadith applies to when an issue of debate and there is no clear directive from the Quran or the Sunnah and it's just an opinion of a scholar where you are inclined due to feeling that it is not right and there is nothing crystal clear and you have a clear conscience and a natural inclination towards what's right and what's wrong. Basically, whatever there is a clearcut evidence or proof from the Quran and the Sunnah, we as Muslims have no right to think otherwise. I talked to many many people servants of this dunya not of Allah and they simply don't accept the rulings of the Quran the sunnah the rulings of segregation between the genders they're fixated on free mixing on partying and they say no I don't believe in this my gut feeling says it's okay they these are followers of shaitan Allah says in the Quran But no, by your Lord. So Allah is swearing by himself. But know by your Lord they will not truly believe until they make you oh Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam judge concerning that over which they dispute among themselves and then and then find within themselves no discomfort. They agree. They approve. They find no discomfort from what you have judged and submit in full willing submission. So this is what every single Muslim must abide by. But when there is no clear directive, no proof or evidence from Quran or from Sunnah, there is nothing from the coats of the companions of the of the um there's nothing. And then there's only this fatwa from someone that we don't trust his knowledge, his religious commitment. Yeah, he's a celebrity. He's a muti on online or on social media, but he's not known to be a real heavyweight scholar. Rather, he's known to follow his whims and desires. Every couple of months or years, he flips the fatwa and says, \"Oh, it was haram. Now it's halal in this case because there is no clear proof the believer goes back to what itches his heart. So if he feels that no no I I I don't believe this is right. Then you stick with your gut feeling. I'll give you a couple of examples. If you go to the west, you'll find these so-called scholars saying to you that you can buy a house in mortgage in ribba if it's your first house. Now, the evidences from the Quran and Sunnah state otherwise, but assumingly that there is no clear-cut evidence, which there are plenty assuming here because you feel that it's not right. Your gut feeling tells the vast majority of Muslims that no this is not right. So then you have to stay away even if these mufties paid mutes have said to you it's okay. I'll give you a second example and this is something that I give fatwas in. In the west I say that it is permissible to eat the meat which is served by the Christians in America or in Europe because it's a Christian country. because we don't have proof that it was not slaughtered. So the default according to verse 5, chapter 5 in the Quran and to the numerous hadiths of the prophetam is to say to eat and this is a fatwa of bimbaz and the great scholars of Islam. Now this is an issue of dispute among scholars but this is what I am inclined to and I follow. If you live in the west and you say, \"Oh, my heart is itching. I don't feel good about this. My gut feeling tells me I shouldn't.\" 100,000% don't eat. Sheh, you just said it's okay. Yes, I said it's okay. But nobody's hitting you on your hand to go and eat. If you feel that this is not right, you should refrain. Nobody would say, \"Why did you refrain? You're sinful.\" But the opposite might be right. If you eat it while not feeling good, scholars would say now you're doing something wrong and it's not permissible. So as the prophet said, burden sinful thing is what itches inside of you and you're not comfortable with it. And this is related like says to the people of righteousness and piety. As for the sinners, the open sinners, the people of uh uh uh heinous things, it doesn't apply to them because they're inclined to haram. So no matter what you bring them from Quran or Sunnah or the codes of scholars, they would say, \"Nah, my gut feeling says it's okay.\" And they do it without even blinking. So this is what the hadith is referring to. May Allah have mercy on his soul. Says in the authentic hadith, the Allah says, \"My servant continues to offer voluntary deeds to me until I love him. If I love him, then I become his hearing that he hears with and his sight that he sees with.\" to the end of the hadith. This hadith means that Allahawel would support an individual whom he loves and he will only make him see what is good and hear what is good. He would have a clear gut feeling and this is the natural inclination to the majority of people whose natural inclination their futra has not changed. When your heart is filled with righteousness, you can see things other can't. Unlike a haunted heart, a dark and hard heart, may Allah be pleased with a man with with his father says a believer has a glowing light in his heart. And in the authentic hadith the prophet told us when the antichrist when the dal comes out every believer whether literate or illiterate would read on his forehead disbeliever. Others can't see this. They can't see the writing on the wall and in this case on his forehead. But believers who have this light in their heart are able to see it because they have this natural pure natural inclination which means that a believer would see what others won't be able to see especially at times of fitna and tribulations and calamity. So whenever the heart is filled with righteousness, this is a gift from Allah because allahel gave that individual someone to remind him in his heart where he could distinguish between good and bad, what is pleasing allahel and what is evil. And I pray to Allah subhana wa ta'ala that he gives us such pure hearts that can see what pleases Allah to do it and see what angers Allah to stay away from it."
