  "transcript": "Joiria from France Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh Wa Barakatuh I have a question. Is there a need to prevent intrusive thoughts? Like, I have a lot of thoughts whenever I read the Quran, whenever I study, or even when I walk, or I walk. I live basically in my thoughts, so how can I stop this? Jazakallahu Khair. Wa Jazakum. I don't personally know any such du'a, other than to say, Amantu Billahi Wa Rasulihi. Whatever these intrusive thoughts are about, they usually come to cast doubts about your Islam, about Allah, about the Quran, about Prophet Muhammad Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. So in order to stop and prevent them, you just say, Amantu Billahi Wa Rasulihi. I believe in Allah and in His Messenger. Also, reciting the last surah of the Quran, Chapter 114, Surah An-Nas, Qul a'udhu bi rabbin nasi malikin nasi ilahi n-nas, min sharri al-waswas al-khannas. So this also gives you a boost to stop these whispers, and blocking it by not paying any attention to it, would inevitably terminate it insha'Allah, after some time, because shaytan will give up, and will tell his thugs to back off for three, four months, until you let your guard down and he attacks again. This is a vicious cycle that is ongoing until our souls depart our bodies, unfortunately."
