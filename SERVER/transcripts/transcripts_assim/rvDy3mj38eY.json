  "title": "Tafseer of Qur'an Ep 04 Surah Naba 5 11",
  "transcript": "we began to speak about chapter 78 surat and neva about the great news that the disbeliever are in disagreement of they're asking one another what is it what is this great news that they are in disagreement we also said that it is the message of the prophet salam it is the quran it is the day of judgment it is the horrific events on that particular day the day of resurrection and why would they disagree first of all the prophet alaihis came to the disbelievers came to the idol worshippers from within for 40 years he lived among them he was like each and every one of them with the exception that he did not worship the idols he was known to be the honest and trustworthy they would entrust him with their money with their wealth they would entrust him with decision-making and they would seek his opinion in great events so when the revelation came to him and he declared that he was the messenger of allah azzawajal and all that you worship is nothing and you may not worship except allah the creator of the heavens and the earth he came with this they became shocked and they went into denial they said that you're a sorcerer you're a magician you're a liar you are a soothsayer you're insane and they disagreed and they were in argument of what the prophet salam came up with allah says in verse 4 and 5 nay they will come to know so they will come to know nay again they will come to know and this is great warning for those who disbelieve in the message of the prophet for those who just believe in the existence of the day of judgment and what allah azza has prepared for the disbelievers and what allah has prepared for those who believe and allah azzawajal after doing that in this introduction to the surah allah starts to give the people eye-openers so you are in disagreement so you're questioning the validity of the message of the prophet do you think that there is no god you think that allah almighty would not send a messenger with his book to guide the people and to get them out from darkness into the light you still doubt this so allah azzawajal is giving eye openers to those who do not believe in resurrection and the people who do not believe in resurrection have a big and grave problem why is that well i'll tell you there are six pillars of a man of faith which we believe in to believe in allah and the day of judgment the belief in the day of judgment that there will be accountability is what restrains muslims from doing bad things for example if i look at the way i'm living if there was no day of reckoning if there was no resurrection i wouldn't be here preaching people i would have been out there doing whatever i want i would kill people i would steal from people i would become the most influential the most feared the wealthiest because there are no limits no borders nothing to restrain me except the law and if i can cheat the law and who cares not the muslims even if a muslim can cheat the law he knows that there is a day of reckoning and man he will pay for his dues and he will pay for his sins and that is why those who do not believe in the existence of allah or those who do not believe in the day of resurrection they're wasting their time they're doing nothing they're not living their life as it should be lived for those who do not believe in another life and at the same time they are not preparing for the other life which awaits them and that is why allah the almighty is giving us eye openers so allah begins with have we not made the earth as a bed so the first blessing in favor of allah azzawajal is that you find the earth in front of you flat as if it is a bed prepared for people to sleep on do not listen to what people say because had we not known that the earth was around anyone would tell you that the earth is flat so if you recite the quran you'll find evidences that there are planets and they are round and if you recite the quran it talks to individuals about what they see anyone who does not know about nasa about space travel would look and say that the earth is flat and if i go from one point to the other i don't see any curve so the quran is talking to these individuals and telling them look around you from the cradle to the grave so seeking knowledge is like this so almad a cradle or a bed and this is from allah's favors and blessings upon us if you look at the land we live in it's not so rocky that we cannot plow and use to cultivate and it's not so soft that our feet would go deep in and we would not be able to use it has made the whole earth for us as this bad so flat so easy to use and to benefit from and then allah azza says so we made the mountains as pegs and what is a peg a peg is something that you put deep in earth to hold something so it's like a rod it's like a peg that is used with tents and if you look at the mountains and how allah the almighty has created them they are something to ponder upon in surat al-rashya which we will come inshallah to discuss allah mentions four things for us to ponder upon the camels the heavens and the mountains how they were erected and we often take things for granted i once had an office when i was working in my former company and this office had a sea view and it was on a high level of a building and it has all windows around the office so you could see the port the sea the ships it was a magnificent scene it's beautiful view and i used to enjoy watching the expression on people's faces when they come for the first time to my office so when anyone came in he took like six to ten seconds just staring at the view and wow and i just would enjoy watching his face and then when he looks at me and he says what are you doing he said and i explained to him subhanallah being in that office i never appreciated that view i did appreciate it for the first few days and then it was like any other view and this is life these are the blessings of allah azzawajal when they come to you you may appreciate them for the first minute or two but then it becomes something of a habit you become accustomed to it and you do not appreciate it the mountains are like this and this is what we will ponder upon after the break so stay tuned [Music] and welcome back so suratul allah azza is telling us to ponder on the fact that these mountains were erected allah here describes them as being pegs in different verses of the quran allah keeps on telling us that these mountains stand firm and geologists tell us that the plates on the surface of the earth keeps on moving but we don't see this if they move a little bit too violently we have earthquakes and these mountains with the grace of allah stop or hold these plates from moving and that is why they're described as rawasi this mountains are firm in holding these plates together and people fail again to notice this we take it for granted we see these beautiful mountains so high so strong so what it's an act of nature no it is not it is something that allah azza has planted for a reason it is so magnificent so strong that allah tells us that they ask you about the mountains what will happen to them on the day of judgment say that allah azza will blast them all and will make them flat and want to say okay big deal we can do that with a nuke we can nuke a mountain and have it flat well it's not that easy i worked for another company that did mining work and one of their projects was to get a mountain in mecca which is next to the kaaba it's called jabal umar the mountain of omar and it's not that huge or big it's just a normal sized mountain it's not something like that goes hundreds of meters in the air it took us approximately a couple of years plus to blast the mountain and to excavate and to take the debris away from the place until it was flat one mountain look how many hundreds of thousands of mountains on earth who did this it is a lot almighty and a lie is opening your eyes look around you is there any person any entity any country any nation who is capable of manufacturing one hundreds of a tenth of a thousand of what you see can't you see haven't we made this for you to see and ponder upon and then allah says and we've created you in pairs allah has created us in pairs and in pairs means more than just a man and a woman it also means that most things have a counter to them so allah created us as male and female old and young beautiful and ugly fat and thin black and white and people differ although they're created from a single father and a single mother adam and eve yet when you see the diversity the colors the languages the different mentalities and characteristics you keep on finding all of this and this indicates to one single thing that is the greatness of the creator can't you see it's an eye-opener only those whom allah guides would be guided those whom allah azzawajal wills not to guide will continue in their blindness and they will continue in going astray may allah and have made your sleep as a thing of rest so this is one of allah's favors and imagine if you did not sleep for a couple of days how would it be this is something we take for granted and we never appreciate that allah gives us a time to rest and this shows you the greatness of allah almighty when a human being does not sleep this is a deficiency this is an indication that there is something wrong with that individual but when allah the almighty does not sleep this is an attribute of perfection because if allah sleeps the whole universe would collapse allah does not sleep the almighty allah does not rest because he is perfect he doesn't need sleep and he doesn't need to rest humans are imperfect and that is why if they do not sleep this is a sign of a deficiency and there's something wrong with that individual allah has given us the night to rest has given us the night to stop from being active into restoring some of our strength back and this word is derived from ascept and asubat and it is also similar to the word accept which is saturday or the sabbath because they are ordered to not work that is the jews on the sabbath unlike us the muslims alhamdulillah we are exempted from such obligation allah says and have made the nights as a covering through its darkness so one of the blessings of allah azzawajal that he has given us night time and this is a blessing to the majority of the human beings and to the animals there are exceptions there are six months of all day time and another six months of all night time as in the scandinavians and the north pole etc but to the majority of human beings they don't have this alhamdulillah they have segregation between night and day so allah had made night to cover the people as if it's form of clothings so when night falls it covers the whole earth it covers that area with its darkness so it's like a piece of cloth that wraps around the people the community the countries and the earth and allah says and have made the day for livelihood so allah azzawajal made this as the norm people work in the daytime and they go to bed and rest at nightfall nevertheless this is the general term we do have people working the graveyard shift so they would not say hey this is not for us no this is temporary this is not the norm the norm with the majority the vast majority of people that they work during the daytime and they sleep and rest when it is night all of these are things that are given to us by allah azzawajal and people may feel that they have these things and they deserve it and this is their god-given right while it is not now it is important always to appreciate allah's blessings and favors upon us allah says and if you count the blessings of allah you'll be unable to count them day time and night time the sun rises and the sun sets won't say so what this happens every day imagine yourself sitting in a room in pitch black darkness and all of a sudden you see these lights around me they're turned on what happens to your eyesight this is literally blinded by the light so you could not see anything you have to close your eyes and it's harmful and maybe it may harm your eyes as well allah's grace and mercy that when it is pitch black at night what is so dark the sun does not rise like this the sun takes its time and the dimness goes away bit by bit and the light clips in bit by bit your eyes are accustomed to it now you can see and this is something we take for granted it is from allah azzawajal almighty likewise if i'm out there in my field plowing if i'm in the market if i'm not driving if i'm doing whatever i'm doing outdoors or indoors and all of a sudden boom lights are off you'll have cars collisions you have people falling into wells you have problems in catastrophes and calamities but allah's favors and blessing upon us the sun sets bit by bit and darkness comes little by little until your eyes are accustomed to it and you can see these are favors and blessings of allah azzawajal that we take for granted and we never ponder upon when you recite these verses and allah says this and this and this are my favors over you open your eyes appreciate acknowledge allah's greatness acknowledge allah's knowledge and mercy and favors and blessing upon you when you do this you attain true belief and conviction and you get closer to allah azza because now you're appreciating allah who created you unlike those disbelievers who do not appreciate who object to allah's decrees why did you do this why him and not the other person why me and not him and they keep on complaining and whining not knowing that it is allah the almighty that created us it is allah the almighty that tests us and is allah the almighty that would reward us with paradise if we succeed or with hell if we fail so wouldn't it be wise of you to ponder upon this this is all the time we have until we meet next was you"
