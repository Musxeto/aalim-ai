  "transcript": "uh I am often scared of uh death like my heart beats fast and become dizzy uh I'm asking Dua to Allah and seeing your videos on YouTube Made Me Brave like you uploaded like pre Destiny when Allah said to the pen and uh I'm getting thought like what will happen in my old age like this thought I will get or not and I'm very scared of the grave punishment since when have you been scared from dying AR yeah my when I was in Fever like that my health issues no no no since when have you been afraid of dying since when uh in the night when was when I was in my room like that how many months how many months uh like 6 months okay have you died so is this logical six month you're terrified of dying and you did not die what if you live another 20 years are you going to waste your 20 years being afraid of something that will happen inevitably when Allah decrees it it is insane you have problems up there because your date of death and mine has been already predestined and it can't be one minute early or one minute late whether you worry about it whether you bang your head against the wall every day whether you throw your nothing is going to change you'll die when Allah has pre-ordained it therefore be content live a life of beauty enjoy joy every moment you can on Earth with those who love you feel motivated be positive in your work as if you're going to live for eternity be content with the fact that I might die in 5 minutes so what but if I don't I'm enjoying these five minutes instead of wasting my time weeping this is not the right approach for a Muslim to deal with it and Allah Knows Best"
