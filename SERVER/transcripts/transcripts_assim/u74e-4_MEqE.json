  "title": "If someone borrows an item from me and uses it to do haram, did I facilitate sin? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Najeeb says my sister borrows my headphones sometimes she watches movies other times she has work meetings with it am i helping insane the default is that we do not judge people so a headset or a headphone can be used in Haram and it can be used in Hallett likewise a knife you can cut bread or meat with it and you can cut someone's throat or injure someone with it so it depends on how it is being used for you Najeeb if you're a hundred percent certain that she will be using your headset for her arm only in this case it is not permissible for you to give it to her because you would be assisting on evil but if she is fifty fifty she may listen to the news she may listen to the Quran she may listen to halal lectures she may have a halal meetings and she may listen to something that is haram this to me is best to give her the benefit of the doubt if you advise her while giving her the headset that would be a disclaimer so you say to her I'm giving you the headset but fear Allah I am not in responsible for any sin that you commit with it then this is okay it's a reminder but if you don't know for certain what she is going to use it for the default is it's okay to give it to her"
