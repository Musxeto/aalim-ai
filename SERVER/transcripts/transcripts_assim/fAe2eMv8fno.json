  "transcript": "bubba from gambia says tahajud should we say it loud or silently you should say it in between there is a narration that abu bakr used to recite silently and um loudly may allah be pleased with them so the prophet saws raise your voice a little bit and said to rumor who was reading it loudly make it a little bit uh lower so you should do it in between if you recite so that you can hear it so you say alhamdulillah you don't have to announce it to the whole house that would be sufficient you"
