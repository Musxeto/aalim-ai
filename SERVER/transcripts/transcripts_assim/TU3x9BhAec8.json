  "transcript": "was regarding zaka on gold does she have to pay the zaka on gold from a percentage of the gold well uh uh uh Scholars have different opinions regarding this as we've mentioned is the jewelry that a woman wears does she have to pay zaka for that the answer is yes she has to pay zakat but does she have to pay zakat from the gold itself well if she has cash then nobody tells her to sell the gold in order to pay the zaka for it she estimates how much the zaka is by taking it to a shop and he knows exactly how many grams of gold is there and then she pays it from her cash money without having to sell the gold and and also I think she asked about diamonds and and and emeralds and so on precious stones the answer is no you don't have to pay zaka for that the only thing you are obliged to pay zaka for is gold and silver so platinium even if it's far greater than a gold and silver you don't have to"
