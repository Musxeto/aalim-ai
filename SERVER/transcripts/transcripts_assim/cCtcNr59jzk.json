  "transcript": "is it permissible to learn boxing okay i will answer the shot from the philippines says what's the ruling on learning boxing so learning the sport itself is halal aspiring or fighting is haram why because what is the intention of boxing it's not self-defense it's inflicting harm to your opponent and specifically to the head area and the prophet hasaam has prohibited hitting the face totally not even in wars you must avoid whether he's a muslim and non-muslim avoid the face so boxing is revolving around strengthening the face the head whether it's a job it's a combination is this a job or that this is totally prohibited to practice but to work out to learn it to do the ropes and and to hit the uh the bag boxing bag and do the drills and know how to move here and there to avoid to to dodge punches etc yeah this is permissible so if you want to learn self-defense there are other mmas other sports jiu-jitsu aikido um and the rest of the things that would teach you how to self-defense without engaging in actual harming your opponent on regular basis or on competitions learning this is permissible insha allah"
