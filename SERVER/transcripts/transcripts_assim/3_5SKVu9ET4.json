  "transcript": "foreign um one of the greatest battles of islam it happened on the third year of hijrah one year after the defeat of the polytheists the idol worshippers on the battle sent to his nephew the inside information that the people of quraish are coming to invade medina they were coming with an army of 3 000 men 200 riders on horseback and 700 armed warriors in armor full armor the prophet allah tried to mobilize his army and everybody was keen and eager to fight but they were outnumbered because by nature there were there weren't a lot of muslims at the time so the prophet salaam prayed friday prayer and that was in the month of shawwal the prophet assassin prayed friday prayer and he encouraged people to fight in the cause of allah he prayed as a prayer and set out with his army to the battlefield and they camped between an area in an area between medina and the mountain of uhud in an area called the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam started looking at his men and allowing those who were capable of fighting to fight and rejecting those who were young and he returned back about 14 of the companions because they were below 15 years old among them was abdullah ibn umar usama ibn zaid and also zaid bin fabit one of the great scholars of islam and one of the great companions of the prophet simply because they were underaged he allowed only hadith may allah be pleased with him though he was 14 he allowed him in the army because he was an excellent archer samurai ibn jindub who was also a companion who was also 14 objected he said how do you reject me and accept rapha while i am stronger than he is i'm better in the battlefield than he is and the funny thing was at first when the prophet rejected samara he burst into tears he cried like a like like a child like a baby 14 years old he wants to go to fight subhanallah it's not a game yet these boys were men they knew what fighting meant they knew the implication of their actions nevertheless they wanted to die in the cause of allah so when he saw rafael being admitted to the army he objected to the prophet allah so the prophet asked him are you able to pin him down to the ground if you wrestle with him he said give me seconds so he told him okay go let me see what you do and in a matter of seconds raphael was on the fro on the ground and samurai was pinning him down so the prophet sallam accepted him and admitted him to the army now the the issue would be is is this ethical in today's standards in the sense is it okay for children to fight in wars so they say and they have these special courts especially in africa and and in sierra leone and so on where they court-martial whatever those who admit children into wars well i don't know what what the what the rules are according to the european order to the geneva conventions conventions but they're all different from different societies like we have in palestine the youth are more stronger than the men in most places in the world because the the beliefs or the culture is is a culture of you know maturity at a young age while in the west or other places the youth they play with uh computers and and the mindset is different i believe like how you mentioned before about how the strength of the companions and how big they were how strong they were to a level like you know unbelievable that could happen these days like it could give me myself a hand like they were really strong that their children could beat like strong men at the moment okay the criteria that we should judge things over is not what they think it's what the quran and the sunnah tell us and that is why they say beyond or below 18 years of age a woman cannot marry she's underaged they say if she's over 18 and she has intimate relationship this is with her uh concession that's okay in islam it's adultery fornication is not forbidden and is not permissible in islam they say if this took place before she was 18 this is considered to be rape though she conceded but because she is underage likewise if a person kills before he is 16 or 18 years old he's not executed where execution is practiced because he's underaged they claim that if a 16 or 15 years old does something this is negligible because he's a teenager so it's okay for him to do things that are not okay for others adults in islam it's completely different in islam a person is accounted for his actions if he reaches the age of puberty and the age of puberty is recognized by few things among them is reaching the age of 15. he could reach the age of puberty before 15 depending if he has a nocturnal emission or so on or if he has grown hair in the pubic area and and elsewhere as the the jurors say the fukaha say so 15 was the ceiling whoever was 15 and above is an adult and that is why the prophet alaihi salatu would not have children fighting fighting in his side but rafi and samurai were adults they had reached the age of puberty but they were below 15. and this is how we judge on things not on their conventions not on their rules because their rules allow same-sex marriages and no way in islam this is acceptable homosexuality is not acceptable in islam so we judge things through the spectrum of the quran and the sunnah not through their eyes yes not only that sheikh we have also the reality of of the times we're living in most of the crime is committed by use because of how they view the world and the young women also they feel they've been held back from growing up in the sense that when they are mature when they do have feelings of marriage or or to have intimacy they've been restricted by a law which the body and the emotions of this individual is ready for yeah this is completely true and again it's our rules that we should apply and practice simply because it's not human made it's divine it's from allah allah almighty created us and he sent us this manual to operate and to tell us how to operate his creations and by applying it we are applying the rule of allah the almighty that had not changed for the past 15 centuries not even one single letter going back to the army the prophet had one thousand men and they were ready to fight an army three times as big and far superior in equipment and armor the prophet salallahu sallam prayed fajr on saturday morning and after they prayed fajr they could see the army of the polyphase they were so close to them so he asked that his companions if any of them knows a route that could be a shortcut where they can turn around the polytheist army so that their back would be to medina facing and the muslims would that back that be to facing medina so one of the companions knew a shortcut and they quickly turned around the mushrikeen army to the politics army without them realizing to be faced with the muslims behind them so they turned away and looked at the the muslim army as we can see in at the map later on the prophet alaihis allah with his army were ready to fight and he instructed 50 of the men as we can see in the map to go to a mountain that is called a small hill next to ahud he ordered 50 of his archers to stay on that mountain and he clearly instructed them not to leave the site at all no matter what happens even if they see birds coming from the sky taking the muslims away they should not leave their posts until the prophet sends to them so if you look at the plan if you look at the strategy you would find that it is an excellent plan the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam took a position though the enemy army came before him he took the best position it was a little bit higher than the enemies his back and his right hand side was were covered by the mountains his back and his left hand side were covered by the mountain and by the archers on the small hill aine and they were ready to fight now just as the prophet alaihis salat was about to reach the area where the battle took place guess what happened one third of the army defected of the muslim army of the muslim army imagine that one third of the army defected and why was that well i believe we have a short break and just after the break inshallah we will tell you what took place so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize god and enjoy his blessings in this life and his mercy in this life and in the here each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of allah almighty which no one shares or is compared to allah in it and welcome back the people are ready to fight and they're full of enthusiasm and encouragement they would like to prove themselves worthy of being the servants of allah fifty men we're on the archer mountain which is hoping to be able to defend islam and the muslims the remaining were on the battlefield ready to fight of an army three times as big as theirs on that spot one third of the muslim army defected and who would you guess that would be hypocrites the hypocrites abdullah took 300 of his men and said muhammad you did not obey me when i told you not to fight outside of medina fight on your own and he left the son of a so and so could have from the very beginning not gone out with the prophet allah but he did this intentionally he did this so that he would weaken the muslims once they see one third of their army defecting and retreating and he wanted to strengthen the army of the polytheists when they see that and they say now we're four times as big as they are and better equipped this caused a problem at the very beginning because two tribes of the remaining muslims had second thoughts from the ansar but that was only a thought that crossed their mind and soon after allah strengthened their hearts and they decided to fight to the death with the prophet and this was mentioned also in the holy quran and they were supported and strengthened by the will of allah otherwise they would have been with the hypocrites and doomed in hell forever this was not a surprise a big surprise to the prophet on the contrary this was a gift from allah because in the battle of badr allah azzawajal showed the people the true value of the polytheist who lost in and and were defeated and in the battle of allah almighty showed the people the true value of the hypocrites and this teaches us that whenever you're doing something for allah your front should be solid and pure you should not allow others with you when they have different agendas and hidden agendas you all have to work on the same rules regulations and platform you have to share the same beliefs but if you want to defend islam and the man next to you wants to gain or wants to have or to score a point or want something politically motivated or economically motivated then inevitably defeat will take place this is a very important lesson we learn from this battle of ahud the prophet alaihis is encouraging his companions he's telling them that whoever fights with them facing them not giving them their back whoever is patient exactly as he said in badr he will end up in paradise with me and everybody was looking forward to that honor to die in the sight of allah defending the prophet of allah he took a sword of his a very strong one and then said to the people who would take this but would pay for it so ali advanced omar advanced az zubair they're all strong warriors of islam we all wanted to take this sword the prophet sallam did not give it to any one of them they were astonished and he kept on saying who would take this sword and take it and give it its right so abu dhujana simakim nakasha stood up and said prophet of allah what is this sword's right that you want us to give he said that you fight the polytheist until it breaks and bends so he said i'll take it prophet of allah and he gave it to abu dhan so everybody was eager to begin the fight on the other side abu sufyan had been the leader of the polytheist and by the way he accepted islam five years later may allah be pleased with him but at the time he was a fierce enemy of allah the son of man and also who was killed in the battle of badr his son was and ekima also became a good muslim after uh five or six years but at the time of they were all enemies of islam because you said stuff on him both of them they were the reason for the battle really to start and collected you know yes yes donations yes yes that's true and they were all enemies of of allah but they all accepted islam subhanallah five six years later and this also teaches us a lesson that never ever condemn someone and say that he's in health forever because as long as he's breathing you never know what allah may do with him he may transform and accept islam in matter of seconds like what happened to umar himself may allah be pleased with him was a fierce enemy of islam he used to attack the muslims in mecca and once he took his sword and he went to the hiding place of the prophet and his companions to kill him and he was met by one of the muslims and he saw sparks coming out of his eyes he saw this great anger and hatred and he told him um what are you doing he said i'm going to kill muhammad so the man could not stand in his way because he would have killed him in a matter of seconds so he redirected him he told him before you kill muhammad go and check your sister and her husband because both of them are muslims and he was outraged he went to his sister's house he went in he saw her reciting the quran and her husband stood up to do something and he just pushed him and he was pinned to the floor fainted and he went to his sister and he smashed her on her on her face he slammed her in the face and she cried and she said until when are you gonna stay away from allah she shouted at him and this was not expected from her so he felt a little bit soft and he told her what is this you're reading she wouldn't tell him when he insisted she said this is the quran so he told her give it to me let me read it she said no you're an impure person you're negis go and wash and come subhanallah the guy was there to kill and he went and he washed and he recited the surah of and the guy was 180 degrees transformed and he said what do i do if i want to become a muslim and he became a muslim and he went to the hiding place of the prophet that was less than half an hour transformed completely from wanting to kill the prophet to embracing the prophet at islam in front of the prophet he went into the house hamza saw him the companions saw him they were afraid they said umar is asking permission to enter so what should we do hamza a great warrior of islam said let him come in if he wants something good he should have it if he wants something else we will kill him with his sword don't be afraid i'm here hamza was a brave man so he went in and the minute he went and the prophet saws grabbed his shirt and shook him the prophet wasn't afraid umar isn't it time for you to become a muslim immediately said so you never ever know when the guidance of allah comes to a person that is why never open any elementary and i hadn't the other side as well we can't trust ourselves like i can't say about myself i don't know if i'm in paradise if i'm muslim i can't trust myself that is exactly the true thing to say we ourselves cannot guarantee that we will die as muslims and that is why we are always hoping and fearing we hope that we die as muslims because whoever die as a muslim regardless of what he has done he'll end up in paradise sooner or later but those who die not muslims they will end up in hell no matter what good they did because they did not did not believe in the oneness of allah and they did not accept the message of the prophet and this is an important thing for us to learn about now abu sufyan was doing the same was trying to make his army brave and wanting to die the armies at that time and in medieval times they used to circle around the flag the most important thing in the army was like the flag who whenever the flag was still up this meant that the army is fighting whenever the flag went down this meant that the army was defeated in the battle of badr another ibn harith and he is from the the the section of the tribe of banu abdul they he was the holder of the flag and he was taking capture and he was executed because of what he had done previously by him giving up the flag they soon lost the battle and they retreated and fleed the battlefield so abu sufyan went and addressed benue abdiddar and ben abdulmanaf were cousins because they had the same great great grandfather and he told them listen cousins you saw what your friend did in the battle of badr and we lost it so if you're not men enough to hold the flag it's okay tell us we'll take it from you this came of course as an insult what are you you're accusing us of being yellow accusing us of being cowards and they damned him and they cursed him and they told him we will show you what we will do what they did inshallah this what we will know when we meet next time and until then foreign hmm uh-huh"
