  "transcript": "says that white patches disease skin uh affects on 50% of the body it looks very ugly having two kinds of color on the body normally skin uh pment are not coming back treated Etc so the answer is can we uh treat the skin so that it would have a uniform color please advise um the question is that people may have some kind of patches disease that changes uh the color of the skin so you'd find someone with spots in the fingers in the face in the body different color because the uh uh uh I don't know what it it's called The Millan or something like this uh uh the coloring goes away these white spots due to the difference of coloring are far far less than the rest of the body so if you apply creams on these white spots to restore the color to your normal body color this is permissible now this is washable of course and it would be a process that you would undergo twice or three times a day and there is nothing wrong in that because you're actually restoring or trying to restore or imitate restoring the the normal color if the white spots you restore and put the same you put a cream and the color matches your skin this is no problem but if you undergo certain treatment to get your full body white if you're black or if you're yellow if you're h a bronze color to get it the whole thing white as the spots this is not permissible this is changing the creation of Allah"
