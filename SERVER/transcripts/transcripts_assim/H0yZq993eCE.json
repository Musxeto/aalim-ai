  "transcript": "foreign [Music] from Turkey um so my question is that if uh By the Sea there's a dog that looks one of the utensils and then Sam gets into the utensils and it's washed afterwards many times I was wondering if sound counts as soil and if intention is necessary in order to remove impurity so if Sun just got by itself and then it was washed I didn't get the beginning of your question are you asking about a dog that licked into utensils and the utensils were washed without using soil no like if sand like I don't know if some counts the soil it got into the utensils okay and if um there was no intention of purifying like it just got into the utensils and then they were washed many times afterwards with water what's wrong with sand what is wrong with sand sand is pure is it counting as soil even soil is pure no no like the sand purify those utensils or this have to be like soil which is not purified them from what the dog leaking okay this is what I said in the very beginning no putting the sand with your utensils without intending to remove the impurity from the utensils does not work and does not help you have to have the intention of doing it as part of the seven washes that the prophet ordered us to do and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah thank you"
