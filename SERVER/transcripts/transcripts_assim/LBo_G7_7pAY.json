  "transcript": "Shahid says if we see any Muslim girl with a non-muslim boy at a public place what should one do if one sees them should we tell her father to enjoy in good and forbid forbid evil first of all it is a duty upon every Muslim to enjoin virtue and righteousness and forbid evil and vice however there are etiquettes to do this among them is that the outcome should not be greater than the sin itself so if I'm going to do something that would cause more harm or problem this is not permissible in a kaffir country there is no Sharia prevailing and it's not the law of Islam that prevails rather that they're man-made laws so to the authorities it's a natural thing it's a normal thing for a boy to date a girl regardless of their ethnicity or religion now if a Muslim sees this happening it is not appropriate for him to go and address the girl because she's an maharam to him and definitely when going out with a kafir she has no regard to Islam or care about what Islam says so talking to her would not do any good he's talking to her father a good thing to do it depends if you know that her father is a righteous practicing Muslim who's wise and who would take things into consideration and would deal with this issue wisely yes you have to advise him because if it happened to you you would have wanted your neighbors and friends to come and warn you if it where your own daughter you would have wanted people even strangers to come and say listen Uncle your daughter is doing this and that so that you would have heads up in order to tackle this issue before it goes out of hand so there is no problem but you have to address it with wisdom and diplomacy insha Allah [Music] uh and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for Allah"
