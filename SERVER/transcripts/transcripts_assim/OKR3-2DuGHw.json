  "title": "How to SHOW Respect to elders in Islam? (Bow, squat, kiss forehead, etc) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Alima from France Yes sir, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Yes sir, thank you very much sir. I have a question like how to respect adults in Islam. The grammar that we must say to them, the tone, how we should say them. The body language, like the obligation of putting hands at the back to stand straight and separating the legs. So please sir, thank you very much sir. I would like to know how to respect. There is nothing Alima prescribed in the Sharia handbook that says when you address your grandma, you have to stand in a particular fashion or do this or do that. The general guidelines are when you are addressing or talking with the elders, you have to be respectful. Now what they consider to be disrespectful, if it goes against Sharia, don't pay attention to it. For example, in some countries in Africa, it is disrespectful if you don't squat to the elders. So what? It is not permissible to squat. In some countries, Asian countries, it is disrespectful if you don't bow to the elders. And again, this is against Sharia. You don't do it. Even if they consider it to be disrespectful, because the guidelines are set by Sharia. Anything else is fine. So if for example in Sharia, it says that the same gender, when you meet the elders, you kiss them on the forehead. There is no problem in that. It is a cultural thing. It is a sign of respect. That's fine. So you have to go alongside filtering the culture and the customs through the lens of Quran and Sunnah, of Sharia. And if it doesn't go against it, there is no problem in it, inshallah."
