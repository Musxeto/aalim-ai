  "title": "I stopped talking & meeting up with friends after practicing islam, is it sinful? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh my question is uh I am not a social person so if I lose contact with people for no reason like for example I had I won't I wouldn't say friends like I had relations with the people in the past and as I wanted to become a religious person I lost contact with them intentionally and they are not bad people they are a Muslim they pray but I just wanted to improve myself so I lost contact with them intentionally so after a long time they called me and like they keep telling me yes that why don't you contact with and I got my driver's license and then I don't think it's a sin because as far as I'm concerned Prophet Allah said so I have I I did not abandon you I do not have any enmity towards okay your line is breaking Handler but I got your question okay the Hadith you've quoted is correct this is when I have beef with other Muslim and we disagree on something and we have an argument and we have a fight then I boycott him for three days in the sense that I may see him in the mall or in the street and I look the other way for three days not giving Salam there's no problem in that but after three days if I see him on the fourth day I have to initiate salaam by saying assalamu alaikum even if I still hate his guts and he has to reply and if he uh initiated the Salam I have to reply this is a mandatory there's no choices I have gazillion friends that I don't contact for 10 years 20 years life is short and each and every one of us have lots lots of things to do I have total respect and love for them but I don't have time to see them is that okay there's no problem imagine if someone calls me would I hang up definitely not would I not pick up the cold definitely not if he invites me would I intend Maybe depending on my schedule but what you're doing is not a positive thing and a lot of the brothers once they are committed to the the religion and they start to practice shaytan messes up with their head and makes them isolate themselves from the society from their friends from their colleagues sometimes from their loved ones from their relatives why I want to better myself I want to elevate myself to a higher level I want to be righteous and practicing and a student of knowledge that's a good thing but this is the wrong way you can't be more righteous and practicing than the prophet and if you go to hisira you will find that the prophet that is used to mix with everybody would attend any invitation he's given even by a Jew woman she invites him to eat from a ram that she cooked he tells his companions let's go no problem a woman with mentally who's mentally challenged takes an appointment from him comes and takes his hand and drags him in the streets of Medina complaining about what her folks and relatives are doing to her and he's going with her so he wasn't the type of saying oh I don't have time I don't want to meet people I don't want to mix with people beside that imagine the benefit you can get and gain when you go and meet these folks who love you and have respect to you and you throw gems from the Quran and from the Sunnah they never knew before and they're hearing it for the first time and they adopted and start practicing it and you the following days or months on your bed sleeping while getting rewards countlessly because of the things you've said in half an hour when you had a meeting with them but you did not pay attention to it you're depriving yourself from a great source of rewards so I would highly advise to balance your time to prioritize your relationships and keep the bridges running and and live instead of burning all bridges with people though you don't have any enmity or any uh grudges against them but still people would like to see you every now and then"
