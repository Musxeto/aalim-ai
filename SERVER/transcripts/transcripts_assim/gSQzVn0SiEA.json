  "transcript": "uh what would be some of the shortcomings or some of the dangers of mentioned procedures we you mentioned about seven and you mentioned that the first five are all Haram according to the scholars and the last two are the only ones that they saw permissible what would some of the dangers be for example with even the last two well there are a lot of dangers surrounding this procedure and by saying dangers is not life-threatening it's even worse because it would mean that the lineage would be mixed and people would come into families that they're not theirs it would cause a similar harm to what fornication has caused for example exactly and that what caused a number of Scholars to forbid all these seven procedures altogether and say that if you measure the pros and cons if you measure the disadvantages and the advantages you would find that it is not an issue of necessity it's not a life-threatening issue that would permit us to allow this yet the majority of Scholars say that the sixth and seventh procedure is um are permissible providing that we avoid the shortcomings or the dangers that uh uh revolve around this procedure such as for example that in order to have this IVF we have to expose what is known as the and not only this it is the most private part of the private parts of course so here we come to a fork of the road it is is it worth it is it or is it not is it worth it for the woman or the man to sacrifice their modesty and their their yes some say that it is not sacrificing the modesty because when she gives birth by default she has to expose this to whoever uh doing the delivery but again it's an issue of uh uh to to be balanced and to be weighed they go on and say that there is a very huge possibility that mistakes could happen at Labs so instead of cultivating the right sperm or the right egg things could mix up and then a black couple would have a white child mhm I said what is this or the opposite and the is not of importance more than the result of it an individual can end up having the child of his cousin or his uh his friend or his brother by accident by accident and this and this is why some of the scholars limited the P permissibility of this procedure to doing it on the spot not having the samples taken in uh the refrigerators and come after 3 or 4 days and then planting it no it has to to be on the uh spot uh among the dangers that are very possible that these places or institutes these clinics or hospitals they're profit oriented MH so they would want the woman to come out pregnant regardless if it's possible or not so this means that even if the donor or the husband husband's sperms are not up to the task they would fabricate they would get from somewhere else so that they would get the money for this operation for this procedure and this is what caused a lot of Scholars to say that it must not be performed the IVF it must not be performed in commercial institutes or privately owned it has to be governmental run where profit is not a factor with which which is is completely a fact what about uh and this is a very superficial question but what about some people who for example would store that sperm if if some Scholars allowed it and once the husband is dead inserting that sperm into the woman well this also was discussed and mentioned by the scholars in their uh uh meetings and they said that this is not acceptable and it's not applicable because after the death of the man the contract marriage is over it's done so by doing the IVF after his death would not actually be his own it would be like fornicating it would be like committing adultery so they completely forbid this and they ban this and uh uh this is something that it is not uh permissible because imagine if someone dies and all of a s all of a sudden a wife comes up and says 3 years later that listen I have his sperms and now I'm conceiving his child how would we know that this is his child and not the result of uh adultery so what is the Islamic ruling then on some people who did this let's say for whatever reason out of ignorance and they fell into one of the first five categories for example this would not be considered to be a a proper offspring of the person because this is not his child the sperms is someone's else so he this child cannot be called after him unless in a very narrow window of where the man has the right to call after him whomever he wishes so he can give him his name but this is this is a minor opinion but this is a very minor opinion so what's to be done with a child should they be given to day uh to to um adoption agency should the should those two that couple raise that child well the mother is the mother without without any doubt because the egg was her she conceived the child but the problem is with the father he is not the biological father and it was a result of someone's else so he cannot be called after the person and that this person should not treat him as his own child so he should be called after the mother as in the in in the times of of of adultery if a woman fornicates and bears a child who is he called after definitely not the biological father because he has nothing to do with it he's to be called after his mother and in this case because of the misconception because of the error and ignorance that resulted of this child there might be a way to have this child called after the husband who is not the actual biological father and if he accepts this and he calls him after him he's called after him okay so the ruling for the most part falls to the same ruling as a woman who committed fornication or adultery and it kind of gets taken out of the whole contemporary issue because there are now direct rulings to dealing with it or direct examples from the earlier Generations yes but what governs this is that ignorance was prevailing they didn't know that it was not permissible or someone gave them the wrong so they're not sinful they're not sinful if they did not know we'd love to continue and discuss but unfortunately we're just out of time join us again next week hold [Music]"
