  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh. After my period ended, I saw white discharge on my navy blue trousers when I took it, and when I took it in between my fingertips, it also looked white. But when I put the same discharge on a white place, it looked slightly yellow. Now am I supposed to do wudu for every prayer and wash my trousers every single time? I will be going travelling in a week, in sha Allah. If I combine prayers, say zuhr and asr, did I have to do wudu twice for this problem? Jazak Allahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum, if this yellowish discharge is light in colour, which it most likely is, so it is like off-white, no, there is no need to do that. This is the normal vaginal discharges. Yellow discharge that may be accompanying your menses or following it immediately is the thing that you should be concerned. During purity of white or a little bit yellowish, it does not impact your purity in sha Allah."
