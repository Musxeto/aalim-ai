  "title": "Should I first make up the missed days of Ramadan before 6 days of Shawwal? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "have missed days from ramadan can we make up or do we have to make up for these missed days and then follow that with six days of shawwal or can we put the six days first and then later on in the year we make up for the miss days of of of ramadan what are you after when you want to fast the six days of shawwal what are you after everyone says well we're after the great dua where the prophet salallahu the great reward that is what the prophet saws told us that whoever fast ramadan and follows that with six days of shawwal allah azzawajal would reward him as if he fasted the whole year so this is what you want fasting the whole year the reward so if you want this go back to the basics what is the hadith the prophet says alas islam whoever fasts ramadan the whole complete ramadan and then follows that with six days of shawwal allah would reward him the fasting of a whole year now if you missed three days due to traveling or due to being ill or if if it's a female due to her menses and she missed these three four days if she finishes ramadan and wants to begin with the six days of shawwal would this apply to her the answer is no why because the prophet said whoever fasts ramadan and this sister fasted only 27 or 26 days she missed four days or three days so in this case in order for her to be rewarded she has to make up for the missed days of ramadan and then afterwards fast the six days of shawwal this is a specific incident regarding to the hadith and understanding of the hadith as well"
