  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum and welcome to with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman our viewer host we are looking at the Sahaba the Companions of the Prophet peace be upon him and how he the Prophet interacted with his companions during his life our guest of Saudi Arabia Shaykh awesome al Hakim Salaam aleikum Salaam o Allah thank you so much Sheikh for being with us to open the subject about how the Prophet peace be upon him interacted with his companions his faithful companions we should probably start with a an understanding about exactly who we should consider as companions there's across the 1.8 billion Muslims there's a some what a difference of opinion about exactly who the Sahaba are what their rank is in a law's site and to the Prophet let's start by defining who the Sahaba my name al hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa idly he wore a suit I mean nabina muhammad in Wahiawa sahbihi ajma'in by as you've correctly stated the scholars differed in defining the title of Sahaba okay so a Sahabi meaning the companion of the Prophet that is awesome is defined as a person who met the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as a muslim and died as a muslim okay so by this you can take out the hypocrites who met the prophet has some word there were hypocrites and were soon forgotten and nobody considered them to be among the Companions because they were well known to the Companions of the Prophet is awesome and also from this definition we extract those who saw the Prophet or met the Prophet area so rostrum while they were disbelievers and did not believe until he died and they become it became Muslim then they're not companions or those who are pasta sized and abandoned the Islam and died as disbelievers now when we talk about this segment of the society we are talking about the elite the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he was talking about the best of generations he said the best of generations is my generation that is the generation of the companions and those who follow them and he's talking about the taboo in the followers were those who saw the companions but did not see the Prophet s son and those who follow them and these are the tabi tabi mean who saw the tabary but did not see the companions may allah be pleased with them so the Prophet is telling us a race awesome that these three generations are the best generations ever to walk the earth and why is that because they carried the religion to us and this is why we have a very high level of respect and love towards the companion may Allah be pleased with them because without them we would not have received the Quran we would not have learned the Sunna and we would not have known what what events took place at the life time of the Prophet array so I'd like to pick up thank you for that answer I'd like to pick up on what you just said about the the the Quran and the role of the Sahaba may Allah be pleased with him in bringing us facilitating the Quran coming to us the Prophet peace be upon him was receiving these revelations and he himself was not illiterate man he wasn't going home opening up you know pen paper and write talk about how this was happening I mean it happened over in stages principally who were the writers do we know who they were can you talk about that well first of all the prophet alayhi salaatu son revelation continued for 23 years and he had scribes who were responsible for writing whatever is revealed to him when I - I as a full chapter depending on the revelation it came so we know that Omar Baba earth man even a fan I'll even ABI talib mourão even ABI Sufyan they didn't if a bit all of these learned companions who used to read and write hmm whenever they were in the presence of the Prophet Sam he had like half a dozen or more of them I see so whenever a revelation came they would just simply bring a piece of leather a piece of a tree of leaves or bones and they would write on them and the people would learn it by the words of a word of mouth or by describing another copy of it this is how it was revealed and it is well known that the Quran was memorized it is verses in the chest of the believers so let us assume hypothetically that all copies of the Quran is burnt to the ground today no problem tomorrow will write an exact replica without a single letter different without a single vowel different because it is memorized by hundreds literally hundreds of millions of people I go in my message I lead the prayer a child of 10 years of age correct me when I make a mistake though I am the Imam he corrects me without any problem and I accept that and I embrace it because the boy is preserving the heart man yeah yeah it's really an amazing thing when you stop to think about it all right a slight slight sidetrack so thank you for indulging me on that let's go back to the relationship between the Prophet peace be upon him Ennis and his companions how would you I we've told us so much and we've got snippets here and there but let's be direct about it this time in characterized describe for us the relationship how he interacted with him how he viewed them valued them so on and so forth okay in terms of valuing them we and the Muslims know for certain that there are top four and these top four are out of top ten and then we have those who are known to have participated in the Battle of batter we know that there are those who migrated ahead of others so the ranking differs mm-hmm okay among the Companions the best for our Abu Bakr then Roma then us man then highly known as the four caliphs the rightly guided caliphs of Islam they were the rulers after the Prophet alysus in their order in that order and their status to Allah is in the same order the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam mentioned these four among ten of the companions so there were six more when the Prophet mentioned them he said so-and-so is in Jenna Abu Bakr is in Jannah remark is in generous man is in Jenna ID is engine a borobudur amber majora is in Jannah sadly Waqas is in Jannah abdur-rahim 11 alpha is in Jenna a uberman Lama is anjana Paul habanero vanilla is anjana Syed Evans AM Nam Rob no no fail its in China ten people in the unanimous decision of Muslims that these are the best of the best then you have other companions I'll just give you an example of one would say okay companions are all the same they are knowledgeable they're all good you know a companion by the name of Hallett evening worried mm-hmm he was a great warrior he was a great leader and the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam described him as the sword of allah this description is not given easily hmm so when the Prophet complements a person by saying that he's the sword of Allah this mean that this guy has a lot under the hood however in the say highly demon will eat once argued and disputed with at the man even out one of the ten top ten companions of the Prophet Elisha saw Salam what did the Prophet do when he heard about this dispute one would say okay this is one of the ten heaven bound and this one is the sword of Allah it happens no the Prophet said that is also addressing the whole of the Companions wouldn't you leave my companions for me this is addressing Khalid but I'm your companion as well but the Prophet is showing the difference wouldn't you leave my companions for me for by Allah if one of you is addressing harlot if one of you would to give in charity the weight of Mount Hood in gold that would not come close to the hands full of my companions or not even half of it so the profit is actually saying that no matter what you do Hollett mm-hmm even if you pay in charity the weight of Mount Hood in gold this would not come close to what a Brahmin offers to Allah so a jealousy and that was it not only that even with Abu Bakr and Umar how close can that be we know that Umar was so close to the prophet alayhi salatu salam so beloved to the Prophet Isis am Abu Bakr in him always went out and came in with the Prophet sallallaahu Salam yet once Abu Bakr said something inappropriate to Omar then he went to his house trying to seek for the forgiveness but Omar did not come out so Abu Bakr went to the Prophet era so Salaam apologizing for his mistake towards Umar and asking him to intercede mm-hmm Gani abu bakr is admitting his fault Umar went to Abu Bakr's house and he did not find him so he went to the Mestre to meet him because he felt that maybe I should have accepted his apology the moment he walked into the Masjid the face of the prophet alayhi salatu salam changed hmm Abu Bakr went down on his knees and said o prophet of Allah I'm the wrong one it is my mistake and the Prophet said that his salat WA Salam wouldn't you leave my companion for me Abu Bakr believed me when everyone else said I'm a liar Abu Bakr gave his money and wealth to assist me and to help me when everyone else deprived me from that wouldn't you leave my companion for me hmm and he's addressing this to Omar then the the people the companion said after that day no one ever touched Abubakar more dared to say something against him this is the status of Abu Bakr to the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam well thank you so much for that Sheikh we are ready for a break and we will come back to continue with check awesome assalamu alaikum and welcome back to with the Prophet we're continuing with Shaikh awesome I always pronounce your name like awesome awwe som e awesome awesome awesome both word probably thank you for you know in relationships the Prophet time and time again peace be upon him proves himself to be a man that a truly unique an unusual man I mean his humility his love his compassion his mercy he was really different from the mold that we are accustomed to recognizing as a man in there in any organization public private for-profit non-government so on and so forth there's a hierarchy and the relationship between leaders managers and workers is an important one how to maintain healthy relationship and so the question I'm trying to get to is characterizing the nature of the prophets relationship with his companions peace be upon him was he rigid within I think not was he open to them did he defend him did he protect their feelings that he resolved disputes yes yes yes did he joke with them elaborate on these on these points and the nature of the relation is relationship if we would like to elaborate this would take us like six or seven more episodes yeah and it won't be enough the Prophet Area salsa was the perfect human being so when you talk about perfection in regards to being a human being he was the manifestation of such perfection his time was fully utilized to the particular second so he used to visit his companions one by one he used to counsel them solve their problems answer their invitations visit them when they're sick and make du'a attend their funerals attend their burials attend their with weddings check upon them if something was missing or something was wrong if there was a task at hand he would always give a helping hand as in the case of digging the trench which we all know about the Battle of the Honda or the trench when the idol worshippers of Koresh and the tribe of Vltava and we're planning to attack Medina immediately the companions gave advice to the Prophet aliens of Salem to dig a trench around it to delay their penetration of the borders and they can attack and this is also one of the things that manifest or illustrate the relationship between the prophet and his companions Arie saw some that he used to ask them for consultation he says advise me o people what do you think and they advised him to dig the trench one man for example who used to attend the court of the Prophet Isis em and he had a young child that came from behind his back and played is his father plays with the father one day the guy did not come and the Prophet asked where is my companion so-and-so and they told him that his beloved son had died so the man was in mourning the man was sad and depressed so the Prophet went to him solace Allah and condoled him and gave him his sympathy condolences and then the Prophet asked him would you like that your son is with us today playing with you or would you like on the day of judgement that he meets you on the gates of paradise and admits you to it he said nobody by Allah I'd like him to admit me to paradise the Prophet said so it is so when you see the interaction of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam he used to joke with them mm-hmm okay and they used to tell him Oh prophet of Allah you joke with us and he says yes but I do not say except that is true so a woman an old woman comes in and says o prophet of Allah pray to me that I enter Jannah the Prophet says Jenna paradise is not a old women are not admitted to Paradise so the woman starts to weep and if the Prophet smiled and says you will return to be young in your 33 years of age hmm so the Prophet in life he didn't yeah so another person comes in he the Prophet jokes are racism and he has like trachoma in his eye in one of his eyes so the Prophet invites him to eat dates while is eating dates the Prophet says you're eating dates with trachoma in your eye with this infection in your eye and the boy and and and this companion says yes but I'm eating with the other eye with the healthy eye so the Prophet jokes with them once there was a man by the name of Zaire and he is a Bedouin who used to come and do practical jokes mm-hmm for example he sees something in the market and he buys it from the owner and he takes it and he tells the owner to come to collect your money and he goes to the Prophet at his son and he gives him this thing and he said o Prophet Allah this is a gift I liked it for you and the Prophet is thankful and few minutes later the owner comes and the and zyre says to the owner collect your money from the Prophet yeah and the perfect laughs of this once the Prophet went into the market and so there so he came from behind him he embraced him and said who will buy this slave from me and the guy was trying to mm-hmm get loose and and and and lose the grip but then when he heard the voice of the Prophet Isis Aram he started going back wanting to touch the body professor and remain in this so when he said who will buy this slave for me as I said o prophet of Allah then no one will buy me I'm not something good to be sold so the Prophet said ah Sam but you at the sight of Allah is expensive you aren't expensive at the sight of Allah so the Prophet jokes yeah but he doesn't cross the line he doesn't lie and it's not something that is frequently done like a stand-up comedians or Majora's or clowns no the Prophet has respect but every now and then this breaks the ice this makes them feel that he is from amongst them yet the relationship between bosses and subordinates usually is a relationship of intimidation so you my boss I would probably fear any reaction from you this was not with the Prophet as a Sam there was no intimidation they was taught to respect Amram than us who was an adversary and an enemy of Islam until the 8th fear of Hydra he said I embraced Islam and now I could not describe the Prophet sallallaahu l'm if I were asked to do so I cannot because I could not look at him face to face he's not intimidated but he is so respectful that he is always looking down was he cannot look at the professor in order to memorize the way he looks and then to describe him this shows you the amount of respect and love they had to the Prophet I am this individual himself says that I've never met the Prophet as after accepting Islam except that he would smile in my face now look this he has just accepted Islam he was an enemy but now he's a Muslim so whenever he comes and meets the prophetess era the Prophet would smile in his face until this made him think that he is favored by the Prophet so himself this guy I'm from the last mile of a prison he said so one day I felt courageous and I said o prophet of Allah who among the people is most beloved to you thinking that he will say you mm-hmm because he always smile in my face so he said Ayesha so no no no prophet of Allah among the men we write then the Prophet said abu bakr mmm then Omar then I was mad and then the guy knew and understood he got it that this is the nature of the Prophet ah some of being so down to earth with his companions that he smiles to all of them yeah it really changes the dynamic when you have someone who humanizes themselves is good with the situational humor as you describe how basic question going back to who the Sahaba war may Allah be pleased with him how would this election made was it based on people who were immediately around him did he know them peace be upon him before his prophethood began how did these people when we look at some of the other prophets the most the major prophet preceding Muhammad the ISA peace be upon him he went around the the town selecting people randomly they he didn't have any previous connections with them how did it work with Prophet Muhammad the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam did not do any selection per se it was Allah who selected them for him all right Abdullah even mustard me Allah be pleased with him says that allah azza wajal looked into humanity and selected the best of them to be his messenger prophet muhammad ali so son then allah looked in the hearts of all those around him and selected for him the companions of the prophet Isaiah who we're the elite and the best of the best therefore it was not that he used to go and select them they were around him they saw him they believed in him they followed him and they chose to be defending him fighting for him learning from him up the love him so for example is one of them he learned 70-plus suitors straight from his mouth Abu Huraira stayed with the Prophet the last four years of his life not going anywhere not working anywhere only to whatever he can eat with the Prophet that is awesome and I said no Malik he was with the Prophet for 10 years as his mother brought him may Allah be pleased with them also when you look at the companions and you look at the judgment of character of the Prophet Allah so sir you understand that he is an intellectual person he knows character so when he said Abu Bakr is the most most merciful of my Ummah to the people Omar is the strongest earth man is the most bashful Ali is the best of judges they more Adam imageable is one of the those who know in the vision of inheritance and a borough beta is the Ameen the trustworthy of this Ummah so all of these characteristics he knew them one by one and he knew how one was better than the others in all of these things yeah it sounds like it sounds like the job that we hear coaches they have to identify develop talent natural abilities that's all the time we have for the Saba thank you so much for being with us Bala Qaddafi we will conclude our discussion about the Sahaba the companions of Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him and in our discussion and inshallah may Allah accept our efforts thank you for being with us assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah"
