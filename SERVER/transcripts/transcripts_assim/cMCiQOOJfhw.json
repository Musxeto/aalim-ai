  "title": "Ruling on a person who rejects a single hadith from Sahih hadiths (Sahih Bukhari) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Germany says what's the ruling on someone who rejects a single Hadith that is reported in the sahih this is an issue that depends on the person's knowledge so if this person is a knowledgeable person of the caliber of Sheikh Islam is the scholars of a high caliber then we would consider what they had chosen a mistake that does not tarnish their reputation as great Scholars but if it is a Layman whom if you ask him where is this verse found in the Quran yet and he says this is Hadith not the verse of the Quran so oh I didn't know that of course you didn't know that because you're okay I can't say that on live TV you don't have the qualification to speak in religion so now you're coming after 15 centuries of Islam and you say oh this Hadith I no I don't buy it it's not logical this is exactly what shaytan what Iblis what Satan did long long time ago when Allah told him prostrate to Adam he said no this is not logical I was created from fire Adam was created from clay I'm better than him you're doing the same thing you're rejecting something from the religion with your logic knowing that your logic is impaired it is at fault it is filled with flaws your senses your eyes your hearing are not perfect there are so many galaxies out there so many planets so many solar systems that you cannot see yet because you can't see them it doesn't mean that they don't exist so if he rejects one Hadith because of his whims and desires he's a fast Circle and most likely we would not say that he is out of the fold of Islam because this is sinful he accepts the Hadith he accepts the Quran but this particular Hadith he rejects but if he rejected something that all the Muslims agree upon in his part of our uh Akida like the existence of Heaven and Hell like the existence of the sirat the bridge over Hell Fire where people cross to the other side if he denies the torment of the grave and rejects the Hadith if he rejects the Hadith of a spell being casted upon the prophet Allah by a Jew magician or sorcerer by the name of Assam then this is problematic if he rejects all hadiths and he says I don't believe in Hadith at all because these are man-made I only believe in the Quran this person is an apostate because Allah says in the Quran to follow the prophet Sam and to obey him and to take what he brought to us and he's rejecting it so how is he going to pray give zakat how is he going to know what's Halal and what's Haram how to perform Hajj without the Sunnah so by rejecting the whole Sunnah he's a kafir he's an apostate if he rejected something a Hadith or two that these hadiths do not impact a person's Iman and it's not rejecting something that the consensus of Muslim Scholars had been agreed upon in this case he's a facet he's sinful and an ignorant imbecile but he would not be a kafir and Allah Knows Best"
