  "transcript": "Umayyad from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam Sheikh thank you for doing such a great service for the ummah My question is that can I record my daily life or daily routine on TikTok and other social medias to earn income? So many influencers and famous people are blatant liars They don't have a happy marriage, they don't have a nice life, they don't possess what they pretend and claim to possess It's just for fame, for recognition and to be pointed at saying oh this is so and so So a decent Muslim is always having a low profile He is a servant of Allah who is righteous, pure and hidden He is not boasting around showing people that I have this, I have that No, this goes against a proper Muslim who fears Allah, who wants to keep everything between him and Allah Azza wa Jal Yes, enjoy life, enjoy a good ride, a good car, a good house But don't boast about it and show people that may break their hearts, may get you an evil eye and may put you in a lot of trouble Let alone the money that is coming, Allah knows what the source of such money is and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best www.mooji.org"
