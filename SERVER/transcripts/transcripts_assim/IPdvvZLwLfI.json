  "transcript": "well actually this is a practice uh widely I believe in Pakistan and this is wrong it is a waste of money one would say what do you mean waste of money we're doing this for the sake of Allah I said yes this is true but do you know more than the Prophet The Prophet sallallahu alai wasallam did not do this he did not offer sacrifice for all of uh the members of his family or for his uh wives uh each one he only slaughtered one sheep and he said this is for me and for my family and he slaughtered the second sheep and he said this is from my whole umah for all of my followers especially those who are unable to slaughter now when he went for Hajj he slaughtered that sacrifice 100 camels now this is different than see the the animals to be slaughtered are different we have which is the sacrifice that a person who does not go for Haj offers on the day ofid we have had which is the sacrifice that a pilgrim offers throughout his pilgrimage we have fidia which is the experation a person doing or H Slaughters in order to expediate something wrong that he had done we have what is known as and this is the sacrifice we offer in gratitude whenever we are blessed with a child so we Slaughter two sheep two RAM for a male newly born or one sheep for a girl newly born and we also have the wi which is um a sheep that is slaughtered and we invite people whenever someone gets married and so on this is what I can think at the tip of my mind at the moment is different than those who are not SE who are not performing they should not Slaughter one sheep for each member of the family because this is not the doing of the Prophet Alam Slaughter only one sheep the father your father should Slaughter only one sheep on his behalf and and on the behalf of his family and he should utilize the the the the value and the cost of the other seven Sheep by giving them to charity paying the rent of someone who's unable to do this uh paying the medical bills of sick people who can't afford it U giving it to to tuition uh fees for people who can't take their kids to school ET utilize the money and deeds of slaughtering a sheep or more uh against the sin of the prophet"
