  "transcript": "nasra from the U.S so I know a sister who has a brother who seems to be mentally Disturbed like he's been locked up in a psych ward more than once and refuses to accept that he's sick um recently he said that Allah speaks through him and that when this happens he's Prophet ASAP and he also says that when Allah speaks through him his shoulders brought in and his voice changes and his eyes basically violate um he says that Allah can take possession of one's body and that Allah has spoken to him twice in a spin of like a year and some change her family members have been trying to get Quran red on him but he keeps refusing and this sister was just wondering if these were symptoms for gin possession because she and her family members think that he's um possessed by Jim first of all what this person has said is blasphemous and most likely he is possessed by Jinn or he's mentally unstable meaning that he's insane because no one who's Muslim would ever say such things so the evidence that may back this up is his refusal for the Quran to be recited upon him and usually this is a sign of gin possession so you guys have to try to pin him down and get someone who knows what he's doing from to recite rookie on him and maybe Allah azzawajal would help him and get whatever Jin um that he has in him out but definitely these things that he's saying is either an indication that he's mentally Disturbed insane or that he has chosen to be a kafir and to come out of the fold of Islam which is normally not any logical or possible with normal people and Allah Knows Best foreign"
