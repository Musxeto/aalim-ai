  "title": "Kissing the Quran and other Innovations - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "last question was about kissing the poor an we see a lot of people after reading the Quran they close it and they kiss it in some of them even prostrate on it so they do this and they do this and this is also done when you find a piece of bread on the road you kiss it and you put it on your forehead and you put it in a high place if you find a 500 dollar bill you kiss it you prostrate in it and you put it in your wallet excuse me where did this come from this is all not part of Islam however some scholars stated that kissing the Quran if it was out of great compassion and love to it and respect this might be accepted yet the safest opinion of all is that respecting the Quran is not by kissing it respecting the Quran is by doing what Allah told us to do in it so you kiss it from here till Fez your time but you deal in RIBA and you borrow in river and you lie and you cheat people and you don't pray on time and you don't give your zakat on time and you abuse others the Quran is cursing you so if you kiss it from here till the day of judgement this would not help you and this is why even taymiyah may Allah have mercy on us all said that nothing among the abstract and not abstract the concrete or things that are not alive nothing among the GEMA that is to be kissed except the black stone so you go to the grave of the Prophet as Salam you start kissing and machine all the windows and the doors and this is an innovation you go to his pulpit and you kiss it this is an innovation you go to the Kaaba and embrace it and kiss it this is an innovation only the black stone among the living you can do that with your mom and dad without any problem insha Allah"
