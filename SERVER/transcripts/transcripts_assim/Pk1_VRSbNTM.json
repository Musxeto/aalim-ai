  "transcript": "yes my question is a husband says I give you talach in a fit of rage many times during quarrels within a period of say 10 to 15 years randomly at different times but Noida was observed as he used to make up immediately after quarrels saying he did not intend to say it now when the wife after so many instances when the wife seeks to get a confirmation about the divorce from a Mufti the husband lies saying he never said like that are they still in a wedlock first of all the issues of divorce cannot be solved over the phone we have to take the couple to a Muslim court because this is a serious thing it's not like I have some traces on my trousers I don't know if they're Pure or impure um I was passing by and a dog touched me this is the difference between being married and living in a Haram relationship so it's not something to be taken lightly secondly a lot of the husbands divorce and then claim that oh I didn't intend it well you don't have to intend it the moment it comes out of your mouth you've divorced so what do you mean you did not intend it so no no I was angry so nobody divorces his wife while drinking green tea and some croissant and in the morning and they're happy and chit chatting and joking and then says I love you honey I divorce you Nobody Does this divorce takes place when you're agitated when you're angry when you're upset when you have some beef with your spouse thirdly it's not something that you can cross off and say okay let's start over there are only three divorces you divorce once one down two to go you divorce twice twice two down one to go you divorce the third time that's it game over okay can we reset no can we unplug the device and plug it again maybe we get three lives no end of the game you can't go back to her she's a total Nan mahalam to you you're living in Haram so now point three or four I don't know who's counting if they want to see counseling they go to a Mufti and the husband lies well actually it happened between both of us the two of us the husband and the wife the wife says he divorced me nine times and I have a list of it and I'm not a lunatic I'm not insane I'm a sane woman and the husband is lying said no prove it the judge acts upon what the husband said because he's a human being he doesn't have a crystal ball he doesn't know the Unseen only Allah knows the Unseen so how can he know which one is telling the truth and which one is lying he only acts upon what he sees and the man's word counts because he's the one who gives talaq and he's the one who reconciles so the man says no I did not divorce her nine times I only divorce her once in this case the judge says once is noted two to go what is the stance of the woman the woman cannot stay with him at all full stop it's between her and Allah is she saying yes does she remember that she was divorced three times or more yes how can we say to her go back and live with this man who had divorced you three times or more he's a stranger to you touching you is prohibited seeing you without hijab is prohibited let alone sleeping with you this is Zina so definitely she has to go back to her parents house and file for holler because the judge is not going to believe her so she has no option other than to file for color give him back his Dowry and seek Allah's Justice on the day of judgment from this oppressive man who is trying to force her to live in Haram and takes her money unlawfully and Allah Knows Best"
