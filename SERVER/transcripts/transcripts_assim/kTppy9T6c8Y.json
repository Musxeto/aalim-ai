  "title": "Hadith about eating Beef | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "- sent an email which yesterday's time was not sufficient to answer and she says in my city Hyderabad nowadays people are saying Prophet Muhammad sallallaahu ariados Elam personally never ate beef he just said it's halal and they are avoiding it can you give a reference did the Prophet Assam eat beef or not first of all it is quite strange for people to make assumptions but what is weird when their assumptions are related to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam so assuming that the prophet alayhi salat wa salam did not eat beef who are you to avoid it Jeff this is Sunnah okay the Prophet Isis am was proven from the authentication not to eat garlic or onions people have Hyderabad do you have the guts not to do that so share what do you mean most of our food is based on onions we can't live without onions so what will you do mmm okay mmm this is not sunnah share this is something that the Prophet did not do so we're not obliged to follow it subhanAllah when it suits your desires you make an way out for it when it doesn't you simply say that the Prophet did not do it knowledge is not taking this lightly you don't shoot from the hip you don't give verdicts like this without accountability without being responsible and this is what we had just talked about responsibility in Islam as our values you are not allowed actually to just state such generic and white statements without an proof cows were mentioned about among the live stocks in chapter 6 or 10 and I'm at the very end and Allah told us about the camels the cows the goats and the sheep eight pairs mentioned in the Quran not only that in the farewell Hajj pilgrimage the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam sacrificed cows on behalf of his wives and if it was bad he would not have done that he would not have harmed the poor who ate from this sacrifice so you don't have to have a specific hadith stating that the Prophet Allah saw some ate strawberries and he used to use jam and a peanut butter is breakfast what is this where is halal is known what is Haram is known now what made the people of Hyderabad and others come to this conclusion because there is a hadith where the prophet sallallaahu rere salem said that the milk of cows is a cure and means of healing and the meat of cows is an illness so that are okay al hamdulillah hadith authentic its authentic yet callous done wait a minute what do you mean by done see the Prophet said it is an illness you have to look what the scholars of Islam said you're not even know Quran or memorize it you don't even know Arabic and you just come and give verdicts like this left right and center this is not logical this is irresponsible so the hadith as some scholars said is referring to the cows living in Arabia because the meat is very harsh unlike the cows elsewhere where you get good meat go to South Africa and you if you find fine meat in Kenya and Uganda and all these places excellent cow meat beef that is not only that some scholars said that the hadith is referring to consuming a lot so if yes if you consume a lot of beef this is bad for your cholesterol levels and for your heart diseases that may develop but if you are regular and moderate there is nothing wrong in that so again - this is baseless what these people say"
