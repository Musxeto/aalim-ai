  "transcript": "so what about the salaat itself how to offer these two records of jummah well you have to pray two rakahs like culture in every aspect so is two rakahs it is pretty loudly though it's in the door and the sunnah in these two rakahs to recite Surat al ala in the first raka and Surat al Raja in the second dragon which is surah 62 and 63 and sometimes the Prophet used to recite Surat and you are one moon of a boon which is eighty seven well actually I think I mixed the numbers six is Pasha but if you recite anything else this is valid and this is why the vast majority of Imams usually do not stick to this depending on the time depending on their vocal cords sometimes people when they give a narration and they shout and they're so engaged with it when it comes to salat they find themselves out of steam they are unable to recite long surah so they choose short surahs this is valid this is permissible it's not mandatory to recite those other surahs analyze the Virgin knows best"
