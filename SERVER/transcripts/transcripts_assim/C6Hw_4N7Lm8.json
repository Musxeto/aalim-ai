  "transcript": "We have Abdul Mateen from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, if I made any mistake in Salah and after I recognized, what should I do? Should I repeat Salah? Thank you. Are you with the congregation? Are you praying with the congregation or alone? No, alone. So what is the mistake that you have done? Yes, Akhi, I'm listening to you. Yes, of course. Akhi, there is a difference between making a mistake in a Sunnah action, for example, raising the hands. This is Sunnah. If I raise one hand, if I don't raise hands, if I raise three hands, if you had three hands, there's no problem because this is a Sunnah action. And there are actions that are mandatory. So if you made a mistake in Ruku' and said, and then said, whoops, I did not say, So you missed such a mandatory act out of ignorance, out of forgetfulness. We compensate this by Sujud Al-Sahw at the end of the Salat. But if you dropped something that is a pillar, instead of praying four Raka'as of Dhuhr, you prayed three Raka'as, offered salutation, offered Salam and went home. And then you remember that somebody called you and he said, you prayed three Raka'as. You've dropped a pillar, which is a whole Raka'a composed of Ruku' and two Sujud and then your prayer is invalid. If you remember during the Salat, before you conclude it, know you make it up and you continue your Salat and Allah knows best."
