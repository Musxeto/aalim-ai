  "title": "Can we pray behind someone who commits innovation? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "muhammad from the u.s he says should i pray behind someone who commits innovation this is genetic muhammad because any person who's a muslim and his prayer is valid at the sight of allah for himself then his prayer as an imam is valid for me to pray behind him and innovation is divided into two types innovation that takes someone out of the fold of islam so if someone uh um does not believe in the beautiful names and attributes of allah if someone talks ill about something in islam if someone doesn't believe in uh the torment of the grave or in the sarat or does types of shirk all of these are innovations if he believes that you can invoke the dead in their graves and ask them for help and assistant this is shirk so such an innovation takes a person out of the fold of islam and you cannot pray behind him but if the innovation is making congregational dua after salah throwing a mauled to the prophet without any or the likes of what you had mentioned then prayer behind them is valid but it is not recommended"
