  "title": "Rights of a Muslim are to Accept invitations but what if I am invited to a b-day party? | Assim Al",
  "transcript": "from the emirates among uh one of the six rights of muslim over another muslim is if he invites you accept and relation so my question is what if the person is inviting you for a birthday or a marriage ceremony where there will be music or free mixing so what should be done in this case i think we should lift the invitation i will answer in the united arab emirates uh said that we know the hadith where the prophet said al-islam there are six rights upon every muslim for another muslim so um one of them is if he invites you you answer first of all this portion when he invites you not for every or any invitation for example i get people calling me tens and times a day come and have breakfast with us come have lunch with us come have dinner with us check we have this we have that if i were obliged to respond that would cause a lot of hardship for me and for my family the scholars say that the invitation that must be answered are a wedding invitation for marriage or when a child is born and you offer the sacrifice these are two legitimate invitations that you must respond and answer unless there is haram in it so if it's a wedding that has music or free mixing then definitely you must not attend even though answering it is one of the rights but not attending is one of allah's rights due to the sins involved similarly similarly if it if it was a birthday celebration or the likes which is not part of our religion or our culture"
