  "transcript": "if we were put in a situation where the non-muslims the enemies of islam are trying to kill us you told us that we should try to tolerate to be peaceful but if someone is trying to kill us to harm us real good so what should we do you don't be you don't need to be a rocket scientist the prophet said allah whoever dies while defending himself is a martyr whoever dies while defending his wealth his money is a martyr whoever dies defending his religion is a martyr whoever dies defending his honor is a martyr so yes if a group of people come and they intimidate you and they want to kill you no one in his sound mind would tell you just let them kill you another one bites the dust no defend yourself and if you had have to kill them all be my guest you are defending yourself and this is universal you don't have to be a rocket scientist to know this but what we were talking about previously is that muslims are weak and they are a minority they should not provoke such incidents but if the incident comes to me then definitely you have to stand up and be a real muslim"
