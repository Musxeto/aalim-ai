  "transcript": "foreign so I have a question about um my husband and I we decided that um I wanted I wanted the akula from him but I'm also under a comma and uh is he allowed in his plan for her to islamically divorce like I have kuna but it still retains The Economist because I want to stay here until I'm able to go back to my country to be legally married in the system but we are islamically divorced is that allowed this is allowed but it's against the law which makes it sinful so you can apply for holler or he can divorce you at court and he would give you Headway for six months or a year to be on his ekama giving up front the money for that so that you can try to look for a job or to better your life in a different way the color or the divorce is applicable and valid but you would be sinful for cheating the authorities because if anything would were to happen if one of you were to die the authorities know that you're still married you can come and say no no we divorce is it it wasn't registered so we will deal with you as if you're still married and The Inheritance laws and the likes with all follow and that would cause a lot of problems and Allah Knows Best"
