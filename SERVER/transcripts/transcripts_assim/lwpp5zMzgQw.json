  "title": "Does passing something in front of the one who is praying break their prayer? | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Zechariah says I know we can't pass in front of praying person but can we reach our arms in front of him to pick the Quran or any object that is beside him on his other side for example I will be sitting to his right and someone will pass me the Quran who is sitting to his left and we will pass the Quran in front of him while he is praying the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam prohibited walking in front someone who is praying to a sutra and we've explained that the sutra is an object that is a foot high a visor a screen that you put in front of you and you pray towards it so that people would identify that you're praying and they cannot violate your space but if a person does not pray to a sutra and someone wants to pass and walk in front of them he is entitled to do this providing it is beyond the place where he puts his forehead in so the prostration spot if he walks beyond that this is okay the question is what about if no I'm not going to walk in front but rather penetrate this space through giving something or taking something from someone on the other side so if I'm praying and the one sitting to my right hands something to the one sitting to my left and it's like a foot in front of me because he's giving and the other one is taking so would that be prohibited this would not be prohibited because this is not considered to be walking but it is inappropriate because of your invasion of his space and this breaks his concentration yet we cannot say it's prohibited in the sense that the prohibition in passing and the hand itself is not considered to be passing as in the authentic hadith where the Prophet alehsalaam was once in seclusion in ehtekaf in the Masjid and his house was adjacent to the Masjid so there was a door between them and in his house was Aisha may Allah be pleased with her who was in her menses so the Prophet said to her Ali asaram hand me that piece of garment so she said o prophet of Allah I'm in my menses I don't want to violate the purity of the Masjid the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam I know you are in your menses your menses is not in your hand meaning that when you hand it to me while your body is still in the house there's nothing wrong in that because the penetration of your arm to the vicinity of the message it does not or is not considered to be entering it with your body which is not permissible for a woman in her menses so I hope this answers your question"
