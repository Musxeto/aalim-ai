  "transcript": "but from Bangladesh so Chef my question is when we praying in congratulations straight after completing the order iyani he doesn't perform at the end of the first and the third raka in such a situation what should he do as a muktadi should we finish the Audra and estate and his tent directly or do Josh instead of her because I have heard from his kind of knowledge that we shouldn't do that in Masjid is it true first of all foreign pause where you sit after the second prostration of the first and the third Draka so I'm in the first raka I bow I Rise and then I offer pure prostration before standing up to the second raka I sit for a second or two and then I stand up for the second raka and likewise from the third to the Third raka what is this this is backed up by a Hadith of Malik may Allah be pleased with him in elsewhere where he described to the congregation to the people sitting how the prophet salallahu used to pray and he did this and none of the companions objected to it so some Scholars say this is a a preferred recommended Sunnah like Imam shafri and other schools of thought others say that no the prophet did this when he was old and he had to take this pose before standing up and this lacks evidence and proof so you have to present this with such proof to back your claim and justification said that it's a recommended Sunnah when praying in a hanafi Masjid or behind any man who doesn't offer it can we offer it again an issue of dispute some Scholars say no you should not offer it like and others other Scholars say that no this is a recommended Sunnah it takes no time at all it's it's a second delay or two so there is no problem in offering it and uh following the Imam and this is what I'm inclined to and Allah Knows Best"
