  "transcript": "you want to find which is the closest to pleasing Allah not the closest to pleasing people and this is why may Allah have mercy upon his soul said that the scholars are free the scholars are three categories number one a scholar of the state when Simon Says something he just signs in stamps whatever the uh rulers say he does exactly what they want and he manages to do a good job because people trust him category number two um a scholar of the nation in the sense that what do you guys want to listen to I'm I'm here just tell me okay so he caters for the people's needs and what they need and what they want to hear and this is not a genuine scholar unfortunately a lot of us are like this we want people to have a good time and if we can't break the rules might as well try to bend them a bit the third one is is the scholar of the religion he says what he says could care less about what the people say because he's giving what pleases Allah he's following the footsteps of the prophet of Allah sallallah alaih wasallam and not looking for likes followers people to praise him or compliment him and Allah Knows Best"
