  "transcript": "Tamjid from Bangladesh. Masha Allah we have callers from Bangladesh like crazy. May Allah Azza Wa Jal protect the people of Bangladesh and increase them in Iman and make them steadfast on Quran and Sunnah and raise In Sha Allah the Iman in their heart. Tamjid. Sheikh recently as a moderately practicing Muslim who wants to improve when I started to know about Islam more and saw how shaitan decepts people through media and entertainment. I started getting waswas or intense intrusive thoughts about shirk or kufr and I overthink a lot all day and even in my salah I cannot concentrate. What's your question? So I need your help how to fight this. The simple answer for all of this because this is not a counselling session. In a counselling session I could sit with you for 30 minutes and talk you out of it but in a Q&A question that is live the only thing for me to hint to you is one. Who is whispering in your ears you shaitan? Why is he whispering into your ears to take me to hell with him and stay there for eternity? Three. Is he your enemy or your friend and ally? No he's my adversary and enemy. Are you nuts? You know that all of this is from shaitan. Why are you obeying him? Why are you listening to him? He says oh I didn't know. Now you know. So ignore it and move on."
