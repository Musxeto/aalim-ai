  "transcript": "[Music] canada's first question and he says that whenever he squats or sits to wash his feet he doubts whether he passed wind or not and he gave the answer himself alhamdulillah with knowledge you annihilate you erase doubts and he gave the rule himself i didn't do anything so he said i just heard you say that doubts do not impact certainty and this is the ruling that the prophet gave us allah he said when anyone of you is praying he should not leave his prayer just for the thought that he had passed wind the thought itself does not break your prayer unless he hears a sound or finds an odor so a smell so if you are not certain whether i passed wind or not because sometimes you may pass wind without hearing a sound or without finding a smell to it but you are certain that you've passed wind khalas your widow is broken but if you're not certain then you have these two ways to judge either you find a smell or you hear a noise if you did not then your wudhu is still intact and you can continue to pray without breaking it"
