  "title": "Is it permissible to permanently straighten one's hair?",
  "transcript": "that is it permissible to permanently straighten my hair the confusion is that a lot of the people think where Allah prohibited changing changing the creation of Allah asael that the hair is included and this is not true because the hair is something to be adorned something to be beautiful I whether by curling it when it's too straight or by straightening it when it's too curled therefore doing and applying creatine for example or certain procedures to straighten it and soften it this is permissible providing that there is no extravagance some people may pay lots and lots of men of money to do this and providing that there is no harm medically when applying it because we've seen cases where people a little bit cross the line and end up becoming bold and their hair is lost or it falls or it's permanently damaged but if a woman or a man apply such chemicals or such natural substances in order to straighten or to fix their hair according to what they desire and wish and there's no harm uh uh on the individual through this process inshallah this is uh permissible whether it's permanent or temporarily but I very much doubt that there is something that is safe and it is permanent and we have to also bear in mind that the procedure does not involve forming a layer on the hair itself because if there is a layer formed on the hair this prevents water from reaching the hair when a person is performing a major uh ritual Purity so if he's taking a bath to uplift a major ritual impurity this layer formed on the hair whether through the softening uh uh chemicals or through dying uh it with different colors in this case this becomes prohibited because it prevents the water from reaching the hair and hence it would not be allowed"
