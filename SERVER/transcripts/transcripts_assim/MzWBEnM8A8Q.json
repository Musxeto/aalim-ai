  "title": "Great debate - Does a person become kafir if he abandons Salah? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "as many of you already know as our masjid is packed to the brim I'm the sister side as well upstairs in the back we've been blessed we've been honored to have the presence of one of the Imams of the Muslims because he is the imam of the masjid al-haram Sharif and Mecca a shape an imam abdul rahman irr sudais rahim allahu taala so he gave the hospital Juma here today at our Masjid and he's going to officially kick off the conference that we're going to have vietname now after salat and maghrib but I just wanted to say a few things very quickly before dealing with the format of the debate that's going to happen and that is we in the religion of Allah Islam have been commanded and we've been ordered to by laws with gel as our mother Aisha said ruddy Allah I was collected by an email Muslim in his MOOC Adama for Marilyn Nunez didn't ask - Elohim we have been commanded to put people in their proper places so the real Emma of Alyce land we put them in a high and exalted place our mothers and our fathers we put them in an exalted place the Muslim lady she puts her husband in a high and exalted place and so forth and so on so I shave and imam abdul rahman as two days we put him in a high place because he is as i mentioned one of the imams of the muslims because he is the one who's the main leader of the salah in mecca but in saying that brothers and sisters in el Aslam I don't know if I'll meet you people after today's meeting we shouldn't go overboard and any human being even with the prophets of allah wahda who suddenly shouldn't have a hulu and have excesses and extremes in our religion prophet told the people salallahu alayhi wa seldom yacuma Loulou a 15-4 enema halacha man conical oakum below louie 15 you Muslims beware of going overboard in your religion for verily those people who came before you the yahood and nasarah they were destroyed because they had excesses in the Dean so when people like the shame comes his personality many people come out many of our mothers our auntie's people who normally don't pray they come out to get the butter cut his recitation and that's a good thing we feel honored and blessed that in the city of Birmingham this is the Masjid way he prayed the salat of ajumma and we like to see the many numbers of the Muslims coming out but at the same time at the same time Allah slam does not accept that the people running behind his car jump on top of his car go crazy it's not our religion prophet told his companion sallallahu alayhi wa ali we seldom glad to tarun incoming a certain isara be several money when I can cool who abdullah he what a slow don't go overboard and Dilla with me sallallahu alayhi wasallam the way the Christians went overboard with a Seminole money but say that i am abdullah and rasool ullah abdullah in missoula so this is a masjid mr. da island hadith chawla and we are against innovations we're against in allahu taala and in saying that again from our religion from our methodology and our min Hajj is to put people in their proper places he is one of the Imams of the Muslims and part of respected him and honouring him is from our religion allahu taala mentioned in the quran radical men were anthem Shah yalla phenomen Tuckwell Kulu whoever exalts and makes high the symbols institutions of life that's a proof and an indication of the tuk wah that's in his heart so we respect him from that angle without going overboard yeah analyse land without going overboard for him or for other than him from the Imams who came before him or the moms who want to come after him inshallah or the Imams were living at this particular time yakumo lulu don't go overboard in your religion in regards honey to the issue of the debate that's going to be held I want to make the first point and the first point is that the baton in the religion of lslam is something that is disliked generally speaking the Muslim does not give himself to debating and controversies and argumentation in the religion for that reason Imam Ahmed rahimullah lutein and one of the classic works that he wrote a small book concise book I would invite you and courage you all to get this books been training is translated into English called a solo Sunna the fundamentals of the Sunna what is the al-qaeda and what is the methodology that the Muslim has to be a ban in his religion based upon the Quran and the Sunna he brought that one of the fundamentals of al-islam and there are many one of the fundamentals of al-islam is Terkel Amira well gee dal will ho Sumathi 15 that the Muslim abandon arguing dispute ations controversies and parlin and their issues of the religion is something that's not permissible to spend time arguing with a person about a particular point so many people when they come to the religion of Allah slam and their new Muslims or many of our brothers and sisters who allow with Allah guides them to the understanding of the Sunnah after not knowing the Sunnah many times we read the Quran and read the hadith in the states of the scholars with the media of fighting and debating and quarreling with those who are around us from our relatives so that's not from our religion to debate and to quarrel and there are a number of I add a number of hadith that show improve this right the statement of Allah who is part of what either Duke of Apple as them to watch you Lila one minute Thurber and tell them oh honey if they argue with you the mushrik own if they argue with you about your religion and what you upon then simply tell them I have turned my face to Allah with sincerity me and those people who follow them I'm not here to debate you must be calm I'm not here to argue with you the hawk is clear to me there are a number of ayat in this regard so debating in the men Hajj acidity from the azul of the menage ascetic he is for you not to engage and debate in an arguing with people especially people who don't want to hear the truth they don't want to they don't want to accept the truth they just argue for the sake of argument but there is a type of argumentation that is permissible the argumentation that nor made with his people salah whathe ye wilson my lady the argumentation that Ibrahim made with his people the argumentation that rules are made with firown' and Wilson made with the magicians that moves Tommy where the people from Benyus Rahil re subrahmanyam salah whathe where you said i'm wanting a domain there is a type of argument that is permissible the argumentation in which the person and the people involved are trying to establish the truth or they're trying to get to the bottom of the truth and that's what we hope to exemplify here today where the two speakers and I will be the moderator in sha allah where the two speakers are going to debate an issue with etiquette and with de miel proofs in an issue of the scholars of al-islam and FG life in its regard but the most important thing here is for us to take a look at the means and the of the correct way of debating and arguing in the religion of Alice level so before the people come before us we want to remind you picture taken in the Dena of Islam when this for sheikh abdul-rahman as su days or other than him it's from the tribe at year so if you can refrain from taking pictures this is being issued sha allah that will be better for you will be better for the speakers as well so without any further ado f1 without any further ado we're going to begin our program and we have with us the two speakers who are going to debate this particular issue with the etiquette on the idea of a listen to my immediate left we have our brother from the pioneers we have our brother I will Amina Bulow Phillips and he is going to speak secondly and the first speaker is going to speak and here's our brother who also came all the way from Saudi Arabia and he was our guest here and our previous conference to share and uh awesome Hakim awesome look man and Hakim he's going to speak first for 30 minutes he's going to put his issues across with their proofs and then after that our brothers shinja will be loud he's going to also speak for 30 minutes about the same issue and then we'll go back to the first speaker who had 10 minutes to make his rebuttal or to make whatever closing remarks that he wants to make in regards to the issue and then the second speaker will also be afforded the same opportunity so without any further ado we'll begin beating nahi Thailand this debate which is centered around a serious issue and that issue is the issue of the one who abandons the salaat in lsland me the speaker has time to talk about the virtues of a Salah that the first thing that allows with gel is going to ask you about you'll know qiyamah is your Salah the thing that the Companions are of the Ilan who did not see the abandonment of anything other than it as being disbelief they don't have the time to deal with the virtues of it but that's the issue at hand what is the ruling concerning the individual who abandons the salat out of lazy's Allen a laziness and as a result of being negligent does he go outside of the fold and the pale of understand or is he's still considered to be a Muslim so we're going to have our brother and awesome it's going to begin inshallah finally at the Fidel much poorer left cinematical tomorrow Sheila had a hand over him hundred alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa happy he was holding in amin nabina muhammad in allah and he was of a woman todav√≠a he was in the vicinity he in Alma Dini America the issue of a person abandoning salat whether he is a kafir or not is an issue that scholars of Islam had disputed upon L Imam Ahmed even humble may Allah have mercy on his soul said that whoever abandons salat is a kafir and he is to be asked to come back to Islam by performing prayer if he insists he is to be executed as a non-muslim and he would be treated as such Imam Abu Hanifa I remember Malik and aleem am a chef era may Allah have mercy on them all said that he is not a kafir but as is my Malik and Imam Shafi said he should be asked to come to pray and if he doesn't he would be executed but not as a kafir as a Muslim and he would be treated as a sinful Muslim and they different again and again and as Muslims whenever we have difference in opinion among scholars we on the day of judgment are questioned by allah azza wajal in regards to our response to what the Prophet RS Salado Saddam had said not to the differences among scholars and that is why Allah the Almighty says and if you differ in anything among yourselves be fed it to Allah and his messenger sallallaahu Rd how do you sell them if you believe in Allah and in the last day therefore I'm gonna put forward some of the evidences from the Quran and from the Sunnah regarding this topic of selected few because the time limits me not to go in details so the first verse is in surah at-taubah where allah azzawajal says but if they repent perform salat and give zakat then they are your brethren in religion so Allah Azza WA JAL is talking about the pagans if they do these three things then they are our brethren they are Muslims and that is they are to repent from shirk from associating others with Allah and they are to pray and they are to performs a cat so if they repent they say Allah Allah and Allah but they don't perform prayer and they don't give zakat they are not Muslims they are not our brothers if they do two out of three which is they say la ilaha illallah and they pray but they don't give zakah it is supposed to be that again they are not Muslims but there is a hadith and the Sohae where the prophet of allah tells us that those who do not give zakat it is up to allah whether to forgive them or to put them in hell forever it's up to allah azza wajal so this is or this does not fall under the criteria of being something that makes a person abandons islam if he does not pay the count so we remain with prayer if a person does not pray but he believes in allah azza wajal and according to this verse of Toba he is not considered to be a brother of ours he's not considered to be a Muslim another verse in Surat and with death there where allah azzawajal tells us that the believers and when there in paradise they asked those who were with them but they were thrown into hell and Allah so Allah tells us what has caused you to enter hell they will say those are who are in hell we were not of those who used to offer their salat this is the first reason and then they give three other reasons so the prime reason was they were not considered to be among those who prayed and if you go on to look at other verses of the Quran you will find that there were sins committed major sins yet the Quran described those committing these sins as brothers of ours as in the case in murdering a Muslim this is one of the worst major sins allah azza wajal tells us that whoever kills a believer intentionally his recompense is hell to abide therein and the wrath and curse of allah are upon him and a great punishment is prepared for him those who kill a Muslim intentionally but at the same time allah azza wajal tells us about those who fight against each other and may kill one another after the killing has taken place Allah says in surah al-baqarah but if the killer is forgiven by his brother who is related to the person killed so Allah so just described him to be his brother though he is the killer of an innocent person yet the relative of the deceased the relative of the person who was killed is described in the Quran by his brother so the killer and the relatives are brothers so allah azza judge did not tell us that those who committed this major sin of killing is not your brothers anymore but regarding prayer Allah the Almighty told us that if they repent perform prayer and cat then there are your brothers in religion as for the Sunna jabberin abdullah may allah be pleased with him and with his father told us the hadith the famous hadith where the profits of the Maharani who are selling them in different narrations said the difference between us and them is salat who is us and who is them we the Muslims and them are the non-muslims so the difference between us and them is salat whoever neglects it is a kafir and this was reported by Muhammad and others and in another so he is not the Prophet said Alice ought to sell am nothing stands between man and cover and shirk disbelief associating others with Allah nothing separates him nothing stands between him and that except prayer the Prophet says Alice awesome whoever neglects it becomes a kafir and a mushrik and this is a commentary from those who translated but the Prophet did not say this re salatu salam and this was reported by a limit Muslim in the Sahay now the Prophet Allah saw Salam drew the line and he said this is the nine separating Muslims from non-muslims and this is Allah the the vow or the oath between us and them so when you draw the line this means that who of whoever crosses the line is not a Muslim and it is the only form of deeds that the prophet called are in solution whoever does this is not a Muslim and he specifically said Al Kooper with the identification article al he did not say go for he said a little Co for the thing that causes I'll cover and another hadith the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam i'm not going to go into details because of the time the prophet tells us a little opsin about rulers to come and they will rule the muslims he's telling the companions and he tells them so lala haria Selim that you will know things and you will reject things you will know things that are in accordance to the Quran and the Sunnah but you will reject things that you think that they are not in accordance to Islam so companions being hot-blooded and being so strict to their belief and abiding by it said o prophet of Allah shall we fight them if they do evil things if they commit sins and do things that we do not recognize to be from the Quran or synonym shouldn't we fight them so the Prophet told them a day his salat WA Salam know as long as they pray as long as they pray so the Prophet gave them only one excuse we did not mention salat sorry he did not mention the cat fasting Hajj we did not mention anything else he just said as long as they are praying leave them you have to obey them you have to follow them you have to give them your allegiance now in another hadith also in Sahih Imam Muslim the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam called for the pledge of allegiance to the our rulers and that you have to obey them in good or bad and ease and difficulties in all your conditions so and you should not do anything to go out of their allegiance unless the Prophet says Allah salat wa sallam he said unless they made a blunt show of cover and you have evidence from Allah that what they are doing is indeed tougher and this hadith is agreed upon by Bukhari and Muslim so if you compare apples to apple you'll find that the Prophet Allah salatu salam is telling us in the first hadith you have to obey them as long as they pray and the other hadith you cannot disagree with them or go out and make a mutiny or fight with them unless you have and see a blunt blatent chosen Latins it's a blatant show of cavora cheating's and you have evidence from allah on it and this means that abandoning salah is equal to comfort and that is why you obey your rulers unless they abandon salah or commit something that is considered to be go for and there is a hadith which was regarded and authenticated by sheikh al albani may Allah have mercy on his soul where the Prophet says Allah salatu salam about prayer whoever preserves praying on time it will be light and evidence and means of anna jet of being rescued on the day of judgement and whoever does not observe it and maintain praying it which shall not be light for him and it shall not be an evidence for him and he will not be rescued on the day of judgement on the contrary he will be on the day of judgment with Pharaoh with Haman with our wood and with obey even halluf the head of disbelief in this world and this proves that whoever does not observe Salah he will be with those kafir in hell and if you look in the Quran and Sunnah never you will ever find evidence stating that a person who does not pray will not is not a kafir a person who does not pray is a believer all what you'll find is general evidences stating that whoever says la ilaha ilallah purely from his heart will enter paradise but it doesn't say what this hadith implies because you could say la ilaha illallah and disbelief in something else or you can say la la la la and prostrate to a statue or to the grave of a dead person and this nullifies Islam even if he said I'll Allah a hundred times and the Prophet says la sala to say I'm also in a hadith authenticated by shell advance may Allah have mercy on his soul he's advising his companion he says do not associate others with Allah even if they chop you into pieces and they burn you alive and do not abandon a mandatory prayer intentionally because whoever abandons it intentionally Fahad vari-etch Min Ho's Vilma he is not considered to be a Muslim and do not consume intoxicants because it's the key for every evil and we believe that this is the consensus of scholars at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and onwards the companions of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam as reported by Abdullah Habashi Shakib they said that he said that the Companions of the Prophet Allah Salaam Salaam did not consider any deeds being abandoned to be kufur with the exception of prayer so the Companions thought - that if you abandoned fasting this a major sin and you are on great in danger but you're still a Muslim if you have had that pilgrimage if you abandoned paints the cat it's a major sin but as long as you believe in it you are still a Muslim but they thought and they believed that whoever abandoned prayer is committing coup for he is not a Muslim and this is a consensus of the companions of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and it was also reported that Omar may Allah be pleased with him I'm management Alf Mahadevan jebel abou Hawaii and many other of the Companions such as Abdullah II miss Road nabis October Abdullah Abu Darda they are all considered those who abandon salat intentionally to be non-muslims to be Co far is happy bin de la hoya may Allah have mercy on him one of the Companions of I met in Hamburg may Allah have mercy on him also said that the majority and he's talking about himself and the people at his time thought that whoever delays whoever postpones prayer and he does not pray it intentionally there until the following prayer is due he said that all the Companions from the prophet's time Salalah Selim and the scholars up till date they considered him to be careful there are so many evidences I still have ten minutes I believe and I don't want to go into details technical details because then you tend to forget the main points but the difference is not that big and it's more of a theoretical difference because all Muslims without any exception believe that if a person abandons a lot thinking that it is not mandatory he is Catherine if you don't believe in salat you are kafir even if you pray five times a day and you perform excellent evolution and you make the center before prayer and after prayer if you maintain praying five times a day but you don't believe that it is mandatory this person is kafir there is no difference among scholars in this if you believe that zakat is not mandatory he's a kafir a person believing that fasting is not Ramadan fasting Ghana is not mandatory he is a kafir even if he performs it but the only pillar of Islam where we have the prophet aerosol artists are not identifying this by saying whoever believes that prayer is not mandatory is a kafir he said whoever abandons he did not mention your belief he mentioned not actually praying the only deeds or pillar of Islam is this prayer and that is why we always say that it's a technicality even Tamiya says may Allah have mercy on his soul that if you bring someone and you tell him to pray and he refuses and you show him the evidences proving that if you don't pray you're not a Muslim he says well I believe prayer is mandatory and I believe in the verses of the Quran and the hadith of the Prophet as of Sam but I'm not going to pray and if he is brought in front the Muslim ruler and the ruler who has the authority not you and I will have no authority on anyone at all this is to be done by the Muslim ruler and the ruler tells him you have to pray or we'll chop your head off he says I'm I completely agree with you I believe in Salah I'm not gonna pray we leave him for three days and nights we threaten him what a big plasma you know executions and beheading and people dying in graveyards every morning we come and say you wanna pray nope you have 10 hours left one hour left we show him the sword we got to behead you now says I believe it's mandatory I'm not gonna pray amen Tamia says once you chop his head off he is not a Muslim because after all of this and he's brought with the evidence and he is asked to pray and he refuses then he is rejecting the concept otherwise he would have done it therefore I end my talk by saying we have to look at how to apply this verdict because it's being misused among the Muslims I get almost 4 or 5 calls every week from sisters saying yes yes my husband is abusing me he does this he does that he married twice thrice four times and he's doing that he's not supporting me and he doesn't pray because when she says itself you have to be patient you have to be tolerant you have to do this and when she sees that it's coming to a dead end she says he doesn't pray so so she's confidential then he's not my husband then I can go and get a remarry again it is a very serious thing to tell your brother that he's a kafir it's it's a serious thing the Prophet tells us understand whoever tells his brother yeah kafir it will go up and and look if he is truly kafir that will fit him if it is not it will bounce back on the person who said that therefore it is not to us to label people as kafir never ever go into that swamp of labeling people classifying people he's a calf Simmi cough I don't think couple of weeks you'll be a kafir' or so no it's not your duty we're talking about a technical thing that can be only ruled by judges by rulers by scholars of Islam so you don't label someone because you don't see him pray that he's a kafir I've never seen him pray maybe he prays in his bedroom maybe praise when you're away maybe he prays when you're in the message no I never go to the Masjid I'm always with him so you're not praying as well maybe he prays when you pray so don't go into that swamp but you have to know that if a person abandons prayer intentionally he's not a Muslim and this is as far as the Companions of the Prophet that I saw some thought and the scholars of the hadith and this is what I believe and let's hear inshallah what the other side of the story is Allahu Alem when especially me Aslam Solo saline water cannot be also nabina muhammad just Allahu ta ala katana shaken up awesome passages ah what he put forth and he was generous enough to finish before the allotted time there are six minutes remaining and in the art of debate in Islamic Lee as I mentioned there are a lot of issues to be discussed and mentioned how did our ulema al-islam debate how did they go about debating and we come to understand and we come to know that in the art of debate in lsland there are some advantages and there are some disadvantages or going first so we thank him for his bravery for accepting to go first but in order to be fair and to be just and not to give the other brother the chef's table now I mean a five extra minutes I just want to ask him from what he said from the proofs of the person who abandons a salon and a negligence he mentioned some ayahs of the Quran some of the hadith of the Prophet sallallahu re who sell them and the statements of the ranima of Islam I want to know he mentioned one hadith has said the one who banned is the salat the meaning of which the one who balanced the salat will be raised up yellow clamor in the company of around and her man and will be able to health and other than those people Lana to llahi I laid him so I believe he said that and Imam and Albania said this hadith was authentic Allahu Alem so he wanted to get clarification on that is that what he said concerning that particular dealing well I've looked it up and say he'll Jam and Cheryl Advani may Allah have mercy on his soul graded it that's Hassan I don't know if he graded it as week elsewhere but this is what I found inside her jammer the other point because we have three more minutes and we don't want to be unfair to I will be into a ship awesome the Sheikh mentioned that it was an aged man consensus and he mentioned some of the names of the Companions and other than them who were of the opinion by abandoning the Salah out of negligence in Aden laziness was covered so now the question that presents itself Sheikh is if this is the case then isn't it impermissible for the other scholars to go against the iijima well ala muhammadin humble may Allah have mercy on his soul said that whoever claims each man is a liar and this is his words not mine and he said that how do you know that they didn't differ if I come to you now and said and Hum Dil all the scholars of Islam today say that mortgage is Haram one would jump and say listen there is this scholar in the the country of walk walk and he says that it's not harm so whoops then this is a lie but I've mentioned what the scholars mentioned so now a local free died said be carefully this is not covered said what of the live machete who is Atteberry reported and it has him may Allah have mercy on his soul also reported that this is the aged man since and I was happy ma la jolla or raha way depending whether you're doing it in the literal literal sense or in accordance with how you pronounce his name also reported that this is the consensus in his view now this might be questioned and it can be easily rejected by saying that if it's the consensus then no one can leave this but this is what they've reported is it true that it's the consensus of scholars after the Companions the answer is known before the Companions yes the Companions as reported by Abdullah Hamish appear that they did not see anything considered to be Co for if you abandoned it with the exception of salat now those who say well I made this agree with you because we believe that qu4 can have different meanings but I don't want to jump in to share about Mina's Yanni presentation and Allah knows best okay honey with that there's only one minute remaining of his time in which we are going to now call forward our brother Abu Amina to present his presentation insha Allah Tala for the full duration of 30 minutes failure to fulfill much core hamdulillah was salat WA Salam o Rasul Allah all praise due to Allah Allah's peace and blessings be on the last messenger of allah the topic of whether a person who abandoned Salah is a disbeliever or not is one about which scholars are in agreement with regards to two aspects because this could be looked at from three different perspectives the first perspective one in which a person abandoned Salah and denies its obligation in such a case a person that person is considered to be a disbeliever he's excommunicated from Islam and there's no difference among the scholars with regards to such an individual the second case where a person abandons the Salah but he holds that the Salah is still an obligation so his abandonment is one in which he has an action abandoned the prayer but in his heart he hasn't abandoned it because he still maintains its obligation in this case the scholars hold unanimously that if he is threatened with death and choose his death over prayer even though he is saying I don't consider it I do consider to be an obligation they are still unanimous in holding that he is a disbeliever because it is inconceivable that such a person who in his heart held that prayer is an obligation he is threatened with death and he would prefer death of a prayer at Sheridan Albani had said this is impossible it is inconceivable that person's choice of death / Salah is evidence clear evidence that his statement of recognition of Salah still being an obligation is a false statement so the third category is the category in which the differences really arose and that is the case where a person abandoned Salah out of laziness now a person who banded abandoned Salah out of laziness we call them today Friday Muslims or Ramadan Muslims so during Ramadan they will pray Friday they pray but the rest of the time they don't so they're praying sometimes and they're not praying other times now the issue here is they have abandoned Salah for part of the time those who hold as my brother pointed out that the abandonment of Salah means you are a disbeliever their position is that even if you pray sometimes you're still a disbeliever once you have abandoned the prayer you're a disbeliever abandoned it for a period of time you're a disbeliever that is the essence of their position now what happens in that position is that they differ is it one prayer so you miss one prayer you abandon one we're taking you to the gallows or is it two or is it more than that is it a whole day or is what the problems now come to determine and define what constitutes abandonment they've entered into a door abandonment and trying to now set a number becomes a problem because everybody in his heart when you hear the man abandoned once Allah and there's some among those who will take that position one is enough that's it problematic if this were the case I think most of us would be taken to the gallows today given the situation Muslims today abandoning prayer it happens so the other position one which is held by Sheikh Agatha mean along with Sharon Bonnie among the leading scholars of this time was that a person who abandoned Salah on occasion sometimes but prays at other times holding that it is an obligation such a person should not be labeled a disbeliever such a person should not be labeled a disbeliever otherwise for on one hand we're going to be labeling the majority of the OMA the majority of the OMA will end up being labeled disbelievers so the issue of what constitutes abandonment is really the crux of the whole argument now Chicago same in argues that if we look at the Hadees these are the Hadees which were mentioned by my brother awesome the Hadees banal Co free well Iman Turkish Allah and others Allah led banana obey no Messala from enterica ha pocket kaffir the what is referred to in the hadith here is not follow without with without al-islam this is a technical linguistic issue you have salah and Isola two terms as salah is the definite form the prayer Salah means a prayer now in these hadith the term which is used is the Salah so they argue that what is your referring to here is a complete abandonment of Salah where the person is not praying at all in this case where a person does not pray at all any time not known to pray this person yes that is what the hadith is referring to one who has in fact abandoned Salah in its totality and that is a Salah as to Salah a prayer or two or three that is not what the hadith is referring to we also have the other issue which my brother also pointed to or alluded to which is part of the argument for those who say that it abandonment doesn't indicate disbelief the totality is the fact that the term coffer is used in by the Prophet SAW Salem in a variety of other circumstances in other Hadees where the Prophet Muhammad SAW Solomon said that one who has sexual relations with his wife in her anus is a disbeliever or during her periods is a disbeliever this term disbelief is mentioned there and the scholars are unanimous with no known exception that such a person is not in fact a disbeliever he has done an act of disbelief meaning that is the that's what disbelievers do they commit sodomy they have sexual relations during menses that is common practice amongst them so when a Muslim does it he shares that quality with them and his act is an act of the disbelievers but it doesn't necessarily make him a disbeliever meaning that not every act of disbelief makes a person a disbeliever a person may under some circumstances we know at many examples from the life of the Companions and the Prophet SAW solemn where people committed acts which we know are acts of disbelief praising the idols on the torture like a martini Azam when he made these statements of this bill under torture prophet muhammad saw salem sanctioned his statements of disbelief so though he had made these statements of disbelief it didn't in fact turn him into a disbeliever so we have this issue of for consideration because of which some scholars held that as our brother mentioned that the abandonment of Salah in general out of laziness definitely was not considered to be kufur I did not excommunicate one from Islam and this was the position of leading scholars like imam malik and Shafi and others so if we look then at the argument which was made early in our brother awesome concerning the ayah from the Quran in which Allah said but if they repent and establish Salah and give zakah then they are your brothers in religion implying that if they don't and they're not your brothers in religion however as she asked him himself mentioned if they didn't give zakah it is known and well known and accepted that that doesn't take them out of Islam their evidences from statements of the prophets allah wa sallam and others that this doesn't take them out of islam simply doing that unless of course they denied its obligation like those who opposed abu bakr or the law one who refused to pay this akka claiming that it was not an obligation on them it was an obligation on them while the Prophet SAW salam was alive but once he died it was no longer an obligation so abu bakr radiallahu anhu then summon the Sahaba and they fought them and killed them as a result of it why because they were denying its obligation but for those who didn't deny its obligation it is unanimous among the Sahaba and those who came after them that such an individual is not considered to be a disbeliever he may be punished he didn't pay zakah the punishment is promised us and specified was that half his wealth would be taken from him so it was a punishment for him but not death so if that is the case of zakah and the two are mentioned together in the in the verse you can't then choose to say well that's not the case in the cab but it is the case in Solano they're both mentioned together if one does not make him no longer your brother in religion then neither does the other you don't have sufficient evidence to make that exception especially when the evidence which is being used is used which indicates complete abandonment and we're not talking about here laziness and especially in a where a person is actually praying certain times and not praying at other times so this basically constitutes the main argument for those who hold that salah that the abandonment of salah by a person on occasion is not enough to make a person a disbeliever but only when that person abandons the salah altogether not known to pray at any time in the past not known to pray even if for example he prayed last Ramadan is not prayed you've known him for the last eight nine months you haven't seen him pray but the point is that he did pray last Ramadan he is known to pray in Ramadan then that is enough to keep him within the fold of Islam and in terms of being merciful to the Ummah then definitely that is the most merciful position so the arguments that I've mentioned are the main arguments used and inshallah I think the position held by these scholars is in fact the more correct position and I think that most of you agree inshallah for your own sake okay honey um this is no doubt an academic type of presentation as opposed to what we've been used to and we wanted to change things up a little bit this year try a few different formats and this is one of the changes that were dealing with so it requires shall lie your attentive listening and your suffered as well so our brother I will Amina he's finished his presentation 15 minutes before the a lot of time so as to take advantage of what remains of the time shall I have a few questions that we want to put forth to him and the art of debating in Ellis lab is that the person gives his point of view and he gives his proofs and as long as his proofs are looking at you and staring you in the face you have to deal with those proofs you can't just give your proofs and his proofs are still staring you in the face his proofs from the Quran and the Sunnah so chef awesome he gave ayats and he gave a hadith from the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam ala ba-ba-boo Amina he dealt with those arguments the points of view of the other side he made for us the turkey lore he explained to us where is the point of difference and talked about some of the practical aspects of the point of view of the other side that don't make sense so we want to ask him because he didn't mention in the ayahs he didn't mention any hadith of the Prophet sallallaahu on who sent them would he like to take this time out sha Allah to share with us do the scholars of al-islam who disagree with the other side present any Delille from the Quran Allah from the Sunnah in fact the scholars from that side from the side which I am linked with do present certain verses but for the sake of simplicity I just dealt with the arguments used from the other side because technically speaking it is sufficient for me if I explain the arguments used from the Quran and the Sunnah of the other side that is sufficient to clarify but as our brother has opened the door for other evidences I can mention some but again not to confuse the matter because some of these arguments you know are very fine they're dealing with long Hadees and is picking out only a few lines here for you to really grasp what is going on may not be so easy but anyway among the arguments used from those who consider that the abandonment of Salah is not covered in and of itself and you see again this is I mentioned that I'm not dealing with the position of those who took that as a general position but dealing with with those who took it with regards to a person who prays sometimes and abandons it sometimes that is really the fine point from the Quran we have in surah an-nisa verse 48 or this may be a mature exactly if it's miss Abbot the verse in Nilachal ayah Pharaoh and you shakabooey welfare Amadou Nadal Akali manya mayuri billahi Fahad but if Torah if man of EEMA indeed Allah does not forgive that should be committed with him but he forgives what is other than that for whomsoever He wills but this verse expresses that every sin for which forgiveness was not asked may be forgiven by Allah except Shahrukh even Cooper may be understood as included except for the fact that there are many verses and hadith which confirm that Cooper will not be forgiven so the verse in and of itself leaves an open implication of course for those people who hold that Cooper is every form of Kufa shirk and every form of shield is kufur then that's a whole nother set of arguments concerning it but the verse is specific about shirk and about Allah forgiving everything else other than that so where this term is used it is understood that even within this - shirk is forgiven we have verses which in the other statements about solemn which indicate that - sure can be forgiven so the issue of Cofer which is mentioned in the Hadees those who take the position that it is it doesn't mean what it says meaning that it is preferred unna kufur it is a lesser form of Cofer not one which takes you outside of Islam but an act of Cofer which only becomes a means to take you out of Islam if it's also connected connected to it is actual disbelief in the obligation of Salah the other evidence is from the Sunnah said the Hadees are somewhat long and I feel that presenting it will just you know make it more difficult for people to grasp what is it really getting at but if we take one of the shorter ones there are three things I swear by Brussels selamat said from Aisha are you Laura Ann huh this hadith which is rated so here and there ad he there are three things I swear by that the law will not make one who has a share of Islam like one who has no share the shares of Islam are three Salah fasting and zakah so the hadith gives one who pays akka and abandon Salah and fasting a share in Islam and vice-versa here the hadith there are three things I swear by that Allah will not make one who has a share of Islam like one who has no share out of the three things one who has a share one out of the three will not be like one who has no share none other than three and the shares of Islam are three what are the three shares it is Salah fasting and zakah so if abandonment of Salah expelled one from Islam the one who abandoned it while fasting and pray paying zakah would not have a share of Islam that's what it would mean thus this hadith indicates that the abandonment of Salah is not in fact major Kiefer these were points to the other the two approaches were said to the Hadees that the brother meant our brother mentioned a share has he mentioned one that Khufu referred to in the hadith is the lesser form not the major form which takes you out of Islam the other approach is that it the abandonment referred to in the hadith is absolute and complete abandonment and not abandoning part of the time while praying some of the time so those are among the hadith we also have another hadith from a body or body even Samet Islamic who said Allah has written five prayers on the slaves whoever brings them without allowing any of them to be lost or chling there right then he has a covenant with Allah and he will end to him into paradise whoever does not come forth with them then he has no covenant with Allah and if he wishes he will punish him and if he wishes he will forgive him if he wishes he will punish him and if he wishes he will forgive him but now if it was in fact kufur in the big sense major Kiefer then how is Allah going to forgive him at that stage if it is in fact major cooker here the hadith again Allah has written five prayers on the slaves whoever brings them without allowing any of them to be lost or belittling their right then he has a covenant with Allah and he will enter him into paradise person who does it does it as its required doesn't miss out on any of them it's guaranteed prioritize and whoever does not come forth with them he doesn't bring them either all of them or some of them then he has no covenant with Allah if Allah wishes he will punish him and if Allah wishes he will forgive him so what is referring to here what makes sense here is that the disbelief that is referred to is disbelief in action it is not major coup for cofrin akbar but it is cofilin also harder as we have Circle Akbar and sheer colossal r1 which takes you out of Islam one which decreases the value of your deeds gives you punishment etc so this are calls for a distinction between the two so these are among and I said there are a number of others most of the others are quite long and I think these shorter ones gives you an idea that there are other evidences even within the Sunna which indicate that the abandonment of Salah and especially where it is sometimes and not other times and this is the one that I focused on because this is the one where the vast majority Breann the one where it is abandoned completely then they all agree most of them agree that such a person is shin Se all most of them agree that such a person is out of Islam if he has abandoned it not known to pray at all that's complete abandonment so we talked about Isola so lie in its totality not just Salah two minutes remaining shallow for about a minute so we want to suspend one of his two minutes and make it equal the extra minute that was left by our brother hospital now we shall love without a boat speakers will be allowed a ten minute rebuttal if they use the lesser than those ten minutes then nothing is going to be said and nothing is going to be done so all five minutes I'm sorry five minutes for both speakers because we have to be done by nine o'clock inshallah so brother awesome ship awesome if you have a rebuttal or additional points you want to make you can do so now this is not fair five minutes five miss is not enough yeah I need the ships that ahead gave us a lot of things that had to be answered back but in a nutshell he agrees with me that those who abandon salat completely are considered to be covered true it's some video hamdullah now I come to one of the hadith he mentioned which is that those who have share in Islam and those who do not have share in Islam and the Prophet mentioned salat zakat and fasting and he said that if you abandon one and you do two then you have share of Islam then you still a Muslim his agreement with me states that no we have to understand this hadith in a different way and the share is that if a person present let's go he doesn't pray perfectly or he doesn't fast on time or he skips few days or he doesn't pay zakat but not to abandon Salah because abandoning Salah is covered by the verses of the Quran and hadith of the Prophet are a sort of cinnamon hadith about the Muhammad the chef has mentioned the shorter version the longer version states that Allah so Allah shall have said so sallallahu taala who are the very bad femine sullivan le rock to him no I said I would never push were on the Autoport oven what's with the whole Kerala for after in the law now you translate the Prophet said that I saw to Salaam that these five prayers if you pray them on time and you perfect their evolution and you perfect their submissiveness and kosher and you perfect the record and you perfect the sea Jude then you have a covenant with Allah to forgive your sins but if you don't and any logically speaking if you don't refers not to not pray it refers to perfecting your evolution praying on time your submissiveness to recover your suit etc and the share stated the verse in Surat Annisa which was mentioned twice in the Maya a few Roy you shall akka be aware field by doing a dedicated ma'sha'allah such as does not forgive those who associate others with him and he forgives to those who he wishes who do not associate others with Allah this is a general verse and also the hadith that he did not mention which was a long hadith in the shafa'a in the intercession it's also a long hadith that it is a general hadith that states general concept but it does not stand in front the specific description which our prophet allosaurus Arum told us on the day of judgment i cannot say to the prophet alayhi salatu salam you told us that the line separating a person from shark cover and islam is prayer whoever abandoned is a kafir this is a description that the Prophet gave erase a lot o Sam to a person who does not pray I cannot say no it's it's a different concept it's not the description that the Prophet has given I have to stick with what the Prophet RA saw it was sanam described and labeled this person and that's why if a person does not associate others with Allah but commits one of the acts that nullifies Islam as there are acts that nullifies your would your evolution there are acts that nullifies Islam so if a person says la ilaha illallah and he makes jokes about our prophet eraser - Salam is he a Muslim of course not this nullifies is Islam if a person says Lyda Hill Allah and commits shirk as well I can read it this way it's five so it goes on and on but in a nutshell the nutshell is getting a little bit bigger where to go next yes you got me confused anyhow a committing an act of disbelief the chef says and he agrees with me whoever abandon sprayer completely is not a Muslim he's a kafir which hand Allah although he believes that it is mandatory but he doesn't pray at all he's a kafir and this is exactly what we're saying if a person skips a prayer or two or he's a Friday prayer worship Allah or a Ramadan worshipper we believe that he is not a Muslim as long as he's not labeled as a person praying it's like a person going to school only to attend the physical education class he skips chemistry physics everything but when it's time for sports he goes once a week to do his cricket or rig rugby or whatever and he goes back at the end of the year is he considered to be a student of that school no he's not and likewise if a person prays once every blue moon if he praise only in Roma Bahn and the rest of the year he doesn't pray at all he's not considered to be among those worshippers and Allah knows mr. Soglin share about Amina you can in Takashi hamdulillah salat WA Salam salida the final point which was the crux of the argument which I made in the beginning the difference between a Salah and Salah was not dealt with this point is the point which I loose a mean though he comes from a tradition of Saudi scholars who declare one who abandons even once Allah as a kafir right this is a very strong position held in Saudi Arabia now if a mean comes out of that tradition known as one of the top legal scholars you know the folk are the leading folk AHA of Saudi Arabia on an international scale he left that position held by the rest of his other scholarly friends and teachers etc he abandoned their position and took the position that that person is not declared to be a disbeliever he says I cannot label him correctly disbeliever in fact it is incorrect because the issue of what is being referred to in the hadith is clear this point of whether you say Salah or you say Isola whoever has Bandhan Isola that is salah in its entirety and that's the one we said we agreed with he abandoned Selena's entirety even though he says shall I still obligation say it is impossible it is not reasonable to expect a person who never praised any time to really believe that it's an obligation not any time no that's not reasonable sometimes sometimes not okay but if he if he because we said we don't know necessarily what's in a person's heart unless he says it or in his actions he indicates it him not praying at any time is indicative of him not believing it to be an obligation if he has even the minutest quantity of belief that it's an obligation he'll do it sometime so he can at least come before Allah and said well I did pray sometimes so the whole issue comes down to the point of whether we're talking about total abandonment or partial abandonment so I believe as I'm sure you will agree with me that the person who prays sometimes and doesn't pray sometimes is cannot be called one who has abandoned Salah he has abandoned some of his Salah but we don't say he has abandoned Salah period so this hadith the hadith would speak about this belief here as we said either we take it to mean not the disbelief which takes a person out of Islam but an activist or otherwise we have to look at it and with God with regards to what is the Prophet SAW cell I'm talking about when he said whoever ban abandons a Salah it has to mean so law in its entirety not sometimes and sometimes not without Akane we want to thank both of the speakers for the effort that they put forth and what you just heard was a real live issue it was not a case of our brother Sheikh awesome playing the devil's advocate for lack of a better word taking the position just to argue it's what he believes that the one who abandoned the salat is a disbeliever and I will Amina believes the other side and although they have differences of opinion in this mustela you don't see them degrading one another you know if you see them fighting one another you see them respect in each other and this is one of the goals and the objectives that we want to bring to your attention this is what the scholars of Alice LOM this is what they were apart from the companions and other than the companions radi allahu anhu ajma'in this is a set up here and I'm Amish a free to disagree with an imam will kid village Arak and they were still brothers in Al Islam and they cooperated and assisted one another so would that being the case we bring this session to a close"
