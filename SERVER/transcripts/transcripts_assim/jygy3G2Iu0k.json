  "title": "When to make Dua for Tahajjud, before or AFTER Wudu? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Belly from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi When we wake up for Tahajjud we should say La ilaha illa Allah, Wahadahu etc. and then make Dua. But if I make my full Dua sitting down and raising hands, it takes me like 15 minutes. But then I think it is good to make Dua with Wudu. So should I sit down immediately after waking up and make Dua or should I make Dua after doing Wudu? No, the Hadith specifically states that you say La ilaha illa Allah, Wahadahu la sharika lah. Lahul mulku wa lahul hamdu wa huwa ala kulli shayin qadeer. Subhanallah, Alhamdulillah, Wallahu Akbar. La ilaha illa Allah, wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah. Then you ask Allah for whatever Dua you want. Whether it takes 10 minutes, 15 minutes, no problem in that because your Dua is going to be answered with the grace of Allah. Afterwards you go and make your Wudu and then you start to pray your Tahajjud and make Dua as well. And that would be a win-win insha Allah."
