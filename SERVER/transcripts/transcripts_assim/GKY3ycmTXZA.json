  "transcript": "alhamd today we will talk about the second chapter of the Islamic faith and this chapter revolves around a very important aspect of our AA and this is where do we get our AA from and this is a very pivotal question a very important and a Cornerstone of everything we go through you see what gives Islam its power that no other religion possesses is that it is not up to human intelligence it is not according to people's whims and and desires because people differ your understanding is different than mine their time is different than ours and hence each one could simply object to any ruling saying that no this is something that I see it this way and the other one says I See It My Way and others say no we will take the highway so Islam Islam's Perfection is driven from the fact that Allah the almighty is the one who placed it who revealed it who had given it to us while accepting it as a religion while completing his blessing upon us so there is no way we can learn Islam other than the sources and what are these sources let us go through the chapter first of all and see no one may interpret Islam and how God how Allah wants it to be except Allah himself in his book The Quran and in the Sunnah of the Prophet no human being has a higher status than Allah's Prophet yet he only delivers what Allah reveals to him Allah says in the Quran messenger Proclaim what has been revealed to you by your lord as he delivers his message the prophet also has to explain it and make it clear as Allah says the messenger is not bound to do more than clearly delivers his message the explanation and the clarification also comes from Allah as he says in reference to the Quran when we recite it follow the its uh uh recitation then it will be for us to make it meaning its meaning clear so this is extremely important because it preserves Islam it preserves the A and this is what kept our religion intact as it was revealed 14 centuries or 15 centuries ago how is that all Muslims believe that the Quran is their constitution however the Quran is a revelation from Allah and it is suitable miraculously for all times and all places you remember yesterday last session we said the Hadith of the Prophet Alat that he was favored with five things no other messenger or Prophet was given it before him and one of them was that he was sent to all mankind to the gin and to the humans while each and every messenger used to be sent only to his people so this miraculous Quran has to be something that is compatible with all times with all generations with all countries and Nations and this is what we see manifested in front of us a book that was given to the nomads and the bedwin and the Arabs The Primitives 15th C centuries ago still is applicable to Rocket scientists to physicists to mathematicians to doctors and engineers and it will be still applicable and valid centuries from now when people even do things that are unimaginable for us today why because it was from Allah it is the word of Allah himself who created us as a Creator he knows how we were how we are and how we will be therefore you cannot expect anything less than a perfect Quran a mobile phone that people use you get a thorough manual operation manual to tell you what to do and how to do it yet sometimes you need to go to the forums and ask questions that were not mentioned in the manual or need clarification here is the role of the Prophet Alat wasam and this is in response to the people who calls Al now we have a cult that claims to be Muslims and they say we believe in the Quran and nothing else and the prophet himself warned us from such people when he said I do not want to see a person that is in the future inclining or leaning on his couch saying that whatever we find in the Quran we will take it and whatever is not in the Quran we will not give it any attention by Allah the prophet says Alam I was given the Quran and similar to it with it and he's referring to the Sunnah so the Sunnah is a revelation from Allah like the Quran and this is a clear indication that this Quran needs to be explained and who will explain it to us better than the prophet Alat wasam there is no one to explain it to us better than the prophet Alat because there are things that are general for every time and place and needs to be specified but this is part of the Beauty and the power of the Quran Allah says in the Quran those who do not associate their belief with transgression zul they will be secure and they will be guided so the companions came to the Prophet this Surah is in chapter chapter number six and they came to the prophet and said and and said oh prophet of Allah who Among Us did not mix his faith and belief with transgression we all do wrong things we may lie we may cheat we may do bad things to people so does this mean that on the day of judgment we will not be safe and we will not be guided so the prophet explains to them no it's not like you understand Allah says verily associating others with Allah is great and major transgression this is what is meant by it this is what the prophet explained to the Companions and there are so many examples where the Prophet himself explains to the the companions verses of the Quran and in some other incidents he explains it to them through the Quran itself or through his own Hadith and that is the Sunnah of the Prophet so again this is an indication of the sources of our religion so now Islam is the religion of Allah cool we get this now this chapter deals with what are the sources where do we learn where do we get information about our religion the answer is the Quran and through the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat so when we say the Sunnah of the Prophet can you elaborate okay we will do that in the following paragraph the Sunnah is a revelation from Allah to his messenger Allah says in the Quran he does not speak out of his own fancy that which he delivers to you is nothing less than a revelation sent down to him when a question was put to the prophet Alat he would respond in the answer if the answer had been revealed to him otherwise he would wait for for the answer in new revelation how do we understand this a question is paused to the prophet Alat wasam the prophet answers in 95 to 98% this answer is maybe 99% this answer is totally correct either because it was a revelation from so the prophet immediately answers according to the revelation of Allah or due to that the prophet did his due diligence and in accordance to his knowledge and of what he knows from the Quran and what he knows from Allah he gives the answer from himself which coincides 100% and fits like a glove with Allah's ruling there are a handful five maybe 10 incidents throughout his life where the Prophet gave an answer and it was not right and immediately Allah Asel came with the correction and revealed to him a correction such as in the case where the captives of the battle of bad the prophet Alam asked Abu Bakr and asked Omar may Allah be pleased with them what to do with these prisoners of Wars of War Abu Bakr said they are our relatives so let us take Ransom from them let their families pay money to set them free the prophet liked this opinion was in inclined to it Omar on the other hand said oh prophet of Allah give Z my brother to me and give to Ali and give so and so to so and so of the companions give each one his own kinship and let them behead them so that they would be an example to all of the idol worshippers so the prophet am was inclined to the opinion of Abu Bakr and he instructed the idol worshippers to pay the ransom for their loved ones to set them free immediately it was revealed to the prophet alaih that that was a wrong decision and had it not been for Allah's preordainment a torment from the heavens would have fell upon you so Omar says I came and I found Abu Bakr weeping alongside the prophet Alat and he said I said to them what is it that you're weeping for if it's something worth weeping I'd we weep with you and if it's not then I'll try to pretend so the prophet said oh Omar if someone were to be saved from Allah's storment it would have been you whoa so another incident the prophet Alat wasam is giving da to the idol worshippers the dignitary of them The High Society whom if they were to accept Islam scores of people would accept Islam when this blind man comes and asks the prophet few questions not aware that the prophet was busy so the prophet Alam frowned did not say anything did not do anything the simple gesture of frowning in the face of a blind man who did not even see your frown this was a cause that Allah Reveals His and Allah telling his Prophet that this was not supposed to be because you don't know where the guidance is so the prophet did something out of his own he did his effort to reach the right conclusion and this is what he had reached yet it was wrong so Allah corrected him so it is either a revelation or his own interpretation that fits as a glove with Allah's rulings or an error that is not condemned or looked down upon because it wasad and it was corrected on the spot if the prophet did not know the answer then simply he would wait until the answer is given as in the case where the hypocrite slandered mother AA and he did not have any knowledge about it and he could not speak out of his own whims and desires because he can't this has to be a revelation from Allah as Allah stated subhanahu waala he does not speak out of his own fancy so he waited for a whole month until Allah revealed Surah anur and I think the word is ex exonerated A's reputation and she was proven innocent till the day of judgment now what do we understand from this paragraph the Sunnah is a revelation from Allah to his messenger when the question was put we understand that you cannot not understand the Quran without the second source of Islam which is the Sunnah and we find that nowadays a lot of who they whom they call themselves intellectuals or people of uh literature they're trying trying to undermine the Sunnah and nowadays we have the attempts to tarnish the reputation of the IM Al bukari of the alar of a number of hadiths claiming that it contradicts with science it contradicts with common sense it contradicts with the Quran sometimes now we have to look at those who are talking against the second source of Islam the Sunnah if they are people of knowledge if they are scholars in Islam if they know the Quran they know the Sunnah they know theith they know they know the language of the Arabs perfectly then we should communicate with them and prove them wrong but if they are full-fledged Hypocrites who have never ever ever read the bukari themselves let alone understand it who do not even know the difference between a verse of the Quran and the prophet's Hadith if you quote it to them they can't tell which is which because they have never spent time studying or reading or learning or wanting to worship Allah through that then we know that these people are backed by by the disbelievers the Jews and the Christians they're backed by the secularists the Liberals and the Hypocrites if you want to undermine Islam you have to undermine the foundations so you have to talk ill about the Quran but the Quran is perfect we can't talk about it there's no way so they say okay we go to stage two we talk ill about the prophet Alat we depict him in pictures we talk trash about him sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam trying to make people not respect him and they failed miserably as Allah [Music] said whoever hates you he will be cut from being remembered by the people he will have no mentioning he will have no lineage and this is what's happening it takes some time wait for it it's coming if they can't do that they move to Stage through three which is undermined the Sunnah and some people would unfortunately consider this to be trivial we have the Quran we have no problem no you have a big problem you see the Quran as I said is a miraculous book that is suitable for this era and for further Generations so it does not speak about our own time specifically otherwise it would have been in thousands and hundreds of thousands of volumes it's one small book but it is so concise it is so rich and full of meaning that you can never end benefiting from it so you need the Sunnah to explain it to you to clarify things for you to show you the difference between this and that and this is why Omar may Allah be pleased with him when he used to advise his judge his Scholars his companions those who debate with the people of evil he said he used to say to them when you speak to the people of innovation do not talk to them with the Quran because one Ayah can have different interpretations it is so miraculous that a people from can find his evidence in it and people people from could find their evidence in the same eye but people look at it from different angles Omar says do not debate them with the Quran rather debate them with the Sunnah because in the Sunnah there is no other options it's Crystal Clear to the issue we are talking about so it is part of our AA and this course revoles around whether our AA is genuine or not so many times people get ocds am I a CF and if I tell you the counseling sessions I have like 75% of it revolves around OCD in kufur people keep on thinking I get one question of a brother saying that usually smile as a mental problem when I hear something that is related to Allah or to the Islam so I suppress this to the best of my knowledge to the best of my ability and I managed to do that alhamdulillah because I know if I smile this might be kufur which is not because it's a mental issue nevertheless what is his question so she while in Salat and reading the Quran or hearing it sometimes I swallow my saliva so did I commit an act of kufur duh where is the kufur 75% of counseling sessions that I get are around these issues why because people don't know they don't have the knowledge if they had the knowledge of their own religion none of this would have had happened so we are studying the we are studying the Islamic faith what is my AA okay this is what I'm teaching you now your AA is that your source of of religion is from the Quran earn from the authentic Sunnah which means that you must not allow anyone to cast any doubt in your head about the Sunnah otherwise he's a hypocrite or a disbeliever wanting to mess with your mind stand firm because this is your and this is the interpretation of what is Muhammad sallallah alaihi wasallam has to do in all of this he is the one who gave us the second source of the religion the the third paragraph As we are running out of time the people who were closest to understanding what the prophet said were his companions and their understanding of the Quran is clear evidence other than God other than Allah whoever says that anyone has the authority to State what is permissible or forbidden in religion claims a partnership with Allah in his rulings this is blatant disbelief in Allah and an act of associating partners with him there is no disagreement among Scholars on this what do we understand part of our a is that understanding of the Quran and of the Sunnah is driven through the understanding of the righteous predecessors okay this is something that we need to make a pause so can you please elaborate the Quran and the Sunnah these are not things for normal people to deduce rulings from out of the blue you have tens and tens of references in the medical profession if I read 10 volumes of these books would I be a qualified doctor the answer is no I cannot treat patients by just reading books likewise 85 to 90% of the Quran and the Sunnah is self-explanatory I can understand it there is these fine details that require that we check how the salaf understood it sal sal sal what are you doing what is salf Ah that's a good question calm down relax and understand with your brains and heart the prophet saidat the best of generations is my generation and the generation that follows it and the generation that follows it so the prophet is highlighting to us a very important issue the best of generations that have ever lived on this Earth is the generation of the companions may Allah be pleased with him then the generation of the those who did not see the the prophet but managed to see his companions then the those who were not fortunate to see the companions but they were fortunate to see those who saw the companions why would the prophet say such a thing to indicate to us that the understanding of these three generations is the best understanding possible and the religion cannot be understood except through the way they had learned it and I had understood it so this is a very important and crucial issue yesterday Wednesday a gentleman called me on the phone and you know my policy is to give five minutes per call her a day whenever I have free time not more now this brother happened to have a serious issue so I had to take approximately 15 hours of my time to address it and in the end he said sheh I contemplated upon the letters in the beginning of the suras Etc so he said I came to a conclusion that they are referring to the name of Allah and I stopped him and he tried to pitch his idea he tried to explain to me and I would not let him and I said to him I'm going to ask you one question this thought that you contemplated upon and the conclusion you reached did any of the companions ever spoke about it he said no so I said Subhan Allah did the prophet know about it he stumbled they said I don't know maybe he did maybe he didn't and I said to him no I tell you for certain the prophet did not know about it because he did not leave anything hidden from us and when Allah says in the Quran today I have completed your religion either this knowledge was part of the religion at the time or not so to come after 1,400 years plus claiming that you've discovered Ure you've discovered something the prophet didn't know the companions didn't know the didn't know the didn't know this is ridiculous this is preposterous and the guy acknowledged his mistake and he started saying but um and I quoted him the 33rd verse of chapter 7ah where Allah highlights to us the sinful things leaving the last and the fourth thing to be the highest and which is to speak about Allah with without knowledge and this is part of speaking without knowledge therefore part of our is that you don't come and say that well this Hadith about and Ma I don't believe that they will come at the end of time and that they are buried under ground with a barrier as mentioned in Surah no this is illogical so now the Quran and the Sunnah doesn't work someone else says I don't believe that people are tormented in their grave we've dug Graves out hundreds of times and all what we see are bones and Ashes nobody's being tormented or flogged or scorpions running around their them uh uh killing them or or biting them I I don't believe in this such people should be thrown in the dust bin because they go against the they go get go against the Quran the Sunnah with the understanding of the previous s the righteous s of ours the favorite three generations as we were told about the prophet Alam so the author is telling us that this is part of your a and he combines to it the issue of Halal andam so he says that other than God Allah whoever says that anyone has the authority to State what is permissible in or forbidden in religion claims a partnership with Allah in his rulings this is blatant disbelief so again this is part of our a no one has the right to say this is halal and this is Haram other than Allah so she you say that music is Haram yes I say that based on evidences from the Quran and from the Sunnah and you say that wiping over socks that are transparent and made of cotton is halal when the three three schools of thought or so say it has to be made of leather true because we base our belief and conviction on the Quran and the Sunnah no one has the right to say Halal or Haram unless based on evidences whether clear or ambiguous whether in black and white or things that we understood from what is black and white and this is extremely important to understand and to comprehend and I think we would uh stop here so that we can take some of the questions and we will finish or continue um this later on next um Monday so where were we I think we have the questions that came to us your questions number one M says what is the difference between a messenger and a Prophet this is the difference of opinion among Scholars the most authentic definition is a messenger is someone who was sent to his people with a new law a message a revelation and a new law while a prophet was sent to his people to explain and to follow the law and the Shar of the previous messenger so yes he has a revelation of his own but it is not a revelation that is recited and Allah is worshiped by it rather it is being communication a means of communication and he's telling his people how to implement the law of the previous messenger that's why we have hundreds and thousands of messengers of the sons of Israel though the law was clear the law of Moses peace be upon him and and so on so every messenger is a prophet let me repeat every messenger is a prophet and a messenger but every Prophet is not a messenger he's being revealed to he is favored by Allah but he doesn't have a new message AF says what is the ruling on on a religious girl when she has a proposal when the groom wants to settle in the US she is scared that she wouldn't hear the aan which is very depressing to her what is the religious guideline to for her this is up to her own preference and it depends on her status whether there are other proposals coming to pick from or not depending on her age depending her and uh depending on her religious commitment some people are extremely practicing here in Saudi Arabia once they go to Canada or to Europe or to the US they start compromising their religion and they're practice and they become unfortunately heedless so it all depends what is your advice Sheik my advice don't go there don't accept such a proposal I've been to these countries before I've seen the Muslims and how they suffer with their children I've seen the second and the third generation of Muslim immigrants who went there and how their religion was severely compromised I've seen women girls running away with their Christian boyfriends and the parents coming in Weeping what should we do what can we do we provided her with everything we bought a house we have a beautiful car and we have good income yes but you don't have Islam so those living there may Allah make it easy for you but when you have the choice if I have the choice people coming to me and say she we will give you $50 million to migrate would you I never leave the land of Islam to migrate yeah I may go for few months to work or to study or to teach but never to get married there never to raise my children there never to settle there because the prophet ordered us to migrate to a Muslim land so that we would preserve our religion not to compromise our religion in such a fashion but again this is your choice at the end of the day Zed Zu says who are the a maybe the people of the scripture are they the temporary Christians and Jews also follows under the same category the answer is yes the people of the book Orab they are the Jews and the Christians whether those who lived at the time of the Prophet Alam or those who are currently living today who never go to church who never attend the religious events and festivals yet still they are considered to be Jews and Christians and the rulings apply to them as well number two of Zed zuber's questions is the are the trousers we wear also follow the same cat ategory of clothes that must not go beyond ankles or is it only the inal or the is I don't know yes anything that you wear on your body from the top down it must not go beyond or below your ankle whether it's trousers or a waist strapper or a shirt like mine which we call TH or anything that you wear on your waist downwards what is not considered to be Haram is wearing socks because this is from downwards upwards so socks that cover your ankles are totally kosher and legit um then we have a question from nigar is there any signs of Surah of the Quran like some boxes and numbers can it be used as black magic sh kufur no this is definitely Blasphemous when you use the Quran in boxes in in charts and in columns and and rows and you divide the verses into letters and this is black magic and this is usually used by Sorcerers and s soothsayers who seek the assistance of the disbelieving Jin and the Jin instruct them in order to get their assistance to humilate the Quran so some of them may step on it on the Quran some of them may write the verses of the Quran with menstruation blood some of them may write it in the opposite order in Reverse so that they would humiliate and disrespect the Quran and this is Blasphemous uh farzana says is number one in the Salah when I go for or and remember that I did not read the fa or cannot remember whether I read it or not what should I do first of all you have to figure out whether this is a repetitive uh um thing something that has been repeated a repetitive thing or it happens once in a blue moon if it happens once in a blue moon and I am in rur or I'm in suud and I get this thought that whoa did I read the fa either I am confused and I can't say yes or no so it's 50/50 in this case I have to go and stand up again considering that I did not pray it so if I'm in sujud immediately say Allah abbar and stand up and I assume that I am in the beginning of my first FA and I recite Etc blah blah blah to the end and then offer prostration of and I should offer this prostration of sah before the Salam after the salutation of prophet before going I go for two prostration of case one case two no I'm in suud but I'm inclined to that I did recite it or I did not recite I'm inclined to so I have 60 40 or 70 30 either way I have to act upon my inclination so if I'm inclined that I did not recite it I stand up and recite it if I'm inclined I did recite it continue my prayer as usual offer Tah salutation upon the prophet to prostration of then this is if it happens once every blue moon what about if it happens like every other prayer now this is wias this is Whispering of Shan messing up with your head trying to make you hate hate Salat and abandon Salat Al together what you do ignore him continue praying because 99% he's bluffing and that you've read the fa but he just want to confuse you with this 1% so ignore it and move on then we have a question from I have no idea who after the aan we send salutation upon the prophet and read the Dua is there anything else we have to read no there's nothing else you have to read there are a number of um not a number this is the time for Dua between aan and so between aan and the time of prayer it is highly recommended that you raise your hands praise the Allah Asel offer citation upon the prophet and ask whatever you want from Allah oh Allah guide my heart forgive my sins guide my children um make my wife a jewel in my eyes um pay off my debts give me a promotion guide my neighbors to become practicing um Excel me in da it's anything you want from the goodness of this life and the Hereafter you can do that without any problem M says what is the ruling of walking in front of a person who is praying performing Salat how much distance must I maintain to cross if the person who's praying has no obstacle in front of him or should not cross at all if a person is praying usually he has something that is a visor or a screen that in indicates that this area this Sanctuary between his feet and this obstacle or visor is a sacred area you must not cross when people don't have this in front of them Scholars say that you are entitled to walk across beyond the prostration spot so if I'm standing and my prostration spot is here you can walk from Beyond that even a few uh centimeters without any problem not necessarily a meter or two or more and this is uh what you can do and Allah knows best [Music] Muhammad says a guy has an old mother who lives alone the guy works a good portion of the day and to pass time his mother wants to buy her a TV for entertainment is it okay for him to buy as she will watch un un Islamic drama and things containing music and how to handle this situation this is not permissible it is not permissible for you to buy your mother or your family your wife your children something that would facil itate Haram now in Saudi Arabia in the Gulf area in parts of the Middle East we are blessed to have a Broadcasting Service that is like a cable service that shows only Islamic material of course out of 10 their quality is two but it's a start so the they don't have music they don't have women and they're trying their level best to be um infot infotainment so it should be informative and entertaining at the same time and they may succeed in some and fail in others so if this is the case and you ensure that you don't bring a satellite receiver or a cable box that shows Haram things yeah this is permissible but if you're living abroad so you have Star TV you have um whatever uh cable it it is in your country now this is Haram because you know that your mom or your loved one would spend endless hours watching music Bollywood movies series Etc all of this is corrupting the heart and you cannot facilitate this or you will be sharing uh the sin how to handle it this is up to you may Allah make it easy to be diplomatic with your mom try to explain that to her but at the end of the day you cannot share such sins with others uh bansy Ahmed says is it permissible to trade in food stuffs like buying grains or cereals for storage purposely to sell them when the prices are higher there is no problem in that this is totally permissible the only obstacle where it becomes Haram is when you are the sole source for such grain when there's a monopoly and you're the only one who sells it so you store it or in better terms hoard it in order to raise the prices way Way Beyond people can bear this is Haram but if everybody's able to buy it from supermarkets but you still hoard it until the time is right it's like buying dollars or Euros waiting for the right moment to sell it once the prices are high uh can Za says is it permissible for me to watch a Snapchat of a woman who is sinning and posting her videos and pictures to the world to see I am a girl and she sometimes shows her makeup and clothes and food is it okay to watch it if I'm not liking her stuff and nor do I add her just to watch the answer is no this is not at all recommended it's not an issue of Hal andam in the sense that am I permitted as a woman to look at another woman's face who's wearing makeup and showing her hair yeah it's so why are you saying I shouldn't do that as I said it's not an issue of Halal and Haram it what comes afterwards the heart is set sensitive and it can be tarnished easily without you knowing it it can rust it can become hard and it can break and therefore we're ordered in so many places in the Quran not to look at what's glamorous in this world so that we would not be seduced or distracted from experience a woman who watches celebrities who is fond of following Kim kadashian and her sisters and doing what they do acting like them wearing what they're wearing interested in the makeups they apply in their hairstyles they will be inevitably negatively influenced by their by them and this is why they call them influencers influencers YouTube influencers Instagram Snapchat because they influence people with weak Iman would someone with strong Iman spend his time watching this nonsense and filth no because he thinks that he's better than them Allah created him for something more important than this aren't there any women who would probably show makeup and clothes who are not celebrities who are modest in the way they act and behave maybe but still it's Haram but it's not like watching someone who's a celebrity with your heart connected to it and would negatively influence you I advise you not to all follow such people on Instagram or SnapChat because this destroys your IM kills your heart hardens your heart until it is breakable and Allah Asel knows besta says what is the difference between prohibited not permissible and Haram the answer is it's all the same they're all the same whatever is prohibited is Haram whatever is not permissible which is the operative of Halal Isam and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet you next Monday I Leave You"
