  "transcript": "Ford says is it permissible to study and practice law in an unknown country the laws that you study in university are all man-made laws and we know that in Islam only Sharia law is valid in Holland and any man-made law is prohibited and a major sin but in practical practicality if a person is living in the West and this is something that he can study and inevitably Muslims would need to use it because they live in the West they need to go to courts they need someone to represent them and fight for their rights or defend them from any accusations that are not real and you can't do this without a lawyer so if a lawyer if a person studies law in order to defend what is right in according to Islamic law I believe that this is permissible in it's helada so if you know that a Muslim needs to get his rights from a partner who took his money who cheated him and he needs you to represent him and you see that the case is legit and that he has all the rights and he's the oppressed there's nothing wrong in sharla and defending him and calling for his rights providing that you do not exceed the limit so for example if there are damages some damages are ridiculous so yes I have been cheated by my partner and my partner took a hundred thousand dollars from me I've got the documents the lawyer goes to court and it's proven the judge gives me my hundred thousand back but my lawyer says we need also $1,000,000 in compensation for that images this is how l'm so the lawyer is not allowed to go out of the Sharia law after securing his right the hundred thousand the million is not his right because this is taking people's money without any legitimate reason and Allah knows best"
