  "title": "Ruling on making up missed fasts (due to menses) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as Mamoon says my early age in Ramadan I did not fast all 30 days so many lunar years I did the same but now I realize I did wrong and I with the grace of Allah fast the whole month before which fast I miss is there any way to do this answer is yes of course any days that you have missed due to your menses you have to make them up if you don't remember the number of days you have to estimate and add some of your own just to be safe so a woman says I reach the age of puberty when I was 11 now I am 20 years of age and the past nine years of my puberty I used to have my menses but I never made them up and I don't know how many there's these days are so we say ok 9 years what's the average of your menses a month she says between 5 and 7 days so I say ok so 5 times 9 years this is 45 days and 7 multiplied by 9 years this is 63 so you arrange between 45 and 63 days choose an approximate amount so that you would be safe and doing 63 days would definitely be safe for you so start fasting 63 days if you're certain that it is 60 or 55 or 50 then go ahead and do that but you have to estimate and add maybe a day or two just to be safe rather than sorry this is this is regarding the days that you have missed use your menses but if you skipped days in Ramadan intentionally you did not even fast one minute of these days from the night you said I'm not fasting tomorrow without any legitimate reason you cannot make those up"
