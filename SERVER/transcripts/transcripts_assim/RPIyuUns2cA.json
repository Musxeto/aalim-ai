  "transcript": "foreign [Music] but the police are from what I've seen they never catch anyone they try to catch people who's providing their service to watch um these Sports and stuff so my question is providing if um this the watching videos don't get in the web applications such as um and our studies and stuff um is it permissible to watch these first of all if the material you're watching is halal such as crickets and there isn't anything Haram involved and these websites are open freely I don't have to hack or to uh violate any rights it's there it's free I'm just browsing the world wide web and I find this website that's showing live games of cricket there's no sin on me I did not do anything this is something available it's the problem of the organizers the owner of the channel to go and track these websites and close them down otherwise I see no problem in doing this like reading PDF files of books and people say that this is copyrighted actually it's not on the website what do I what do I want me to do give the author a call if I go to a public library I'd find a book there and if I find it on a website and I just read it or not making money out of it there I see no problem in that Allah Knows Best"
