  "transcript": "i want to know whether it is halal to fill the gap between the teeth the gap between the teeth we don't have any hadith that restricts it except the hadith of even masroad may allah be pleased with him and it's in the sahih and it's a well known hadith where he tells us how the prophet salallahu salaam cursed a number of women for mutilating and changing the creation of allah azzawajal such as those who [Music] are tattoo artists and those who they practice their art on so both the recipient and the doer are cursed by allah azzawajal and cursed by the prophet he also cursed those who connect their hair with other hair those who do it the hairdressers and the those who it's done to the clients among those the prophet are salaam cursed those who file their teeth this means that they make a gap between their teeth as it was a sign of beauty in the past that you have a gap between the front two teeth so they used to file it and the prophet allah followed cursing those who do this those who do this gapping or filing to their teeth so that they would look more beautiful and they change the creation of allah this is how allah created you changing it permanently like this would be curse-worthy and as we see from sanya's question she's saying about filling the gap not making one and usually if there is a gap in the teeth nowadays this is considered to be an abnormality however we have to go to the dentists and we have to ask normal people if such a normal gap is a deformity or it's a normal thing and the vast majority of people would say it's a normal thing it may be somewhat different say that this is more beautiful than filling it up and hence that would be prohibited because it's changing and altering the creation of allah however if a dentist or dentist or specialists said that such a gap is bad for your teeth it allows cavity to grow it uh [Music] brings plaque or plaque or whatever they call it and it may store food in it etc so filling it up is the correct procedure in this case this is totally permissible inshaallah"
