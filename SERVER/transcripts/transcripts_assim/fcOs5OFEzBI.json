  "title": "Is income from collateral business halal? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is taking over the business or taking any percentage of a qualitative property halal come again explain that please uh there's a property that has been collateral and then if i will take over that business and i will take the amount or i'll take any percentage of that income it's not income permissible i have no idea if it's a collateral and there is a partnership and there are people owning it you cannot just overcome their shares and take the profit and conquer everything this is not halal there has to be agreement because the prophet alice assam said in the farewell a hajj farewell pilgrimage he said to the people that your wealth your reputation your uh physical uh safety upon one another is haram as the sanctuary of this land in this sacred month in the sacred day so the prophet hassan prohibited us from consuming other people's wealth or transgressing upon them if there is a company that we're partners in and all of a sudden one of the partners is not doing his due diligence so i take over the business that doesn't mean that i also take over his share of 30 percent and the profits and oust him without any legitimacy no i have to buy his share out we have to agree on that he has to be uh in agreement to that he gives his consent he's happy with what we've reached as a decision not simply to overpower him and throw him out by force in allah knows best"
