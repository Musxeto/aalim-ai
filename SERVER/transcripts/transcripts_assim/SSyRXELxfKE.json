  "title": "If someone saw me while my awrah was not covered properly, does this break my Ghusl or Wudu?",
  "transcript": "faison from india he said that i didn't understand his question so he's clarifying it if a person wears shorts does this impact his russell or his wudu i said to him no even if you perform wudu totally naked your wudu is valid so now he added an extra piece of information so what happens if someone saw me whether deliberately or accidentally when i was not covering my aura does this impact my russell or my wudu and the answer remains the same the things that nullify your wudu are known whether it is urinating defecating passing of gas having things coming out of your private part sleeping or eating camels meat these are the things that nullify you will do you cannot come and add something it's okay what about if someone saw me naked what about if i smoked a cigarette what about if i saw a movie or listen to a song all of these things don't impact your wudu their sins yes if they are sins but it has no impact on your russell or on your wudu and allah azzawajal knows best"
