  "transcript": "I wanted to ask you when we finish the Quran in Ramadan, could we dedicate that to a person who is deceased in the family? This is an issue of dispute among scholars and the most authentic opinion and this is the opinion of the greatest scholars of Islam is that you yourself don't know if Allah accepted this from you or not. So how would you grant the reward to it? The things that we can give to the deceased are limited. Number one, making dua. So any type of dua, Allah expand his grave, fill it with light and fragrances of Jenna. Oh Allah, forgive him. Oh Allah, ease his stay. This is accepted. Number two, charity. You see someone in need, you give them a thousand dirham and say, \"This is on behalf of my deceased father or uncle or cousin or whomever.\" This is accepted. Number three. So I've done gazillion in my time. I go and make Omrah this time for my mom. Ira and I make of I shave my head and that's it. Number four, Hajj and I do the same. If I performed Hajj on myself or I give money to someone who've done Hajj before, would like to go this year, I give him money to make Hajj and I tell him make it on behalf of my grandfather. This is all accepted and legitimate."
