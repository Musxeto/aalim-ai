  "transcript": "empty ways zessica moolah where is the Sahar peda why is it important how bad I pee that can lead to bad well nah hey my friend Mohammad this is a very long answer that requires a lecture Ikeda is your conviction your belief and we have only one type of al-qaeda that is accepted by Allah Azza WA JAL how do we know this from the hadith the Prophet said erase a lot of salam my ummah will be divided into 73 sects all of which will enter hell except one so they asked him Oh prophet of Allah which one is it then the Prophet said whoever is following my footsteps and my companions footsteps so this hadith clearly states that there are 72 sects of the Ummah who will go to hell now scholars say that is they are they different from the prophets way at least some and the companions way in terms of fit so whether they put their hands on the chest or below their belly buttons whether they do this or do that that is no these differences in fact are not of an essential part of the religion that divides the Muslims what is problematic is issues regarding al Qaeda so we have people who do not believe in the names and attributes of allah subhanaw taala they either misinterpreted some of them neglected or divert the meanings and alter it this is an extreme way of going against the authentic and sahadeva so when you worship Allah you have to know who you are worshipping according to the knowledge you received from the prophet aerosol Salaam if Allah tells us that he has a throne and that he is above his throne and people say nonono Allah does not is not above his throne and this is mentioned in like seven places in the Quran and in numerous numbers of hadith said no no no you misunderstand what do i misunderstand what is it where Allah tells us in the Quran that he has two hands and he has a face when Allah tells us about himself all of these things and people come and say no no no this is a metaphor but the Quran was revealed in Arabic what do you mean by metaphor Allah is telling us about him services no no this is wrong this is a breach of faith because you're not believing in Allah anymore you're believing something else you're falsifying what Allah has described himself by when people do not believe in the torment of the grave though it's mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah they do not believe in the physical presence of Jenna and of hellfire and they say that this is all mental and not physical then you start to believe that your conviction your belief is not on the right track and there is a big problem and this is why if you follow the false artiguez when people come and believe that prophet muhammad alehissallaam is not dead they say if he's not dead then where is he let us see em let him rule the world into justice they say no no his house ur nozzle and he's not created from clay like human beings is created from Allah's nor Allah when they say that he controlled the universe and that he knows the unseen they are describing alas what are they doing and then they say no we love the Prophet as Sam and we are the followers of the Quran and Sunnah these are followers of the Shaitaan when people come and they curse the Companions of the Prophet and they slander the mothers of the believers like mother Aisha and other half Sun and they accuse them of Cofer and then they say we are Muslims how can that be if someone comes and says that the Prophet as son is not the seal of the prophet hood and there are other prophets after him this is blasphemous so correct Aki that means that you believe in Allah and in his books in the day of judgment in the angels and the messengers and in the cutter in the destiny or pre decree or the divine decree and if you don't have the right conviction in al-qaeda you are not a proper Muslim"
