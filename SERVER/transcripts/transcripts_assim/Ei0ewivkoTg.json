  "title": "Can we give Charity on behalf of NonMuslims Dead or Alive? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "the final questions uh question from the emails can we give charity on behalf of non-muslim dead or alive the answer is no because Allah mentions inah Al and we will come to whatever they had done of good deeds in this life and we shall make it all into dust meaning that Allah will not accept anything a disbeliever does in this life whether it's charity or Good Deeds all of it is void and of no value on the day of judgment therefore likewise if I have a disbeliever relative or a loved one and I go and I give charity on their behalf whether dead or alive this is without any value and it would not benefit them the least at all and it's not permissible because Allah Pro prohibited his messenger and his companions to seek forgiveness and to ask for Mercy for those who died on disbelief even if they were their own relatives and Allah Knows Best"
