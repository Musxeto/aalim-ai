  "transcript": "a sister says my query is regarding allah or is regarding debt or alone on a deceased person if a person dies and he has debts on him and after selling all his assets the debt is still not paid fully also the family cannot afford to pay it what is the ruling about it there's no ruling about it the children of the deceased are not obliged to pay his debts so if i die and someone had lent me money he comes to collect the money before we distribute my wealth to the heirs so the first thing to do is to clear off my debts of course after preparing the body and shrouding it and burying it so the first thing after that is to clear off my debts and if they sell my assets my properties my house my car my bank account and it's not sufficient to complete paying off my debt then this is it the children the wife the brothers they're not obliged to pay off my debt and he cannot come and sue them or ask them to give him from their own earnings he has no right to do that i will be held questionable on the day of judgment if i took the debt or the loan for a legitimate reason with the intention to paying it off but i died before doing that allah will pay it off for me if the children want of their own good self to pay it off this is nice this is okay but it's not mandatory you"
