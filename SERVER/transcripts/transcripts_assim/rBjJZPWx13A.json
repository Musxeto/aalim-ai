  "transcript": "is that taking a loan from beta Tamriel kuwaiti or the Kuwaiti house for financing and she wants to do this to go to Hajj first of all they don't give you alone they don't lend you and we've stated this many times any bank that gives you a loan and claims to be Islamic it's not an Islamic bank they sell you a commodity and if they sell you a commodity and they ask you to pay it on installments this is permissible because you buy from them a car you buy from them whatever you want to buy this is permissible but it's not a loan that you're borrowing from them you're buying something or buying a car you're buying a property you're buying air-conditioning's etc and you are paying it in installments you take the commodity and you sell it elsewhere and this is a condition that you buy it from the owner which is the bank or the financing or institution and you sell it elsewhere yourself not authorize them to sell it for you if this is the case then this is permissible insha'Allah however you should not take a loan to go to Hajj a large Dajjal that does not want you to do this and it's not recommended Hajj is mandatory upon those who can afford it and if you have to take a loan you cannot afford it so wait until you save enough money to go for Hajj with your Muharram and Allah knows best her second question regarding the questions India Hajj yes it's the only reason like I wanted mine I was I have the intention to do it this year it's because I have enough money but the only question is it will complete the the Philippines symposium of forgive us they said that the last payment should be jewelry and I will be getting a bonus from Ramadan as a gift and also because every 10 years in the company so don't give me another bonus so that's enough for to pay for the Hajj but the thing is I did not know that it would be it would be earlier and he make it June 3 for the last payment so I was thinking like to get it from the quite - and I asked the white finance like the same thing that you said that usually like bio commodity so I would be like they're buying it for us and then they're selling it and then they giving the money okay the quite financed housing I will answer the question is do you have a Mahatma Sagara inch I'll be going home to Philippines - okay and I said I would answer the question Sharma said Java from the Philippines says as an explanation to her question that she is expected to get end of service and dignity plus a bonus etc and all of this would be sufficient for her to perform Hajj but at the moment in order for to register for this year's hatch before it's too late before they close she doesn't have money this ancestor remains the same I would not recommend you to take this loan from anywhere especially that you will have to pay a little bit extra but if you do take a loan providing that you are anticipating to receive such money from your company this is Hana insha Allah maryam from"
