  "transcript": "or the name like allah muhammad on the walls is that allowed or and the guards that we hang like mashallah or some duas like that can you place them on the walls and frames and everything or is it not allowed okay again asking multiple questions this is not appropriate but yellow it's a bonus it's eid what is the ruling on hanging verses of the quran on walls the most authentic opinion is that this is not permissible why this is the word of allah we're not hanging a photograph or a portrait of some other artist it's the word of allah scholars say that quran was not revealed to be a form of decoration as we see in some messages or in the vast majority of messages in the muslim world could it be that all these muslims are wrong sheikh the answer is yes because who defines whether we're right or wrong the quran and the sunnah and the understanding of the three favorite generations companions and they did not do any such thing the kaaba never had verses of the quran written on it the walls of the masjids whether in mecca or medina never had the quran written on it and if it was something to be followed or to be done the companions would have done it the taberine would have done it so hanging the verses of the quran is not honoring it it can be insulting it taking it as a form of decoration especially when people don't pay attention to it especially when they pay a lot of money just to show off with it so many people you enter their homes you find so many verses you ask them don't look tell me what's on the walls i don't know i've read it maybe years ago but i forgot so what's the purpose of it decoration hanging the name of allah muhammad together this is totally inappropriate you are making muhammad similar to allah almighty and when some of the companions said to the prophet as some addressing him whatever allah wills in you the prophet was outraged and he said are you making me an associate of allah say whatever allah wills and stop don't accompany me associate me even through a figure of speech i'm just saying that whatever allah wills and whatever you will as you are the one who tells us about what allah wants azzawajal yet the prophet hasn't blocked this mistake because it may lead to shirk and if you put allah muhammad as we find in so many messages that follow innovation and sometimes follow blatant shirk and you ask them he said yeah muhammad sallallahu alaihi was created from allah's light allah so he's an attribute of allah this is shirk this is blasphemous but they believe in it so this is totally prohibited because it insinuates this idea to the layman to the ignorant people when they see the two names side by side like that thirdly and finally before we go to the break the issue of writing masha allah or these kinds of dua what is the purpose of writing them the vast majority of people would say so that people would not give us an evil eye so they write on their big mansions masha allah barakallah allahu mabarik again this is like a an amulet like a travis and this is not permissible okay if i did not have this intention then this is an innovation you should not even do it in the first place and allah knows best you"
