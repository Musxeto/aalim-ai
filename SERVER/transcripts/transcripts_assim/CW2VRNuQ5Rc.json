  "transcript": "brother says I did something between brackets masturbation and swallowing mucus and that was in the previous Ramadan's this made my fast invalid but I did not know it would make it invalid I only knew it just I only knew it just now do I have to make up those days but I don't know how many these days are what would what am I supposed to do first of all the things that nullify your fasting are food and drinks anything that takes their role such as glucose and IV syrups intercourse masturbation vomiting intentionally menses or postnatal bleeding and some say cupping I think this is all that maybe I don't know of course there is the intention of nullifying your fast just out of the blue also is included and there are others but there unless you have dispute so masturbation and the others nullify your fasting scholars say that in order for these things to nullify your fasting they have to be done first of all out of knowledge so someone who knowingly knows that eating and drinking during the daytime of Ramadan nullifies his fasting his fasting is nullified but if someone did not know that masturbation nullifies fasting he didn't know there is a difference between not knowing the ruling and not knowing the punishment now this person is totally ignorant he knows that eating drinking in to course nullifies a fasting but masturbation he never thought it does so knowing it has to be done intentionally so if someone forces you at gunpoint to eat and you eat this doesn't affect your fasting if you eat forgetful II you forgot and you ate out of forgetfulness then this does not affect your fasting as well it has to be done intentionally and whatever a person does out of ignorance this has no impact there for masturbating for those who did not know that it was one of the things that nullify your fast your fast is valid and you don't have to make up these days now swallowing your mucus this doesn't affect your fasting but it is not medically safe for you to do"
