  "transcript": "but now we are still in the second one which is talking what is your religion so we spoke about your son Islam Eman and today we were going to talk about Sharma then so whenever you're ready I'm ready yes we're ready check the level of X n xn is one pillar which means to worship Allah as if you see him but even if you don't see him he indeed sees you the proof for this is Allah saying verily Allah is with those who have taqwa and those who have xn and also he's saying and put your trust in the all-mighty the most merciful who sees you when you stand up for prey at night and who sees you it would cease your movement among those who prostrate themselves to him verily he is the all-hearer and all Noah and he's saying in the friend the is do deed that you O Muhammad do know any portion of the Quran that you recite any deed that you humans do except that we are witness to AIDS while you are doing it ok Raheem alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad al al-amin nabina muhammad in water early he was happy he ajma'in a mother so when we speak about rasul a Salathe basically this is about when we speak about a soul oscillator basically this is about the questions each one of us would be asked in his grave what is or who is your Lord what is your religion and who is this man who was sent to you and in order to be saved in order to make it you have to know the answers we spoke earlier in Ramadan about who is your Lord we spoke briefly about Allah Azza WA JAL and what does what this question entails and we spoke about what your religion is when we spoke about Islam thoroughly we spoke about Eman and now the Sheikh mentions to us the level of a SAN which is the third part that came in Gabriel's long hadith when he said o Muhammad tell me what Islam is o Muhammad tell him what a man is then he said o Muhammad Ahmad Exynos the prophet alayhi salaatu son when he defined a son he said to worship Allah as if you can see him and if you can't see him then know that he sees you so when we look at this level first of all what is a SAN the Arabs because this is an Arabic word the first thing that pops to our mind when you say he have asan is the word kindness then the word perfection then to do what is best all of these are a cocktail of the meaning of the word SN so we come to think of as an being kindness the opposite of being unkind so when you are abusive or rude to an animal people would say ah hey fear Allah have X n so when you feed that animal and give it water and be kind to it they would say Masha Allah he has a son and likewise when I'm doing a craft or something with my hands someone looks at me if I'm not doing a good job he would say hacen meaning that perfect what you're doing make it good and this is stemmed from the word Hasson which is good so when we're speaking with each other how was your uncle he was sick yesterday I would say hamdulillah he's hacen he's better and someone shows me his homework teacher what do you think of this I say this is Hassan this is good so the whole concept of a SAN is a cocktail of all of this now the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he answered gibreel he answered him in what is the highest level so we have Islam all the population who claim that there is no God where they are being worshipped but Allah for those who believe that the prophecy is the servant and messenger of allah pray 5 times fast Ramadan give zakat etc these are Muslims this is a bare minimum now the higher level is not what people can judge us by Islam we can judge one another oh look he's praying he's a Muslim he's fasting he must be Muslim what's inside this is something we cannot judge a man deals with something that is inside something that is hidden you believe in Allah in his books in his messengers in the angels in the last day in the predestiny all of these things won't appear from an individual when we see him for the first time having said that it is important to know that the Prophet Alice also mentioned the highest level of Excel without giving a lot of details because the details are in his teachings so he said to worship Allah as if you see him now the word worship we have studied that maybe five or six or more episode ago so it is not logical to go through it every time we mention it however in Arabic even Tamiya defines worship as horsemen Jeremy on nicholae Emily new hip of allah azza wajal men : o fairly in our Amal for healing kana I'm Bob Dylan generic but concise it's a terminology describing all what Allah loves whether of rhetoric or actions whether appearing to the people or hidden so this is a form of worship now when the Prophet says our son to worship Allah as if you see him this means that any type of worship you do is considered part of a sin providing that you do it with utmost sincerity filled with conviction anticipating the reward only from Allah the Prophet made a condition or something similar to that when he said to worship Allah okay we all worship allah azza wajal what's the big deal we have 1.8 or 1.9 billion Muslims all over the world yes but wait to worship Allah as if you can see him can we see Allah no we can so what is meant by this no one can see Allah with his vision in this life even prophet musa peace be upon him said to Allah o Allah let me see you and Allah said you won't be able to see me so no one can see a larger Linda's life the only possibility for us to see Allah is on the day of judgement and not for everyone only for those who were who are admitted and allowed to enter Jannah may Allah make me and you among them so if we cannot see Allah Azza WA JAL then what use is it to say as if you can see him well the Prophet made it clear to you that you're not going to see him but he is describing a condition where the level of Eman the level of sincerity the level of conviction is so high that you almost see allah azza wajal due to your sincerity now if you were able to share my vision you would not have done much more than what you're doing at the moment because you have reached the highest and utmost level in worshiping Allah soldier and this does not refer only to prayer this is not only limited to praying as we often think that worshiping Allah is prayer that's it no worshiping allah azza wajal can defer to refraining from harming others doing good to others whether financially whether with your body whether with your knowledge whether with your authority all of these actions indicate that you are in the level of X and now let us go back one step backwards what is San the word itself in the Quran is everywhere you will find it you will read it and most often that when you read the translation you would always find the word good kind which is very limited when it comes to explaining this huge beautiful word s and so as I said SN can mean perfection it can mean kindness it can mean to do what Allah ordered you to do in Islam as a religion or as a religious practice all of these can refer to xn not to be rude or rough so when we want to look at SN we find that SN can be between me and allah azza wajal and also it can refer to what's between me and other creatures of Allah Azza WA JAL so what does that mean when I want to reach the level of a SAN with Allah it means that I have to worship allah azzawajal wholeheartedly so first of all I must be a person who does all followed and mandatory acts without an exception and stay away from all that is Haram without any exceptions you cannot be a proper Muslim without doing this there is a great error among the Muslims when you find someone and I get a question I get questions like this a lot yesterday I had a question like this hey brother says I spent hours praying to hedge it but I always oversleep over fetcher so can I pray father the moment I wake up and I tell this brother Ali your thinking is not straight Allah says in the hadith alkoxy and my servant would never get closer to me with something more beloved to me than what I have mandated upon it so if we were to put in the scale night prayer six hours a day and on the other side we would put fuzzier prayer six minutes a day which one do you think would overweight definitely the prayer of Federer if you pray 24 hours voluntary prayers Allah will not accept that from you if you do not pray Fajr prayers on time so it is without questioning that the most important thing that you should focus to reach the level of a son is priority number one the obligatory and the fault being kind to people smiling in their faces loving them giving them money helping them while being offensive to your parents or one of them being rude looking them straight in the eye shouting at them is definitely a no-brainer there is no comparison even if you're kind to the whole world but evil to your parents you're doomed in hell so this is a concept that we have to understand and comprehend that the issue of a SAN is not of our own choice so in order to reach the level of a SAN while worshipping allah azza wajal first we have to prioritize and know what exactly is that Allah loves of us this is worshiping Allah doing what it's meant actually saying away from what is Haram then you do what is recommended muster habit Sunan not mandatory if I don't do them I'm not sinful but to reach the level of X and you have to do the things that you reward it for and you have to leave them a crew hat and what is meant by makuu hat things that are not recommended so if I do them in my sinful you're not sinful but by doing them you don't get any reward by leaving them you're rewarded so if you want this level of X and you have to also do what is recommended stay away from what is not recommended for you and one has to be in the state of a son in every single small thing and big everything he says who does and every time he takes or gives he has to have this exam in him this is with between you and allah azza wajal to worship allah as if you see him but if you don't see him remember that he sees you evening IM says worshipping allah azza wajal cannot be unless you have two things perfect love complete humility now these two things can never be combined in your heart to any other than Allah I have perfect love for some person but I can't have full humility to him I may have humility to a ruler or a tyrant that I'm scared of but I can't have full love for him the only one that these two emotions can be combined is Allah soldier towards allah subhanaw taala which means that if you look at the Sun to worship Allah as if you see him this part refers to love if you don't see him remember that he sees you this part refers to fear so the highest level of a Sun is to worship allah azzawajal with love seeking his pleasure anticipating his reward this motivates you energizes you pushes you towards worshiping Allah Azza WA JAL well while if you can't reach that level then you worship allah azza wajal while feeling his wrath being afraid from going into hell not wanting to be punished or tormented in your grave which is a very good thing but definitely it's different than the higher level this in short is referring to al San when you worship allah azza wajal now let us look at when sand between us and the other Asian of a large division is needed so allah azza wajal mentioned in an ayah the ten rights of other creatures and Allah says in the Quran worship Allah and associate nothing with him okay this is known to us what I quote next then he says and to parents do good were billed worried a nee-san allah says wahdahu allah to shri could be he/she and what bill waited a nee-san so sad is mentioned with the creations of Allah so you have to be kind to your parents and to relatives orphans the needy the near neighbor the neighbor further away the companion at your side the traveler and those whom your right hand possesses indeed Allah does not like those who are self-deluding and boastful so we need to be kind and to have X and towards others with first of all our refraining from hurting them the best type of a sign is not to abuse or to hurt others so refrain from saying bad things refrain from doing evil things to your Muslim brothers and to humanity at large then in order to be kind you have to be generous with your wealth so you provide for your parents and you provide for those who are closer to you afterwards such as your siblings your wife your children your uncle's your cousins depending on how is your financial status you do this in order to reach the level of X and then you also be kind to others with your authority so I as your Assam I know people someone comes to me and says oh sure we have problems in this area this region and we are unable to get our rights so I said okay I know the ruler of the region I'll put a good word for you go and meet him I didn't do anything that costs me money I utilized my name and my fame to help others then you help others with your knowledge you spend hours teaching people doing good things to people trying to make people understand what Islam is and you have to also be kind to people with your own body where does this mean share mean this is a little bit dubious no no don't go that way physically helping others carry a heavy load unload the goods from the car physically push the car that doesn't want to start and by doing this people acknowledge that you are being kind to them and all of this is known as Essen allah azza wajal in so many places in the Quran says well I see Moo in allaha yuhibbu mercy mean and do good indeed Allah loves the doers of good and this includes all types as mentioned Allah says in the Quran in the ayah that most Muslims here during Friday speeches in Alaia mobile idly well yes and indeed Allah orders justice and good conduct what does justice do with X and justice is a lower degree than X n xn is higher so if someone takes my money I take him to court I go to the police and the police investigates and they see that he took my money they order him to give my money back what is this this is justice if San is when I say ok I forgive you you can keep the money you stole it because you were needy and I understand that I don't want you to go to prison I don't want you this is a higher level of course it's not always implemented I'm just giving an example so there's a difference between someone saying bad things to you and you confront them and you face them and you tell them that what you had done was ok once again it's not working anyhow a there is difference between confronting them and getting even and between xn which you tolerate you act as if you don't know seeking the reward from allah azza wajal nao-san can be in action with the people and with the other creation and it can be with what you say so when it comes to being Muslim and reaching the level of ass and through rhetoric Allah says in the Quran were only a body Yahoo roulette ehia hacen and this beautiful ayah if we devote a lecture to it that wouldn't be too long three in surah 17 sortal Islam say tell My servants to say that which is best so many times great friendships our demolished sometimes they are reversed into enmity and hatred because a word because of a word that was said and people did not pay attention to it Best Buddies be enemies over the years they used to joke and criticize one another without any hard feelings not knowing that the shaitaan was lurking in the dark filling their hearts with hatred grudges envy not being pleased with whatever they hear but they pretend that they're laughing and they're taking it in a good way once they are ready when the other says a word that is normal in normal circumstances the other person becomes furious angry makes an issue out of it and they become enemies just because they avoided saying what is best this is why joking the lot is not good criticizing one another is not good even if it's lightly because shaytani utilizes whatever comes from our mouth Allah Allah says who lanessa sneh and speak to people good words this is an order from Allah that what comes for him from your mouth must be good isn't it a sign of Eman the Prophet says Ison whoever believes in a line that they have judgment either says good or shuts up remains silent your wife spends two to three hours cooking in the kitchen prepares lunch for you and your children she made an error much salt the cook was overcooked the food was overcooked she made a mistake what do you do a good man eat whatever he can and he says masha'Allah the food was geared great was food was beautiful may Allah reward you an evil man would not let it pass what is this we've been married for so many years you don't even know how to cook the food yet this is unbeatable I spent 8 hours outside working and now I come to have a good meal and all what I get is this what are you doing to your wife you stabbing her in the heart your chef she deserves it ok she deserves it but you deserve much more how would you like it if she came one night to you and said in bed while you were happy in intimate and excited that this is not good you don't know how to do your thing like you're a man what is this would you be insulted say what is good if you want to hear what is good and there are so many any places where Allah tells us to say what is best and you have to have Excel in your actions as well and this is strange imagine being instructed to have a SAN even in things that are globally known to be ruthless harsh violent look at the beauty of Islam the Prophet says in an authentic hadith in a logic a table asana and a coldie shape allah has mandated and ordered that you have a sad in everything you do therefore whenever you slaughter you should sharpen your blade and put your slaughter to ease by slaughtering quickly it is prohibited in Islam for us to sharpen the blade in front of the ship while the ship is looking it is prohibited in Islam to slaughter a sheep well an other another ship is standing and watching especially in hatch when people have like 10 or 20 sheeps to slaughter and they put them in the same place and bismillah lock with a lock but in front of the others this is prohibited in Islam it is prohibited to slaughter with a dull knife what is this it's not working no you have to sharpen it so well so that it immediately relieves the animal from its pains so to go into a SAN that would take us a lot of any time and there are so many things that we can speak to but about that would most likely consume most of the time so we are remaining now with evidence from the Sunda certain answer which is the long hadith of gibreel we will conclude our session with it be analyzed dodging and take the questions afterwards so can you kindly read it please the title which is reported from Nakata rhodium Bachmann who say one day we were sitting with a prophet when they appeared to us a man with extremely white garment an extremely black hair no trace of journeying could be seen on him nor did any among us recognize him then he sat in front of the prophet leaned up his knees with his knees solo Hawley was seldom I'm placing his hand upon the the path the site of the visa Bihari was seldom and he said o Muhammad inform me about his stem so he said lo haría was in lemon said it is that you testify that there is no authority that has a right to be worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and the u.s. stablish the prayer gives a car fast during the month of Ramadan and performed the Hajj pilgrimage to a Las house if you are able to do it he said you have spoken truthfully so amazed that he had asked him and then he told him that he was truthful then he said you know of course of course we can't go through this hadith explaining it but most of you know it by heart it was strange how do you ask someone a question when he answers it he says you said this is correct didn't you know he did not ask me to know you are telling me or informing me so this is why they were amazed how could this stranger come and ask about Islam and then he would say to the professor after answering him he said you had said that yes if he then he said now inform me about Amen so he said Ali social Salaam it is that you believe in Allah his messengers and in his books his messengers the last day and that she believed in other the good of it and the battery ok ok this copy of yours is wrong because to believe in Allah what's after Allah his angels yes you should his messengers oh did you okay good courier and he said you have spoken truthfully now inform me about exam he said it is that you worship Allah as if you see him but even though you don't see him he indeed sees you then he said now him from me about the final hour he said Allah who Ali was a limb saying the one who has been axed does not have any more knowledge of a than the one who is accent he said so then inform me about its science he's a lot Hardy was a lemon said it will be when the mother gives birth to her female master when the barefooted barren and lowly Shepherd will compete with one another in construction tall buildings then he left and we remain seated there for a while then he saw Laura was a lemon said Homer do you know who the questioner worse I said Allah and His Messenger knows best he is the lover already was a let me say that was gibreel who came to you to teach you your religion ok so this is the great hadith that we all know about and with this we conclude the second or soul or the second fundamental which is what we know or what is your religion the third one is knowing the Prophet alehissallaam which we will come to speak to about next week he is a widget so do we have any questions no sir never shall we have some few questions the first question is eating it's permissible to hire a private investigator to check out a man who wants to marry you hiring someone to gather information that is well known to anyone it's permissible what is not permissible in Islam is to spy and usually a PII or a private eye would work as a spy so he would anticipate in the card for a few hours follow the person wherever he is going photographing him those who he's meeting with maybe try to hack his email Facebook social media this is Hara Allah says in surah al-hajj Iraq well at just says who do not spy on one another but to gather information that is well known to anyone so he goes and he checks on the person's colleagues at work what do you think of Assam and they say well I re is a good guy is he impulsive does he have Grey's attacks is he stingy is and they should know no is this is that and he gathers information which a father would have gone and asked the same questions he goes through the message it speaks to the Imam and says does he professor and this is his picture I've never seen this man in my life Finola he lives next door ten feet away you don't know him then this is a problem he goes and checks for example if he has any criminal records this is not spying this is gathering information that everybody knows this is permissible in sha Allah but spying is not permissible next question is Salaam alaikum please is it permissible to name newborn baby angels name like brain and lungs it's an issue of dispute in the most authentic opinion that it is permissible to name children with the names of the angels providing that the children are male it is totally prohibited to call a female daughter with the name of angels because this is the doing of the idol worshipers as mentioned in the Quran that the idol worshippers made the angels to be females and we know that the angels are not females yet they are not considered to be males because they have no gender yet because they have no gender in as humans we give them the pronouns of male because this is the higher gender a male is a higher in gender than the female and this is mentioned in the Quran and whether feminists would not be pleased with that this is their problem this is Islam the raziel of 1.7 billion allah as allah stated in the Quran will a said the caracal unfair and email is not like a female and he said allah azza wajal rajala comunidad de said that men are guardian over women so you cannot have in an airplane a captain in another captain even if if both of them were captains one of them has to be acting as a first officer taking orders from the one sitting on the left seat the captain this is why before they start the flight two captains come one of them says okay I'm the captain of the fight you're my first officer and the other captain says okay and he sits on the right seat and he acts like that this is how life goes so what brought us to this question what was the question in the in the first place I forgot yes yeah so so the male gender is superior to the female gender and due to the fact that angels don't have a gender they are referred to as male pronouns so we say he when we talk about angel jibreel and this is also done by the Sahaba by giving the names of an angel to their sons but not their daughters so in short yes you can scold your son gibreel mika l as as a male son but not to a daughter you cannot call your daughter angel or Malak or medic in arabic this is not permissible next question is my dad say I'm most bowed to greeting I know of the ruling and I have tried my best convincing my uncle's to say I must obey Him since he is my dad how do I compromise this kind of situation I fear that I me yet so piquant child says condemned to hell you will be a disobedient servant of Allah if you agree to bow to him so you choose what is greater instant to disobey Allah or to disobey your father Allah says in the Quran that you must not obey your parents if they order you to commit however you have to give them good companionship so when he says you must bow to me okay let's assume that you bow to him is he happy probably yes tomorrow he comes he says you must prostrate to me make sure dude what will you do said yeah if I disobey him I will go to help me shall Allah knows what's in my heart so you do that to him the following day you discover that your father is a pervert and he says take off your clothes in front of me huh what are you gonna do oh oh this is no I can't do that Enola well hi there's no get it - I can do it your religion your Eman comes first as a priority you're kind to them because Allah tells you to be kind to your parents but you cannot obey a creature in disobeying the Creator so this is a rule of thumb and the Sahaba did this sadly a view across one of the ten heaven-bound he was known among Arabia among all the Arabs but he was the most dutiful and obedient son to his parents when he accepted Islam his mother and his uncle's relentlessly tried to turn him away from Islam and he would not budge he would not listen until the day that his mother went into a hunger strike and it took many days until she was in a critical condition so his uncle's came to him and said sod your mother is about to die and he smiled and told them convey this message to my mother and if I remember correctly he himself went to his mother and he addressed her was well she was on bed unable to move so weak he said my mother all of Arabia knows that I am the most dutiful son to his mother and I would do anything for you and you know that but by Allah if you had a hundred souls and each soul was exiting your body painfully torturing you so that I would reject my religion and come back to worshiping idols mala I would not leave my religion so when she saw his determination she started to eat and drink and left her hunger strike so are he may Allah make it easy for you if you have an abusive father like this if you have any father who does not fear Allah like this does not pay any attention to your religious commitment and your Islam this is your test from Allah obey Allah and do and this obey your father when he's telling you to do that no matter what the consequences are and may Allah make it easy for you the next question is okay for female in my hair there is no problem for a female to cut short her hair and the mother of the believers the wives of the Prophet Allah used to cut short their hair but you have to be aware of the conditions or the restrictions in shortening your hair 1 you must not imitate a haircut of the disbelievers so if the disbelievers for example have a hair on the side of the face and they shave this area it's like some models do or some actresses or some singers this is Haram this is not done by Muslims and you should not imitate men so to have a haircut that resembles boys for example this is totally prohibited other than that the sky's the limit and the next question is when is the right time to say the evening as car some maid before mother or after mother this is an issue of dispute I personally say them after Maghrib prayer but if so if someone wants to say it after us a prayer there are scholars who said that this is also time for saying it so hamdullah you can choose either way you're comfortable mostly with do you say Allah Akbar when getting off a rocker or after standing up no you should say it in between you see when I say Allahu Akbar in the books of they call it takbir atul in Tihar the career of movement so if I'm sitting and I want to stand up some people say while sitting Allah Akbar and then they move other people say the takbir after they reach so while they're sitting they stand up and once they're erect they say Allah Akbar and both are wrong it should be set in between so while you're sending up you say Allah Akbar and this is cascaded throughout all the movements in Salah it should be in between the two pillars now I am a biology I'm a biology student and we have to perform such an experiment but before starting the experiment our professors prescribed us you to use clean hands with alcohol so is it permissible to clean hand with ethyl alcohol as alcohol or hippie tyrannous no no who said alcohol is prohibited in Islam I've never heard this in my life consuming alcohol is prohibited in Islam using it in swipes using it in detergents using it in perfume using it in what is this that they put before washing their hands they took down detergents what do they call it they have a name for it I forgot although it is regularly used with copied 19 and the virus they you should have to put synthesizes Accola here basim synthesizes so Oh Marshall everybody's is putting their contribution that we have more than two viewers wow that's great we're making history you had a Billiken ham so I hope they're benefiting is it not there by mistake so set aside sanitizes it's 90 or 80 percent alcohol okay the concept of alcohol being Haram in Islam is totally bogus what is Haram is intoxicants so some bakeries have alcohol in it so what's the big deal does it intoxicate know when you make Yates nuggets what do you call them in Arabic we called the Chimera you know when you might want to make dough and you put the wheat and you put Camilla into it is it Yates I don't know and what it is in English it has a percentage of alcohol but it is not intoxicating therefore it is permissible to use 2 in biology in medicine we can't have these Sciences without using sanitizers and and and such things to clean your hands with so go ahead there's no problem in that inshallah to hold the wind in solar if one has ability to do so yes if you are afraid of breaking your rule and you suppress passing wind your salat is totally normal especially for those who have wind problems meaning that they always pass winds and they break their would do many times and there's a lot many types so if we tell him release it he goes makes will do and come back and it comes again and again it would cause a lot of hardship but if you can suppress it and hold it without from from coming out there's no problem that name check is there anything I need to do if I got to marry to a woman I had illegal relationship with because I am made to understand that it is not permissible to marry a woman you've had illegal relationship with no this is not true it is not a valid marriage contract when two fornicators marry without repenting to Allah or while the woman has conceived so you cannot have a girlfriend boyfriend relationship and next day you go and get married she has to repent to Allah first you have to repent to Allah first cut all communications and after she is sure that she's not pregnant by getting one monthly cycle if both of you repented you can propose and marry her but to come and marry without repentance the marriage contract is invalid to marry her while she is pregnant claiming that you are the father still the marriage contract according to the majority of scholars is not valid and Allah knows best now the last question share what is the rule in not mix some say it's not a mug or network not muck not in UT not much is a something like how do you call it it's it's a not that they use as a spicy and it gives a good flavor to the food this is an issue of dispute among scholars because if you add a little bit too much of it it intoxicates you and anything that is intoxicating is how I'm minister so some scholars say that using a little bit of it is permissible because a little bit does not intoxicated however others say aji if you put too much then it will become intoxicating and this makes it harm so it is not a matter of life or death it's just spices therefore leaving it to be safe is far greater than adding it and then be sure you on the day of judgment and hence I am inclined to say that this is not permissible to use and Alonzo Gee knows best the lucious single intention barakallahu eco Musa Qala here until we meet you in Sharla next time I did with Manila wassalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh leakage you"
