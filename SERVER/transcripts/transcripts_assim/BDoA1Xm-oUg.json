  "transcript": "Sajid says is there any reward on cutting nails on Friday is it sooner to cut nails on Friday the answer is no it is not part of the Sunnah to select Friday to do the acts of fitrah which are shaving the pubic hair plucking the armpit hair trimming the mustache clipping the nails all of these are part of the of the Sunnah of Fatah which the Prophet has some highlighted and told us that this is recommended to do now some people always do this before Friday prayer especially when they're doing their also ritual bath for the Juma for the Friday prayer so they associate these acts with it associating these acts with it is no problem but thinking that this is a Sunnah and if you missed it off you've done a grave mistake and this is a big thing no this is totally not true so if you do it just because it's a habit and not related to Friday there is no problem in that in sha Allah and Allah knows best"
