  "title": "Ruling on calling someone kafir if he does not pray",
  "transcript": "but when we talk about general concept of an individual that we know see when we talk generally we say yes whoever abandons prayer is kafir but when we want to pinpoint a person this particular individual who doesn't pray in front of us we cannot say that he's a kafir because there are conditions to be fulfilled maybe he prays when we don't see him maybe he prays on and off maybe he has a misinterpretation that he has in his mind thinking that it is not mandatory to pray you never know so we don't go and make someone kafir individually specific person without fulfilling the conditions and this is usually done by scholars or by the muslim imam that is the muslim judge the ruler now having said that it is not at all appropriate to label people for us but i'm assuming this is a general question"
