  "transcript": "If you're talking about what a new Muslim first steps should be, this is different than what and how the Muslim community is supposed to deal with this new Muslim. In a sense, that if a person wants to accept Islam, he pops the question, how would I do it? What should I do? So the procedure is simple. You take a full bath, which is highly recommended, though it is not mandatory. But it's sort of symbolic because you're going to cleanse your inside and purify your soul with accepting Islam. And you are cleansing your body from any impurity and anything that is not worthy of Islam. So there are hadiths where the Prophet used to instruct those who embraced Islam to go and have a ghusl, a total bath. And in some incidents, he might tell them to shave their heads. But this is rare. And the scholars said that shaving the head is when a person has a haircut that is specific for the disbelievers. Like the Marines haircut, for example. This is not for Muslims. It's called Qaza' or like, what is it, the tomahawk haircut like Mr. T or someone like that. This is un-Islamic. So he has to shave it so that when I see him, I can tell that he is, I can relate to him. He's a Muslim. And the Prophet, alaihi salatu wasalam, looked at the biggest, bigger picture. And what is that? You know, what is the biggest problem new Muslims face is that when we call them to Islam and they make this massive shift from one religion to the other and they leave their culture. They leave behind all what was normal for them all these years. This is not easy. You're letting go of everything that is dear to yourself if it goes against Islam. The biggest problem is when people call them to Islam and then they abandon them. So now he's like a loner. My community doesn't want me because I've left their religion and the Muslims are not taking me in because they're busy giving dawah to someone else. So this is like cultivating the land, throwing the seeds and leaving. You're not irrigating it. You're not taking care of it. Inevitably, it's going to die. Now, the Prophet, alaihi salatu wasalam, took good care of this and he made it clear to the companions not to let go of their brother. So he would tell them to make a lot of dua. This is step one. A new Muslim and an old Muslim. What is the most important dua of all? Ask Allah azza wa jal to make us steadfast on Islam. The Prophet, alaihi salatu wasalam, most well-known dua that he would not make any other dua more than it, was, O turners of heart, make my heart steadfast on Islam. And this is the Prophet, alaihi salatu wasalam. So you could imagine those who are below him, how vulnerable would they be to flipping. And a lot of those new Muslims, if not been taken care of, they'd flip. And shaitan, satan is there. He sees that there's great momentum when they accept Islam. So he leaves them for a couple of weeks, a couple of months, maybe a couple of years, until it fades a little bit. Then he starts his attack by trying to lure them back to their old ways and habits. And if there isn't sufficient knowledge, then they would not make it. There are other steps and other ways that if you wish, we could discuss that as well."
