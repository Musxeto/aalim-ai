  "title": "Predictions about people who leave Islam - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I read in one paper article in the pew research.org they made a study about the world religion they say Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world and they uh predicts that in 2050 Islam would be slightly less than the combined Christianity Catholic Protestant and all of the Christianity maybe the difference only two three percent but in year 2070 they predict that Islam will offer overpass all of them in that reports they mentioned that up to 2050 they say the people who lives Islam roughly is about 9 million up to 2050 but the people who Embrace Islam roughly about 11 million so there are different 3 million but the Christianity they say that people who lives uh sorry people who Embrace Christianity is roughly about 60 million but people who lives Christianity exit lives Christianity is about 110 million wow that's almost double I know I don't believe in these predictions and they don't mean anything to me to us we say those who leave Islam they're more than welcome we don't want them yes because they are a hindrance to us and they are tarnishing our reputation we don't want them but I know that they are less than few thousands yes with the grace of Allah because everyone who accepts Islam would not leave it because they accepted it wholeheartedly and today all the population of Muslim in the world if I'm not mistaken is already more than two billion alhamdulillah"
