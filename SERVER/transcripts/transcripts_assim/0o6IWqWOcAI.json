  "transcript": "Qasim from Qatar Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Nasa'aka Allah Bil Khair Qasim Nasa'aka Allah Bil Rida Wa Surur Qasim In English, in English ya Qasim There is a Hadith, Allah Azza Wa Jal says And the other Hadith is Does this include what is supposed to be Al-Khuyala? I don't understand the concept I will answer you So brother Qasim is asking about two Hadiths And he thinks that there is a form of contradiction that he cannot understand So he would like a clarification Well, there is no contradiction with the grace of Allah One Hadith refers to someone who lowers his garment below the ankles Without any feeling of arrogance or pride And the other Hadith is regarding someone who does this with pride and arrogance And the punishment is different The punishment in someone who does it without any pride or arrogance Rather out of laziness Is the Prophet said whatever goes below the ankle is punished in hell fire So the whole body is not in hell Rather only this two or three centimeters below the ankle would be tormented in hell And we know that the least of people being punished in hell fire Is a person and he is Abu Talib the uncle of the Prophet Is a person who a stone of fire is placed in his sandals From its heat his brain boils So you can imagine if this is the minimum punishment and torment What would happen to our friend who lowered his garment below the ankles without any pride The other Hadith states for punishment Allah doesn't speak to them Allah doesn't purify them Allah does not look at them and they have severe torment and punishment in hell fire And who are those? Al-Musbil The one who lowers his garment So the scholar said oh because of the difference of punishment This is regarding something extra than the other one which is pride and arrogance That's why in another Hadith while a man was dragging his garments in arrogance and pride Allah made him fall in the seventh earth to hell fire Or as the Prophet said I hope this clarifies the contradiction brother Qasim"
