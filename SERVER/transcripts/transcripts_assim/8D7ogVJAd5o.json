  "transcript": "about the Rockman from the UK says can you tell us something about the deeds and the best of deeds that we can perform in Roma Bahn he the sky is the limit anything that is good that you can offer in Ramadan this would get you closer to allah azza wajal upon the top of the list is avoiding sin so the best deeds you can do in Ramadan is to avoid sin major and minor and one of the best ways of doing so is to eliminate totally your usage of social media so you do not enter during the month of Ramadan social media at all no YouTube no Instagram snapchat Twitter Facebook whatever nothing complete zero and you devote your time to getting closer to Allah dodging it's going to be difficult and there is it is that we are addicted to these haram things and in ramadan allah is coaching us training us to kick the habit and not to be addicted to what is halal such as water and food this is hella but Allah is telling us to refrain from halal things 15 hours 17 hours 19 hours depending on your region so that we are not even addicted to what is halal rather we worship allah azza wajal and we do whatever he tells us to do so by default any other addiction to haram things you would have to cleanse your system you have to detox as they say everybody's saying you have to detox no in Ramadan we detox from these social media from YouTube which only leads us to sin after sin yes we might find five minutes of a lecture or a reminder but beautiful but the rest of the hour is all in Harlem so totally avoided there is worshipping Allah with what he mandated upon you and this is the highest of all types of forms of worship so taraweeh is good Whittier is good night prayer is good nothing is equivalent to praying fetcher in the Masjid for men to praying your fault prayers on time for both men and women so do your level best in ensuring that what's mandated upon you from Allah is being done without any delay or shortcomings now the best thing for us men is to professor in the Masjid and remain until the Sun rises reading the Quran making vicar and then praying two rakahs whoever does this in the Masjid Allah would reward him with the reward of a Ramallah and hedge perfect perfect perfect and this is every single day so 30 days of Ramadan 30 Ramadan 50 hatch and you don't have to go to the agent and get a visa and come all over all the way to Mecca no need you can recite the Quran and finish it once every three days this is one of the best things meaning that you read 10 juzu per day so in in in 3 days you finish the Quran you start over again you can give money in charity even our best may Allah be pleased with the money and with his father says that the Prophet as Salam was as generous as the wind and he would be most generous in Ramadan so this is a byproduct of revising the Quran is that you become generous and you give in the cause of Allah Azza WA JAL feeding the food during the month of Ramadhan it's one of the byproducts of being generous so you feed the food and among those whom you feed are the poor the needy and even your relatives who are not poor during the Prophet said Adam whoever breaks the fasting of a person will get the same reward as he had so someone who fasted and it's now sunset time you give him dates you give him water milk some soup some sambusa and a meal then Allah would reward you with the same reward of him fasting a full day so you can do that you have to observe night prayer known as taraweeh so if you pray with the imam in the message it until he concludes his whitter Allah would reward you as if you have prayed the whole night from Asia to fetcher and if you do this every single night without skipping a night Allah forgive all of your sins previous sins and you can do Amara you can visit your kinship and connect to them so that whatever was severed you patch it up you can check on the poor the needy those who need medication and give them the sky is the limit a lot of do a lot of vicar especially door when you break her fast the Prophet told us I assume that the door is answered it's not rejected a lot of vicar throughout the day and the night and as I said the sky is the limit"
