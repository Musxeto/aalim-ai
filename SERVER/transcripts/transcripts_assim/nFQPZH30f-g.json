  "title": "Have fear & anxiety everytime I pray, what to do? - #assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign and it is OCD you know um but it's a feeling of fear and anxiety that I have in my heart whenever I'm praying and this feeling interferes with my recitation and I forget what words I was on and it's really confuses to me and I think a lot inside the Salah and sometimes my head hurts inside the Salah so I don't know how to fix this problem if I ignore which verses should I decide from um I really don't know I'm confused first of all you have one of two courses either to keep on fighting and OCD and ignored it or you leave Salah and of course the latter is Unthinkable leaving Salat means that you've abandoned Islam and this is exactly what shaytan is targeting why are you having OCD who's the cause and the perpetrator behind this it's shaytan it's Satan all what he wants to confuse you to distract you to make you lose the sweetness of Salat to make you suffer and feel that prayer is a burden you just want to get rid of it and every time you have these Whispers and get carried away with them shaytan claps is very happy he's very pleased with you the bad news is that Allah is angry with you because you are the cause of it you're allowing shaytan to come in and to creep into your head and to mess up your thoughts if you were to depend on Allah rely on him make Dua Institute oh Allah protect me from such Whispers And OCD Allah would have done that for you besides what is a pillar in Salat is Fatiha so if you recite the Fatiha and you recite something afterwards and you get confused go for record skip it just pray Fatiha don't pray anything else is my prayer valid 100 percent reciting a isura or a verse or more of the Quran after the Fatiha is it's not mandatory so what counts is the Fatiha you do that and give it a shot supplicating to Allah and suju to protect you and to cure this illness of yours blocking our all such thoughts and Whispers from shaytan because you know it's from shaytan that's strange you know your enemy is telling you to do this and you're adhering to him and listening to him whose fault is it definitely yours"
