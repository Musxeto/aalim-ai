  "title": "Is paying past Zakat on the current value Riba to Allah excess amount",
  "transcript": "Arma from India Sheikh, my question is that if someone pays their past zakat on current rate of gold or silver rather than old one, is it just like giving more as sadqa and hence rewarding or is it like giving Riba in any way because of particularly using current value of the metal converted to currency for all calculations? If a person is obliged to give zakat, whatever amount he gives in access to the zakat is sadqa. There is no Riba with Allah Azza Wa Jal. So if you have to pay a hundred euros as zakat and you said I'll pay a hundred and twenty just to be safe, a hundred and fifty, a thousand, that would be one hundred zakat and the rest would be charity and this is totally permissible. Whatever has benefit for the poor and the needy, this is permissible Inshallah. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it Inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
