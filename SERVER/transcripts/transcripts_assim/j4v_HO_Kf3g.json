  "transcript": "Abu abdulrahman from Italy says used to pray and used to pray very fast okay my roommate his nature is playing very fast and and I give him advice but he don't think so if I had this if I listen I don't talk to him is that I'm hiding a knowledge from the person because I told him he will play double files that's what I'm not telling him that is how do you say that no you of course you have to show him the way of the Prophet Allah and explain to him that this was only in regards to sunnatul Fajr the voluntary turakas before the fourth mandatory obligatory prayer of Fajr but to conceal it so that he would not pray quickly that is not the right thing to do your concealing knowledge first of all second of all we have to evaluate whether your friend's prayer is valid or invalid see praying quickly is a relative description to you he might be praying quickly to me he might be praying normally so someone who's used to saying in his 10 times would consider someone who says three times praying quickly and someone who's used to saying three times would consider someone who says wants to be praying quickly and all these three their prayer is valid and as long as they have Tranquility in the pillar itself when doing rukur or standing up or doing sujud and they say it once and they pray in such a fashion their prayer is valid so you have to reassess your judgment in regards to him praying quickly to know whether his prayer is valid or invalid in Allah Knows Best"
