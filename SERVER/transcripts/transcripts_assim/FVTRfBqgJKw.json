  "transcript": "[Music] there are brothers who are fasting but are careless about praying their salah they do not pray and reciting the Quran they waste their Rama bond in loitering in food malls you know just going around shopping etc what's the ruling on that first of all we have to understand we are not people judges the biggest problem is when I think of myself as a good believer as a righteous pious practicing Muslims Muslim and then I look at everyone else starting to accuse their Eman starting to blame their lack of interest in good things starting to feel boastful thinking highly of myself liking what I do and presenting what they are not doing like me this is the same thing that Satan had and ended up him going into hell so sure we should not comment no no no you don't get me wrong it's the feeling that goes into your heart when I read this question I get the sense now what is mandatory upon them to fast Ramadan are they fasting yes they're fasting but wait wait are they are they fulfilling the pillar yes they're fasting okay do they pray five times a day yes yeah but not in the Masjid okay this is sinful we might bring this up to them and encouraging them going to shopping malls food malls time buying clothes is it Hallam no it's not her I'm sure but they should what they should do is something different you have to weigh and know the preferences in Islam don't you know that there is a hadith that a man came to the prophet sawa sanam and said tell me about Salah he said to pray five times a day he said anything more the Prophet said no except if you want to offer voluntary tell me about fasting is it too fast Ramadan anything more no unless you want to add something voluntary and so on so the man said by Allah who had sent you I will not deduct or add more than what you had said meaning he would only pray five times a day . he would only fast Ramadan . etc and he left and the Prophet said Allah sent by Allah if he was telling the truth he will succeed the guy is not going to pray taraweeh no tahajud nothing extra other than the five daily prayers yet the Prophet said that he would succeed so when you and I come and evaluate others and say oh this brother is doesn't pray taraweeh hold us in the Masjid he's a bad Muslim ah-hoo - billahi min ash-shaytani r-rajim how dare you judge others so are he and of T brother and sister don't get me wrong I just want you to open up and you know the race horses when they put something beside their eyes so that you only see the track not being distracted I'd like you to remove this and see the full picture now this doesn't stop us from encouraging them in showing them that Tala we has this beautiful reward from allah azza wajal the prophet said is Omarosa whoever prays Ramadan in totality that is taraweeh prayer allah azza wajal would forgive his sins providing he does this he manon YT 7 man i'ma Ramadan Eman and YT 7 Eman and meaning believing in the Sunnah and the reward of it 87 and dissipating the reward from Allah so JAL not from others this is the meaning of Iman or 87 so first of all praying the whole night of Ramadan that's too long share you're talking about about 10 9 10 hours a night that's a lot well Allah has given you concessions really yes the Prophet said that is awesome whoever prays with the Imam until he concludes his prayer Allah would register to him the prayer of a full night so if I pray to Tasha and then I pray taraweeh with the same Imam until he gives Salam from whitter Allah would give me the 9 or 10 hours full night prayer Wow not only that the Prophet said Alice awesome whoever prays lailatul other one night a man and what is seven believing in Allah and anticipating the reward from Allah Allah would forgive his previous sins Wow one night and I don't know which night it is so anyone who prays taraweeh p.m. with the Imam in the last 10 nights he's got it done who cares if it's the 28th first night or the 29th night of Ramadan who cares as long as I prayed the whole last 10 nights I'm a winner for sure and certain so we encourage people but we don't judge them as long as they're doing what is mandatory and staying away from haram yes and always try to call people not repel them if he prays on time and he fasts from about and you keep on telling yeah here you should not go to a mall you should not go and have dinner outside you should not spend some time with your wife going to visit yeah it's not a good business it's me between me and Alonzo you are making me hate what I'm doing because it's not like what you're doing always have the balance always bring people to Islam rather than repelling them away from Islam [Applause]"
