  "title": "Ruling on hanging Wind Chimes, Dream Catchers or the Blue Eye in Islam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what is the ruling on using dream catchers or wind chimes now if i understand the question correctly these so-called dream catchers are a form of decoration that people hang in the ceilings or over doors whether it's made from wooden uh pipes or from metal so that when the wind blows it gives a sound and this sound might be pleasant might ha it does not have any system to it usually so some people may be confused that this can be similar to music and without any doubt this is not music because it does not have a rhythm to it it does not have certain tunes that it follows that would make a person enjoy as when he listens to music music so basically speaking hearing such random noise or sounds is like when someone is sewing a piece of wood or a a blacksmith is is hitting a piece of metal it's the same thing and hence there is nothing wrong in listening to it however if the people the normal people see it and they get the idea that you have installed or placed it so that it would ward off jinn or nightmares as some people may think of it in this case it becomes haram why i don't have any belief in it yes it's true you don't have any belief in it but others do and hence due to the fact that others may think negatively either of you or of it because of their a bad conviction or bad iman in such superstitious things it becomes prohibited for us like someone who likes the blue eye as it forms decoration and she wears it as a necklace or hangs it on the door and we say why are you doing this she says looks nice beautiful and she has no intention or believe that this prevents evil eye it's still haram for her to wear or to put in her house the origin is the hadith narrated in muslim where a man came to the prophet he said o prophet of allah i made a vow never to slaughter a camel in buwana an area close to medina called buwanna so the prophet asked him two questions assalam 1 is there an idol that is being worshipped by the idol worshipers because then they will confuse you for slaughtering it for their idol not for allah though you're doing it for allah but the prophet made sure i saw salam so the man said no question two is there any read any festival celebration that reoccurs every single year on the same time and this is another confusion that a lot of the muslims try to turn a blind eye to a heat is something that tree occurs so your birthday is your anniversary is because it reoccurs every single year on the same particular date and this is totally prohibited to celebrate the prophet made and gave us islam to only to aid to celebrate and adolf so the prophet asked him is there any aid in it and the man said no then the prophet said allah fulfill your vow and slaughter that camel so i hope this answers your question"
