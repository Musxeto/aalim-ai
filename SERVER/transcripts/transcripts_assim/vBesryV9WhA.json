  "transcript": "uh we have abdevahir from the U.S what should one who experiences a daily constant Trump stomach trouble do if he constantly experiences overwhelming gas attacks from phrase he does not know what to do and he tries his best to hold it in getting day to day it is like this throughout the day it was released here and there so what should he do okay I will answer inshallah as before the break brother Abdullah from the U.S says that he suffers from a lot of pain and emission of gas that is continuous all the time he tries to suppress suppress it but it doesn't work so he asks what's the ruling on that first of all this is similar to urine incontinence either would be enough time for you that you can relate to an estimate where you can pray without anything coming out from you in this case you have to wait a person knows that between there's an hour and gas or urine or whatever is going to continue to come out until half an hour and then there is a gap of a half an hour nothing comes out he knows this for certain by observation by practice by whatever in this case he has to skip Salat until he's totally pure and fresh changes whatever's soiled from his clothes perform Moodle and pray on time this is scenario number one scenario number two is when a person has this problem continuously and it doesn't stop no matter how many times he tries to observe it and keep a watch for it it simply continues every time he goes to pray or he wants to make wudu it breaks and it continues to do that even if he prays as he is until the end of the time in this case the consensus of all Scholars as if reports and other Scholars that who's ever is in such a situation once the advantage called of the prayer whether it's whatever and he wants to pray not necessarily the moment the Adan is called no whatever he wants to pray but after the time is due not before he may go ahead and clean himself perform Moodle and pray even if this is continuously coming throughout the process even if he was performing wudu it broke ignores it goes and pray while praying it breaks no problem because this is the best of his ability as for going to attend the prayer in the Masjid if these gases have an offensive odor that would annoy Muslims it is prohibited for you to attend because the prophet salallahu ordered us to prevent those who consume garlic and onions from disturbing and from annoying or harming the worshipers because the angels are also harmed and annoyed by such an offensive odor so anything that's offensive that's bad bad smell even if it's your own body odor even if it's someone who smokes and comes with the smell of tobacco this is prohibited for him to attend the Masjid with such a smell because others are offended by it so likewise for someone who passes gas but if your gases do not have such a smell hopefully not the sound as well in this case there's no problem in attending the prayer and Allah Knows Best"
