  "transcript": "Nadia says can we eat meat from McDonald's from Subway and so on and can we eat meat from grocery stores by the way I live in Norway where most people are atheists not people from the book first of all Muslims can eat any type of veg food any type of non meat food that is not harmful Muslims can eat it so any vegetables sweets pudding cakes that do not have animal derivatives in them you're allowed to eat whether they were done by Hindus by Buddhists by Christians by Muslims it doesn't matter whether it was cooked by atheists by people doing it for their own gods and idols then bringing it to you there's no problem the food itself is a lot as Muslims the only thing that we care about is the meat was it one halal meat meaning that the animal are we permitted to eat the meat and flesh of that animal such as in the case of domestic donkeys dogs cats lions wolves these are Haram for us to eat Eagles hawk and the birds that we are not supposed to eat or not allowed to eat because they're scavengers or they eat meat or they have claws and they have whatever this is how long for us to eat secondly it has to be slaughtered and the person slaughtering has to be either a Muslim a Jew or a Christian these are the only three people or three dynamic denominations that we are allowed to eat from their slaughtering they slaughter halal meat such as cows sheep camels birds in general so they're slaughtering is permissible likewise hunting hunting deers rabbits etc all of these are halal for us to eat now the issue is if I go to a Christian country the vast majority of people are Christians I can eat the meat they're providing I'm not sure that they had not slaughtered it if I'm sure that they slaughtered it I've seen that or have confirmed report beyond doubt then it's Haram for me to eat or if I'm sure that they've said a word of Cofer like they saying in the name of Jesus or in the name of Buddha this is totally Haram Jews Christians and Muslims any one of them who does something Haram the meat is Haram now coming to subways McDonald's Burger King and all the fast-food chains if it's in a Christian country it's ok to eat until proven otherwise what about Norway the vast majority of people are atheists I don't know that you can not know that either because I think the country has a cross in its flag so if you ask the people what is the religion of the masses they will say Christians whether not practicing or not practicing this is not tribe my problem they're Christians likewise a lot of the Muslim countries do you think they are really Muslims they're practicing Muslims definitely not some of them even state that he is an atheist he doesn't believe in God he's a moderate thinker yet at the end of the day the country's Muslims by default the butcher's are Muslims and the meat is halal for me as a Muslim until proven otherwise if I see someone slaughtering and he said I don't believe in religion and I'm slaughtering this sheep this is a dead meat or he says that a Basim mohammad in the name of muhammad or name of Adi or in the hasan and husayn and he slaughters this is dead meat this is shirk definitely so the default is that Norway is a Christian country and this is why if a Muslim man marries a norwegian lady who's christian the marriage is right if she denounces christianity says no i do not believe in christianity and i do not believe in anything that relates to it in this case she is an atheist and the marriage is not valid and likewise if the butcher you know for sure that he does not practice Christianity or does not believe in it and denounce says yet in this case his slaughtering is not permissible otherwise the default is that you can eat meat there providing that it is not sure for you it's Haram having said that McDonald's and subway etc you must be careful and that sure that they do not mix the utensils they prepare port with the normal beef and chicken and turkey etc because then it becomes netizen it's how long for you to eat so if you know for sure and you have evidence that yes the the utensils are different the containers are different even the gloves they wear would be different when handling these things in this case inshallah it is permissible analyzer gel knows best"
