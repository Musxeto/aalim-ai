  "transcript": "Hammad says there's a magnetic bracelet when you wear it it relieves the pain which you have in your arms or hands some people say you have to rely on Allah you leave it for Allah Allah cures all sickness I think it is shirk to wear such a thing then we should also not have medicines we have trust in Allah so basically speaking Muhammad is asking about a bracelet it's magnetic bracelet and like 10 years ago 15 years ago it used to be sold in the market a bracelet made of copper and then there is the biological necklace I think they called it or something like that that has energy etc to cut a long story short healing comes from Islamic ways and practical ways when we say Islamic ways this refers to that it is met it was mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah for example rukia reciting al-fatiha this is proven from the Sunnah and al-fatiha one of his name's is the healer so reciting ayatul kursi reciting the last three chapters called wallah had alpha lakh and an ass this is a form of healing it's Rokia saying supplications good supplications Alohomora bana said he'll pass this is islamic sharing it's referred to the means of healing that were given to us through the conditioner also there is honey that's mentioned in the Quran and in Sunnah there is copying the SCOOTER ization there is the black seed and a number of things that the Sunnah had come up with and telling us that these are means of healing these are the Islamic means of healing then you have the practical the experimented so the doctors said we've experimented and found out that antibiotics cure infections with the grace of Allah Sojin aspirin or panadol or Tylenol cures headaches relieves fevers with the grace of Allah soldier we've experimented this physicians doctors pharmaceutical experts all say yes this is good stuff this is experimented here's the research so this is practiced this is tried and and proven to do a good job so this is halal providing it is holid providing that the side-effects do not exceed the benefits of it and it's not harmful then we have a third form of so-called healing that people believe in but it's not mentioned in the Quran the Sunnah and the physicians the doctors the experts say that this is baseless this is bogus this has no proof to back it up such as these magnetic bracelets these bronze or copper bracelets or necklaces or some of them even wear rings and think that the stone of the Ring has something that brings healing and and maybe protects him from this or that no scholars say that this if not proven scientifically falls under minor shirk so you know that Allah is the healer but you believe in this bracelet because you found that it relieves your pains doctors say this is hope this is bogus this is not true there's no scientific evidence backing it up so in this case if you believe Allah is the healer but you still wear it this is minor ship if you believe that it heals by itself this is major shaker and you're not a Muslim anymore so we have to go and ask the physicians the real physicians the doctors to provide us with research papers on this magnetic bracelet and whether it relieves Rome tides or a kings in the bone etc or not analyze Odell knows best"
