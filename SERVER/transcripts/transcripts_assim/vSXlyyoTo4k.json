  "transcript": "Manwarf says, Ã¬If a person dies with debts, are his children or wife obliged to pay off his debts? We know that when a person dies, heÃ­s obliged to, or we, the heirs, are obliged to number one, prepare his funeral. So whatever money we need to get him washed, shrouded, perfumed, and buried, this has to be taken from his wealth. Then we go for whatever debts he had left behind. So if he was in debt, we have to look at the wealth he left behind, property, house, shares, cash, investments. And we have to pay from all of these his debts, even if we had to sell the family house, because this is his wealth, and we have to sell everything to get his debts over with. If we pay off his debts, and there remains some money or property, we have to look at whatever will he wrote before dying. And we know that heÃ­s entitled to allocate one-third of his wealth to anyone he wants or any purpose he likes, providing itÃ­s not one of his heirs. So he cannot write a will to his wife, to his children, or to his parents and the likes. After that, whatever is left, we divide it upon the heirs who would inherit him, his parents, his spouse, and his children. And Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
