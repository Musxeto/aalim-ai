  "title": "Suppressing the urge to pass gas / wind during prayer, is wudu still valid? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "what's the ruling on suppressing the urge to pass wind during salah is my salah valid if i succeed in suppressing it or do i have to make a new wudu and pray again is nullified if the things that we were told in the quran and the sunnah exist such as defecating urinating passing of wind sleeping deep sleep or eating camel's meat so if a person feels the movement inside of his stomach and has the urge to pass wind but he doesn't he suppresses it whether before salat or during salat in this case his wudu is intact it cannot be broken until he passes wind and if he does not pass wind then his wudu is totally valid and intact and there is nothing needed for him to do and allah azza knows best"
