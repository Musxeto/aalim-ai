  "transcript": "his second question was about the Sunnah of wearing the garment this what I'm wearing the white shirt long shirt is called hope in Arabic but usually felt is anything that you wear a dress a t-shirt a shirt it's soap something that covers you and he's saying amis I mean this is a shirt in Arabic so he's saying is it the Sunnah dances yes and no it is a cultural thing so if I'm in living in the States would I wear this dancer is no I'd wear like everybody else is wearing I won't be wearing a tux for example but I would wear a normal suit like everybody anybody else I would look like everyone else without imitating the disbelievers because wearing such a thug in a place where people are not used to it would cause more harm than good and there isn't anything in the sooner that states that the Prophet as-salaam ordered us to wear such a particular dress there are there is a dress code that it shouldn't be tired that it shouldn't be see-through that shouldn't exceed the anchors that it shouldn't imitate the women and that an obvious gender that is shouldn't exceed imitate the disbelievers etc but not to wear this or to wear a Thor yes wearing white is part of the Sunda other than that it's a cultural thing and whoever claims that it is a Sunnah just because a prophet did it is Ostrom then we might as well say that going to work riding a mule is a Sunnah because a prophet did that too so Lala are you Salim"
