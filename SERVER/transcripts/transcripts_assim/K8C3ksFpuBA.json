  "transcript": "Daniel from Norway. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam. A very big air conditioner of yours. Mashallah. I have a question about regards to food. When my mother prepares food, for example, I wanted to know is it something that I need to find out if it's halal, haram or if it has pork in it because I've come to find out recently that some of the things that she does make, you know, have pork or have these things. So I just wanted to know. She's Muslim? Excuse me? Is she Muslim? No, my family is a Kafir family. I'm the only one. If this is the case and you know that they do not have any boundaries in serving pork or ingredients of haram food, yes, you have to make certain that the food is halal because this is an obligation upon you and Allah knows best."
