  "title": "Iddah for a woman who has Irregular Periods | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says what is the ADA for a woman who has irregular period again there is the transitional period or the waiting period is something that a woman has after being divorced or that is separated from her husband either through divorce lawyer or separation for separation or after death of the husband after she becomes a widow so there is a idea for a woman who's divorced her EDA is one of three one generally speaking a normal woman right there would be three monthly cycles to a woman or a girl who does not have monthly cycle either because she's too young or she's too old manopause in this case her ADEA is three months lunar months and thirdly a woman who is pregnant her ADA is to deliver once she delivers her pregnancy when she gives birth then she is out of her head immediately as for a widow she is either a normal woman who's not pregnant her red day is fixed for four months and ten days or she is pregnant her right there is fixed to giving birth so if her husband dies today at 1:00 p.m. while she was pregnant and she gives birth at 101 a minute after his death she can get married at 102 immediately there's no idea for her because there was one minute or one week or month depending on her pregnancy the moment she gives birth her idea is over she's not a widow anymore coming back to the question of the sister a woman who has her head and she gets three she gets a regular period now this can be understood if a woman for example is breastfeeding when she circles her period is interrupted sometimes six months without a period so if a man divorces his wife she could be in her red for like a year and a half two years who knows that's too long what to do can she refer to the three months scenario the answer is no because she still gets her right there that she still gets her menses so what to do well you try to stop what is preventing your idea so stop suckling - you can go to the doctor and ask for pills that will allow you to have your menses back and this is safe and possible usually they provide such women with pills and the these pills regulate her menses and with this she can have her menses normally but either way she has to have three monthly cycles before her idea is over and Elijah knows best"
