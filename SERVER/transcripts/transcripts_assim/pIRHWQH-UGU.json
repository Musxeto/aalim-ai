  "title": "My father has many debts and I have no brothers, can I teach in a co-ed high school to help him?",
  "transcript": "Bally from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu My father has a lot of debts and I'm his eldest daughter. I don't have a brother. In this situation I must work to help him. So can I teach in a high school where there is both boys and girls students? They're grown-ups. Helping your father in paying off his debt is something that is considered to be a good deed and part of being dutiful to your father. However, this cannot be done by committing a disobedience to Allah, committing a sin and definitely teaching in a high school for boys and girls is sinful because such boys are non-mahram. They're adults. They're grown-ups. So definitely this is out of the question."
