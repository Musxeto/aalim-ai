  "title": "Do Crust & Mucus on the Sides of the Eyes impact Wudu? Shaykh Assim al-Hakeem",
  "transcript": "far from qar uh my question is uh when I wake up I have like uh a crust and mucus on the sides of my eyes so does this impact my Wu or or like oel okay this mucus or this crust at the sides of the eyes is an issue of dispute among Scholars some consider it to be a barrier that prevents water from reaching the whole face and in my own opinion this causes a lot of hardship among people it opens the door for a huge case of OCD among people to the extent that they go into small details that were not mentioned in the Sunnah so yes it is important to wash the limbs of woodo of evolution that were mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah and it is important that the water reaches the skin without any barrier however such very tiny minute negligible amount of natural um things that are found on your body there are Scholars that consider this to be negligible and not impacting the validity of the woodo and this is what I'm inclined to of course if you can remove it nobody would keep it intentionally but sometimes people are neglectful sometimes they don't have the ease and the facility of seeing that in a mirror so they just wash without seeing it and by feeling their faces everything looks okay so they don't remove it therefore the prayer or the woodo is valid inshallah"
