  "title": "Do Paternal Grandparents have more rights on the grandchildren than the Maternal Grandparents?",
  "transcript": "a sister sent us a question saying that there is a community of people a group of people that think they have more rights over their sons children than the girls side the nanny and the Nana I don't know what that is but I presume it's a grand father and mother is this true does the boys side of the family have more rights over his kids than the girls side of the family Dhoom first of all that as per the child my responsibility towards my grandfather whether paternal or maternal are the same I have to do give them due respect I have to obey them I have to try to provide for them if they are in need as for the rights of the grandparents over their children now we have to acknowledge that a grandfather from the father's side a paternal grandfather shares with me my name and shares with me the inheritance if I don't have a father between us there's no one between us and if he dies I inherit him if I die he inherits me because he's a father and likewise the issue of names and lineage he can't be my a girl's guardian in marriage why the maternal grandfather does not inherit and the maternal grandfather does not have the right to become a guardian etc so in a sense yes there is a difference but not to the extent that they use their power to influence and to dictate what their grandchildren must do such as disconnecting or disobeying their maternal grand parents etc"
