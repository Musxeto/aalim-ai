  "transcript": "Hameed from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh My question is, my question is, can we use Ummah for non-Muslims not intending to honor them but because it is the norm? Jazakallahu Khair. Ummah is a nation and it can refer to an imam, it can also refer to a religion, and it also can refer to a period of time. These are all mentioned in the Qur'an. So it can refer to a nation or a group of people, whether Muslims or non-Muslims, there is no problem in that and Allah knows best."
