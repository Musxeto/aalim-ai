  "transcript": "now fell from indonesia my mom started a business with her friend so my mom only he gave her friend 100 and her friend is the one who used the money to do the business for some period of time a deal that my mom will get a share every month the problem is the share that my mom get is always the same amount and it is most likely that her friend doesn't give the share according to the percentage of the profit is this kind of deal is halal okay to answer your question nofa first of all we have to understand the relationship between the partners now your mom and her friend are in a partnership known as mudra in islamic terminology mudra where one is paying the capital and this is their share in this business and the other one is utilizing this capital to make a profit so this person is using their know-how their connection and they're physically involved in running the business so the percentage of profit is something to be agreed upon regardless of the capital so if they say it is 70 30. so be it no problem when the losses take place it is the capital that incurs all the financial losses and the person the partner that was doing the actual work loses his effort his time and he doesn't contribute to any financial loss so all the loss is on the capital so the hundred dollars they decided to buy watches from china and the other partner did all the communication transferred the money and got the customers ready to buy it and then while the ship was coming from china it drowned so the loss is a hundred percent your mom lost her hundred dollars her friend lost all the time she invested in it your mom has no right to go and say give me my capital or give me 50 or give me 10 or give me even one single dollar she has no right to do that this is the islamic mud now what you've described to me is most likely it does not fall under this category why because this is a form of investment that a lot of the muslims are falling into unfortunately and it's haram and riba how they give a hundred dollars to this individual and they say i want you to work it and make business and give me profit and the other party says okay i'll give you ten dollars a month and if the business is lost i'll reimburse you the hundred dollars this is not an investment this is complete and utter riba why because a hundred dollars is not invested it's given as a loan that's why you have the right to reimburse it fully if the business loses why because this is a loan and this 10 dollars a month is the interest on the riba and this is totally prohibited so if this is the case your mom has to rectify this and fix it you"
