  "title": "Religion of Fitrah (Basics Part 1) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and welcome to this new episode of the basics it's a new program where we just sit and chit chat about things that may benefit us and open our eyes in the midst of this changing fast-paced world we live in before we start i'd like to greet you all and congratulate you wherever you are with the coming of this blessed month of ramadan it's one of the greatest seasons of all time it's a time to get closer to allah azzawajal so i pray to allah that allah makes this ramadan the best ramadan for us to have ever witnessed the basics basics of what whenever you have a project you have to go back to the basics whether it's a mathematical project where there's a a project related to physics whether it's a mechanical project anything can't be executed properly without understanding the basics islam is no different islam is a religion of nature of ease of simplicity islam is a religion that allah has given us where the young and old can understand the rocket scientists and the nomad can understand the arabs and the non-arabs can comprehend and practice with great ease so it's a religion of fitra this is mentioned in the quran allah direct your face that is yourself towards the religion inclining to truth adhere to fit of allah upon which he has created all people no change should there be in the creation of allah that is the correct religion but most of the people do not know what is fitra in arabic fitra can refer to nature how allah created things in their natural form the hadith of the prophet salam further explains it where he says no newborn child is born except he's born upon [Music] okay what is explanation the prophet goes on to say assalam and his parents make him a christian a jew or a fire worshiper in this case we can understand that fitra relates to islam and to be more specific to monetism so if a child was or were to be born on an island and left alone without any environment influencing him such as the parents schools etc he would grow up knowing by what allah has instilled in him in his nature that there is only one god that is worthy of being worshipped of course he doesn't speak arabic he doesn't know how to pray or to fast he doesn't know the rules of sharia but the fitrah we're talking about is the belief in the existence of one creator one lord who's only worthy of being worshipped this is fitra this is in a nutshell what islam is all about acknowledging the existence of allah acknowledging that there is no god worthy of being worshiped but allah and to worship allah according to what he has prescribed for us this fact that islam is the religion of fitra is what drives a lot of the people to accept and revert back to islam as soon as they hear one single word as soon as islam is introduced to them they immediately feel that they know what this is it's it feels like coming back home going back to your bases so they accept islam and as muslims every single day we read in the fatiha in our prayers asking allah to guide us to the straight path this straight path we find that a lot of the muslims let alone non-muslims a lot of the muslims have been misguided they've deviated from the straight path a lot of them had fallen into what the prophet allah is warned us from and that is to divide into 72 sects or cults this is obvious we can see this in the muslim world so what are we to do in these series as i said it's not something that is a scientific it's not something that is classical or structured these are just thoughts that come into my mind and i'd like to share them with you hoping that they would act as an eye opener in order to rectify the errors that the ummah had fallen into and to align our lives back again with the straight path so that we would remain steadfast on the straight path till the day we die so how are we going to do this i don't know it's random thoughts that come i know then note them down before i come to give this episode insha allah there will be always room for improvement and you may question and ask what i have stated maybe challenge what i have stated and insha allah through this way we would hopefully help restoring our path on the straight path and cleansing whatever has gotten into our convictions and beliefs throughout these years first of all may allah be pleased with him one of the great companions of the prophet islam one of the most learned people the prophet said allah if you were or if you want to learn the quran take it from four one of them is abdullah so this is a high recommendation from the prophet salallahu said i took over 70 surahs i've learned them straight from the prophet's mouth alahillah so he did not hear it from someone else he took it straight from the prophet alaihis assam directly so he was among the very steadfast companions of the prophet sallam and he taught generations and generations of the muslims he said learn knowledge referring to islam before it is taken away and taking it away is by the death of the people that hold it meaning the scholars beware of extravagance beware of going deep or innovating in islam and always hold on to the old way what is the old way he says in another narration all people you'll invent new things and others will in vent and innovate new things so whenever you see something that is new meaning that we don't remember seeing it before it is something new innovative whenever you see this then stick to the first order so what is the old thing what is the first order this is exactly what the scholars of islam have been preaching and following imam malik one of the great four scholars and imams of islam said the affair of the latter generations of this ummah will never be corrected except by that by which the affairs of the earlier generations were corrected these are puzzles sheikh what are you talking about no there's no puzzle at all no ambiguity is as straightforward as an arrow it's as sharp as a blade ibn massroot is saying that stick to the old thing to the first order which is the teachings of the prophet salaam in the early generations and this is what malik anas is referring to the later generations their affairs will not be corrected except with what corrected the previous generations what corrected the previous generations it's the message of the prophet it is the quran it is abiding by the understanding of the three favorite generations of of companions those who followed them and those who followed those who followed them this is the antidote to the poisons we're consuming on daily basis from social media and from the general media from all around us this is the healing process if we want to cleanse and detox our bodies by abiding by the quran and the sunnah according to the understanding of the three favorite generations nowadays when you look at how islam is being presented it's not the real islam it is a philosophical ambiguous highly sophisticated lingo that people address selected people with the general masses they keep their mouths open and saying they can't understand what is being said this is not how the prophet assalam preached islam it was so straightforward and unfortunately the complications increase so people talk about minute details in where people don't know what they're talking about others talk about complicated issues of akida and different sects and cults so when they end up teaching akhida i know what khawarij is what murjiya is i know what martezila and jahmia are but i don't know what is my akida i'm lost i know everybody's else but i don't know my own because we have failed in teaching people up here and some of us even do not teach our kid rather they try to sugarcoat everything so all of their lectures and speeches are motivational but never addressing the illnesses of the ummah and the deviant sects and what they have done and corrupted with some of the people just talk about comparative religion which is a good thing and this is one venue that has to be protected even those who use philosophy to counter the atheists this is one venue that has to be protected and we need reliable brothers and sisters to address these issues but not to focus only on that we have to go back to what corrected and rectified the previous generations if we want our generation to be corrected and fixed and how is that to be done very simple go back to the basics basics of watching everything has basics one of the topics or some of the topics that i've listed just before i came in and inshallah tomorrow i think i'll hopefully have something more fruitful the basics of going back to the quran the basics of tahit the basics of giving dawah the basics of abiding to the sunnah in every aspect the basics of being steadfast on islam when you scrutinize those around you and look deep in their lives and affairs this is not islam if you look at some quote unquote scholars and dies and students of knowledge lives you'll see that this is not islam free mixing talking to women flirting with them not having a defined line that separates islam from other than islam you find that is supporting lgbtqs plus minus give or take and this is not islam this is not the way of the prophet you find people changing colors one year they say something the following year they change depending on who pays more depending on the political influence depending on many factors such as what do the masses want if they want rock and roll we are here to rock and roll they want blue grass we can do that this is not a show that adheres and listens to what you request islam is not like that so we need to go to the basics and going to the basics is not rocket science it's just an eye opener and i pray to allah azza that we will manage to do this and fulfill this mission and vision in the coming episodes this is the end of the first portion of the show after the break we will take your questions in sha allah through zoom as you all have the link hopefully and through your phone calls and where you will get the numbers displayed at the bottom of the screen we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
