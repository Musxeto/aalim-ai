  "transcript": "I saw the role model episode we did about what the prophet Muhammad hated and one thing you said was that the prophet Allah hated when somebody would mimic or impersonate someone you said that the prophet Allah told Aisha may Allah be pleased with other that and I quote your words I don't like that I have so and so worldly wealth and I would impersonate a person no I would never do this end quote where did you get this ah Hadith from Sheikh I can't find it anywhere online personally I'm really good at impersonating people and at mimicking actions but if the Prophet muhammaded this I'll stop doing it inshallah first of all if I had the ability to quote the references and remember where they're at I wouldn't be sitting here I would be somewhere else in a higher level place I don't remember these things I could barely remember what I had for lunch yesterday of course I was fasting so um the Hadith is authentic without any doubt and inshallah insha Allah insha Allah any Hadith you hear from me is 99.99 authentic it's like the Arab elections because I entirely rely on authentic hadiths all of my lectures and try my level best I don't know the reference at the moment but an easy search on Islam q a dot info will get you the answer in a heartbeat and you will find the Hadith with the references with the page number and the volume so you have no problem in checking it out if not then please come back to me on my website and inshaallah I will try my level best to go to two though I don't usually even give references on my website but I'm 100 certain that you will find it with the grace of Allah on Islam q a dot info"
