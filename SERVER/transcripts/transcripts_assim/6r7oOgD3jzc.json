  "title": "What happens on the Day of Judgment if a Muslim wrongs a non Muslim? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Osama from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. My question is regarding the hadith where it says that if someone has wronged his brother, a part of his good deeds will be given to their one wrong and he will receive the wronged worst bad deeds. So does this also apply to non-Muslims? Because if somebody, for example, somebody has wronged a non-Muslim way in the past and it will do more harm than good actually reaching out for forgiveness and the fact that the non-believers are already doomed for hell, so what about the non-believers? Do they also apply in this category or it's just Muslim brothers that, you know, we will get their bad deeds? First of all, Muslims and non-Muslims alike, it is prohibited to transgress or oppress or to do them wrong. And if you do, Islam tells us that you have to seek their forgiveness in this life. But for both Muslims and non-Muslims, if doing so would cause greater harm, in this case, no, don't do that. Don't go and apologize or seek forgiveness because there would be greater harm. So what to do? You have to ask Allah for forgiveness, repent and show remorse. Now, in the case that Allah did not accept your repentance or your remorse wasn't sincere enough, Muslims will take from your good deeds whatever is equivalent to your transgression and oppression. And if you ran out of good deeds, then you will take from their own sins and accumulate it upon you and then you will be thrown in hell. The non-Muslims don't get this privilege because they can't take from your good sins. It's not going to do them any good. They're bound to hell either way. But on the Day of Judgment, because of your oppression and your wrongdoing to the non-Muslims, you will pay and you will be forced to give some of your good deeds in compensation, but not to them. It will be erased and gone according to your wrongdoing and Allah knows best. Al Fatiha."
