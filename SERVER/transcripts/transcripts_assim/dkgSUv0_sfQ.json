  "transcript": "the seller must be the owner of what is being sold so this is understood when we learned the hadith of hakim may allah be pleased with him where he said do not sell anything that is not yours so you have to possess a merchandise before selling it and this is why in so many cases generally speaking without going into details dropshipping is haram when you come to me and say i'd like to buy a mobile that i don't have and i'll tell you that it costs you xyz and you say okay i'll buy it and i say okay i sold it to you i don't possess it for me to go to a third party and make an order and ask them to ship it to you and then receive the money or partially what's rest what the remaining of it this is haram and not permissible"
