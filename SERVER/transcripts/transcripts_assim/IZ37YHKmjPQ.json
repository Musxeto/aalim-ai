  "transcript": "Ashraf from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu This is an issue of dispute. Some scholars say it is mandatory, some say that it is sunnah. And I am inclined to say that it is mandatory for a number of reasons. One of them is that the Prophet ï·º was never ever reported to have skipped them. He used to say them. And sometimes he used to say, And it is not something that is difficult so that we would ask people to skip. And it is part of the pillars of Salat to have tuma'neena in this pillar, to sit with tranquility. And to sit there doing nothing or saying nothing is unheard of in the Salat. You have to say something. So I'm inclined to say that it is not merely a sunnah, rather it is mandatory and Allah knows best."
