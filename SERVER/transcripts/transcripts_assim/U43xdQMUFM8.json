  "transcript": "rahmanir rahim al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa muhammad al al-amin nabina muhammad in ala alihi wa sahbihi ajma'in berg assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato I'll try to make this as brief as possible because under the lights is a little bit hot for me and being born to a most a mother from the Eskimo I am used to a colder weather was it handled I have not prepared anything actually I just came to learn and listen from cher Hamid and he is insisting that I give you a small speech but there's nothing prepared the only thing that I would love to share with you is that we are in an era of tribulation and calamities fitten is everywhere around us well actually this is an understatement it's not around us it's in our pockets it's in our homes it's in our work place it's everywhere we are there is fitna and the only solution out of this fitna is proper knowledge and this is a commodity that nowadays is a bit difficult to find real knowledge yes you get lectures you get talks you get seminars and conferences I give lectures I make people laugh enjoyable like the old American in an advertisement in the early 70s maybe before you were born man know before I was born maybe three old women go into windes restaurant hamburgers so they find this big hamburger the table the tallest old woman in her mid 90s she says big loaf of bread or big bun of bread the middle one says big bun of bread the shorter one lifts up the top of the hamburger and says big bone of bread but where's the beef so today's lectures today's talks today's shul and celebrities it's a big bun but where is the beef what is the benefit that you leap and obtain out of it what is the implication and the impact on your lives now you've studied the book Shama el mohammed ii a great book by mama termini and it contains a lot of knowledge that most of us did not hear before about unfortunately it's gonna be held against you on the day of judgment because knowledge exams and a lot of talk but where is the beef what impact did it have on you in your house this is something that we have to give an exam to your wife how did Abdullah improve he's the same then what's the use how did your prayer improve how did your luck with your co-workers in the office with your neighbors with yourself your own self how did it come now am i following the Cinda have ice changed the way I sit like the Jews do do I follow the Sunnah when I drink or try my level best or do I still breathe into the vessel do I perform the Woodill like the Prophet used to a lustrum do i recite the eighth car before going to bed like the Prophet used to do as so many things so my advice to you is to focus on such gatherings the food is good I can tell by the smell masha'Allah though I didn't have any of it but the food is good what's before the food is even better if you manage to finish a textbook and we are living here for 5 years some of us 10 years some of us 20 years and life goes on but when you manage to do something structural academic like this you learn you study and you give this information and pass it over to others and share it with them this is great name from Alliance the origin so my advice to you is focus on such knowledge focus on implementing it and force focus on increasing it and it should not end here in a month time I guarantee you if we come and give you a quiz you will fail in the same book because knowledge goes if you do not even your Sheikh probably but your share this it may take six months because his knowledge base is far greater than yours he did the preparation the research he did the asking questions I didn't understand this who are the three poets of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam has animals have it who who sins and no textbook is all closed huh Labib no not a bit huh cab a bit Malik the one of the three and Abdullah have narrower a chef just mentioned the three poets of the it goes it disappears we all forget you ask me what did you have for lunch I forgot what lied because it didn't have lunch ha ha ha so but but this is beside the point so you have to pass this knowledge to someone else share it with your family share it with your co-workers you have to go through the book on your own again otherwise it will disappear and move on with another book and another book and another book insha Allah Azza WA JAL Ian this is the best way of becoming steadfast and facing all these fit and calamities tribulation with proper knowledge everything you see is yes the Prophet told us about the Saudis a lot of cinnamon so you will be aware insha'Allah so this is it inshallah if you have any questions I would any ham Delano yes sir the question is can a daughter gives the cat to her parents it's an issue of dispute but the majority say that it is not permissible why because the cat has mentioned in ayah number 60 chapter 9 surah surah Tauba in Masada cartoon in Pokhara al Misaki to the end of the ayah scholars say that the cat cannot be given to someone who it is mandatory upon you to sponsor or to provide for what's the evidence there it is in Surat al-baqarah what Allah Azza WA JAL mentioned in the ayat over a bar of suckling a long ayah well worried there to your dad how they incur Malayala Manorama you Deloris Kahuna Laguna Bill Maher goof and then Allah says well what if e-myth lose alack and the one who's inheriting he is similar to the father who is obliged to oak to provide for who for his child now if I get a child and the wife the mother of the child says I don't want to breastfeed is she allowed to do such a thing there's no no yes it's an issue of dispute Asha has saying that one of the answers that for a question it's an issue of dispute you will get 100% in all the exams when someone asks you what's the rolling or something you say it's an issue of is dispute it was reported that even Jeanie he was one of the scholars of linguistics and a peda and Arabic is so so I was once in his message it said it's a story LOL him if it's true or not he wanted to go for an errand so his class was like Shamas class he brought me now and he can go for his answer and he told his old father come and sit in my place so the father said son I don't know how to give fatwa I don't have to say anything said anyone asks you say that is an issue of dispute there are two opinions in it so other one says sure I divorced my wife three times does it count one or three say it's an issue of dispute another one says share can I rub on my socks made of cotton or it has to be out level it's an issue of dispute share I touch my wife while being in the set of Google does it nullify my it's a chef dispute one smart aleck did not like this so he said share I feel like a chicken is there any doubt in the existence of Allah so sure it's an issue of dispute everyone in the Masjid stood up wanted wanting to kill this man she's the connect of apostasy what are you saying but his son came and he said what are you doing this crazy man he's being asked is there doubt in the existence of Allah is an issue of dispute yes linguistically a fella he Jaron Murphy muhuali Rafi hovering rope Adam Shaq is moqtada and he played at what linguistically not theologically so to come back to the the statement every exam you can see Rishi of dispute you become for one she calles mashaallah you're knowledgeable but when we come to the AIA while aware if he mislead Alec the scholars say that anyone who you would inherit if he were to die you cannot give him the cut and it's your obligation to provide for my sister my father is dead my mother is dead and she has no husband and no children and she's poor it is an obligation upon me to provide for her I cannot give her the cut why if she dies who will inherit her I will so this is the rule likewise your parents you cannot give them from your zakat because it's your obligation to provide for them this is hitting two birds with one stone your children you cannot give them from this is a cat and this is the opinion of the Messiah like shale Islam like every taymiyah like a - Amy and bimba's and our permanent legend of IFTA when I hope this answers your question as the Sheikh I mentioned in his doors and clarified that the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said Milani film Anam Cara Annie happy attend for in the Shaitaan Allah at msl you be whoever sees me in a dream he had seen me truly because Shaitaan is unable to impersonate me so the scholars differed in the interpretation of this hadith one interpretation which is very famous is that this hadith is addressed to the Companions who actually literally saw the Prophet Elisha listen therefore it cannot be cascaded to those who did not see him but the most authentic opinion is that whoever sees the Prophet I saw some and is able to describe him a lot of people send me emails share I saw the Prophet did this people call and I said hey what did you see you see I so light I see they did not see the Prophet I sister one of the brothers said says to me oh I saw him he was like four eight like a Chinese and his eyes wasn't like this but he used to play kung fu said oh you're mixing him with Jet Li it's this is not the one Salalah sl1 says I saw him in he's was from Africa and he was like a big brother what kinda okay this is not the profit at least a lot to some some say that he had a small beard some say that he was this he was that it has to fit like in the book of Asha muhammediye you know that he has wide eyes that he was white with some redness in his cheek and it's awesome that his beard filled his chest the Companions were asked how did you know that the Prophet I am used to recite in Laura NASA silent and his back is to you so how do you know they said we used to see the trembling of his beard from behind his back sure behind his back this means that his bid is this big so when he moves his jaws it trembles and shakes so this is one so you have to and Plus that other than the description itself if you see the prophet in the Prophet Isis and tells you in the dream alhamdulillah you are a good righteous man you don't have to pray no come on here you pull up the brakes the Prophet can not change a religion or a verdict or a Luke ruling because in chapter 5 surah al-ma'idah allah says allah muhammad wa alikum Dinoco today i have completed your religion and he had accepted islam to be our way and perfected it so no way that islam can change even issa peace be upon him he's a prophet and among the the strong-willed messengers the five strong-willed messengers a lot of the brothers asked when he comes and descends at the end of time will he be a prophet in messenger or not what's the answer no he's a normal man if he's a prophet and he's a messenger but his message was abrogated by Islam and this is why he will rule only by Islam and this is why when almighty Muhammad ibn Abdullah sees him coming down at Fechter akarma he retreats and recently he saw some says no stay where you are it is for you that it was called a comma I will not lead so he will be a messenger prophet but the Dean will not change not a single iota and Allah knows best yes sir so the brother is asking what's the ruling on an apartment building that is flat it's a plot it's a project so you buy a specific flat an apartment in it in installments yet you have a contract stating that it is a three room apartment it's about a hundred and eighty squared meters the kitchen is this big it's overlooking so the tiles are made of this the chandeliers are made of that the doors are steel or our boat everything is specified and the price is specified this is extremely important in any thing that has to do with EMI is it huh okay anything that has to do with EMI there is in installments it has to before we sign the contract mention the final price if the final price is not mentioned it's Haram transaction if the final price is fluctuating according to the interest rate or the banks or what it's Haram it has to be 100,000 not a single penny more once it's fixed then I sign the contract this is halal I can sell you my iPad cash for a hundred kwaity dinner well I hate your curses very little but I have no problem having it if you wish 100 KD the brother comes how much I said 100 KD this brother comes how much under KD Thomas says how much I said 10 KD you have no right to object Mya I sell it for 10 I burn it it's mine it's none of your business so if I sell it for him 10 and I sell it for you for a hundred but I give you the luxury of paying the hundred over five years period no problem at all Helen bear they I'll tax it it is Harald soap if these conditions are he are fulfilled you are allowed to buy Hashanah and Allah knows best and this is by the way called is this man it's not called Salam Salam transaction is what was at the time of the Prophet as Salam a trader goes to a farmer and says I like your oranges the oranges that your farm produce are big and juicy next year's harvest if it was 50 tons I'm willing to buy it for X amount of money which is 30 percent less than today's market value he says whoa this means that I can get this money in advance I can pay my debt I can cultivate my land I agree this is called Salam I give them money condition number one fully in advance I cannot give him half a half of delivery it has to be 100% and this is why it's different than drop shipping which a lot of us deal with but this is another issue let's stick with Shania so I have to give him 100 percent a value as agreed to he has to give me the date of delivery he says okay inshallah well Charlotte on November 1 September shall I make 2020 maybe 2030 according to the mission and vision Allah Adam no this is not applicable he has to specify the date condition number 3 and the final condition is that the product is specified you know oranges we have Abu Salah about Salah is to eat you cannot use it for juice and there is Venetia this is for juice it cannot be eaten so he says yeah oranges what kind of oranges California oranges South Africa oranges what dates are the same thing so these three conditions for cinnamon is the snare is when I come to you and I say ah he I'd like you to manufacture for me something like this catalog like this item so you have the description then you go and manufacture 100,000 of it this is no problem in doing it in installments you set it because this is not Salam and Allah knows rest can I can we have the up door open um babe what's your good name Hassan Hassan if I come and I smack you a punch in the face and take your wallet and step on your stomach would you forgive me why it's written is it not the brother is asking about destiny and this issue is part of the six pillars of belief it is not something that to be taken lightly it is the essence of our religion religion however a Shaitaan is confusing us and so many people say 'aha why Allah holds us accountable for they always look at the bad side so if I were to sin why should Allah put me in hell why don't you look at the other side of the equation if I were to worship Allah why would Allah give me paradise for eternity no no this is unnatural isn't interested I'm interested in sinning because this is what I'm planning to do and this is why the Prophet are a source came to his companions and they were discussing other destiny like you just asked and his face was red and he was furious and angry and he told them not to speak about this and the company ma'am Ahmed soil was asked about destiny he said this is the knowledge of Allah so first of all you have to so that we would not only make a long story short or a short story long first of all you have to acknowledge and have the conviction that Allah is fair any doubts because if you have doubts another Muslim Palace you're in the wrong place maybe you should go to any somewhere else Allah is fair and does never ever put injustice upon a person this is granny you have to believe in that number two Allah is knowledgeable and Allah is knowledgeable is not like ours I know my knowledge is if I open this and I do this it will spill all over the table I know this this is my knowledge a large knowledge is so vast that he knows what's happening what is going to happen what has happened what did not happen in the future how it would have been had it to happen so it be goes beyond our imagination how allows knowledge is and similarly we give sometimes examples but Allah has the highest example I know if my student will fail or not he said oh you want to flunk me no but I know your capability because I've been teaching you for a whole year then what do you expect of Allah the third thing that if you have conviction of you feel relaxed is that you are a slave you're not a master meaning this is my water bottle of water if I spill it on the floor if I burn it if I take a shower with it it's mine so we are all Allah if he were to throw us all in hell who can object nobody so if you have these three things embedded in your belief no matter what happens I'm driving I had an accident Allah didn't know that this accident going to happen sure I shed my earth car why didn't elaborate prevent our will this is blasphemous no what does it happens at hamdulillah it could have been worse yeah I don't be like a ham and this is how you live and get the most valuable thing a Muslim can have other than the Arpita which is content the happiest husband is the content husband the happiest wife whose husband is rich but also if if she is content she is the happiest wife once we have this content and the content comes only from accepting Allah's other and decree Heidi he was surely Allah knows best so the question is are there 80th car to be said for someone who wakes up in the middle of the night and then wants to go back again what he said in the beginning suffice it meaning should I say ayatul kursi sorta subhanAllah until Allah Akbar 33 times Allah to complete the 100 wipe my body after blowing and reciting the three poles no you don't have to do this what you've done in the early night before you go to bed is sufficient if you want to do it again robotica but if the question is not as clear as that if the question was if is there any half car to be said once I wake up in the middle of the night a question mark the case yes there is a vicar when you wake up in the middle of the night in shillelagh hay la la la sharika lahu lahul hamdu or the kulli shayin Qadir Subhan Allah handle allah allah akbar la la la and then ask whatever you want from allah azza wajal or seek forgiveness Allah will give you this is one of the greatest times of answering your door and I have tried it myself alhamdulillah and so many things so many projects I have that Allah Azza WA JAL made easy because of the rug I suffered two or three months after knowing this and teaching it to people you know when you wake up in the middle of the night at two o'clock you go to the toilet you do your 110 or 220 depending and you go back and sleep and I forgot you travel tomorrow insha'Allah in the days in the following day to three months I'm struggling just to remember to say it now alhamdulillah wake up in the morning in the afternoon Article II I'm saying it because I am it's at the back of my mind I have you know when you go to the Emir and inside when you go to the medic to the king you have a petition saying I need the land and I need the house and I need to pay my debts and so I have a big petition so now Hollis I have it I say the dora and i ask allah azza wajal in hand allah all is well Lamonica ham prophet said Ali salat WA Salam lenta Zilla Padma optimal Kia Hatala and Alba and in another narration comes the feet of the son of Adam would not be moved from the position he's in the day of judgement until he's asked about for in another narration five and Remora - Athena and Shah Baba he FEMA habla and Wilma he FEMA Amira b1 Malley mean Iannetta sabaha FEMA and faha so Anna Marie - Athena about his age life what did you do in it so this is generic from the day you were born to the day you die then it goes a little bit specific your youth what did you do it in it because my age I can't do the things I used to do 40 years ago when I was young so now I regret not a lot but Sharon is there you regret oh I wish I did this I wish I studied more books I wish I could have been a scholar a real scholar now I regret because the memory is not like I used to be and in me he FEMA amela be about your knowledge and what did you do in it so we have knowledge but when walking the talk is difficult we have knowledge being tolerant being patient being forgiving being merciful once you drive in Kuwait roads highways and somebody cuts Oh in front of you I will follow him until how early until I put him on the pavement or a quorum why is this sure what are you do it I can't this is walking the talk Allah will ask you about this you preach and you give advice but you can't implement it you talk about being kind to women and you abuse your wife I know most of you from the subcontinent you use your wife as a servant to your mother-in-law yeah a joint family is wrong with all due respect I know the elders and the people would hate this but it is wrong I would never nowadays in Saudi we would never ever make a contract unless it's a condition that you give her a separate home so many problems will lie if I tell you about the problems I have nothing Saudi in Egypt in Holland in America problems that are so severe but this is not our problem so here we come you give us much of a lecture about being kind and nice to your wife and your abusing her you're humiliating her you are insulting her in front of your children and the sisters saying empowerment of women no it's not go to the sister in your attending mashallah Halle Kartik with Quran your hijab is so masala ninja power and you're wearing gloves masha'Allah but you are abusive to your husband you don't give him his rights you're insulting him you disrespecting him what kind of a marriage that can go on with disrespect it's a formula for failure when a man does not respect his wife and she does not respect him they cannot sustain a healthy marriage and I've been doing so much any counseling and seeing people number one problem on the agenda this respect so I don't know what brought me there but I hope what what project the youth Nam accent so three things life youth knowledge that you have to implement which the hadith tells you your wealth your money where did you gain it from gambling intoxicants hookah smoking renting videos and I said haha no no well Dasha I sold halal I'm a CEO in a higher company that sells dairy products much okay this is half of the part of it let's go to the spending where did you spend it in and hookah in videos and subhanAllah so these things you will be asked about upon and your knowledge will be asked but it does not exempt you from punishment a lot of people and I sit with them and I say a fee the Prophet said I said what are you doing he said I don't want to heal why do we don't want to hear said I don't want a lot to question me yeah if you do this Allah will not question you said yes I did not hear I did not learn no Allah will question you because you are in the land of Islam you have there is you have Imams you have scholars who can ask not knowing is not an excuse for you and Allah knows best evil eye now as Muslims nowadays open the window he hummed Allah Allah he holiday they said well life is like a lion nowadays we tend to blame and justify our failures on external factors I have a problem with my wife and was always nagging fighting disrespecting I say she's possessed by jinn and she says about me I'm possessed by jinn my son fails it at school I said evil eye subhanAllah hasit people are giving him evil eye evil eye on what he's always number 29 in class but he said yeah but this year he failed the car had a flat tire and it's jewel or July it's hot in Kuwait said this is envy people are envying me because my car is 1925 model something like that and if my business fails and I have to close my business it's black magic someone did magic in Mozambique against me and I know a sorcerer there or two so this is not right do you read your earth car every day in the morning do you read it before you sleep do you read it after every salat do you read it before going from your home you're protected aji you don't have to have McAfee or antivirus it's just the Norton Norton I know you are protected by a large the origin so no need so many people say and come to me share I found this a visa so I said okay I open it okay burn it he said suck a la Hache yeah yeah I know burn it just know you burn it what line I think you you acknowledge this is this is yeah yeah yeah I know oh there it is sound okay burn it said no no you burn it I'm afraid it this fear is itself so it is not right we believe that the rescission possession we acknowledge this we believe that there is inve there is black magic there is evil eye is more mentioned in the Quran but we don't exaggerate and everything that happens in our lives it's because of that and Allah knows there is a chance with the will of Allah but this is something Yanni you cannot say Hamas it will never happen when Allah soldier wants us to happen it happened it can be said verbally without concentration and contemplation so a lot of the brothers after salat they raised their hands they make door especially from the subcontinent and they wipe their faces I see them in the Masjid what did you read I said I ate a cookie and so and so and so a quick recite I tell could see for me he feels he knows it by heart but why does he fail because it's been repeated so many times without any contemplation and this is why people say we don't have kosher and salat why because every single salat they say subhanak Elohim dick tabarak a smoker identical Eric I mean a lot what did he do the same cliche the Prophet used to alternate at least a lot of Salaam so Allah Mubarak Blaney when ahupuaa a convertible Masha cold moderate oh now I'm feeling that the prayer has a and taste after Salah subhanAllah Hangul allah akbar subhan allah hamdulillah 33 times there are a hadith saying it 25 times with that Allah 22 five times either 100 Subhan Allah 25 hamda lillah 25 Allah or 25 la la hey la la 25 oh this is new share yes and I it's free everything else is gonna be costing you also one of the earth car after Salam subhanAllah 10 hamdulillah 10 Al Akbar 10 that's it chef Damien says that this is Sunnah but we say it when we have something to do quickly after salat so no one said hey why are you going so fast I said the certain and I'm leaving now don't force me to say the 33 times because the Prophet did all these times when make a model see the knowledge it makes darkness disappear if I'm in making water in the ham in the toilet and another brother is next to me and I wash my face once my arms once my feet wants it what are you doing said the Prophet did that did he I thought there was three times all right now you know this is one of the advantages of being next to a sheikh like me but the problem is we don't have the knowledge because we do not seek knowledge we seek lecture that makes me laugh a lecture that gives me hope etc where is the beef so I hope this insha'Allah answers the question of someone who asked a question well I don't remember what the question is I think you guys want to desert Allah you want to sleep I up to you after dinner last question is Allah now this question is a person who fell sick he made a vow another said oh Allah if you cured me I would perform Umrah a lop eared him and like all vows people are having second thoughts I wish I specified the month of so-and-so it's cheaper I wish I did not make okay then he they come to me sure the Prophet said that is salatu salam that whoever prays feature in the masjid and remains in his place making dhikr until the Sun rises and praise to Allah Allah will write for him Hajj and Umrah perfect perfect perfect so does this mean that I have to in my credit for ambra because I did this vouch they bring up things to you or share I was in Medina and I prayed to Raqqa and kuba and the Prophet said whoever prays two rakahs and Poobah this is equivalent to Umbra so I have the LA to shake haleh's no no Habibi you have to fulfill your vow and this is why vows nether is makrooh the Prophet prohibited it is awesome disliked it to us and he said that this is only means of extracting wealth from a stingy miser person because I have 10 dinars in my pocket and then someone says give me sadaqa no go away allah karim difficult times I don't have my I myself want money but then my son's exam is tomorrow and he's number 29 in his class so I wish that he passes in sha Allah Shah said o Allah if my son passes the 10 dinar is for your sake so what's written is written but I'm doing this vow to to get something out of a large they were gel so the Prophet hasn't denied us from doing this but if you do it you have to fulfill it you own a bit in every way - oh man can I shall go home mostly Allah Allah so shall praise those who fulfill their vows but not those who make vows in the first place therefore if I made the vow of Ramallah and then I want to go to Hajj can I conclude or consider the Umbra the one I'm doing part of the Hajj you know that has is it is very indeed two to three na seuk tomato Quran any fraud Quran there is no apparent Umbra so this does not fulfill tomato then we have to look is it a fairy BA Hajj or not because you cannot combine fala out with YG back so someone says I pledge that I fast one day for the sake of Allah if my son passes the exam he passes the exam I fasted in Ramadan is it possible no you cannot this is obligatory for and this is a vow which is mandated upon it yeah yeah but two birds one stone you know 50% discount like a deep No so it seems that it has to be a separate one do your Hajj before you go home Gautama Siddhartha make a ramp and fulfill your vow and Allah knows best jacquimo la jolla for having us and for the SONA that we have enjoyed all the sha allah and i pray to allah that we see you hopefully soon banila co's allahu wa sallim ala nabina muhammad in our area Jermaine"
