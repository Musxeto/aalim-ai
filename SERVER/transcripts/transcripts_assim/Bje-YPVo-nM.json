  "transcript": "Salman from India sheikhai asked you through your website if a father who visit visits dargah can become worly in his salafi daughters Nika so you replied that the next one in command should be the garden but in her list of all these no one is fit to be her guardian some of them are dead some of them does not pray at all and the rest do shirk now the only option is the Imam of a local mosque so instead of doing this if I can convince her father to stop going to dargas and if he agrees that he will not go from now on now on so can I trust him and do this with him being the only Salman Salman in your question you stated that her father is practicing and a good Muslim correct yeah this was confusing for me when I'm answering your question how could he be a good person a good Muslim and practicing and yet visits dargas so you have to first of all clarify why is he visiting dargas he's he's visiting it because he's making Dua or sacrifice or any form of worship this is shirk if you can invite him back to Islam then definitely this is a win-win situation alhamdulillah but if he doesn't go there to commit shirk if he just goes there because he's used to making Dua for the deceased he thinks that the deceased is a good person or maybe one of his relatives is buried there so he visits it as he he visits any normal cemeteries no doubt nothing there is no shirk in that so first of all you have to determine is he committing Sheikh for True for real or not is he convinced of it does he fulfill the conditions of being out of the fold of Islam and there are no obstacles preventing him from going out of the fold of Islam if this is met then he cannot be the guardian what to do afterwards is to go to the next of kin the next one in line and if they're all the same then you have to go to the Muslim kavi or you as you said qazi the Muslim judge not any random Imam of a Masjid so the Islamic Center there the representative of the Muslims in your area in your state you have to go to him and he will conduct the marriage inshallah but if by any chance or means you were able to convince him to revert to Islam and he rectifies his Affairs and he's a proper Muslim then he's a guardian insha Allah without any problem foreign"
