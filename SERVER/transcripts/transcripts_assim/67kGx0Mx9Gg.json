  "transcript": "you said uh you gave a thought where you said that it's halal to go to a gym that plays music and wear your own headphones to block the sound yeah yeah and what about if the gym has a tv so it's playing haram shows but i just lower my gaze and also put headphones because the music and the women and is also permissible usually speaking uh generally speaking that is in such places the tv screens are put up high like two or three meters on the wall so it's not in the level of looking and such scenery is found everywhere so it's found in malls it's found in even restaurants it's found in the streets so yes the general trend is to lower your gaze while doing that and this is different than if the gym is mixed if there are women in the gym that's totally uh [Music] unrelated and prohibited but to have tv screens around the place and you lower your gaze and you're not listening to anything haram there is nothing wrong in that insha allah"
