  "title": "Is it Haram to touch private parts with the Right Hand? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "what death there says is it Haram to touch our private parts with the right hand there is a hadith or a number of hadith where the prophet alehissallaam prohibits us from touching the private parts in two cases one while urinating so it's prohibited to touch your private part with your right hand while urinating and the second is when you are cleaning your private part so you don't clean your private part with your right hand rather you do that with your left hand now these two cases according to the majority of scholars is disliked not prohibited only even has them and some scholars took the prohibition to be Haram the majority of scholars took it as makrooh disliked and it's always safe to be on the safe side and to consider it to be Haram and prohibited so these two cases we limit touching the private part with the right hand to them other than that there is no prohibition at all so it is permissible to touch directly without any barrier your private part with your right hand except in two cases if you are urinating or answering the call of nature or if you're cleansing yourself from impurity and Allah so JAL knows best"
