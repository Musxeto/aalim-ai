  "transcript": "is a word used by a faction of the muslims and this is a byproduct of the intelligence department the cia whatever used to deviate and split the muslim ummah so you have people who think in a particular way and you have others who think against them though they're both salafis they're both following the quran they pray like each other they consider the major bimbasman al-banning to be their but they differ on few things here and there and this is what is causing drift between them it started with a dispute an argument a debate ended up in slandering in labeling so if you're not with us you're against us and this is what parties are all about though they say that we don't follow parties so they consider anyone else to be murji to be hawari sururi etc all of these things and they call them matkalis they call them murjis they call them this exchange of labeling names is what is killing the ummah instead of uniting instead of coming together instead of reading the quran the sunnah with the understanding of the self people have been polarized and this is damaging the ummah leave everything behind you and focus on studying the quran and the sunnah with us understanding of the righteous predecessors your scholars who are not controversial are the ones who you should follow these guys are not controversial listen to them learn from them and you insha allah will be in safe hands"
