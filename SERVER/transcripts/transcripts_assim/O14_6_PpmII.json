  "transcript": "Ahmed from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Salamu Alaikum. So there was a Catholic neighbor that rented like in our basement in our house and he died like a couple of months ago and no relative ever really visited him and we were wondering what to do with his property, like what to do with his room because he's got some stuff there and his brother doesn't appear to be interested in anything. His son lives in another country. I don't know his status with his mother. This property is not yours. So what you should do is you try to contact them and if no one is responding to you, just simply sell it and take the money and give it to the poor because you've tried your level best to send the money to them and none of them is interested. So you just dispose of it."
