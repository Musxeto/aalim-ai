  "transcript": "so um I know we're supposed to say uh when we're going inside the um um and I'm aware that is because we're going to be naked but sometimes uh some of us do go around the house naked so are we supposed to always say that before we take a close-up inside we have or what is it that you have to say um Amina you are mixing apples with oranges that's good in fruit cocktail but not in rulings like this why Allah is to be said when you enter the lavatories or the toilets in order to answer the call of nature this has nothing to do with being naked or taking your clothes off what is a visor or a screen between our Aura our private parts and the eyes and the vision of the Jinn is to say Bismillah so yes whenever you want to take off your clothes you say Bismillah this has nothing to do with Allah this is a separate thing so I hope this makes sense"
