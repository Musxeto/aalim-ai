  "transcript": "Hamza from Sweden alikum alikum Salam so I have this question that in the Masid they sometimes hold Advent events where there are both CHS are there but they're sitting on separate sides but then they don't put any barrier in between but if you sit on like the far right you and just don't look to the left and you never look at the opposite gender is it go to those kind events no problem inshallah due to the fact that you live in a cfir country and such practices though though they are wrong but you have no other alternative or choice so as long as you lower your gaze and you stay away from being close to them inshallah this is totally Halal and permissible"
