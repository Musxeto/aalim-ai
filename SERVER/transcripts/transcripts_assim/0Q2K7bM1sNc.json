  "title": "Repeat the Salaam After Each Separation? Hypocrites get irritated with Salam? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi I saw this interesting video that a couple of brothers made a while back. If you're walking with a friend of yours on a path, and if a tree or a pole gets in between and separates you and your friend momentarily, is it part of the sunnah to greet your friend with Assalamu Alaikum when you reunite with him again immediately after the split up? Jazakallah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. So what brother Muhammad is asking about is something that was known to be done by the companions and by the Salaf, which shows us the greatness of spreading the word of peace. Assalamu Alaikum. One of the most beautiful greeting phrases that you can greet your Muslim brothers with. Unfortunately, some of the Muslims, quote unquote, or hypocrites if you want, find resentment to it. And if you keep on saying Assalamu Alaikum, they express their resentment and say enough is enough. We don't want to every time reply to your Salam. Don't do this. And this shows weakness of Iman and a characteristic of hypocrisy. It is part of the sunnah to spread the word or the phrase of Salam. As the Prophet said that this would lead us, alayhis salatu was salam, to paradise. Whenever you spread it, because you love one another, and when you love one another, you will enter paradise. So yes, this is a confirmed sunnah that the Salaf used to do. But I don't know any hadith that is attributed to the Prophet, alayhis salam, confirming it. The companions used to do it. The Salaf used to do it. And this is widely known and Allah knows best."
