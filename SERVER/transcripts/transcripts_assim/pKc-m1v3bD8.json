  "transcript": "the following a hadith 277 277 page number 192 chapter the contentment of the self and I said I served the prophet salaallah alayhi wassalam for 10 years he never said o to me and he never said about something I had not done why didn't you do that or something I had done why did you do that authentic now this is a hadith which is well known in the fajir we all know it by heart and this shows us the personality of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam in commenting on this hadith i made only four pages believe it or not and I was thinking of tomorrow's lecture you can make a difference should I put it until now I haven't decided is I need 24 hours before now it's 20 like 8 or 30 so it's not time yet for me to think about either to have it on this topic similar to it you can make a difference in your life and the people's life on the personal level or to expand it and talk about our difference that we can make in the society in the Ummah can we make a difference in the level of the Ummah so until now I'm not decided maybe Haj RF would help me later on say this is a long topic very long topic I will not go through it because we have to cover the material but I'll just give you a hint if one of your employees does a mistake do you look the other way or interrogate him this is a personal thing when your wife does something wrong okay let's help the brothers when your husband does something wrong do you nag on his head and you remind him for the next 30 years you've done this and this and this and this 30 years ago why did you do this I tolerated you I forgave you what forgave you and reminding me five times a day like prayer without I than without a comma every day five times a day you remind me of your forgiveness what kind of forgiveness is this this is a deficiency in our character the Prophet is teaching us a lesson not to do this you remember Yusef they took him threw him in the well he wasn't present then he became the eysies of muscle they come to him he accuses his younger brother so that he can abduct him and take him in his custody of stealing and when they come and say what happened they tell them that the younger one stole because they found the measurement cup in his luggage what did they say well if he had stolen it his brother had stolen before whom are they referring to Yusef they accused him falsely forcefully forcefully of stealing what Allah says in the Quran for a Saroja used to fifteen fcg when mu b hala home he concealed it in himself and he did not react to it this beautiful characteristic is known as a Taha full there is no word in my knowledge in English to explain it in Arabic it means looking the other way when something happens do not investigate do not insist on finding why move on if we did like this we would be very happy no problems in our marriages in our work in our relationships when you look the other way so many examples so many beautiful things it's not the time it's a separate lecture maybe tomorrow maybe not what did the Prophet do erase a lot of cinema this is how the Prophet was whenever Anna's who was his servant for 10 years who was a child he never complained we have subordinates we have drivers we have workers how do we deal with them the Prophet said or Anna said the Prophet whenever he looked at something I did he would not reprimand me why did you do this and if I did not do it he would not reprimand me by saying shouldn't you have done so and so no the Prophet sir let it go and the people with high aspiration would not repeat the same mistake twice when I do something wrong and my boss does not talk to me about it I feel ashamed I know he knows and next time I will not do it because I don't want to bring this feeling again and I don't want to yanny make him lose hope in me in a sense now compare what we do with this hadith how many times we talk to our wives why didn't you do this why didn't you do that how many times I tell you you have to do this this in place I know brothers that are taunting their wives well I when they come into the house I know a brother who's a relative of mine the minute he comes to the house he does this and he looks at his wife with a scaly look this is sufficient why just pick it in move there are people who make life difficult to others they question them they interrogate them look at the beautiful hadith of the Prophet Allison or prophet of Allah how many times should we overlook and forgive the shortcomings of a servant is my servant so the man is asking how many times what do you expect the Prophet to say he said 70 times a day 70 mistakes a day is this logical this is Islam look the other way and things will rectify it itself but when you insist on investigating why did you do this this is wrong you should not have done this I warned you before this causes friction and tension and life cannot go on like this well"
