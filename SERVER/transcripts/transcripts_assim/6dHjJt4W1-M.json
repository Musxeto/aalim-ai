  "title": "Can we judge people by their actions? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "in Islam deeds are judged by intention but this hadith is between the individual and Allah Azza WA JAL so Allah would judge me according to my intention which no one knows except allah subhanaw taala having said that in order to Al for allah azza wajal to accept your deeds you need two conditions the first one to have sincerity which is interpreted as intention that is you're doing it for the sake of Allah secondly it has to coincide with the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam so if my intention is pure if my intention is sincere to Allah Azza WA JAL to give Dera to this woman taking her to dinner on a date is definitely a bad deed I cannot justify my bad deed by saying that I have a good intention Allah would not accept my deeds because the conditions are not fulfilled this is different than judging people because as Muslims we are told we are ordered to judge people by what appears to us so if a person does not pray in the masjid I would not say hmm maybe he has an excuse this or that no so-and-so doesn't pray in the masjid . i judge him according to his actions if I saw someone stealing money I would say that this person stole money I would not say hmm I'm not gonna judge him maybe the money is his father's maybe the money was alone given to that person and that person is refusing what I see is what I say this is what I judge what's between him and Allah this is for Allah Azza WA JAL to take care of and hold him to account and therefore those who say don't judge me I usually come to them and say okay I'm gonna steal your wallet and ask you not to judge me would you accept this so definitely not you're a thief you're a burglar I have to report you to the police and I hope they chop your hands off so why why are you so aggressive why are you judging me so no you took him my money likewise when you make something that is blatantly Haram and you don't want people to judge you prove it to us clarify your reputation and defend yourself like the Prophet did Allah his salat wa salam and he is a role model he wants was in a decaf in the last 10 nights of ramadan sophia have been her evening up may allah be pleased with her the mother of the believers his wife came to chitchat with him and on her way back the Prophet came out to accompany her because it was night so she was all in black and she was walking with the Prophet Ali salatu salam - of the ants are men were coming in the opposite direction when they saw the Prophet that is a lot of Sun accompanied by a woman they change their direction and went the other way out of respect definitely so the Prophet stopped them ELISA Ladouceur and he said to them this is my wife Sofia by the way and they said super prophet of Allah do you think that we're gonna doubt you and the Prophet said sallallahu alayhi wasallam I was afraid that Shaitaan would throw some doubt in your heart that you would enter Hellfire by so the Prophet what he did Allah so some he clarified his stance and position he defended his reputation from any possible doubt no matter how insignificant it is still he clarified it to the people so likewise if we see something wrong we judge what we see if the person or the victim is a real victim he would come out and say know what you saw was wrong this girl or this woman is my niece and I was trying to give her that why that is why she was not wearing the hijab and bla bla bla but to simply do heinous things to go on music concerts free mixing intoxications doing Haram and organizing Haram things and say don't judge me no this is not the right approach for that and Allah knows best"
