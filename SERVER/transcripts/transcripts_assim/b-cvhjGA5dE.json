  "transcript": "uh sh my question is I cannot stop myself from committing certain S I know Allah Allah B he he can see me and everything else even sometimes there is for example Quran near me I wrote different words on the wall to stop myself for committing for example backbiting other another type of sin but still I attempt and connect and commit those sins uh I even like said like Ya Allah promise I promise with you that I will not do it again but still I do it it negatively affect my mental health I think about it when I comment it after commenting it and even when I do good deeds after it I tell myself like look you disobeyed Allah and now you're are doing good this so he will not accept it like he's angry with you and these stuffs I have some health issues as well and I think after committing certain sins like it's further increase I don't know what to do although I know everything like I should stop myself I know like I heard like YF Alam tried to escape from things while some were happening were happening there but I know everything but still I cannot stop myself I don't know what to do first of all s this is something that each and everyone is struggling with by Nature we are sinful the prophet said this each and every son of Adam is sinful this is nature however the best of those who are sinful those who frequently repent back to Allah so this is your fate this is your test from Allah now you have two options on the table either you continue to sin and feel bad afterwards feel remorseful ask Allah for forgiveness do good deeds try to not to do it again then you go back in this vicious cycle over and over again you sin you still feel remorseful and you repent and you ask Allah for forgiveness until the day you die hoping that you die not while making the sin rather in the grace period in the period of repentance remorse and asking Allah for forgiveness option one logical option two you give up repenting don't show remorse just to maintain your mental health and go strong doing sins left right and Center don't care about Allah looking at you the Quran being played the words that you've written on the walls to remind you of Allah the Oaths you made nothing all let them go away and just enjoy the moment do sins left right and center the trouble is the moment you die you go to hell do you have any third solution no so the first solution is the only solution you have however there are ways and means to strengthen your Iman and to prolong the period of the grace period of repentance remorse and asking Allah for for forgiveness what is that to change your environment in the Hadith when a man came he said I confess confess I killed 100 people I assassinated 100 people 100 Souls so the scholar said nobody prevents you from repenting but you live in the vicinity of a Bad Company the time Town you're living in is full of corrupt and evil people go and migrate to another town where there are righteous people that you could worship Allah with and repent and ask Allah for forgiveness and the man went immediately change his environment change his life because he's genuine in his repentance to Allah and he died Midway and Allah Asel accepted his repentance and sent the angels of Mercy to claim his soul and prevented the angels of punishment and and Hell from taking his soul due to the 100 Souls that he had killed so alhamdulillah Allah is merciful most compassionate most forgiving accept the repentance of those who come to him change your environment how I don't know this needs further investigation who you live with with who you hang out with the things you do in your your daily routine if you have that flex and uh uh showtime and Sony and and all these uh uh platforms and you fill your time watching Bollywood movies and Hollywood movies and Nollywood movies and the likes your heart is tarnished is sealed you don't have any room for asking Allah for forgiveness or for remorse soon you would not even care about asking Allah for forgiveness for these sins but if you fill your time with Vick with Quran if you register in zad academy and you try to seek knowledge and you engage in research and and articles about Islam you hang out in the mid with girls that come to the Masjid have Circles of knowledge learn Arabic learn Quran and go out with them and come visit them they visit you your whole life is going to change and this is one of the ways of EMB bettering yourself inshallah"
