  "title": "Should I stop inviting a relative who just came out of the closet? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mu'izz from Saudi. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Yeah Sheikh, so my question is, so my question is actually I'm asking regarding a relative of mine who recently came out of the closet. So my question is regarding this confusion I have about the ties of relationship that I should be upholding. Should I cut off ties with them, or should I not invite him to family parties, or what kind of connection should I have with him? Okay, first of all, those who come out of the closet, if you are able, put them back again. Because this is the natural thing. The terminology, they came out of the closet means that they announce their homosexuality, or their inclination of being transgenders, or not the gender that Allah has created them in. So a man comes and says, I just came out of the closet and I feel like a female, and I'm a female, and address me as a female. This is not permissible in any religion known to man. And this is a western concept introduced by the westerns trying to shove it down the throats of normal human beings. And they have the media to back them up, they have their forces and everyone doing whatever they can to shut mouths and to restrain people who dare to speak against it. Well we see as Muslims, this is unacceptable as per the Qur'an and the Sunnah. How to deal with such people, this is a sin. Like fornicating, like consuming intoxicants, like cheating, like dealing in riba. So if the person is keeping it to himself, and not transgressing and influencing others, and not publicizing it, he's not coming to my home wearing a drag queen, as a drag queen. No, he's a man and nobody knows about him. He doesn't speak about it publicly. I should deal with him like any other human being. And whatever is in his mind, and between him and Allah, it's between him and Allah. I have nothing to do with it. But if he is trying to transgress and spread his evil, and ask people to join him, and invite others to come out of the closet like him, or participate in such filth, in this case he has to be, we have to not invite him to our gatherings because it's an evil that is trying to spread among us. It's like cancerous cells trying to spread. So we have to keep him out of it, and keep his limits, and just maybe call him every now and then, and give him da'wah, so that Allah may guide him, and Allah Azzawajal knows best. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me, and let's speak about it inshallah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
