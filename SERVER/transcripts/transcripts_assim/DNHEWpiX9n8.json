  "transcript": "I have a 9y- old child with my ex who I regularly remind to keep in touch with the dad even though the dad is not bother whether the child calls or not Allah know my intention are good I want my child to have a good relationship with that however this man always have negative things to say or words to me my question is as a mom and the child is 9 years old am I obliged to tell my child to call the dad or just leave the child to call whenever she want as a mom and a Muslim woman you have to know that your son has a relationship with his biological father in Islam and has responsibilities towards his father whether you like it or not whether his father is abusive evil not practicing or not he still is obliged to obey and be dutiful and respectful to his father so I would highly advise that he makes it a habit to call his father once a week or once every 10 days just to check on him and so that he may soften his heart after six seven years you never know but inevitably it's like your finger nail you cannot just take it off unless you're tortured this is part of your body and your his father is part of him and he is part of the father Andel Knows Best"
