  "transcript": "assalamualaikum brothers and sisters on behalf of ick i would like to welcome you all to our webinar today it's a special question and answer session with our beloved sheikh asim alhakeem i would like to thank you for being here and i also would like to thank our sheikh for accepting the invitation to give our community this special opportunity to ask their questions a quick introduction as you know islamic center of kuwait is involved in doing the dhawa activities in the state of kuwait and english language shaykh assam al-hakim is one of the prominent scholars and propagators of islam in the english language he's a saudi national residing in jeddah saudi arabia accredited with ba in linguistics from king abdulaziz university in jeddah in 1987 shayasim went on to graduate with a higher diploma in islamic studies from the prestigious umbalkura university in makkah in 1998. currently she asked asim is an imam of a masjid in jeddah a role which has helped but she has held for about uh more than 32 years now where shaykh now delivers the weekly friday sermons and lectures on various islamic sciences shikhasam hakeem also participates regularly on preparing and hosting a number of english islamic programs such as question and answers ask youth talk mercy to the worlds among others on various tv and radio channels such as alhuda peace tv zod tv and saudi 2 channel today's session is a q a question and answers session we are both at zoom and at facebook and as always you can type your questions in the q a chat box at zoom if you are on facebook and i see the numbers at facebook increasing you can type your questions as comments uh we will we also have some questions from the previous session that are left over but we will give preference to the questions that are typed now we will try to catch as many questions answer as many questions as possible but in case if i i'm unable to get to your question i apologize up front uh with that with your permission shift can we start inshallah bismillah basil raman rahim the first question is from m on zoom what is the ruling when teachers at school show videos that contain haram things including music alhamdulillah [Music] my introduction wasn't was it interrupted or it was fine there was a just a glitch you know yeah because i just had a call and i i i put my phone on do not disturb so i don't know what to do any other than that but hopefully inshallah we will not i know we'll have many calls but i will disconnect them on the spot in charlotte that's all right in case we lose your video we know that someone is calling you yeah so first of all the basic answer to this is it is prohibited for a muslim to watch or to listen to any haram stuff full stop okay sheikh i have this excuse i have that excuse i have um this justification the short answer is that as muslims we must not disobey allah full stop now is there any room for maneuver this depends on the intention of the person on the situation and circumstances and on the possibility of change or improvement meaning if a person is studying in a college or a school and his passing is dependent on listening to something that is haram or watching a video because this english course requires me to watch a dialogue between a man and a woman and maybe something is inappropriate is shown or something that is inappropriately said and there is background music and i cannot pass my test or do my degree without this in this case it falls under the category of allah's verse in the quran fear allah to the best of your ability so for a person to be in such a situation there is a difference between hearing and listening when i'm in my car and somebody somebody next to me in his car blowing music to the highest level and i'm not listening i'm hearing it because it's something that comes in without my permission or intention to listen to am i sinful the answer is no he's the one who's sinful there is a difference between this and between when i'm driving and i stop at the traffic light and the guy is blowing a song and i do this on the steering wheel i'm happy i'm enjoying it i'm i'm going with the beat now this is listening and i'm sinful so likewise when i go to a mall and they're playing music i'm not listening to it so i try my level best to avoid such situations for a person in a class it might be difficult if not impossible sometimes it is possible i've been in situations where i told the instructor listen i don't listen to music either you lower the volume totally or let me out and they would lower the volume and just be content with what is shown in there if there's something inappropriate as a muslim i lower my gaze and move on and allah knows best the next question is from brother jaina abedin and it says that what if i do a mistake while doing the prostration this is too generic because you have to tell me what is the mistake some mistakes are forgiven some mistakes nullified some mistakes due to ignorance differ from mistakes due to laziness so and this is for the brothers and sisters a question be specific in your question and give examples now you ask a general question what happens if i do a mistake in prostration i may answer a question thinking that you mean prostration or forgetfulness so someone forgot to say subhana rabbi radhim he's obliged to do so twice and then he makes a mistake in this by not saying subhanallah so this was not in the prostration this was in the position between the two prostration not saying the dua is an issue of dispute because saying some scholars say it's others say it's mandatory i am inclined to say it's mandatory so if you forgot to say it this means that you've dropped a mandatory act which requires that you offer two prostrational forgetfulness before salaam after offering to shahood salutation upon the prophet and finish your dua before you conclude your prayer with salam you offer to [Music] mandatory or only one and same with ruku what sajdah you're talking about are you talking about regular sujud in prayer or sujud of sahu either way it is a pillar of salat in every raqqa to offer one record and two sujud if you fail to do this intentionally or out of ignorance or out of forgetfulness the prayer is invalid until you rectify it if you did not rectify it you have to pray again next question is from brother muhammad hussain uh in russel uh once i have done the whistle i get the doubt that i have not washed my back completely what should i do if that happens ignore it and move on a rule of thumb whenever you get a doubt after concluding the ibadah ignore it if you get the doubt during the ibadah we have to investigate meaning i went for tawaf may allah azza will grant all of us a rumra that he accepts and we come back to the holy uh sacred masjid without any restrictions insha allah soon be in nila so i made seven rounds of tawaf then i went to pray two raka's behind makkah ibrahim then i stood up to go to say then i get a doubt did i make six or seven this doubt came to me after i concluded my power this doubt this doubt came to me after i concluded my toe off hence it has no value ignore it and move on but if it came to me while doing tawaf did i make five or six my five or six no i have to base it on the list the least number which is five and offer two more tawaf the next question is from abdullah how to become islamic scholar like you why would you want to trouble yourself like this what is your intention this is what we always tell people sure i would like to be a dairy like you i would like to be a scholar like you i would like to be famous like you uh-huh then you have a problem with your intention all days when they started in their dawah in their acquiring knowledge being students of knowledge they had only one intention in mind to peace allah so all of us dies we are supposedly not after recognition or fame or doing something which causes the wow factor people of public relations know this the wow factor that draws attention because once a day does this then cross him out he's not a real daring or a student of knowledge not a scholar and if you want to be a scholar like me i'm not a scholar i'm a student of knowledge scholars like even bas even if they mean these mega people who are like mountains these are called scholars me and tom dick and harry who are popular on facebook on youtube and you see them on tv channels we're not scholars we're propagators of islam we have little knowledge more than you and allah gave us and blessed us with the ability to explain and to be convincing and insha allah we are steadfast on the methodology the way that the manhattan of the prophet salaam the companions that have been in the tablet simple as that so if your aim to please allah yeah that's good whether you become a scholar or not this is beside the point what counts is what gets you inside jannah in the head and the highest level of jannah this what counts but if you want to be recognized to be pointed at whenever you walk through so-and-so the scholar so so the the the famous person i've seen you before then this is a breach of sincerity and an accusation to your intention and therefore if you want to become a student of knowledge and if you want to get closer to allah you need to learn and start from the basics you have to start from the language of the quran arabic without arabic you cannot reach places you cannot understand the quran unless i interpret it to you and explain it to you you cannot understand the hadith unless the translator explains to it to you and sometimes he does not do a good job so many times translators make grave mistakes and you are a student of knowledge you don't know arabic and you take the word for it and you make you fall in the same mistake and so on after that you have to learn the quran you have to at least recite one jujo every single day so you finish the quran every single month other than ramadan you contemplate you memorize you read that fear you read the hadith of the prophet from different sources you know what's authentic what is not authentic and you know what is what has the scholars explain this hadith because so many times we read the hadith we don't know the context we don't know when it was said why was it said in such a fashion etc so you go to the books of the scholars and you read it then you know and you have the fundamentals of and the rules and regulations that govern these understandings of the jurors and you go to normal and there are so many other branches that you need to have knowledge in not necessarily turning you off by just mentioning them in less than a couple of minutes and then you said whoa i will never reach that level i will never ever finish all of this this is nonsense if you do it bit by bit you will reach there the journey of a thousand mile miles begins with one step especially if you're making dua in allah and there are many many ways to acquire knowledge and to balance your time in reading the seerah when you're fed up in reading some specific sciences when you have a conference or a seminar coming up to prepare for this is what a student of knowledge does he prepares he takes notes he asks so i have for example on my youtube channel allah favored me and blessed me with which i did in mumbai about eight nine ten years ago for peace tv the whole series is the first to my knowledge to be recorded on high definition cameras in a workshop-like setup and it covers the entire from purity till um yeah uh judging things and transactions and divorce marriage uh custody things that deals with uh prescribed punishments the whole nine yards and it's found for free on youtube so you can watch one every day it's about 190 episodes you can watch it take notes and ask your local scholars about the ruling on such things that you did not understand and within five months time maybe you would have covered the whole uh and you would have understanding that is 95 better than any other muslim with the grace of allah the next question is from sister miranda abdul samad sheikh nowadays people celebrate birthdays and i know that it is haram my concern is what to do when the birthday of my kids or babies come like they get upset when we don't celebrate or surprise them when they compare themselves with other friends please tell me a solution first of all not all the children know when they were born yeah and when you ask me when were you born check sometimes i need to open my passport to check because who cares i was born in the previous century i'm this old yeah i am like a dinosaur so even the children when they're five seven even eight ten years of age they don't know when they were born what date they were born in so they wouldn't pay attention unless it is made clear to them that every single month we say you were born on the 29th of november or this or that secondly we have to draw the line because our children our spouses have demands these demands would never ever run out if you fulfill one you'll get 10. if you fulfill 10 you get 100. so the demands are always there so if you allow them to participate in um birthdays they say okay we have christmas we have new year's we have halloween we have um easter we have all these festivals and uh diwali we have this and that that everybody is celebrating why we muslims don't celebrate my friends in school they're celebrating and i feel so depressed you don't like me you don't love me if you keep on giving in not holding your grounds you will you would have failed miserably in bringing up your children according to the quran yes we tell them that this is not our customs this is the customs of the disbelievers who insult allah azzawajal who do this who do that and at the same time throughout the year you fulfill their desire of going to fun fairs to play around to have quality time to go out for picnics so that when they compare their whole year to what is being done which is only a cake and a number of candles and happy birthday to you happy birthday so and so they would find that they're not missing a lot so they're as we say their eyes are filled throughout the year by seeing things that they enjoy and like so yes when you deprive your children from something you have to give them a substitute to that in halal fashions and this is how you bring them up insha'allah to be proud of their own religion allah knows best the next question is from brother alan gravy he is from germany and he is currently studying in the uk where he is contemplating to take a loan for his studies or not and he's saying that i could either study and you can take the loan or i could go back to my home country which is germany and study there for free and he is his question is how do you define necessity uh i mean if i can take a loan here the condition is such that if i do not repay it back i will have to pay the interest first of all there is a rule in islam which states necessities render prohibitions permissible example a woman must cover from head to toe she has stomach ache a doctor a male doctor is only available at this time and it's an emergency it is permissible to be examined by a male doctor and he may touch and maybe see the area which is a aura this is a necessity however this rule is governed by another rule which is what is a necessity must be estimated according to its actual size meaning a woman who's wearing hijab from head to toe goes to the dentist and takes off all of her clothes so what are you doing woman she says it's a necessity my tooth aches your tooth aches but why are you stripping you have something wrong in you so yes she can expose the area that is needed the tooth the ear the stomach but not the rest of the the the body so if a woman goes to a dentist she unveils her mouth so he can work but what why does she unveil her nose and and eyes and hair there's no need for that so we go back to our uh friend from germany and we say he okay that was a phone call so we say you do acknowledge that taking an interest-based loan is totally prohibited and riba yes or no he says yes or in germany it is so if this is true and you know it's one of the seven major sins in islam let us look at the necessity is it a matter of life and death no is it something that would permit you to do something haram no i could work without studying i can be an uber driver i can deliver pizza halal pizza i can work as a janitor no matter what i do because my time on earth is limited so i have few years then i'll die and then it is paradise for eternity or hell for eternity it's your choice so i would tell you definitely taking interest-based loans is totally out of the question taking mortgage to live in a house is totally out of the question because mortgages alone based on interest i am almost 60 years of age and i'm living in rent i don't possess a land i don't have a house to live in i pay rent like everybody else and i'm happy with that people say okay with the money you have paid the past 40 years you could have bought two houses said yes but i don't have the money to buy two houses and i'm not willing at all to participate in an interest-based loan after all these years and end up going to hell for that so i hope this answers your question next question is from an anonymous listener a viewer can a bad dua or curse backfire this is in allah's hands we cannot say it can backfire you can make dua which is bad and allah makes it happen oh allah destroy this person who oppressed me and allah destroys him maybe allah doesn't destroy him so it is stored for you on the day of judgment or allah deflects something harmful equivalent to it that was destined to happen but because you made dua allah deflected it from you maybe you make dua and it doesn't backfire but allah tests you with an illness with poverty with the calamity and you get to think that oh i made dua now it's backfiring at me which is not true in any uh entirely we don't have evidence to prove it backfired and we don't have proof that it was not because of that so this is all in allah's hands the next question is from brother faisan sharif while praying uh how to bring my body at ease my body keeps moving he is using the word vibrates involuntarily even though i try to make it still what to do one of two either you are a normal person and this does not happen to normal persons you have to control yourself you have to refrain from moving unintentionally or unwantedly and the second possibility is that you are not a normal person maybe you have parkinson's disease maybe you have an illness that is making you shake and move on voluntarily and in this case allah doesn't hold you accountable this is not within your ability to stop it so allah does not hold you accountable for that insha'allah the next question is from sister tabasam ahmed this is directed towards you i have seen i have seen your video shift in which you said it is permissible to give interest money for building a masjid with some remarks like the donors should not expect reward from allah for such a donation we know from history that uh even before the propheth did not accept money for building kaaba with money not earned in proper way this has confused me peace can you explain first of all quraish before islam did not accept haram money does this have any ruling in islam answers no quraish was not a muslim so we don't take our religion from them islam was not at the time revealed so we don't take rules from it secondly the actual money that we have so this is a bill if i buy halal things or haram things does this bill become impure meaning if i give it to you as a loan saying that you have to return it back to me with 10 riba so when you return it back to me is this now filthy because it's riba based the answer is no the money itself is halal the earner is sinful for earning it so for example we know that the jews deal in riba in interest and usually and they embezzle people extort people and take money from the people unlawfully however when the prophet was invited to iran that was cooked for him by a jew woman the prophet did not ask her where did you get the money from was it from riba was it from embezzling people and extorting them no he accepted the invitation and ate from that poisoned ram which means that the money itself is halal yet the earning is haram and therefore if a person has interest money he's either earning it willingly and happy he's sinful for that or he has no other place to deposit his money except in such interest-based bank accounts and they give him interest as in the case in india he's forced to take it it comes to his account without him being able to control it so in either cases the interest is haram for the earner whether willingly or unwillingly so when he takes it and gives it to me and says shakha sim i have a lot of interest money for example and you have your weekly program on zad and on huda tv and it costs a thousand euros per program so i would like to give you 54 000 euros for the whole year to sponsor it for the sake of allah this is interest money i wouldn't say uh no i will take the money and give it to the channel because they are paying a thousand euros a day for for my program and they need money but you will not get any reward with allah because the origin of your money is yet we can use it in our program we can use it on our tv channel we can use it in our islamic center we can rebuild our messages with it without any problem in sha allah if a business has 80 percent income from halal items and 20 income from tobacco products like cigarettes is it permissible to work in such a company it depends what is your job for example if you're working in the grocery section or in the vegetables and fruit section or in the meat section where you have nothing to do with the cigarettes or intoxicants or pork or whatever haram products yes you can work there but if you're the cashier and you actually receive money for halal and haram items this is totally prohibited for you to work there is there any significance of today a lot of us are sending other car to recite today as today's last wednesday of suffer last they have suffered ya allah i didn't know i have to make a run for it there's nothing special in the first wednesday of safar or the last i think they're mixed up with black friday which is the like last uh friday maybe of uh or the first friday or i don't know of of december or they're mixed up with the last uh wednesday before in in what what month are we in we're in october right february that's correct yeah yeah so the last wednesday of october they changed from day saving uh time in in the uk into normal and they take away one hour there's nothing in islam regarding the last friday the last wednesday the first saturday of any of the lunar history month all of this is a fabrication an innovation something made up by people who found that others listen and follow them and they make a lot and i mean a lot of money out of these ignorant people they make fun of them and they say that you have to do this you have to do that it's the last wednesday who says that wednesday has any preference or any virtue it's a day like any other day is allah nude or does allah have no creates the light that we have and this is an issue that needs a lot of explanation and probably needs a lot of differentiation because we see that we have light is this allah's light the answer is no this is light created by allah and we have a hadith where the prophet said allah and without allah everything would go dark allah azzawajal's hijab is also made of noor and if this hijab was unveiled the gaze of allah azzawajal everything else would uh be burnt because of the glory of allah's face subhanahu wata'ala we won't be able no one would be able to see allah in this life we would be strong enough to see allah's face and beautiful face when we enter jannah in sha allah so allah is noor and allah creates hijab and there is also the nur of guidance to him which allah revealed through the quran to the prophet the next question is from sisters should we say the shahada before going to sleep this is not from the sunnah the afghan of the sunnah are well known and you're a muslim so saying the shahada on your dying bed yes this is sunnah the prophet said teach those who are dying how to say but when going to bed of going to bed ayatul kursi cupping your hands and blowing in it and then reciting the three pulls and wiping your whole body and you do this three times and all the duas uh the last two ayahs of surat al-baqarah subhanallah alhamdulillah 33 times allahu akbar 34 times and so on all of these are part of the and part of declaring your islam without even needing to say the shahadah because saying it would be an innovation saying it at this particular point of time which is before going to bed is something that the prophet did not do so either we have an authentic hadith saying that yeah the prophet before going to bed he used to recite it then we have to follow that or if we don't have this then it becomes an innovation we have kulia one of the things we recite before going to bed which is a declaration of the heed practical to he i don't worship what you worship and you don't worship what i worship and allah knows the next question is that if my father earns his money from fortune telling is his money halal for me yes it is it is haram for him he is making a major sin and he is getting out of the fold of islam because fortune telling is an act of apostasy of kufuru uh uh the prophet said allah whoever goes to a fortune teller and he believes him he has left the fold of islam so yes your father is a kafir for doing what he's doing after the conditions are fulfilled and the money he earns is halal for everybody except him the next question is from brother muhammad when we were kids we did not have much ill but we did have respect and love for allah and our deen but now my kids age ten and eight are completely completing memorization of quran learning so many things like the seerak the arabic grammar etc but they have no respect or emotional attachment in the heart how can i solve this problem 10 years of age 10 and 8. yeah come on these are kids they're children what you had at the time when you were their age was fear pure utter fear of your parents of the environment of your relatives and this is why you find people praying out of fear because they used to be spanked beaten intimidated nowadays we don't have this in our system we don't reprimand our children yet we stuff their heads with information that focuses on quality rather than quality remember the prophet salam stayed in mecca for 13 years what did he teach the people there was no prayer most of the time there was no fasting there was no hajj there was no umrah there was no zakat all of this was prescribed later on so what did he do over these 13 years building up akida building up knowing allah azzawajal loving allah azzawajal fearing allah azzawajal in everything they said or did nowadays we tell i'll bring this and that for you i will get you this and that we will go here and there and no one ever says allah azzawajal will provide this with this and that and i'll i'll give it get it to you inshallah if allah wills by the grace of allah we will go to this place or to that place therefore what they're doing is actually caring mostly about technicalities how many do you memorize what about the quality of your memorization of your understanding of implementing it and of the live says may i'll be pleased with him we used to learn or abdullah we used to learn 10 verses of the quran understand them memorize them implement them in our lives then we move on to the following 10 hours nowadays we all what we care about is how many do you memorize okay complete the following ayah what does this i mean i don't know but i memorize it by heart so 8 and 10 years of age is too little give them time give them positivity encourage them don't would all due respect and wine all the time to them yeah when we were your age we used to do this we used to do that look at you you're useless there's no uh any any benefit of you there's you'll never be something be positive the prophet says whoever believes in allah must say good things or should remain silent so if you're unable to encourage them don't discourage them try your level best to be positive and make them feel also optimistic and positive and inshallah make dua and they will be better within them the next question is from brothers i have left my salah for three years when i was ignorant now i am practicing madina alhamdulillah do i need to redo my prayers for three years no you don't because it won't be accepted from you and we always give the example of hajj if someone came five days late or for hajj and he goes to arafah on his own and stays in the whole place and not a single person is in sight so the police comes and say what are you doing here he said i'm performing hajj i said yeah but arafat was five days ago and you missed that yeah i was caught up due to problems with my visa and immigration did not release me except today so i'm making it up we said no yeah you cannot make it up arafah is on the ninth of the hijab period you miss that day you mishaj you have a possibility next year to do another hajj likewise allah mentions in suratul israel that prayer is time bound so if the time if you pray before time for example fajr if you pray fajr before the break of dawn your prayer is invalid and if you pray fajr after sun rise your prayer is invalid you have to pray within the interval so if you missed it for three years no you cannot make up any single prayer just repent ask allah for forgiveness offer a lot of night prayer voluntary prayers and never mess up a prayer and inshallah can a woman post her worldly opinions on facebook she's a human being as long as she is not showing her picture or she's not talking softly about things that would tempt men talking about worldly things normal things just permissible totally if a girl wants to marry a person who is not religious and her parents are trying to convince her not to marry this person will you please give some tips for convincing her there are no tips she cannot marry someone her father does not approve of full stop if she insists and he doesn't give her her approval might as well why was simon pretend to get married this is zina even if you go to a court or travel to somewhere and they make the marriage contract this is invalid without your father's approval and you're committing zina which is a major sin if you believe that it is halal then you are an apostate a kafir and if you don't believe it's halal and you acknowledge that you're living in zina which is a major sin then all of your children will be born out of wedlock and you would be a fornicator the next question next question is how to think positive of allah when times are well bad needs a full lecture times are not bad because time has no power to be good or bad it is what allah has predestined to us that might be good that might be bad and this is why the six pillars of islam the last one is to believe in the divine decree or the pre-destiny whether good or bad so if you watch all of your life cannot be a constant slope there has to be ups and downs and the curve goes up and the curve goes down sometimes i reflect on my lives on my life i was so in pain and trouble and there are so many times where i was happy healthy wealthy and i find that this is all part of life where allah tests us so you should not condemn time you should acknowledge that this is allah testing you with calamities and with good things and this is a fitna so when allah gives me a million kuwaiti dinar this is fitna i said oh i'm happy allah azza loves me and if allah takes it from me and i'm facing charges with the court and i say allah doesn't love me no allah said in surah al-fajr this is not the case allah gives health gives wealth gives peace of the land and safety to those whom he loves and those whom he does not love but allah does not give iman does not give tranquility does not give the peace of mind except to those whom he love except to those whom he loves guidance comes only to those whom allah loves so whenever you see that allah azzawajal is guiding your heart to be content to be patient to be tolerant accepting whatever happens to you with a smiley face and saying alhamdulillah like zubair may allah have mercy on his soul the son of asma bint abi bakker the son of one of the ten heaven bound he once on the same night lost his son who was attacked or ran over by a horse in the caliph's stables in the caliph barn and it on the same night the doctors say that we have to amputate your foot because there's going gargan in it after all of this happened and finished he said alhamdulillah oh allah you gave me eight sons and you took one and you gave me four limbs and you took one so what you have kept is far greater than what you had taken this is how a believer should deal with calamities that strike him and always praise allah azza and always feel optimistic think positive of allah always tell yourself allah did not deprive me because he's stingy allah is the most generous subhanallah and he did not with hold things from me because he doesn't have allah is the most rich and who owns everything so then why do i say oh allah grant me my business is not doing well my father is not having a good income he lost his job allah is doing this as a test and we don't know the outcome of allah's test but we trust his knowledge always remember al-khidr what he did with musa in the end of surat al-kaff which we recite every friday three incidents he saw a boat with poor people working across the river he said can you give us a lift they said with pleasure he started making a hole in the boat musa was outraged they are doing us a favor and you're doing this in return they walk and they see a child nine years of age playing with his peers he goes to him and he kills him musa was outraged you kill an innocent soul when he explained to musa why he did this we understand that allah azzawajal allah's knowledge is way far greater than ours and allah's wisdom is way way more accurate than ours so we should doubt our own intellect and submit to allah's will and be content with allah's decree and allah knows best the next question is from a sister watching at facebook if a maharam has done zinna with a victim can the victim severe the kinship with him so we have a situation whether this maharan committed zina willingly or he raped his mahram let's assume sister or an uncle doing such heinous filthy act with his niece so can she sever the kinship the ties of kinship the answer is yes but we have to look at each case by case scenario sometimes such things happen and the people repent nothing goes forever if the person is not showing any remorse or repentance she must not be with that mahram in a room alone she must not be with that mahram along with other people except wearing the full hijab from him whether he's her father her brother her uncle she has to wear the full hijab as a total stranger from him and she's not obliged at all to communicate with him because the the the cons are far greater than the pros and the possibility of this happening again is always there and allah knows best the next question is from brother david at facebook his question is allah created good and evil both so whatever so whatever happens in our life if the evil happens is it not allah's will the issue of will brother david is divided into two types there is a legislative will and there is a universal will what does that mean see it's a long topic but if you read the quran and if you read the sunnah you will find that allah azzawajal orders us to pray to fast and to do righteous deeds and at the same time he prohibits us from doing shirk and from doing sins and tells us that these are abhorred to him these are legislative will meaning that these are the things that allah loves us to do and he loves us to refrain from that is since yet this is not necessarily what's going to happen because lots of us would defy allah's orders and not do what he mandates or fall into what he had prohibited so this second or latter one is the universal will allah wants abu bakr to become a muslim and wants pharaoh to become a muslim this is legislative it might happen it may not happen but what allah decreed to happen it has nothing to do with what allah loves it deals with allah's wisdom allah's knowledge allah's power so we end up having abu bakr accepting islam so the universal and the legislative will has been fulfilled while in with pharaoh the legislative will was not fulfilled because he chose to disobey yet the universal will was fulfilled so whenever there are hurricanes volcanoes earthquakes catastrophes wars atrocities is it part of allah's legislative well or a universal will the answer is part of the universal will allah does not want people to suffer but allah does not love people to have wars but part of the legislative action and will of allah part of the universal action and will of allah is things have to happen people have to die calamities must take place without night we cannot value the daytime without illness we cannot value health and without kufur we cannot value the blessing of islam and allah knows best just a quick time check it's only two minutes to our hour uh we have more than 40 questions spending in zoom and several more than 30 at facebook one last question from facebook from sister samina uh salaam she have to take nukhola must the wife leave the house immediately what if she wants to stay in separate compartment for kids sake or for economics this is this is different now once khuller has been granted she's totally haram for her husband ex-husband which means she has to cover she cannot stay in the same room there have there must not be any communication as a total stranger now the arrangement differs from one person to the other most women just leave flee they would not stay and this is why they opted for huller some women would say no i don't want to see him but he is generously allowing me to stay with my children in the house and he's relocating okay this is okay this is fine no problem but to live in the same house and they share the same kitchen maybe the bathroom and he claims that he's not gonna communicate with her or see her and she says yeah i'm going to abide by the parda my husband is saying that he can be maharam of his maternal and paternal uncle's wives i just no no you don't need to to continue asking her husband is sorry i just got another call her husband is either delusional or ignorant imbecile or following his desires and whims his uncle's wife whether paternal or maternal uncle arnan the moment his uncle divorces her or dies and she's a widow he can marry her immediately as a second wife so definitely this is not permissible at all and no muslim with a glimpse of knowledge would ever say such a thing you actually solve their problem because the sisters said that my husband would not agree till sheikh gives his ruling he could call me or get a counselling session with me alhamdulillah and i'll clarify things for him one to one no problem we have run out of time there are so many questions but inshallah we'll continue the next time uh i will leave it up to you to conclude the session and may allah to shower his favors and blessings upon the people of kuwait and on your islamic center which is doing a very good job and may allah azzawajal grant us the safety the health and the opportunity to meet physically once again in kuwait in the near future be india"
