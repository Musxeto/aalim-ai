  "transcript": "sister hawa says can we pray before going to bed in the afternoon as we do before going to bed at night time first of all there isn't any prescribed Sunnah for offering prayer before going to bed at night meaning night prayer is any prayer you pray after Isha and before the Adana fajar whether it is before you go to bed and this is called night prayer or it is after waking up from sleep and this is called the hatred either way you can do that but to think that it is part of the sunnah before going to bed that we offer two Rakas this is wrong it is not part of the sunnah so you should not maintain doing it thinking that it is Sunnah if if you just simply like to do it no problem you can do it likewise before the or after you pray the and you want to take your siesta before a third time you can pray but without relating it to the Sunnah or thinking that this is something good or something that's helpful for my risk or from my day this there is nothing as such"
