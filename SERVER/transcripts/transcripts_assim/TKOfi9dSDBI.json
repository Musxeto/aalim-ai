  "title": "Will Allah forgive my sins if I repent & not punish me once He accepts my repentance or not? Assim",
  "transcript": "okay if my question today is uh what is the ruling on someone uh who has committed a lot of sins in their past which they think of and they've repented but uh the things that they you know like once allah forgives you they will never punish allah will not punish you but uh this person who committed sin he thinks that it's a great sin and he thinks that allah might forgive me after allah punishes me and purifies me is that is that true or will allah completely forgive and if he forgives he'll never punish you for that specific thing that he forgives you the vast majority of sinners like me and you get these intrusive thoughts and as an issue of hakida for those who are like me and you from sunnah who abide by the quran and the sunnah and through the understanding of the righteous predecessors and the favorite generations we believe that every muslim has to have two wings like a bird a wing that is fear of allah and of his punishment and torment and a wing of hope in allah's mercy and forgiveness in jannah these two wings must be equal so that the bird would fly steadily because if one is greater than the other the bird would be tilted now such a fear that allah may not forgive have forgiven me is a positive fear when it drives you to repent more ask allah for forgiveness and to do righteous deeds and definitely to stay away from haram this is a positive fear but when this fear is exaggerated where you're driven to feel despair of allah's mercy this is a negative one so should i feel that allah has forgiven all of my sins and rest assured that i will not be questioned about it and i'll be going and admitted to paradise immediately no should i hope yes there's a great room for hope and being positive but it's one of satan's traps to feel secure as per the hadith if my servant is secure in this life i'll intimidate him in the hereafter but if he's intimidated and afraid of me in this life i'll give him security on the day of judgment and allah azza knows best"
