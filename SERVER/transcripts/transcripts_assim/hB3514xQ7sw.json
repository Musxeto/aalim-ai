  "title": "My bed is faced so that my legs point straight towards my friends books, is this disrespectful?",
  "transcript": "yes actually my question is i am a student so we are two friends living in one room so my bed is declined in such a way that my legs go straight towards my friends books they are inclined they are at the same height where my legs are straight straight forward towards the books so is it inappropriate or should i change my position are you disrespecting these books intentionally no no in this case there is no problem directing your feet towards these books or towards the qibla because there's nothing in the quran or the sunnah prohibits it this is nothing related to islam and this is something that we always tell people you have to be aligned with the instructions of the quran the sunnah whenever i want to prostrate in the masjid and i put the quran on the ground and i prostrate the elders usually come and pick it up and say stop for allah what's what's wrong so this is disrespecting the quran when you put it on the ground i say says who i have full respect to the quran i love the quran i'm reciting the quran i worship allah azzawajal i teach people what's in the quran how dare you judge my intention that i'm disrespecting oh you put it on the ground so what when i prostrate i put my face on the ground am i disrespecting my face this is ridiculous so these ideas that people exaggerating like people saying okay if i'm sitting on a chair and my brother is on the ground and he's a half of of the quran he's not reading in the quran he's a half of oh i'm committing an act of kufur or disrespect this is bogus where are you getting these nonsense from even if he's reciting the quran even if he's praying if i'm sitting on my chair or even on the table or hanging the chandelier who cares let him do what he's doing and i'm doing what i'm doing this has nothing to do with quran and respecting it you"
