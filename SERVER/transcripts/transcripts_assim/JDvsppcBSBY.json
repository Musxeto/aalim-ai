  "transcript": "my question is um someone used to talk with non Maham before coming back to Dean and repenting but before blocking all interactions they both decided to convince their family in future and make make Dua for marriage but they both requested each other not to look for non mahrams anymore so that they can have a minimum minimum chance to inform their family but while avoiding non Maham she instantly changed her intention that she's doing it for the sake of Allah not because of someone else but sometimes while she checks or Scrolls other non Maham or talks or avoids or talks with one of his female relatives she fears of shik so are all of this shik or not no there's no shik in that at all"
