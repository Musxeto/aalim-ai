  "transcript": "liber says a friend of mine says rights of human are to be more frightened for violation than the rights of Allah and this man becomes careless about duties towards Allah likes Allah since nudity as my friend has a concept that Allah loves people so much he will let go this is a misconception among the people and it is one of the deviant 72 sects that are all in hell as the Prophet told us is awesome our ummah will be divided into 73 72 of them are in Hell except one this one is one of the 72 why this is known as ear job and the sect is called a loggia and they claim that no matter what sends you do as long as you believe in allah azzawajal allah subhanahu wata'ala would forgive your sins so it encourages them to fornicate to consume intoxicants to light not to pray on time and still insist that my Eman is as strong as the amount of Abu Bakr and Umar and this is foolishness this has nothing to do with Islam the Prophet told us Allah his salat OSEM that a woman was admitted to hell because of a kitten she kept in her house as a prisoner captive not feeding it and not allowing the kitten to go out and eat from the insects of the ground so the kitten died and Allah admitted this woman to hell compare this to what you're doing from ignoring the salat watching pornography doing Haram sins all of these things will definitely ensure you a big good spot in hell so when you think that Allah is most forgiving and at the same time neglect that he is severe in punishment you are in deep trouble"
