  "transcript": "and we begin with the grace of allah azzawajal the second session for questions on our course the islamic faith for so today's class would be all devoted to answering the questions that you have posted on facebook and on the website is hap says in what state can one praise allah in his or her shoes the prophet alaihis salat wasallam while wearing your shoes sandals for jews do not pray wearing them and in this hadith it is clear that the prophet salallahu salaam is saying to us a sunnah without putting any limitations to it or any conditions and this means that praying while in your shoes is a sunnah it is also proven from authentic hadith that all of you know that the prophet started the prayer salahu salaam in his masjid wearing his sandals or shoes and the companions were wearing their shoes as well in the middle of the salat the prophet took off his shoes and placed them beside him so the companions seeing this may have peace with them they all took their shoes off and did exactly as the prophet had done after the prayer was over the prophet isam asked his companions what did you do that why did you take off your shoes so they said you took off your shoes therefore we took ours so the prophet sent explained to them and he said jibril came to me while in prayer and told me that there are impurities in my shoes so i took them off therefore whoever wants to pray in his shoes should look into his shoes and if there are no impurities he should pray in them so what do we understand we understand that there is no state where it recommends or discourage you from praying in your shoes or sandals you can do that anytime you want however nowadays the vast majority of messages are the floor the ground is covered by carpets that are constantly hoovered and cleaned and the vast majority of muslims don't know the ruling don't know the sunnah so if you were to come with your shoes with whatever sand soil mud on them nothing in pure but it would make the masjid's carpets and how it looks dirty at the time of the prophet they had no carpets nothing on the ground it was only sand and pebbles so it didn't matter whether you were barefooted or wearing shoes but nowadays it's a different story so it is highly recommended to take them off if not mandatory but if you're praying in the mess in in a mall or in an airport or in a hospital or in the market or in the streets you that you don't need you do not need to take your shoes or sandals or slip or slippers off at all you can pray in them following the sunnah safana says i ask dua like my particular property want to get sold quickly so that my debts will get closed if i asked in this way it is correct i am afraid that allah may have any other way to fulfill my debts so if i ask in the same way above then allah will have different plan so that my way of dua get ignored something gets delayed or get delayed please help me out in this i don't understand the question clearly but let me try to give it a shot so safana is saying that i'd like allah azza to assist me sell my property quickly so that i can pay off my debts but i don't know what allah has plans for me so i'm afraid if i make dua this would conflict with allah's plans and i don't want to anger allah or to not wait for what allah has in store for me this is all nonsense the fanum no one knows what allah has in store for us no one knows what allah has predestined for us so all what we can do is make dua and be content with the result so if shaytan whispers in my ears and says ah if you make dua that allah helps you sell your plot maybe this goes against allah's plans and two months later the property value would double and you will feel sorry and regret it okay so i will not sell the plot then shaytan comes to you and says well if you don't sell the plot the debt would be haunting you 24 7 and you will feel depressed and maybe in two months time the prices and the values of property would go down and you would lose half of what you would have gotten if you were to sell it today do you think that this is logical or this is plain and simple from shaytan definitely this is from shaytan messing with your head and you should ignore that and not pay attention to it allah tells you to make dua whatever allah has in plan for you no one can force allah to do what he does not want so if there is good in it it will take place allah will make it happen if not then your dua would not be answered so be content with whatever allah decrees for you and inshallah you will have what you want samia says my brother married a non-muslim in court and not any he is no more he passed away few years back i continued to keep contact with his wife and young daughter with the sole intention of da'wah and still pray to allah to guide them to islam my question is do i have any relation with his daughter with islamic perspective well this is something we cannot answer unless we know the background and the circumstances generally speaking any marriage that takes place without the islamic procedure is not a valid marriage so the valid marriage has to have what is known as hijab and proposal and acceptance and it has to have a guardian and it has to have two muslim witnesses having read your question samia it seems that your brother married this woman only as a legal or civil marriage so there was no proper nikkah meaning that her father was the guardian did not propose and say i give you my daughter in marriage and there were no two witnesses as well muslim witnesses which makes the marriage invalid now having said that if your brother thought that what this was a legitimate marriage and he had zero knowledge of what nikah was some people don't know they're so ignorant that they don't know what's the ruling so let's assume that this woman was a christian or a jew and he married her thinking that a civil marriage would be an islamic marriage because nikah should only be with muslim women but due to the fact that she's not a muslim she's a jew or a christian then he thought that this was valid in this case this marriage is not valid but the girl whom he accepted as his own child and gave her her name gave her his name this marriage would be considered to be what which means intercourse in doubt meaning that he thought that she was his legitimate wife and hence the daughter is his daughter and if he were alive we would have asked him to rectify his mistake by marrying an islamic marriage but due to the fact that he is deceased and he cannot rectify this anymore i believe inshallah that she is his daughter and she is your niece you can deal with her in such a fashion but if the woman was not a jew or a christian if she was a hindu or an atheist clearly declaring that she is not any of the three religions islam judaism or christianity in this case this girl was born out of wedlock and she has nothing to do with you or your family aslin ahmed says how should one react if a born muslim admits he's no longer in islam and that nothing people can say will change his mind because he is happy with his situation this is a clear declaration of apostasy a born muslim who says that he has nothing relating him to islam and he is happy with that and he doesn't want and nothing will change his mind this is an apostate he's a kafir so there isn't anything to react upon except to treat this person as a kafir as an apostate until he reverts to islam and becomes a muslim hussein says if i buy a teddy bear for my two-year-old niece for birthday not celebrating with cake or anything just a gift will i be sinful the short answer is yes the long answer is satan has steps and he doesn't come all of a sudden with a major sin or an innovation rather he starts bit by bit he's patient he can wait for tens of years and he doesn't care what counts is that you would fall into sin so do you think if muslims simply exchange gifts on the day of birth of a person that they would just limit it to that no it says of course not look what's happening all over the world the muslim world how all of this began how did all of this begin it began by a one step a single step of satan's followed by another followed by others until we have reached this conclusion so now you see people throwing parties and hotels for birthdays having a birthday cake with candles numbered as his age and with a song happy birthday to you happy birthday dear awesome happy birthday to you and then blowing the candles with a wish that will definitely take place then exchanging gifts all of this started most probably with a gift or even with a congratulation happy birthday full stop but next year the following year you will slowly deteriorate like a man standing in quicksand until it drowns you therefore why emphasize on that particular day out of the 365 days a year because this is what the disbelievers do and imagine what birthdays led them to it led them to christmas it became part of the religion to celebrate the christmas the birthday of jesus peace be upon him look at the super sufis the among the muslims it led them to celebrate the birthday of our prophet muhammad ali all of this is not part of the religion therefore i highly advise you moyen to ignore such thoughts that come to you you want to be kind to your niece buy her a gift any time of the year take her shopping any time of the year take her to the fun fairs if you wish but not relate this to her birthday fahim says i have a question my family members are muslims and pray they give zakat but they are forcing me for a job in the banking industry how to make them understand they give a very irrigating argument like all of the world goes with banking money directly or indirectly and it is a secure job what should be my answer or course of action well fahim first of all you are a man and part of your job description as a man is to hold your grounds and not to be hesitant and not to be reluctant or confused where people play with you like children play with a football it's part of your job description to remain steadfast as a man no one can force you to do anything you're not a child anymore no one can force you to eat or drink or stand up or sit down you do whatever you want because you're a man secondly when it comes to jobs this is your life you have to tell them that this is none of any of you's business whether i take a job here or there this is my decision this is my preference is it a secure job in worldly terms of course it is banking industry is one of the most interesting careers one can get involved into according to the worldly standards according to the religious standards it is one of the worst it's one of the worst because it is one of the seven major sins in islam where allah cursed the one who takes riba that is the customer and the one who gives riba that is the bank depending which one is lending who and the one who registers it the accountant and the two witnesses who are not charging anything just doing it for the sake of allah no they're doing it just for being uh the good samaritans so worldly standards yes it's a secure job islamic standards it is one of the most heinous and dangerous jobs because it takes the person straight to hell as for their claim that everybody is dealing with it this is true also everybody is indulged in haram whether it is consuming haram income or smoking or abandoning salat not praying it in the masjid or free mixing or indulging in illicit relationships bribing corruption all over the world we see this so just because the vast majority of people consume intoxicants wine and whiskey and majority of humans won't accept islam even if you try your level best so the majority is not the criteria that we judge by logic however as we spoke about on monday's class last monday which is number 16. it's a very important lesson to listen to over and over again what is your family doing giving presidents giving a priority to their minds to their logic and reason or to the revelation of the quran and the sunnah without any doubt they are saying that our logic and reason come first and this is dangerous this casts shades and shadows and doubts over their islam are you telling me that what allah has prohibited and the prophet cursed islam those who deal with it are you telling me that i should overlook this and put it behind me and work in such a job just because it pays well well why would i do that why wouldn't i go for prostitution that pays even more why don't i deal in drugs that is pays more and more and maybe if i sell arms to different warring countries i can make a lot of money these are things these are things that are islamic sinful unethical just because it generates money doesn't make it halal just because everybody is dealing with it does not make it halal so you have to try to convince your family to go back to the quran the sunnah and to see what allah wants and not what they want zaid zubair says is growing the beard and keeping our garments above the ankle rajib or they are just sunnah someone told us that a man came to the prophet salaam to abide by only the five pillars of islam when the man left the prophet said allah if he is true he'll enter jannah he did not tell him about growing the beard and so on please help me out well this is a great um misunderstanding and unfortunate um confusion that many of the laymen tend to circulate among the people to justify themselves shaving their beards and probably wearing long trousers the hadith of the nomad who came to the prophet alaihis allah asking him about islam so he asked about the five pillars or the four so the prophet told him about the shahada about the prayer the prophet told him about fasting and he did not to my recollection tell him about hajj which is a pillar of islam and when you look at the hadith you will find that it highlighted the pillars of islam not all what is included in islam in terms of do's and don'ts so by the logic of these people talking to you zed if i were to say that hitting my parents and beating them up is okay because the prophet isam did not mention it in this hadith and he said that he will be truth successful and he will enter paradise if he was saying the truth so does this make any sense of course not and if a person also claims that all what is prohibited in islam it's okay to make as long as i just pray and fast ramadan and maybe give zakat because the prophet said he has said the truth if he succeeded and likewise everything that is mandatory in islam other than the prayer and fasting would be discluded i would be disregarding it because the hadith did not mention it no one says this in islam at all no one at all said this all what they said was this is the minimum requirement for entering paradise so yes you may just pray five times fast ramadan gives a cat maybe perform hajj once in a lifetime but if you do any sin if you abandon anything that is mandatory such as being dutiful to your parents such as not harming your neighbors honoring your guests being kind to your wife being fair with your wives and your children connecting your next of kin without severing it all of these if someone does not do them or does something that is haram he will be punished in hell at ten years a thousand years allah knows how long inevitably he will end up in gender because he's a muslim for doing these minimal acts which were prayer fasting etc but it does not at all have to do anything with whether drawing the beard and keeping the trousers above the ankles are mandatory or recommended sunnah so to answer your question shaving the beard is totally prohibited by the four schools of thought the prophet isa salaam ordered by saying all of these words are verbs of order telling you to let go honor leave not touch in a sense and all of these are in order form it's like when your father says go and fetch me my keys and you're playing video games and you say yeah yeah sure and you continue and he says didn't you hear what i say he says yeah i heard and you continue what do you expect to happen he will spank you he will beat the heck out of you you have no justification to say that why are you hitting me i thought that you were telling me if you wish if you want go and get me the keys but this is not an order no no one says this once the prophet tells you to do something this is a must unless there is another evidence reducing it from mandatory into recommended therefore it is mandatory likewise when the prophet arrested threatens those who wear their trousers or garments underneath to exceed the ankle level by saying that it is in hell it is punishable in hell fire this is not intimidating you or please think about it this is a promise if you do this you're going to be burnt into in hell because of it of such a sin so i hope this answers your question fatimah says i saw many muslims including my self after making dua or supplication wipe hands over face is this perceived by a fatwa or sunnah or whatever you call it the answer is no when we make dua generally speaking not related to after salah generally speaking i am between adam and eve and i raise my hands and make dua after i finish some people wipe their faces and this is not backed up by any authentic hadith so the hadith that backs it up is not authentic hence one should not do that now look at the steps of shaitan how many times have you seen people not only wiping their faces but rather wiping their whole bodies and every inch of it i've seen many how did this start i've i approached i personally have approached many and usually i approach them with diplomacy because i know that i scared people and many people told me that i have an intimidating face in a very serious world this is the face of a killer so i go to them and say salaam alaikum and accept a word of advice from an elder brother or should i refrain immediately when they see you speak like this so no no no if they're younger so uncle please advise me if he's a little bit older he says yeah no problem if he's way older he says hey don't make yourself older i'm older than you so i broke the ice with the grace of allah so i would tell him i saw you do this do you know any hadith that backs it up 99.9 percent says no but i saw someone do this so i thought that this is barack blah blah blah okay i'll tell you the proper sunnah and it's up to you to take it or not the prophet isam would never do this except in two occasions one before going to bed he used to cup his hands blow then recite the three holes and wipe over his body repeat this three times or whenever he felt pain or got sick he used to do roughly on himself by cupping his hands reciting the vehicles then blow see the opposite knight athkar or bedtime of car we blow then recite in rookia we recite then blow and he would wipe over the area that aches him or hurts him never ever was it reported that the prophet assam wiped his face after salat or his body so this is my advice i apologize again for interrupting you and for uh intruding on your privacy like this but i hope you forgive me 100 percent would never argue and would say allah increases in knowledge i have learned from you end of story so always remember when you have a hadith people honor it people value it i never go and say ah sheikh this makes some people retract a little bit not accept unless you know that they are 100 okay with great scholars of islam that you're coaching then yes this is a point of power that you can add to it so in short wiping the face after dua or in vocation or supplication is an innovation is not valid yasir says can i give gold as mahar to my wife my parents plan to give a gold set and bangles to my wife to be as it is a tradition in the subcontinent i ask them to make it as documents is this permissible answer if yes if the woman agrees to that the answer would be yes but if the woman says i am not less than anyone else your sister received a dowry in cash and gold sets from uh her parents-in-law my brother got married and did the same thing so by skipping the dowry and only expecting the gold set to be sufficient this is permissible if she agrees to it but if she sees it as an insult then no you should include the dowry and most likely you're doing what you're doing for the sake of saving money and that is a bit cheap because the gold set is a gift from your parents it's not mandatory upon them to give her so if they don't want to give her no problem but your dowry is from you to your wife and this is mandatory upon you and allah azza knows best latifah says is signing an affidavit that does not mention the name of allah haram it's just have i will do this and that if an affidavit is a legal document or commitment that you will do something in front of two lawyers or a judge and you promise to do it it's binding legally but it's not an oath because you did not take the name of allah and surely you did not take the name of other than allah which would make it  uh at that time so yeah there's no problem in that inshallah rashid says can we pray evening afkar just before magribathan and prayers the answer is dispute and after looking into it it seems that it is permissible to say the evening of car after assault prayer and the closer it is to sunset or after it the better so to answer your question latifah yes if you say your evening of car like 15 minutes 20 minutes before sunset this does the job in sha allah or rashid's questions not latifah okay says what is the ruling of dua now whenever dua al-quran is mentioned people usually mean by it one of two either they're talking about the general dua al-quran which everybody knows which is done and performed during witter prayer allah madina feman hadith etc and this is a sunnah which the prophet alaihi salazar taught his grandson al-hasan ibn ali when he was a child and he requested the prophet to teach him to read during britain so the prophet taught this dua to him so it's authentic it is recommended if you do it sheikh al-samintamia says that's good if you skip it that's good if you do it sometimes and skip it sometimes that is also good because the prophet was never reported to have said it but he taught it to his grandson so it can go either way it's not mandatory you can do it you can say it and you can skip it if you wish the second type of dua which which people usually refer to is what only the shafiri school of thought from all the major schools of thought in islam only the shafi'is do it and they only do it in fajr prayer so if you go to indonesia to malaysia sometimes in some messages in syria and in egypt etc you will find that after the second rakah saying the imam makes dua and this dua is not from the sunnah and the vast majority of scholars say that this is not from the sunnah what the prophet had done for a whole month was to make dua in all five filed prayers not in fajr only and after one month he was told to stop so he stopped and none of the companions had performed it after he stopped so even after the death of the prophet saws abu bakr umar uthman and ali never performed so what we obtain from this is that the shafir school of thought is strong big time in this issue now what would i do if i go to kuala lumpur and i pray fajr in the message then i say see them offer kunut and i am a follower there's no problem in me raising my hands and saying i mean to the dua because they are following a reputable school of thought though the verdict is wrong totally but i wouldn't go to say that it invalidates the prayer or it is haram this is the best of their knowledge or to the best of their knowledge masuma says tell me the ruling on salatu tawba and salatu what should we say when we read quran and dua came should we say amin during our tilawah so these are two separate questions the first question what to say in salah salat is like any other salah two rakahs you pray fatiha nasura and tasha and then you offer salam you may in sujud ask allah for forgiveness but this is was not mentioned in the salah so the intention of seeking allah's forgiveness and repentance when praying it and concluding it that would be sufficient as for salatu sugar we've stated that many times that there is no specific salat of shukurt and this hadith is not authentic so it is not something part of islam to offer two raka's of gratitude or sugar as for what to say when there are du as in the quran nothing you just listen to it especially if you are a follower but if you are of the imam and you pass by an ayah where it mentions hellfire and torment of allah you seek refuge in allah and if it you pass by an ayah of mercy and the mentioning of jannah you ask allah from his grace and favors and blessing and allah azzawajal knows best muhammad says is it allowed for a muslim young lady to speak about sexual harassment openly like to enlightened people first of all it is totally prohibited to speak in front of men so opposite gender is totally out of the question secondly if she is addressing only females and she is truthful in what she's saying and this does not include any exposure of her own sins so she wouldn't say that i used to mix with men and we used to ask to have a boyfriend we used to go to school and this happened this is exposing her sin she should not address this thirdly lots of these experiences when it comes to harassment may involve um provoking lust and desire you don't know who you are addressing when you speak about he did this to me and i did that and i tried to uh avoid it and he continued you don't know what fantasies would go into the minds of those listening to you so in a sense i believe that such sharing of experiences to enlightened people is not healthy you can simply abide by the quran and the sunnah teach girls not to free mix not to communicate with nan to always protect their chastity and cover themselves probably even in front of mahram and to avoid anything that is dubious or um weird and strange uthman says can we sell special spices designed to cook various meat dishes the to non-muslims yes spices are spices as long as they're halal and they're used by people in halal there's nothing wrong in that if you don't know whether they're they'll cook halal meat or haram meat with that it's none of your business you're selling spices it's like someone coming to buy water from you and you say what are you gonna use this water for are you gonna by any chance make ice cubes so that you would drink it with your whiskey this is not your business selling water is halal that's it says are we allowed to pray in the car when we are traveling due to it's being difficult to come home and pray due to running out of prayer time the answer is no it is not permissible for a person who is capable of standing up to pray sitting down unless there is a legitimate reason the hadith of hassan the prophet said you must pray this is a pillar that you pray standing up so if you're in a car simply stop the car and pray on time on the road in a park at the parking lot at a masjid whatever but don't continue to drive or to pray sitting down without a legitimate reason princess says as a woman am i allowed to answer the salams of greetings of non-mahram if there is no fitnah no problem if you are in a supermarket or if you are in a family gathering someone none says there's no fitnah but if it's one to one there's no one other than you two that is a great place for fitness you should not answer that person you should not be there in the first place and allah knows best muhammad says can you please describe the term i think she means to be is to say subhanallah is to simulate or to give similarity to something and if anyone point his own body parts while talking about any attributes of allah will it be considered as tashbi like one is talking about allah's hands or eyes and pointing to his hands or keeping his finger on his eyes so does this come under tashbih if not then what is it first of all allah stated in the quran that there is nothing similar to him unto him there is nothing like him which means that no one can give any similarity to allah now this is a general rule when we speak about for example the hearts of humans are between two fingers of allah's fingers flipping them as he wishes no one can say like this because this is totally prohibited the prophet had never done this now neither did the salaf when we talk about allah descending in the last third of the night to the lower heaven no one says that allah azza does this he puts his foot first this is blasphemous nobody ever does this simulation but there are evidences where the prophet was do something that indicates that the attributes of allah azzawajal are real but not simulating them so for example the prophet salallahu salaam in a hadith narrated from [Music] um okay even um said the prophet said allah may he be glorified will take his heavens and his earths in his hands and will say i am allah clenching and unclenching his fist the prophet is doing this i am the sovereign and i looked at the member and saw it shaking at the bottom and i thought that it would fall with the messenger on him on it so the prophet is the one who's doing this in another hadith which is also authentic allah the prophet read this ayah they made not a just estimate to allah of allah such as due to him and on the day of resurrection the whole of the earth will be grasped by his hand and the heavens will be rolled up in his right hand glorified is he and high is he above all that they associate as partners with him and the prophet salaam was gesturing like this with his hand moving it back and forth uh also said in another ayah let me try to find it in another hadith the allah the prophet all hearing all seeing and the prophet did this putting his thumb on his ear and his index finger on his eyes so some ignorant people thought that this was simulating and now how could this be when the prophet is some himself read to us allah's there is nothing like him and he is all hearer all seer nothing like him so what was the prophet doing when he was clinching and unclenching his fist and when he was putting his fingers on his ear and uh eyes the scholars say that this is to prove that this is actual attribute and not what some people would manipulate and distort the meaning lots of the asha of ashari's and and the well hearing and seeing is metaphorical and it is only knowledge and they say that allah's hand is metaphorical allah does not have a hand and it's allah's power so by the prophet clenching and unclenching his fist he's telling them that this is the actual attribute of allah which allah has a hand not that his hand is like his so this is only to prove to the people that the actual attribute exists how we don't know how what is it similar to we don't know um can we give an an imitation of it we cannot and all of this is well established from the quran and from the sunnah and i hope this answers your question safe says is it permissible to work in a supermarket that sells cigarettes the answer is if you have nothing to do with loading and unloading selling or handling cashing or moving cigarettes or haram items then your job is halal most people work in the grow the groceries which is halal or work in the vegetables and fruits section which is halal or deal with electronics with just hannah when it comes to cigarettes if you're a cashier you cannot work there if you are a a porter or a laborer that carries the boxes and put them on the shelves etc no you should not deal with that because it is haram for you zed says is this allowed when you want to buy something like a land for example and you don't have cash but you can go to the bank and the bank pays for the land and you start to pay the bank is this not reba i was in an islamic bank or an islamic darsh and the sheikh told us that that's okay please help me out no this is not okay and i am hundred percent certain that you misunderstood what your sheikh said selling and buying should be done by two parties whenever a third party intervenes this kind or form of financing is most likely riba so if i have this plot to buy the owner wants to buy it cash and i don't have cash we cannot finish and conclude this transaction unless a third party comes and says listen the seller wants a hundred thousand euros here's your hundred thousand euros the buyer must pay me back 120 000 euros over the duration of xyz you agree the seller says i'm fine the buyer says i'm fine the bank says i'm fine this is halam this is riva definitely your teacher did not mean this when he was teaching his dust when will it be permissible when the bank comes and sees that the transaction is not going to go through due to such problems he goes and buys the property from the seller he gives him the hundred thousand euros now it is in the bank's name with no strings attached from my site no commitment after he possesses the property he calls me and says i have the property you're interested in i'm willing to sell it to you for 120 000 euros divided by 10 years if i'm interested i say okay if i'm not i say no i think i'll pay rent and he will become stuck with the property in this case this is totally halal and legit because i have the choice to buy or not to buy while in the first scenario i am forced to buy because he did not buy it from the seller until he took guarantees from me and commitment and transfer of my bank account my salary to him etc so therefore i hope this answers your question robia says there are certain paid apps which provide copons for people to benefit from restaurants spa etc example when one uses any coupon of any brand they will buy one and get another one free like if one goes to an open buffet with his spouse they will only pay for one person and the other is free with the app coupon are these types of apps permissible to benefit from because one will buy the app for a package in order to get the free deals for the whole year there are a hundreds of brand in app and each brand has three free coupons vouchers the answer is no this is not permissible because it involves gambling so discount cards and many other things that are similar to it where you buy a specific card for 100 euros and you will avail a lot of discounts in five-star hotels in some restaurants and some spas etc and they have a booklet this big scholars say that this is a lot of ambiguity in this because you may buy the the coupon or the app and not use it so money down the drain and you may buy the app or the coupon and you would benefit thousands and thousands more than the actual value so this ambiguity where this this these discounts may come to a fact or not is not permissible i and i'm sharing this with you for the first time in 1982 that was a long time ago they came up with uh a similar scheme here in saudi arabia and i participated in it and i went at that year traveled overseas i think to the us or something like that and i booked a room in the specific hotel hilton hotel where it stated that it would give me 30 when i went there they said we don't have anything like this we don't have any agreement with that uh company so i took all the invoices and when i returned back i filed it to them and required a reimbursement and they never came back to me so most of these companies they have schemes they have um tricks down their sleeves even if they were legit again this transaction is not permissible due to the fact of ambiguity and not being uh legit muhammad basha says is it permissible to pray with our vest without shirt muhammad a man can pray as long as he is covering his shoulders without any problem there is no need to have a shirt underneath and allah knows best and finally the name is in tamil so i cannot read it does women need to uni to untie their hair during wudu for mess of the head for wiping over their head the answer is no if a woman has her hair in a bun and she wants to wipe she just does this and that that's it if she has her hair with a ribbon or something like a claw i don't know what what they call it um and she wipes over that there is no problem it it her hair should not be 100 exposed or in a certain fashion she's wearing it so that she can wipe over it it can be any type and allah azza knows best and this is all the time we have until we meet next monday obama"
