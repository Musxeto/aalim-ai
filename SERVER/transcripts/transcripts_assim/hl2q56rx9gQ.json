  "title": "Funeral prayer and Dua for someone who committed suicide | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "mmm blonde says can we pray funeral prayer for a person who committed suicide and can we pray for his mother Fela for his forgiveness and give charity on his behalf the answer in a nutshell is yes all Muslims can pray funeral prayer and ask Allah for forgiveness for someone who committed suicide but the only exception is for the Imam meaning that the Muslim ruler or the Muslim judge who deputizes him they are not allowed to lead the prayer and this is what the Prophet did erase a lot to some he did not lead the prayer over someone who committed suicide but he ordered everyone else to do so why didn't he do that so that people would know how grave this sin is to the extent that people would know and be notified that this person has committed suicide but everyone else can't pray it and ask Allah for forgiveness and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best this"
