  "transcript": "pillars of marriage what is meant by pillars of marriage every thing in Islam has pillars has conditions has mandatory things has voluntary things so Scholars segregates Scholars classify things in order to make things more easy so marriage as anything else as everything else has pillars what is the first pillar the existance of what of the man and woman is it a pillar huh it is how can you have marriage a brother comes to me sh I need to to make a marriage contract okay bah where is the wife doesn't exist but make one have to have both man and woman if someone comes and says I'd like to marry sister uh Khadijah said mallah okay where is she she she died two years ago they have to exist they have to be there then the second uh um pillar is the existence of the offer proposal from the guardian we always mix things up we always think that I as a man propose my uncle can you give me your daughter and marriage he says yes the Islamic way is the opposite the one who proposes is the guardian so he says my son I give you my daughter in marriage and the man says I accept her marriage and that is why it's a big issue in the books of f they say that it has to be initiated by the guardian and it has to be initiated As Told to you yesterday with two words only here the the the man making the contract does he have you say these words in Arabic or you say in in your language Arabic raise your hand okay and your language five and the rest are not married or they forgot or it's a nightmare she don't remind me don't remind me no you have to remember you have to okay probably it's a different school of thought however the majority say you have to have this initiated in this fashion the offer proposal has to be from the guardian which is called in Arabic so it's and it's always like this andab acceptance is from the groom I used to always consider a groom due to my English which is very bad I used to always say broom so the broom has to he has actually a broom he becomes at the end of the marriage abro his wife sweeps the floor with him anyhow alhamdulillah the acceptance has to be from the groom now the majority of schools of thought say it has to be like this to the extent that they say if it was not said in this way your marriage is void you have to repeat the marriage again Islam and by the way this is not the only thing that requires and what also requires andab transactions so if I go to the market and the man says I tell him how much is this he says one real so I said oh and he said I'll sell it to you I he has to say the hijab I what does hijab means no yes good in Arabic jawab means answer e means to obligate from from so what do you mean when I say I sell you this isab I'm making it mandatory if you accept it becomes mandatory so I say to him I sell you this for one real and he says I accept or I buy or okay it's done and this in transaction as stated before it's a word of tongue Islam it's sufficient for me to sell my car to mtas without having the car with me without him giving me the money if I say to him I sell you my car for a million rupees because he might say yes so then if I tell him 10,000 rupees he said yes and so he says I accept transaction is doneas 3 days later he said tell you what I I changed my mind he cannot change his mind as long as we have departed I went out and he went out transaction is finished he said sh I he I I didn't receive any car your problem you want to take the car take it now take it tomorrow the transaction has been done finalized likewise in marriage now the majority say it has to be in this format however Islam Tam say that this is not authentic it happens the transaction the marriage with whatever people agree upon so as long as it is acceptable and there is the consent it happens so if I go and someone says sell me this for one real and I say I accept now the hijab took place from the one buying and trying trans action is correct if the man says to me Uncle give me your daughter in marriage and I say I accept it's okay it takes place but just to be safe it should be the other way around you should always make it from the garden and the acceptance is from the groom among the conditions is that they must be free from obstacles that prevent them from marrying such as being Maham and uh okay existence okay now there are conditions these are not the pillars pillars we threw of what is meant by conditions a condition is something that is required in a contract in a form of worship if it is not present then the contract is void but if it is present the contract may happen and may it may not happen meaning I'll give you an example of conditions of prayer one of the conditions of prayer Evolution so if I say Allah I did not perform W is my prayer valid no if I go and perform W do I have to pray no I may pray and I may not so in Arabic they say that the definition of which means that a condition is what if not found then this means nothing is found if W is not there then prayer is not there it's not accepted but when found that does not mean something has to be found or not the possibility is there let's see one of the conditions of marriage that the uh absence of obstacles so obstacles such as being m one of the conditions I cannot marry my sister I cannot marry my a Aunt I cannot marry my daughter-in-law my mother-in-law so we have a number of mams seven from uh uh your blood and seven or so from Marriage as mentioned in Sur an so one of the obstacles is being a Maham and how is it possible to be a Maham either through being married to or from or being a a blood relative or from suckling if I have a sister if I have a woman that her and I were suckled by XY z a woman when we were Bel below two years of age so now we we're what we're brother and sister this is one of the uh obstacles that prevent me from getting married among the obstacles is is that I marry a woman in her how is that a woman was wot and two months after her husband died I propose to her she accepts I get married what's the ruling of this marriage it's void because it there is a clear obstacle which is that she is in her anything else I think this is inshallah clear any any questions regarding this condition okay the second condition is that we must identify the people getting married specifying the man and the woman with a description that makes it clear to the witnesses so if a man comes and says shikh I'd like to marry your daughter and I say I accept or I I tell him I give you my daughter in marriage and he said I accept and in the wedding night he doesn't know which daughter and I bring him any of my daughters for example is this acceptable no she there has to be a specific person or a specific description so I tell him if I have two daughters I give you my youngest daughter in marriage no problem because this is a description that you cannot say no you said the youngest this is the youngest I have youngest and oldest I don't have a third one they have only two so one and two it has to be specified and it has to be pointed out so that the witnesses if they were called into court and they say did you witness the marriage said yes who got married I don't know who's the father of the girl this is the father of the girl girl how many girls does he have did you see her no do you know her name no this is not allowed this is a condition that she is to be specified why so that there is no confusion happening even when you buy and sell there are three types of and because this is all contracts huh there are three types of or three reasons that a lot of transactions are Haram they're based on either or these are the three reasons main reasons that any transaction would be Haram what do we mean by RBA interest we don't have to go into this meaning that there is a margin of error of confusion so if I tell you this is Christian by the way H very expensive I sell you what's in my wallet for 5 rupees how many would say I'll buy everybody now is this permissible in Islam no because I can open it and there is nothing in it and I can open it and there's 100,000 rupees in it this is Haram this is likewise wise if I have a cow and I'm in a country other than India where I can sell cows you can sell cows here okay alhamdulillah so I have a cow and the cow is pregnant and I tell you I'll sell you what's in that cow's womb for for for 100 rupees permissible no why you don't know if it's a twin if it's alive if it's it's healthy you don't know what what the outcome and even if I'm happy with the 100 rupes once it gives birth to a healthy little cow how would I feel devastated because if I waited I could have sold it for 100,000 maybe or less or or more in marriage it's the same thing you go and you propose and they accept but you don't know which one you're marrying there is one that is beautiful and there is one that is blind and there is one that is insane so what will you have this is unknown to you and that is why it is Haram for you to cons uh to go through such a marriage without uh a description one of the conditions that is required the acceptance so if one of them did did not accept the marriage contract is okay providing they approve what do we mean by acceptance that the boy accepts the marriage sometimes you go and work in Canada or in America you come back home for vacation and the father says alhamdulillah I got you married last year to so and so what what kind of a a gift is this Halas she's your your wife take her no I did not give you the power of attorney and I don't accept her marriage the marriage then is void likewise it happens with the girls a lot so the father says to his to his daughter I gave you in marriage to our neighbor so and so can the father do this no the approval of the girl is essential and that is why the prophet Alat said that the Virgin is to be ordered and the non virgin is to be requested and asked and the comp and and the companions asked more and the prophet said the version acceptance is when she does not commment and Scholars say that the majority of virgins and and young girls when their father say w he uh so and so proposed to marry you so what do you think usually a virgin who's young and shy and bashful would look down and smile nowadays how much does he earn how does he look no I have to know does he have a car does he play sports does he enjoy traveling I enjoy I want one a lot of the versions are like this nowadays they're so outcoming and they ask questions that make the father blush well daughter I don't know I can't answer this questions so the prophet was talking about the norm where such girls are usually bashful and shy and they don't commment so that is why Scholars say their acceptance is by not saying anything this is approval but if she starts to to cry she doesn't say anything and she cries and cries and cries is this acceptance no the scholars say you have to look if some there's something wrong in what she is doing then definitely I will not pressure her but she has to approve of it and that is why at the time of the Prophet Alam a woman came to the prophet and said oh prophet of Allah my father gave me in marriage to his cousin or to his nephew to his nephew so that he would Elevate any humiliation because he's his nephew his blood and no one is giving him in marriage so he forced me to marry him the prophet said Alam he has no right to do that and you can if you wish reject the marriage it's void to that extent the woman said no I accept the marriage o prophet of Allah but I wanted my sisters to know their rights this is your right now the girls so many times I've mentioned this yesterday and I mention it today again so many times they are forced if the father does not fear Allah he insists and he's angry and he shout and he may beat her you have to marry this one man I've committed myself and I will not accept uh uh no for an answer you have to you make a must and she says I'm forced no you're not forced don't destroy your life do not obey your father but this is a form of worship I'm getting closer to Allah if I if I uh obey my father not in this if your father tells you sweep the floor sweep the floor a form of worship if he tells you do the dishes do the dishes if he tells you don't go to school do not go to school you have to obey him if he tells you marry someone you do not want do not marry him you will be destroying your life now this is a very sensitive question who among the sisters now is married against their will mashallah that's good or they're lying but inshah inshallah no nowadays alhamdulillah people are more educated they have more fear of Allah it's very rare it may be found in Saudi Arabia in villages in tribes that live in the desert where would the girl go no other alternative but nowadays alhamdulillah people are more educated they fear Allah more so alhamdulillah however this does not mean all forced marriages are bad because even if she was forced the father knows what's best for her and after a year or two she says father for such a man this happens same happened with AA she was married to the prophet when she wasam 60 years of age and the marriage was consumated when she was nine did she complain she was blessed with such a marriage because it was the right choice now I had a point in my mind I wanted to elaborate on but y it will come inshallah among the conditions to have two witnesses or more and the majority of schools of thought they say two two witnesses or more but Islam says that the two the two witnesses are not enough and what is supposed to take place is the Declaration because if I get married to a woman and I bring my cousin and my second cousin to be Witnesses and no one else knows is this appropriate or accepted no the prophet Ed the companions to announce the marriage with what is this D with a d which is a a musical instrument and all musical instruments in Islam are forbidden with the exception of do in three situations marriage Eid and recept receiving someone of dignitary of high status in Islam we receive them so not my brother who studies in America he came I play the doof no he has to be someone of importance in Islam like a king like a scholar like Etc but not any time dick or har so the issue of two witnesses is not intended that what is intended is to declare now someone may ask okay Sheikh I have one wife and if I marry a second wife she will kill me or she will make my life hell so what is the ruling if I go and marry someone and her family know and I declare it in her family but but my part of the family don't know anything about it and I live like this is this marriage correct come on don't be chickens is this marriage correct yes the Declaration is done when I say declaration I don't have to go to Russia and say alhamdulillah I got married I declare it to a group of people and they know but is it advisable no I have friends a lot and every three or four years I discover that they've been married for 5 years I don't know except after four or five years and when they announce it it would be very late it would be too late because the harm has been done his first wife is seeking divorce why it's not the marriage she says it's the Betrayal 5 years I don't know about him getting M being married and now he tells me therefore if you want to get married put everything on the table regardless of the consequences in Arabia we have not Arabia in Syria and and and and elsewhere they have Customs you know the the the old jilah uh way of thinking they say that the groom on the wedding night he brings a kitten and he holds the head of the kitten and the body of the kitten and he splits it in front of the wife so that she knows who the man is one of the friends he said I did this and she took the kitten and she did this in front of me and since then alhamdulillah we have no no problems so no if you want to do it some of the brothers and I'm not advocating my Maring a second wife but I'm not opposing it at all it not it is not a delicacy it is not something accessories that you buy and put in the it is a hell of responsibility I know and when people ask me what do you think it's the 5 minutes at the end of the night is five minutes is too long oh"
