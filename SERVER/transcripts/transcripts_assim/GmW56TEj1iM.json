  "transcript": "Qul hadhihi sabili adu'u ila Allah And it's Salam from the UK says, Can someone ask if I accidentally put the cross symbol instead of the plus sign on my copy book which a non-Muslim can see and I don't erase it as soon as possible? Am I a kafir? First of all, first of all, we have to identify that not every cross symbol symbolizes a cross that the Christians worship. So if this was not the case, we would have not used the plus sign in calculating things, we would not have used the first aid kit because it contains a cross symbol and so many other things. And therefore, a normal plus or a cross that does not signify anything does not refer to the Christian cross. Even if it does resemble the Christian cross where the vertical line is longer than the horizontal line. If you had this done by mistake on a book or anywhere else, unintentionally without the intention of worshipping it or glorifying it, there is no kufr in that. And I always tell the people if you go to your next door neighbor and he's a Christian and you give him a piece of paper that has ash hadu an la ilaha ilallah wa ash hadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh. And you ask him politely to read it and he does and he hands that paper back to you. Has he become a Muslim? The answer is of course not. Why? He just read the shahada because he did not have the conviction. If he did not have the conviction then he's not a Muslim. Likewise when you wrote or drew that symbol, did you have the conviction of glorifying it, praising it, worshipping it as a symbol of Christianity in this case there is no kufr in that and Allah knows best."
