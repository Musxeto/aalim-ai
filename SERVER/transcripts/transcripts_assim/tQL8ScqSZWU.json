  "title": "Can I trust a Hindu restaurant owner or waiter if he says the food is halal? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says i reside in india if the restaurant owner is hindu and he tells me that the food is halal can i eat it these things are related to a manner and when it comes to our religion we should only trust those who are following our religion a hindu or a disbeliever usually would be interested only in making money so if you go to a restaurant and you tell the customer the uh the waiter or the owner of the restaurant any question he would say yes of course regardless so if you ask him is this fish halal he said yes it was slaughtered which shows you that he knows nothing he just wants to sell so it is best to not take their word for it especially when it comes to your own integrity and your own religious commitment if they have a certificate that is from the government on and from the authorities to prove that it is halal or from the islamic center yes you can accept that and take their word for it"
