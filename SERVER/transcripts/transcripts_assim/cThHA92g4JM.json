Islam welcome to this new episode broadcasting live to you from jeda Saudi Arabia on the signs of the hour this is our third segment we spoke in the first two about the importance of the belief in the day of judgment and we spoke about the importance of studying this science the science of the hour and that it is part of the core of our religion because it is one of the pillars of Iman the belief in the day of judgment and because when jiel came to teach the Companions and the prophet Prophet wasam their religion he asked about four questions he asked about Islam Iman and then he asked about the hour and the signs of the hour and there this means that when the prophet tells usat wasam that this is jiel and he came to teach you your religion this tells us that it is part of our religion to study the signs of the hour however as usual Muslims are divided when it comes to any particular subject you have extremes and you have the middle path so when it comes to studying the signs of the hour what are the extremes on the far extreme to the right for example you will find people who had devoted their entire life to interpreting the signs of the hour collecting it looking into it studying in studying it making lectures making uh uh YouTube clips making whatever they can only on the signs of the hour as if nothing in Islam is important more than the signs of the hour and this led them to the far extreme in the sense that the signs of the hour are known they are limited because you're not going to reinvent the wheel the prophet told us about them and it there are lots of books specifying them classifying them with and and through the authentic hadiths of the Prophet Alam so no one could come and say that oops we missed one or two or there are a number of signs of the hour the prophet did not tell us this is un acceptable unfortunately those who devote their time only to speaking and studying the signs of the hour you would find them making things up in inverted commas you'd find them lying you'd find them giving wrong interpretations out of their own whims and desires they think they say that and I believe that this isn't this and based on what on nothing especially when it comes to talking about the D when it comes to talking about the M when it when it comes to talking about the next coming or the second coming of Jesus Christ peace be upon him they tend to fabricate a lot of things and whatever is black and white whatever is clear stated in the Hadith of the Prophet wasam about the they make this a metaph for and they start saying that no no no the Dalal is not a human being he's not a creature of Allah the deal is a symbol of the western civilization and they start showing you Dubai and Qatar and all these metropolitan cities with their high-risers and they say this is a theal and I've went through I've gone through two or three series of a long series talking about the and it is so ridiculous and they tend and they claim that they are based on the Quran and the Sunnah and it shows you things that are so pathetic and so funny that after like 5 10 minutes I turned the thing off and I did not continue because this is a waste of time however whenever I go to Europe I find people coming and asking me did you see these series on so and so about the and I say yeah I saw some of it oh sh it's wonderful it's about 50 Series it it's on YouTube and it's so and so it is based on nonsense it's not based on knowledge this is one of the signs of the day of judgment one of the signs of the hour what is it the prophet told usam that one of the signs of the hour is the Abduction of knowledge that the knowledge instead 20 years ago we had like a lot of Scholars spread around the Muslim world as they day by day we find them dying and the knowledge is being abducted in the sense that we don't have a lot of Scholars knowledgeable Scholars and the prophet told us that when the knowledge is abducted then ignorance prevails ignorance prevails and this is exactly what we're seeing we're seeing people talking about Islam saying this and that and they have no knowledge they have no knowledge structured Knowledge from the Quran and Sunnah they are articulate yes they speak fluently and nicely and in a in a way that is very eloquent yet this is what the prophet wasam also threatened us from he threatened us from every hypocrite who has a knowledgeable tongue this is the Hadith that the most thing that I fear for you is every hypocrite who has a knowledgeable tongue nowadays Open YouTube and punch any topic or name you find someone mashallah looks nice with a a nice background um high definition cameras and he talks rubbish complet complete rubbish one of them comes out and says the Dalal does not exist yes because he's the Dalal he's the Imposter he comes and says that mua AB sufyan may Allah be pleased with him and with his father was a corrupt companion he was this and he was and he slers the companions of the prophet alham and he claims to be a or he claims to be a knowledgeable person this guy is nothing he's no one he's he's speaking rubbish and and you should know this because if you read the Quran and you see how Allah values the companions of the prophet and when you read the Sunnah and you see how the prophet protected his companions and he threatened those who tried to insult or to degrade any of his companions he threatened them when you read this you know that this man is an impostor whether he's living in Vienna Austria or he's living in Moscow Russia it doesn't make a difference he's no one no one knows him so this is one of the signs of the hour when the people turn to PE to so-called Scholars D without verifying if they are knowledgeable or not and knowledge is not enough without verifying if they have the righteousness and the fear of Allah that prevents them from doing something that is Haram it is not enough for you to see someone on a TV screen or on a satellite channel speaking the Quran and Sun good scholar you have to look into his life you have to look into his character ask those around him does he lie does he cheat does he beat his wife does he uh uh um do things against Islam or not and then you may follow him so we have people on the far extreme saying that nothing is important in Islam except the signs of our and if you ask them about purity if you ask them about transactions if you ask them about anything that is related to Islam you don't find any concrete and solid answer based on the Quran and Sunnah because they've wasted their time studying this important branch of Islam but it is not what Allah will hold you responsible and accountable on the day of judgment Allah will not ask you didn't you know that this and that is part of the signs of the hour he will ask you didn't you know that you should have purified yourself before praying or you should have refrained from so and so before fasting on the far left You' find opposite people neglectful ignorant about the signs of the hour and they say this doesn't matter to us this does not add any value to us and the these people are also ignorant why because I've as stated yesterday and the day before that the prophet Alat wasam gave a lot of weight to the signs of the hour and in the Hadith we've mentioned yesterday that he the of that the prophet himself gave a whole Day sermon telling them about the tribulations that will come so from he would only stop to come down from the pulpit and pray and then go back and continue to tell them about the signs of the hour and about the tribulations that will face the Muslim umah so to neglect this important branch and this science is wrong to leave everything and just focus on the Dalal and the coming of Jesus Christ peace be upon Him Etc this is a a grave mistake as well so what is the middle path the middle path is to recognize this science to read what is mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah and to have knowledge of it and to act upon it in the sense that as mentioned before when you see a lot of tribulations a lot of calamities a lot of Injustice we have to admit all Muslim countries are under under huge amount of Injustice and oppression without any exceptions and this is a fact no one would lie to you and say oh alhamdulillah everything is fine everything is fine it's like putting your head in the sand no one would do this however do not feel depressed do not feel down and at the same time don't go to extremes and try to topple governments and uh spread chaos which would mean bloodshed and a lot of uh uh uh killings among the Muslims this is UN Islamic so what to do then well anticipate know that there will come a time where the Mahi for example will come and he will fill the Earth with Justice and uh uh fairness now this does not mean sit back and relax and don't do anything no try to change whatever oppression you see try to uplift the oppression try to educate people try to implement in Islam in your own life in your own house in your own community and by doing this you have fulfilled what Allah has commanded you with but feeling depressed and down means that you do not believe in the signs of the hour truly when you see Jerusalem when you see Al the AA mosque is under the Filthy Hands of the Jews so don't be feel feel depressed we know that there will will come a time that we will kick them out of there and not only that that even the stones even the Rocks would call the Muslims oh Muslim come there is a Jew hiding behind me and kill him this is our religion now am I preaching hatred no I'm not I'm just teaching you what is in the signs of the hour what will come in the future and this is the religion of Islam and no one can hide it and it is enough it's it's about time that people stand up and say this is our religion we believe in it we're proud and our religion is the religion of Peace our religion is the religion of equality and we have what proves it the history proves it our books the Quran and the Sunnah prove it so we don't have to go out of uh uh our way to defend ourselves and say oh no no we're not what you think this is our religion we've been killed the Muslims that is they've been killed in Palestine they've been tortured now they've been killed and tortured by the cafir in Syria in B Burma in Iraq in Afghanistan in fatani in menau and you name it just because they believe in Allah Asel just because they're Muslims and people say you have to control yourselves till when we control ourselves we do not do any form of aggression but you don't expect Muslims to be slapped on the uh right cheek and give you the left cheek they've been slapped right left and Center so it's about time they recognize that this is not going to go on forever Islam has been there for has been here for 15 centuries and it's going to be here until the day of judgment we know where we're headed we know our history and we know our future as well this is the difference between us and them they live for this life and they die for it and after death it's nothing dust to dust so they say as Muslims we know what we what what we are here for to to serve Allah Asel and to worship Him and we know where our destination Final Destination is either Paradise or hell but we know we know the future in the sense that we see things happening as the prophet told usat wasam because he is a prophet he gives prophecies and everything that he had said was 100% true something that nor the Christians or neither the Christian nor the Jews can prove no other religion can do this they claim that we have Miracles our Prophet brought Miracles where are your Miracles we don't see them they said it's here in the book in our uh uh sacred books okay okay it's words but our Prophet also brought Miracles as we will come to discuss inshallah when people ask us where are his M Miracles we tell them it the best and remaining miracle from today till the day of judgment is the Quran this is the word of Allah asael and no one can mimic it no one can copy it no one can reproduce it because it's the words of Allah and it had stayed as a challenge since the time of the Prophet about 1,400 years ago till today it is a challenge if you can produce something similar to it one chapter 10 verses one verse and up till today no one has succeeded because it is a book of perfection when you read other books you don't feel it you don't have this Faith coming into you when you read the Quran you get the Tranquility because it is from Allah it is unlike any other thing so the people in the midal path they believe in the signs of the hour and they study it and they acknowledge of it and they anticipate it's happening but they do not sit back and relax they keep on working learning about their religion preaching their religion practicing their religion trying to spread fairness and Justice wherever they are by spreading the word of Allah the almighty so we begin today to study the signs of the hour and as we mentioned before Scholars divide the signs of ours into two types minor and major so why is this division first of all the minor signs of the hour are are are so many and we can spend like couple of months every day talking about one or two of them there's so many and they happen over a long period of time while the last major signs they are about 10 and they happen in a very short span of time and they are not usual when you get a beast coming talking to the people what is this this is not usual when you get the sun rising from the West this is not usual but when we say that one of the signs of the hour is that people would have a lot of money to the extent that people are giving like $1,000 as Charity and and the poor people say thanks I don't need it I have I have enough so one of the this is not something that is strange this could happen it's imaginable but the signs of the hour the major signs of the hour are so bizarre and and strange and unlike anything that people have heard of so let us Focus now on the minor signs of the hour some of these signs had already taken place this is number one some of these signs is taking place and there is no problem in it reoccurring again in the future so it might have happened before but there is nothing wrong in it happening again the first sign or the first type has happened and it will not come back again come again the third type is the type that did not take place yet and these minor signs that did not take place yet share this that it did not happen with the major signs of the hour so let us go and and talk briefly about the signs that had taken place the first sign that the prophet told us about wasam is him being sent to mankind the prophet's message to mankind when the prophet Alam was revealed to this was one of the signs of the hour why because the prophet Alat wasam said in an authentic Hadith I was sent and the hour like this meaning him and the hour were like this so this one is his coming and this one is the hour so what is the difference you can hardly tell the difference it's this little the prophet saidat wasam my coming to you and the hour are like this you cannot tell the difference which means that it is so close the hour is so close that it is this long one would say when was the prophet sent the answer was about 14 30 uh for 1,430 years ago approximately give or take so one says this is about 14 centuries ago and you're telling me that his message his time and hour are like this how long is this going to take well Scholars say that the middle finger represents the span of this whole earth so how long is it between us from Adam peace be upon Him A Thousand Years definitely lot 10,000 years definitely more so no one knows exactly how long but we know that it was quite long so this is a time span of the whole of this universe until the day of judg judgement and this is when the prophet was sent so the prophet was sent at the end of time but relatively speaking the end of time from The Prophet's day till the end of time might be 2,000 years 3,000 years 5,000 years Allah only knows this is measured with the life of Humanity on Earth so that is why Scholars say it is impossible for anyone to detect or to estimate when the day of judgment will be one would ask did anybody among the Muslims did this yes we had great Scholars such asari uh uh also AI made a mistake and he estimated and he said that it would be on this year or in this century and all of this is unacceptable in Islam because if you go through the Quran tells us that this the hour is in Allah's hands no one knows when the hour is except Allah not even his angels no one knows when the day of judgment is except Allah the almighty therefore whenever you read something about a scholar coming and saying that it is probably in 2012 well we're in 2012 nothing happened as in uh uh these Central American historians said that we went to uh uh the Mayan's um pyramids and we calculated and we saw their precision and we believe that it's 2012 when 2012 was here and they made movies about it when 2012 was here said oh we made a miscalculation it's on this following year and believe me you'll keep on doing this and no one knows it I believe that like few years ago someone in America an evangelist or something said that the Doomsday is on this particular day I think it's 2012 People sold their uh uh uh property and sold their cars and sold everything and they're just waiting in the desert or waiting in the gardens waiting for day uh the Doomsday to come and nothing came so all of this is nonsense no one knows when the hour is but the prophet is telling usam that among the signs the minor signs of of the day of judgment or the approaching of the hour is that he would be sent to mankind so this happened and this took place the second sign is close to him being sent is his death the death of the Prophet Alat wasam is a sign of the approaching of the hour because there is no Prophet there is no messenger after the prophet of Allah Muhammad Abdullah peace and praise of Allah be upon him sallallahu alaihi wasallam an Malik said when the prophet migrated to Medina everything was lit by his entrance to Medina it was so bright it was So Glamorous when he came to Medina he brought life to the people and the day he died sallallahu alaih wasallam everything went dark and when we married the prophet alaih wasam we did not recognize our hearts we felt that we not the same people so the death of the Prophet Alat wasam was the hardest Calamity upon the Muslims at the time and it is still the hardest uh uh uh Calamity upon all Muslims and that is why the prophet saidat wasam whenever anyone of you is struck by Calamity he should remember his Calamity in my death so if I lose a son it's hard and I'm torn by it but when I remember that I've lost the prophet Alat wasam who is more beloved and valuable to me than all of my children then my Calamity would remain small compared to my Calamity in losing our prophet wasam and time sure flies I'm told that we have a short break uh so stay tuned after the break we will receive your phone calls inshallah so stay stay tuned FF our in and there is an American sister who's very active in da in Egypt told me personally that uh she traveled between Buddhism and Christianity and different sex and when she came to read the Quran she started by reading from right to left fat she said I swear once I finished it I fainted I could not believe myself that there is such book that people were so negligent and ignorant about this is that has to be the book of Allah subh and she said I accepted Islam simply after reading and knowing the first chapter seven verses seven verses the Arabic itself which is the Allah spoke the Quran so this is by itself is a medicine it is a word of a word of goes into the heart it was not created rather Allah spoke it out bless anden Ramadan Ramadan [Music] Ramadan can't do that because you do not know what to say to them something at least you raise up your hand and ask Allah oh Allah please give guidance to this brother of mine the importance of following Prophet Muhammad Sall alaihi wasallam to follow our Prophet Sall Ali wasallam means you must understand his Islam is a very easy religion simple religion so don't make religion difficult to yourself I believe this Hadi is very common to all of us but the beauty part of this Hadith number one it started by Omar I'm saying now again I'd like to share with the brother and sister to understand the beauty of the same of the [Music] companion oh my creat Allah ouram alikum and welcome welcome back now the phone lines are open uh Abu Muhammad your explanation of the sign of the hour regarding the extremes within which people react to these stories you know we have all the the information on the Internet is viral yes they there they'll tell you it's a thousand years they'll make some calculations make some projections in fact we have come to the extent of believing in these things to some extent but alhamd explanation has made it clearer aldah but what about these things that happen now can you make conclusions using them for example what is happening in Syria you say it is part of the you know the last hour and maybe the Mah is going to emerge and become the solution to the problem can you make such conclusions okay with what is happening in and I also have another question that has no relation with this topic regarding or M on every two do you have to make the okay and also the the DU after after do you have can you recite as many of them as possible for example you say and you say deping on how long the is standing mean you too Abu hammad's question was very uh uh good he's saying that the events happening and taking place in Syria the killing the massacres the uh uh um the awful things that the Syrian regime is doing now can we consider that this is part of the signs of the hour we don't have anything that specifically states that however it is probably an introduction because we know that the the signs of the hour the major ones would not have take place until the area has been liberated and it's becoming all Islamic and we know that at the end of the time the Sham which is um Syria Jordan Palestine and Lebanon this whole area will become a it is BL blessed uh area but it will be the source of all change in the whole world this is the place where Jesus will kill the Antichrist at Dalal and this is the place where he would descend and he finds the armies ready we know that there will be will come a battle where we will fight join forces with the Christians the the in in Arabic they're called the room and the room refer to the Christians and they not necessarily being Orthodox Christians or uh uh Catholic or Protestant any Christian would fall and in another narration the prophet describe them as they are the sons of yellow because the they mainly are blonde and and and yellow in color sort of so they're known to the Arabs to be B Al and also they are known to be the sons of Isaac and we know that Ibrahim peace be upon him had two sons isma and ish Isaac and Ishmael ishel the Arabs descended from him and the Muslims are the sons of Ishmael and the Jews and the Christians are descended from Isaac and they are the sons of Isaac so we know that there will be such feuds and battles and this we will come inshallah to discuss later on so can we uh um say that what's happening in Syria is part of the signs of the hour no and the answer is no we have yya from Saudi Arabia Ramadan Ramadan mu is is better than my question is when you're late to prayer and let's say the IM has already started let's say he's already finished reading F do we have to read it ourselves okay uh for the prayer to be counted and also my second question is that um when when after we read F and we're starting the next Surah when we're reading on our own uh do we have to say before the next Surah or just continue with from Saudi Arabia Ali asalam alikum she I just read across your notes about the sign of ours on your website okay okay and on that you have information given to us which states that will be from the family of true from the ascendant of the prophet yes from the descendants of the Prophet yeah from the descendants of the prophet's family and it says that it is going to be from the family of Fatima I don't know about the family to be specific because we know that the prophet had descendants from Fatima and also from Omar because Omar married one of Ali's daughters umum but okay go ahead what's your point okay so my question is how is then uh then the son of Fatima were kill how is it that m is going to be from her family okay I will answer your question Khadijah from UAE sister Khadijah Alum um I have a question on zakat okay um zakat is normally payable on cash that you have owned for a year true what if um you sell a property um just before radan which is the time that I normally pay my zakat and uh you get the cash however it's not received for a year so is zakat not payable on this cash and is the zakat only payable one year later um and what if I use the money or something or I buy another property and therefore Z is not payable one one question sister Khadijah the property that you sold was it meant for trading buying and selling buying and selling or you had it for a long time and now it's the time you wanted to sell it I had it for a long time and now was the time I wanted to sell it okay and and when you buy another property do you have the intention of investing in it or just you wanted a bigger property or something in a better location not with the intention of selling it with the intention of investing in it okay I will answer inshah your question uh going back to Abu Muhammad uh second question he is asking about the are we supposed to say the introduction supplication because the imams usually especially in they just say they don't give you time and this is wrong is not something that you just want to get rid of it get it over with and people recite the Quran like doing 60 M an per hour in a 20 M uh uh residential area they you're not supposed to do this you have to contemplate you have to ponder on the Quran especially the faat but nevertheless this is what we have may Allah make it easy for all of us so do I have to no you don't have to it's a Sunnah if you drop it there's nothing wrong in that and then he's saying that what about asking uh uh seeking Allah's Refugee from Shan saying after reciting the F so if I recite the F and then I want to to recite should I say the answer is no you've said at the very beginning of your prayer this is sufficient for the whole four ra or three raas or two raas or regardless of the number of raak as you're praying brother Abdullah from Nigeria brother Abdullah hello yes Raise Your Voice excuse me I'm having two question my question is about okay well we lost our brother Abdullah um y from Saudi Arabia was asking regarding the brother who comes late for Salat and the Imam has finished his fa and he's reciting another Surah does he have to recite the Surah the fa for himself to for his prayer to be valid this is an issue of dispute among Scholars Imam Al bukari says that you must recite the fat in every single Surah in every single Rak and the opposite is the scholars led by Abu hanifah who says you don't have to recite this the fat at allam may Allah have mercy on his soul came to a conclusion and to a middle opinion and he wrote a small booklet by the uh title of it's called and it's a small printed book you can buy it for a real or two and he concluded after Gathering all evidences from the Quran and Sunnah regarding this issue that in loud prayers such as and when the IM is praying loudly and you can hear that and every every body hears this reciting the faat is recommended it is neither obligatory nor uh uh it is forbidden for you to recite it it's in the middle if you can find gaps and read it such as when the Imam finishes the FAA and before he starts the uh following Surah in between you can read it this is good if you don't read it your prayer is valid and it's correct in silent Ras such as in the third ra of or the third and fourth fourth of or in and prayers when the IM is not reciting loud it is mandatory it is a pillar for you to recite the fat in each and every R if you don't recite it in silent Ras your ra is void invalid you have to make it up uh brother Abdullah from Nigeria again raise your voice I I cannot hear you yes I'm you I'm I'm I'm unable to understand you I cannot understand you Abdullah I well abdah your question is not clear I can't I can't understand you I'm asking I'm I'm I'm sorry I I cannot understand your question uh um okay so y's questions we have answered inshallah Ali's question regarding Al Mahi she has she's confused she's saying that she read that the Mahi has to be one of the descendants of the Prophet Alam and specifically the descendants of Fatima and she says that the the the sons of Fatima were executed and killed so how will this happen happen first of all only Al Ali was assassinated and killed in carala in Iraq when he went there and he was betrayed by the people of Iraq alhassan was not killed per se some say that he was poisoned some say not but both cases they had offsprings they had children and their children lived after them and they had grandchildren and they still exist until today so the proy of the Prophet Alam the offsprings of the Prophet was was not connect disconnected it continues to go on and Al Mahi would be one of his descend one of his uh descendants khad Emirates is stating that she had a property and she sold it so let's assume she sold it on the first of Ramadan now is it zable and I ask her did you have this property as a means of investment or you just had it long time ago and now it's time to sell she said it was not for investing and in this case alhamdulillah there is no zakat until next Ramadan so a whole year has to pass with this 1 million euros in your hand I hope it's 1 million and after a whole year then you have to give 2.5% now she says that I'm interested in buying another plot or another property so goad ahead and buy it but when you buy it what is your intention she says my intention is to invest because I believe that in that area two three months from now 2 3 years from now the the prices would double so I'd like to uh uh make a profit out of it in this case your intention has changed so now because you're investing you have to calculate next Ramadan a year from the day you sold your property and got the 1 million euro and on that date a year from now you have to estimate the value of your property so ask real estate agents how much does it co uh uh uh is it worth if I'm going to sell it now they tell you it's €1.5 million e in this case you have to give 2.5 on the 1.5 million and you do the process every single year uh sister Selma from Dubai yes yes shum uh I just want to ask because uh I I just uh recently converted in Islam like two or three years back and I'm I'm very much particular now with the prayer uh I just delivered a year ago and then now I'm alone at the house I cannot perform the prayer on time so is it acceptable for me to perform prayer even if it's late I cannot leave my son why why can't you leave your son like like like he's always uh he's just uh nine months old or 10 months old uh and he cannot be alone like he's always crying if he's alone so when for example it's mgrid time I cannot perform on time because it's he's always you know around me and he's crying okay I have to sometimes perform the prayer like uh before daa or uh like it's already like 10 or 15 minutes late I will answer your question insh yeah and also one more question uh shik uh I want to perform Teri but also the problem is there is no one I can leave my son with how can I perform Tera is it acceptable to to do it at home or should I go in the Masjid to perform it okay I'm going to ask a question after you hang up inshallah don't be mad if I am a little bit harsh on you okay okay sh thank you very much thank you Khadijah going back to her question the the there is a difference in buying a property someone has money and he doesn't know what to do with it so he says I'm going to buy two three plots and just leave them maybe in 5 10 20 years time I'm going to build something on them maybe I'm going to give it to the children I don't know I'm just going to buy property so this man is not displaying his property for selling and buying so he's not trading he's not investing he's just buying a plot for the future says that there is no zakat on this a person who buys something and immediately displays it or always checks on The Price Market the market price to see if it's 10 15 20% more than what he bought it so that he would sell it this guy is investing and a when a person is investing he has to give 2.5% on the to date uh value every single year so her plot was from that type uh the second plot and hence she has to pay zakat for that sister Salma is a new revert alhamdulillah and she gave birth about a year ago to a child may Allah bless the child and make him one of the imams of the Muslim and she's saying that she cannot pray on time so is it permissible for her to delay the prayer and I apologize in advance but you're spoiling your CH your child and this is harmful for him leave the child to cry for 10 15 minutes it's good for his lungs it makes him stronger but whenever the child does something you attend the child this is wrong you're corrupting your child without knowing so much love spoils the child so when now the child knows whenever he wants something he just cries because he knows that he'll be attended on the spot so my advice to you leave the child to cry as long as he in a safe environment he can move around without hurting himself leave him let him cry 15 minutes 20 minutes it's good for his health not that you're torturing the child he's spoiled you're doing this for his own good if this doesn't help if you're still so worried you can pray while carrying the child and there's no problem in that the prophet and this is an authentic Hadith in theah the prophet used to pray while carrying um and Umama is his grandchild from his uh daughter Zab may Allah be pleased with her so he was carrying her throughout the prayer and whenever he wanted to prostrate he he would Place her on the on the ground prostrate and when he stood up he picked her up again so you can do the same with your child whether it is uh during normal prayer or during Twi as for the for a sister the best thing for her to do is to pray on her own in the house if she has someone else to pray with female no problem but it is not like people think that we must go to the Masjid is a recommended Sunnah in the Masjid in congregation for men only so if a man comes up and says she the Imam in next in my locality prays for an hour only and I would like to pray for three hours in my home so I would leave I would say you're doing something that is wrong she I'm praying three hours and theam is praying half an hour say even though you're doing something wrong because is aah of the Prophet Alam he did this three nights or four nights with his companions in congregation so for and it is a Sunnah it is highly recommended for them to go to the Masjid for females for sisters it is recommended that they pray home but if they want and insist to pray in the Masjid this is their right they can easily go providing that they abide by the Sunnah meaning that they do not put they do not wear any perfumes and they do not put uh uh things that would lure men and attract men to them this is not permissible so for for you you can again pray in your home with your child without any problem insh uh among the signs excuse me that took place we mentioned that the death of the prophet and this was mentioned in a long Hadith when the companions were discussing and the prophet saw them talking and he asked them what are you talking about and they okay and uh he asked them what are you talking about and they say they are we are discussing the signs of the hour and he said to them count six before the hour is due and he mentioned among them my death and Subhan Allah any human being in the position of the Prophet Alam if we if he were an impostor sallallahu alaih wasallam he's not and uh uh uh if anyone were to be in the position of the Prophet Alam he would ask people to do things unlike what they do to the others yet he kept on emphasizing I am a human being I will die do not exaggerate in complimenting me to that extent others would ask people to kiss their hands or to kiss their foreheads to even prostrate to them mu jab when he came from Yen the minute he came in he prostrated to the prophet and the prophet held him angrily held him up and said what are you doing he said I came from the Christians and the Jews and this is what they do with with their dignitaries with their Elders they prostrate for them he said Subhan Allah do not prostrate to any living being if I were to order someone to prostrate to another human being I would have ordered the wife to prostrate to her husband but it is not permissible to proster it to anyone and why is the prophet doing thisam he's highlighting the importance of the husband and he's saying that if I were to command I would have told the wife to prostrate because of the rights of the husband are so great great and huge upon the wife that she should know his rights anyhow I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program tomorrow same time inshallah an hour from now we will begin to talk about one of the signs that took place and which is the splitting of the Moon and until we meet [Music] my fulfill our AIMS in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious oh my Creator oh Allah fulfill our a in life Allah forgive our sins yeah Allah oh Allah the most gracious oh Allah the most gracious y"
