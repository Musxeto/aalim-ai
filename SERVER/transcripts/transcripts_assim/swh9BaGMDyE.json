  "transcript": "munawwar says when two men are praying and a third person comes how should he join the congregation should he tap on the follower's shoulder and pull him back yes most likely when i come and i find two people praying i go to the one on the right who is the follower and i just tap him on the back that's it he immediately retreats and goes back if he doesn't because he doesn't know the ruling i grab his shirt from the back and pull him backwards and he will inevitably come back and i will stand next to him and he will understand insha'allah you"
