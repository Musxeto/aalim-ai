  "transcript": "uh sh I want to know like we know that uh Allah gave our Prophet sallahu alaihi wasallam a high status in Islam and he's beloved to Allah among every Prophet among every prophets that Allah sent before and um Allah didn't call him by his name directly in the Quran so my question is why Prophet is so beloved to Allah what's the reason behind that Allah loves whomever he wishes you cannot ask this to normal human beings let alone to Allah you cannot ask a person why do you love this person more than the other there is something that he sees in that person that makes him love him more than anyone else of course we know that our Prophet Alat is the perfect human being that Allah has created among all other of his cre ation and he bestowed upon Him characteristics of perfection in all aspects of life and this is why he deserved to be loved by Allah asael more than any uh human being that Allah has created and Allah Knows Best"
