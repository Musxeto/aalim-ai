  "transcript": "Anisha says my husband doesn't give me time he's always outside with his friends while I sit home catering to the kids every time this discussion comes up we end up fighting what should I do well Anisha I cannot answer you I have to listen to your husband because in any dispute there are two sides to parties and each one has his own side of the story I listen to you I feel you and I say that your husband if he as you had described has to be hanged hanged but when I listen to him I say that you should be standing in front of a firing squad and when you both said in front of me then the truth is revealed and I can tell that 50% of what you had said was a lie and the same goes you say that he's always with his friends and if I ask him he says whenever I work 10 to 12 hours a day and I'm tired I'm fed up of work I need to relax if I go home Oh what I hear is nagging I'm fed up your mother called and she picked a fight with me your kid did this you're your sister said something and she did not invite me all what I hear is nagging you never give us quality time take us out we need this we need that so in order to relax the moment I go back home I decide to go to my friends where we hang out and we chill we just you know play playstation whatever we do anything that is time-consuming and then go back home and sleep so probably it as they say it takes two to tango maybe you are a part of the problem now I'm not blaming you don't say that oh I am the victim and now I'm being accused of causing no no no I'm not not that at all I don't know your husband and I don't know you but I'm giving you an advice and if your husband comes and complains to me I'm gonna give him the same advice by saying that you don't fear Allah you should spend quality time with your wife you should appreciate that she is sitting the whole day between four walls catering for your kids and children cooking and cleaning and ironing and washing but it's not appropriate that I tell you this for you I tell you that it is your responsibility to take care of your husband to give him a safe haven to relax and to feel that he is home so that he's energized to go the following day to earn the food that you need on the table now as I said you have to learn how to communicate if this causes to whatever you discuss this with your husband to have a fight and to increase the level of tension in the house this means that you have a problem you've got to get this fixed either by sitting with him and communicating without pointing fingers because usually when you want to sit with your spouse to communicate and the moment you open your mouth and hear something negative is it but you did this and you did that and you said five days ago so-and-so and you you keep on bringing the dirty laundry and this is not positive therefore you have to look for a way to communicate if not possible go both of you and sit with a Muslim marriage counselor who would listen to both of you and try to give you a solid advice insha'Allah"
