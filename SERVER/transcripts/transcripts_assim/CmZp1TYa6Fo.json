  "title": "Committed Zina while the girl was in menses, can they get married after repentance? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yeah so uh but the sister says she has got her Menses at the time when she was fornicating on having intercourse with the boy once our period was over the couple were living together but they did not involve in any sexual relation anymore a few weeks later they repented so can they get married now this is a complicated question and it relates to fornication and Menses and the intention of marriage after repenting basically the scholars say that a marriage contract cannot be conducted until repentance takes place and by repentance they say she has to have her monthly period to ensure that she is not pregnant and the repentance is there and they can get married so if they had Allah um sexual relationship while in her Menses then we are certain that there is no pregnancy taking place because this is impossible and hence if after two weeks they uh repented and they want to get married I believe that they can do so and Allah Knows Best"
