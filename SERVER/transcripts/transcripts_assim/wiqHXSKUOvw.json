  "transcript": "Daniel from Russia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is I work in a city which is far from the place I live approximately 60 kilometers so should I pray Qasr prayer which is a prayer of travel? No you should not because this distance in most countries is not considered to be a traveling distance most people consider 60, 70, 80 kilometers to be within the suburbs of the city itself and this is why we the people of Jeddah when we go to Mecca which is about 85 maybe 90 kilometers at times we never pray Qasr or combined Salat because we consider them to be part of each other and it's not traveling we don't bid our families farewell when we go there and Allah knows best"
