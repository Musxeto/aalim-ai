  "transcript": "so [Questioner] says is it permissibleÂ \nin Islam to kiss your parents feet kissing a person's feet is notÂ \nsomething usual especially in our timesÂ Â  however in order to look into a specific matterÂ \nto determine whether it is permissible or not weÂ Â  have to go back and cross-examine it with theÂ \nQuran the Sunnah and we will find that in theÂ Â  Sunnah it was reported as an incident or twoÂ \nwhere the Jews kissed the feet of the ProphetÂ Â  Allah in one incident and some of the companionsÂ \nmay have kissed the feet of the Prophet AllahÂ Â  though he did not recommend it or evenÂ \nliked it that is why Scholars concludedÂ Â  from these evidences that it is permissible toÂ \nkiss the hands of others and in some cases theÂ Â  feet of others providing that there are a numberÂ \nof conditions fulfilled such as that this personÂ Â  is worthy of kissing his hand and his feet suchÂ \nas in the case of parents Scholars of Islam EtcÂ Â  secondly that the person you'reÂ \ndoing this to does not want itÂ Â  some of those dignitaries or rich people orÂ \ninfluential people they do this to othersÂ Â  to kiss their hands you know you don'tÂ \ndo this at all this is not permissibleÂ Â  someone who wants it don't give it toÂ \nhim also this should not be a habitÂ Â  meaning that once they've lived every blue moonÂ \nyeah this is fine the parents kissing their feetÂ Â  massaging their feet Etc this is normal becauseÂ \nthey have lots of Rights over us and it's a formÂ Â  of showing your humility uh to them so inshallahÂ \nthere's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session withÂ \nme go to my website and you will find counselingÂ Â  sessions and apply for one if you can afford itÂ \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitledÂ Â  for one free session and this is for everybodyÂ \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannotÂ Â  afford it because they're poor I'll give themÂ \none free session without a problem a full halfÂ Â  an hour so come to me and let's speak aboutÂ \nit inshallah within the following two daysÂ Â  or three days I will uh try and seek Allah'sÂ \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
