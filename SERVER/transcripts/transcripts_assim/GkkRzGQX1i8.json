  "transcript": "Emmett says does reciting the first ten hours of Surat al-kahf suffice for Friday we have two issues the first issue is reciting the surah Surat al-kahf chapter 18 as a whole during Friday which the majority of scholars say that this is authentic Sharyl Albania has authenticated the hadith while some scholars said that all the hadith that talk about reciting surah the calf during a Friday are not authentic but we tend to stick with the majority especially with something that the majority of Muslims of scholars since long long time ago always recommended reciting this surah on a Friday the second issue is reciting ten ayahs in the beginning or from the end and from the beginning is most likely and memorizing them doing so from Surat al-kahf the first and ayahs there is a hadith that it protects an individual who memorizes them from the trial of the Antichrist so if you memorize them insha'Allah you will not be afflicted by the trial of the Antichrist and you will not witness him and it is a serious issue there is no prophet of allah who has not warned his people from the trial of the Antichrist it's the biggest trial humanity had will ever witness and a lot of believers would flip and change into disbelievers because they would see things that their minds could not tolerate and comprehend and they would think that this is God himself llama to believe therefore this is the difference between the memorizing ten verses of surah calf and reciting the whole surah and Allah social knows best"
