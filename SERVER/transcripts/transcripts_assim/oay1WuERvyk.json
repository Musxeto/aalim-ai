  "transcript": "Rashida from the UK. I have a question please. Yes. I've just converted to Muslim. I've got family, they're still Christian. And I don't know if this is a thing that I've passed from the family religion. And another thing, I yearn to do Hajj a lot. I would have loved to do Hajj, however it's not Hajj time and I am preparing to go to Umrah. Am I doing the right thing? Rashida, I did not get your first question. You have reverted to Islam and your family are stillâ€¦ They're still Christian. Okay, so what's the problem? And I'm practicing Islam now. Okay, what's the problem? I don't know if that is a thing, not doing the religion of the husband. Oh, your husband is still a Christian? Yes. Okay, first of all, Alhamdulillah Azza wa Jal, that Allah the Almighty has saved you from darkness into the light and from Kufr into Islam. This by itself would save you from eternity in hellfire and will award you a seat in paradise if you manage to die on Islam and not change your ways. Now, when you accept Islam, you as a rule of thumb cannot be with a non-Muslim husband. So you have to give him da'wah, you have to call him to Islam, and you have to tell him, honey, now I have accepted Islam, in my religion, in my belief, I cannot be with a non-Muslim husband. So we have a choice. We are at the fork of the road. Either you accept Islam and we can continue to live as man and wife and enjoy this beautiful religion together and continue to live our lives as a couple and end up in paradise as a couple as well, with the grace of Allah. If you don't want to accept Islam, I have no other choice but to leave you and leave my life behind because the moment I accepted Islam, this is a full-life transformation. I have submitted my will to the Almighty, not to human beings, not to man-made laws. So whatever Allah wants me to do, I will do it. And Allah ordered me in the Quran and in the Sunnah, and this is a consensus of all Muslims, scholars and non-scholars, that a Muslim woman cannot be married to a non-Muslim. So you have the choice. And give him a few days to think it over. No intimacy, none whatsoever. It's totally prohibited for you because he's not Muslim. If he accepts Islam, alhamdulillah, it's a win-win situation and may Allah azza wa jal grant you the reward of him accepting Islam. But if he is defiant and adamant not to change his religion, then there is no other choice for you but to leave him on immediate impact and effect and move on with your life. And I hope this answers your question."
