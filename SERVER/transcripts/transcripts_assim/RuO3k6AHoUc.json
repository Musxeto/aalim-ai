  "transcript": "and on to my question she I'd like to hear your views and your advice um to University students um in terms of uh how can we balance our faith and keeping our IM man with some of the things we are taught um in in the University I'm happy you touched on atheism as well because some of the debates we have obviously um touch on the specific aspects and uh being a law student as well there's other things that touch on that um may not necessarily be relevant in Islam some of them being riba for example and some of the things we learn in criminal law for example so I'd like to hear what is your advice and your take on this okay now when we address such problems we have to adhere to the fact that we do not live in a bubble unfortunately we do not live in Utopia the time of the Prophet Alat wasam and the companions is not existing at the moment this is what we're striving to reach and we're doing our level best to come as close as possible but it is not applicable at this moment so maybe we can achieve 40% 70% y if we can reach 100% then this is inshallah the optimum but realistically speaking let's come down to earth this is not the fact so we cannot say to people okay what you're studying in university is wrong leave okay I have to work oh there is free mixing leave uh I'll be a janitor oh you have to clean beer bottle beer bottles and and whiskey Leaf what should I do I don't know no this is not realistic we have to look and assess the issue and do our level best in means that would Allah so if I'm studying law now we know that Muslims must not Implement and apply manmade laws because as per Ayah 44 45 and 47 in so I cannot legislate anything that goes against the this is but what should I do the Muslims need lawyers to take their rights from companies that have corrupted uh their businesses stolen their money cheated cheated on them um victims need Advocates to uh call the courts to their cases and get their Justice done so as long as you are working within the parameters of Shar to the best of your ability you're in good hands the moment you start to defend criminals you know he's a criminal but you know there are loopholes in the system I can fix it you have to pay a little bit more you are a criminal as well the more the moment you implement or legislate like a lawyer or a judge or a legislator Haram law when they come and say okay we have this law that selling alcohol is permitted for those who are above 18 years of age so okay what do you mean okay even if it is above 60 years of age it is not permissible for you even to vote on such a legislation unless you can make a difference of banning it according to Islam so this is what you should do likewise when you study biology and they teach you about Darwinism and evolution I know this is kufur but I have to be uh uh smart I I need to do this course in order to become a biology teacher or to be a scientist I cannot say Haram Haram Haram and leave and let everything go to the disbelievers and to those who are not as efficient and as sincere as I am so you have to look within the boundaries now alhamdulillah you have Scholars that you can come to and consult in your country and they would inshallah guide you more I don't know if this answers your question or not"
