  "title": "How to pray when suffering from bleeding for over 15 days? (Istihadah) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the second um question is if a woman were to have istahada what is istihada we know hayd is the monthly cycle menstruation but what is istihada so a woman is either pure she doesn't have the monthly cycle she prays she fasts and her husband can be intimate with her or she has the monthly cycle and she is not allowed to pray nor to fast nor to have sexual intercourse with her husband or she is in between and what is in between when she has discharge that is continuous but we classified it as not being her monthly cycle so for example a woman who has bleeding continuously after the fourteenth day we say okay this is monthly period whatever exceeds that would be istihab and she has to perform russell for the monthly period that she had the past 14 days she has to perform wudu and clean herself and pray and she has to do the cleaning changing of impurity in her clothes and the wudu for every prayer once the prayer time is due so she prayed asar she can still recite the quran make tawaf do whatever she wants once the sun sets it's maghrib time she has to clean herself perform wudu and pray from maghreb till isha time she doesn't have to renew her wudu or change her nappies or whatever issue time is due she has to do the same process you"
