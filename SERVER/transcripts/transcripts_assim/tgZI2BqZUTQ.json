  "title": "I did not go to High School but forged papers to go to University, is my degree halal or haram?",
  "transcript": "We have Abdul Qadir from UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah. Sheikh, when I was young, my father told me that high school is not that important. So he told me to skip it and make a fake certificate. So I did what he said and went to university. Now I finished university and I realized that I made a mistake. So, I'm wondering that if I walk with that degree of university, that my income will be halal or haram. How can you help me Sheikh? I can't help you. Unfortunately, I cannot help you. Akhi, you forged a high school certificate, which without, they would not have accepted you in the university. I don't care if you got a 4.0 GPA average in your university, because it was based on haram and falsehood and cheating. So even if you graduated from your university, I believe that working with a university degree and the money earned is haram, because you're cheating the people. The only way I can see it rectified is that you do your high school all over again, and get it legalized and accepted. Or you go to the authorities and confess to them of your crime and see what can be fixed. And Allah knows best."
