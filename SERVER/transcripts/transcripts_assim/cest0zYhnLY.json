  "transcript": "Leila says is it permissible to celebrate shabih Bharat now that 15 of Japan is coming please throw some light on this it is an innovation abida sure I'm gonna change the channel everything you're asked about you to bida bida everything we asked you about is an innovation what is this don't you have some leniency everything is bida your iPad is a bidder wearing glasses is a bidder okay I'm gonna cool down I'm not gonna get angry with you my friend you have to understand that beta is related to religion so when someone asks me what's your role in on birthdays I wouldn't say it's a bidder because I'm not getting closer to Allah it's not a form of worship I would say it's Haram because it's an imitation of the disbelievers customs but wearing a watch we're using an iPad drinking in a coffee mug wearing glasses driving a car flying in an airplane these are not religious practices of other religions and it is not something innovated to get closer to allah azza wajal and it's not part of the customs so don't mix apples with oranges when we come to the issue of celebrating the 15th of Shaban okay what is your intention of celebrating says to get closer to allah i do salat to attesa beer i do a lot of dhikr I do night prayer I do this I do that okay hold your horses did the Prophet ever did such a thing did the Prophet ever do such a thing I just know we don't have any authentic reports had the Companions done any similar things never so are you innovating or not yeah yeah but this is a good bid ah so something the Prophet did not do i sir and the companions Miller president them did not do and Allah told us at the time of the Prophet Alma Akmal to accompany them come today I've completed your religion and perfected it so you come and say yeah the Prophet didn't do it but it's a good bid ah give me a break this is definitely unacceptable none whatsoever so celebrating shaadi Bharat or laylatul miraj on the 27th of Rajab which was a couple of weeks ago all of these are innovations not because I don't want you to celebrate who cares they celebrate if you wish whatever you want I'm not gonna lose anything from my pocket but you're asking me about ruling according to the Quran and as soon and I'm presenting it to you do you think that I don't want you to pray if you say sure I'd like to pray three hours night prayer I would say mmm bidam no go ahead pray for pray five no problem if you say I'd like to recite the Quran like three hours a day be my guest we encourage people to give lots in charity to do thicker to recite the Quran to pray voluntary too fast voluntary days but when it comes to issues that take you up to take you out of the straight path they will say bidder so no where are we coming from put yourselves in our shoes the size might be differ but understand that we do not want to stop people from doing good we want them to do the good things according to the Sunnah not according to their whims and desires and to what site Satan is telling them to do"
