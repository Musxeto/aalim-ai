  "transcript": "Rahim hamdulillahi rabbil alameen also leave us a limo Allen Muhammad and El Alamein novena Mohammad Anwar and he Mesabi were many today we had the worst innervation iriyama dean am Abbado assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we stopped short last time we met as you are all aware that we are going through the chapter that deals with transactions so we talked about hiring we talked about partnership we talked about pawning or Rihan among other things and we have two items to conclude this chapter that deals with financial transactions and afterwards afterwards in sha allah we will begin with the chapter that deals with marital issues such as marriage the etiquettes of it how it's done divorce holder read naka all of these things pertaining to what people need to learn and know before getting married and definitely before separating and getting a divorce so the first item on our plate today and I hope you guys are fasting as I am is borrowing and in Arabic this is known as a load and borrowing is to borrow something so that you can use it for a while and then return it as it is or as it was intact on the designated time for returning it and this is done free of charge and this is why they call it total xn o SN meaning that those doing it they're doing it for the sake of Allah soldier for the sake of being kind to one another it's like what I'm telling you actually can you open the door for me I'm carrying something that is a little bit heavy you would definitely do that no one would say ok how much are you gonna pay me so that I opened the door for you excuse me nobody does this so although do as our opponent exam this is something that people do to be kind to one another and when it comes to borrowing there are pillars so there's the lender there is the borrower and there is also what is being borrowed so for us for the lender he has to be what is described in fact as JA is the saw proof and there is a difference between ji-su octa saga and Jesu at abattoir so what's the difference between those in the first jettison roof he's a person authorized to deal with the money under his control or with the wealth under his control but not to give it out or to give it away while J is suitable or is a person who's permitted to give and donate in charity or as a gift so if for example I'm the guardian of orphans I have nephews of mine and nieces the father died they are orphans I'm in charge of their wealth what my brother left I'm in charge of it so can I sell and buy yes I can sell and buy not for my own benefit rather for the benefit of the wealth so he left a building that is quite old and the area nobody is interested of renting it except low-class people so i sell it if i could a good price for it and i buy something new in a better residential area where the income would double am i authorized to do this definitely then I am sure is the sum of I am authorized to deal but when it comes to lending money someone comes a sense chef I need five hundred thousand euros to go into an investment and I'll return it to you in a year time and it's a good investment the man is my friend he wants a loan so I take from my nephews and nieces money and give it to him instead of it sitting idle in the bank no this is Harlem this is not permissible why I'm the Guardian you're the Guardian to deal in what is authorized for you but you do not have the authority to give something away and lending money to someone is like giving it away you're not sure it's gonna come back to you so in this case it is hard for you so condition number one the lender has to be jesu at a bar or it should be your own money you're entitled to donate it to give it away to lend it to someone it's your own money nobody will hold you accountable for that and of course among the other conditions as mentioned in the first condition that the borrower and the person lending the article should be qualified so they should all be qualified in the sense that they are adult sane rational and capable of dealing with their money so the issue of borrowing is not an easy issue that anyone could do there are conditions for it there are sets of rules governing edge and the books of truck talked about this in details which we don't have the opportunity to do but lending is something that is praised in Islam and a lot of us fail to see how great investment lending money is there is an authentic hadith where the Prophet said alayhi salat wa sallam lending an amount of silver meaning money is equivalent to giving charity of half of it so I have 1000 euros someone asks me for a loan I give it to him and we have the set date of returning this loan of a month after one month he comes back and gives me the money so the thousand euros are in my possession the Prophet tells us as some 500 of those are registered at the side of Allah as charity charity and I have the money back in my hands yes now I gave him a set date of a month the hadith goes on to say if the other if the second appointment was not fulfilled meaning after a month he came and back and said well I'm sorry the thousand euros I don't have money at the moment can you give me another two weeks and I'll give it back to your Charla - surely no problem the Prophet says is awesome for every day of these two weeks the new extension Allah would register for me the charity of a thousand euros per day so meaning when I give him an extension of two weeks this is equivalent to 1400 euros know that we refresh a fourteen thousand euros charity and after two weeks I get the money in my hand Wow what return of investment can we get where can we get something like this in this world not only that in another hadith the Prophet says as after these this extension so one month he could not pay then acts for two weeks more and he could not deliver so he came more like I don't have money can you just spare me some time and I will hopefully try to gather it for you and I said no problem take your time the Prophet says our son for every day every single day after the second extension the Prophet says an assistant you are awarded double the amount so first you have 500 euros for one month when he asked for another extension of two weeks you have a thousand euros a day as charity for two weeks so that's 14000 for the 2 weeks and 500 for the first month now for every day extended him that he does not deliver this is $2,000 euros for you what line you will never find anything that is this profitable in this world to invest and the beautiful thing is at the end of the day you will get your money back and it's in your bank account so lending is something that Islam recommends it's something that is helen allah azza wajal says and cooperate in righteousness and piety in surah al-maida chapter 5 so what's on our door a little bit early with taqwa this is part of cooperation I need money to pay something that I have need for and I need someone to lend me I don't have it cash on me and this was done by the Prophet Isis and the Prophet borrowed ones from Safwan Divino May some shields so that the Muslims would fight and use when they went to the battle of hunayn in pipe so the Prophet Allison borrowed that from him he also borrowed a horse from Abu Talha he borrowed a SAR of barley from a Jew as we mentioned last class and he gave the Jew his own shield as a pawn so the issue of lending and borrowing is an issue that is well known and well established in Islam and when we come to the conditions of borrowing so the first condition is mentioned clearly the borrower and the person lending the article should be qualified and we talked about that the second condition the borrowed article should be usable for lawful purposes so this is something that most people should know by now that you cannot lend something that is to be used in Harlem so if someone says to you Ali there is a beautiful movie I'd like to watch and my DVD is broken so can I borrow your DVD says yeah sure no problem nope such borrowing is Harlem it's sinful for you to give such a loan or something to be borrowed if someone says I like your golden cups which you keep for decoration and I need one to drink my milk in and you know that this is haram someone wants to borrow your dog keeping a dog is haram so taking it and borrowing it is haram so the product that you are going to lend people must be halal in its nature and halal in its use so you can lend someone a TV screen it can be used in Holland can be used Harlem but if he tells you that it's gonna use it for Haram then definitely this is not permissible for you to give it to him and the borrowed article should remain intact after using so being a borrowed article when you get it back it has to be intact and things and items are divided in into two types we call it myth Li which means that it is almost identical or a replica and creamy or theame which means that the value and the cost of it so if we have a kilogram of dates and the type of dates is specified we have a type known as soup curry so if I borrow from you one kilogram of dates so that I'll bring it back to you next week do you think I'm gonna take this dates and put it in the cupboard or in the fridge or am I gonna consume it definitely gonna consume it so when I return the dates back to you you're not gonna say ah there's a specific date that I had a mark on where is it no you get something similar to it if I borrow a thousand euros from you and I return it back to you it is neatly so these are thousand euros yeah but I gave you my thousand euros in hundreds why are you bringing back intense it doesn't matter a difference because it's a thousand and a thousand and there is something known at SPME meaning if I borrow your let's say mobile and the mobile is busted it's broken it's lost it's damaged do you insist on having the identical phone or the cost of it so insurance cars insurance companies when you damage your car beyond repair they will not buy you a similar car same model a closing shape they will give you the cost of your car according to its condition and according to the model or the year so these are the two things that scholars differentiate if you borrow food the product is consumable how are you going to return it back there has to be something middling of it so if it's a 5 kilograms of wheat you will bring the same standard or level or quality of wheat in 5 kilograms as such and this is extremely important because quantifying and describing the things that you have borrowed is important so that you we know that you can return it the example ok can I borrow one of your mobiles - sure go in the drawer there are 10 of them pick one so I go and pick one and leave and I lose it so I come back to him and said well I lost your mobile so said ok what makeup did you lose I don't know I didn't see it so I don't know even what what would you took no this is too ambiguous you have to have knowledge of the product being lent so and the quantity the weight the description so that when you return it it would be known by its description and of course it is highly recommended that you either have two witnesses or you have it written down Allah mentioned in the longest ayah of surah al-baqarah the ayah of the debt of the loan which indicates that this is something that has great significance in Islam o you who believe whenever you borrow something registered so it is highly recommended and I don't say it's mandatory though the instruction is an order because the following ayah stipulates that if one of you trust the other then it's okay but generally speaking it is not recommended to have a loan without a proof a document written or the presence of two male witnesses people who get people get old and sometimes people are crooks and thieves and they will take your money and they will challenge you to prove to bring your proof which you don't have so you will feel the pain of being betrayed and this is why Islam says better safe than sorry get it written down however a lot of the people are offended when you tell them can you please write a document stating that you borrowed $10,000 from me ja you don't trust me you want me to write something I'm offended for such people who pretend to be offended you can kick them out of the door because they are thieves those who refuse to execute what allah azzawajal has told us in the Quran and pretend to be offended most likely most likely they will betray you and this is why there is a hadith that shekel Albani authenticated and other scholars regarded it as weak which says that there are three people whom allah azza wajal would not answer their door one of them is a person who had a bad rude arrogant wife the second and he did not divorce her the second one is someone who had an irrational person under his control and he gave him his wealth and he wasted it and the third one is a person who lent someone money and did not take any proof against that person and you know what such a person would do so the Prophet says that these first people three people Allah will not answer the drop and this was a shock for a lot because said why if I am patient and tolerating my rude and arrogant wife Allah would reward me for not answering my door the scholars say no this is related to the door you make against that person so yes you're tolerant your patient with such a wife and every night you they make dua may Allah curse or may Allah take her life may Allah do this to Allah will not respond to draw because you had the remedy for such problems is by divorcing her if all roads are closed and there is no way of reconciliation or trying to fix her attitude the and he did not then Allah would not answer your dua when you do dua against her likewise the irrational man who wasted your money and likewise the man who borrowed and did not return your money when you make dua against them it's your fault why didn't you take proof when he borrowed money from me so Allah would not respond to your drug against him but again scott some scholars say that this hadith is not authentic analyzation knows best also one of the things that it is important for us to know is that all abou Hanlin one of a Gela when I give someone money this is kindness of me I've lent him money because I am kind I'm a good Muslim however if I gave him an ultimatum to return the money in a month time this is not binding for me as a lender because the money is mine and let's assume I gave you ten thousand euros and you went and we agreed that you would return it in a month time only to be surprised after one week that I'm calling you and saying hey I need the $10,000 yours today do I have the right to do this that's according to the majority of scholars is yes because this is my hard-earned money and I was doing you a favor I thought that I could do without this money for a month but all of a sudden something important came up I have to pay the children's school fees I did not put that in mind so I'm asking for my money you have no right in saying that tough luck man I have like three weeks before I have to and I'm obliged to give you the money no this is wrong you're obliged to give them the money immediately as it is his and there are so many other topics and issues but landlord Sharla we will stop here or end here now we go to the second point which is endowment in Arabic endowment means what and what means to hold all types of usage of a property and make it a source of benefit and income throughout the rest of its existence which means that this property cannot be sold cannot be gifted and cannot be inherited and this is something that is highly recommended in Islam in the past one of the most major source of income to the Muslims were endowments at present the greatest source of income to the Vatican is endowment this small it's not even a city small village or town yet they have so much wealth that is beyond imagination I remember in 1991 I was in a visit to a refugee camp in Zagreb Croatia and in Ljubljana in Slovenia and the Islamic teacher in the refugee camp was telling me that last week they had three airplanes 747 cargo planes with priests and it was filled with the Bible in the language of the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina and in Croatian translated with lots of food candy and toys for the children and I said how could they do this and she said that this is from the Vatican and they have hundreds and thousands of similar dispatches throughout the whole world preaching their own religion their own falsehood and I said Spinola and what are the Muslims doing where are the Muslims financing all what I had with me I remember at the time was like maybe $4,000 and I bought with a cartons of banana and detergents soap because this is what they need it for their laundry and few other silly things that was gone in like seconds so endowment empowers the Muslims because it gives them a source of income not related to the government for example if there is a an Islamic satellite channel like CUDA TV that TV piece TV and one rich person comes and says listen this shopping mall is all endowments for a larger and whatever revenue comes goes to propagating Islam do you think that the Islamic channel would be begging people for money unable to produce programs that would benefit the whole Ummah of course not they would have a lot of the possibilities without end to propagate islam and you can say that about circles of dyfodol or an about publishing islamic books about building orphanages about building houses to take in abused women domestic violence victims etc the sky's the limit the biggest problem is the Muslims are not putting any effort they're not giving any money except a few and those few would usually be selfish so if I'm a rich person I have a lot of money I would probably build buildings and instruct that the revenue go all to my children after my death which is good keeping your children rich it's good what did I do for the sake of Islam I don't know haha may Allah be pleased with him he said that when the prophet Isaiah saw it was salam gave us our share from high bar after the conquest of Hiva the Prophet gave us the Muslims shares and plots of lands and hyper was a very very rich village with lots of farms that was so rich in its agricultural products so I came to the Prophet and is as I said o prophet of Allah I have this land of hiber which is the most valuable property I have ever owned what do you order me to do with it because it's so dear to my heart it's not a collectors items this is a reversed ideas of things so if I have something I love I would keep it until I die though I'm not using it why are not using it because I love it so the Companions were the opposite if they loved something they expressed their greater love to Allah by donating it for the sake of Allah so how much came I said this is my land and I cherish it and it's very precious to my heart tell me what should I do with it I want to do something that pleases Allah so the Prophet I saw some says said to him you may wish to retain the principle and dedicate the yield for charity so the revenue you get from it is to be given to charity so Romani Allah be pleased with him are stipulated that the land itself would never be sold given as a gift or possessed by inheritance and this is the key hadith that governs the issues of what now the famous hadith we all know by heart and the terminology of esada at algeria when the son of Adam dies all his deeds come to an end except in three ways one a continuous act of charity this is part of endowment so before I died I asked the brothers in Kenya to go to a poor area and dig a well and I paid for it so the villagers drink from that well it would last maybe hundred years this is ongoing charity while I'm on my in my grave that's it someone comes in for example sponsors my weekly programme on who the channel or on that channel its Islam Q&A and they pay for it for a whole year and people all over the world watch these questions and answers on YouTube on Facebook and so on so the money they gave through the channel not to the Sheikh but the channel managed to publish it they are in their graves and their good deeds meter is clicking this is what endowment is so is there any rulings yes endowments has the rulings number one the one who dictates or dedicate the endowment has to be saying adult rationale meaning that he must be qualified to make such a decision if a child who inherited millions says I think that highriser I will make it for a charity work this is not acceptable because he's not an adult and he's not rational so these qualifications must be fulfilled secondly the property endowment in doubt must be something that is used for a long time for example you cannot make a an eraser an elastic eraser as endowment because after a couple of days it's gone you cannot put food or slaughter a camel and say this is an endowment it will be consumed in a few minutes so it has to be something that would last for a long time thirdly the endowment should be to serve a good purpose so someone makes an endowment to teach music how do we learn this is an ongoing continuous sin I know of a righteous practicing Muslim who's a relative of mine who came to one of my cousins and my cousin was young so he asked him to teach him how to play a musical instrument the guitar so he taught him how to play on the guitar and he did a good job only to discover after 15 years that the man now became famous and he's a musician and he make makes records subhanAllah something you throw in the ground a small seed you don't pay attention to it grows to become a huge tree scholars students of knowledge there is like us we talk and we don't think a lot of the impact of what we say only to find out that people from all over the world making dua for us calling us that come ahead you changed my life vertical logic a video clip I saw since then I've been watching all of your lectures and you've transformed my life my wife's my mother my father my siblings and we'll all make him Dora for you we're all abiding by the Quran the sooner it's overwhelming I never thought of such an impact but what's with Allah is never lost likewise when you do a single sin and you share it with someone you never know that this would be like a reckon snowball that would grow up in momentum and size taking everything in his path people don't know that they don't pay attention to that because Shaitaan is controlling them then it is no yesterday I saw a movie it was so great where is this movie I couldn't buy it no you don't have to buy it there is a website go to WWE go to hell straight dot info or dot-com man everything is free there it's beautiful it took me ten seconds and for those listening going back watching this Hallam because of you all their sins put in your pocket you come on the day of judgement hi guys Oh as well mashallah thinking that you're okay to find mountains of sins whoa this is the wrong address who's this now that's not mine yes it's yours you said that sentence which you did not pay any attention to and this is going to drop you in hell further than seventy years of travel distance I would have a life do not underestimate the things that you do so it has to be for a good purpose so you cannot for example make an endowment for maintaining temples or churches or publishing Haram things number four if what is in doubt falls into the state that makes it of no benefit it may be sold providing that if the value is using the same purpose so I have money I built a message it so that people can pray is this an endowment definitely the Prophet said has some whoever builds a Masjid even if it's as small as the nest of a bird this is metaphorical of course a lot will build them a house in general so this is something that whoa not to be taken lightly however after 10 years the building has deteriorated the people have shifted so this neighborhood now is not inhabited people are going all of them are going north so the area is deserted maybe one person or two are praying in it this is not what I built it for for my father or my great-grandfather but they're all dead I'm the one responsible to take care of it what would I do I would go and actually sell the whole plot but this is endowment how can you sell it I'm selling it to refurbish it to renovate it and to reuse it somewhere else so I take an order of selling it as a piece of land they will demolish the Masjid take the money go somewhere else with more inhabitants build a message there and get it working someone was a mall and the revenue the yields of the mall is to be spent on his Islamic satellite channel the mall is not doing well and I got a customer who wants to buy it and change it into a hospital so I take the money and I built another mall or I buy a number of different shops so that the revenue would be equivalent if not more this is totally legit and permissible number five and this is extremely important and a lot of the Muslims don't know that an endowment is a binding contract which is confirmed by a mere verbal statement and it cannot be revoked or sold so sometimes I get money and I feel lucky I feel happy and I'd say I will make an endowment of building a machine for the residential area I have I have like five residential buildings apartment buildings so this one I will put it for the sake of Allah as the agenda to spend the revenue over messages and circles of the field of Quran after I said that I said whoops I'm talking about a million dollar worth of a building that's a lot of money man tell you what I changed my mind let me do another investment that would generate no way Jose it's a done deal sure I didn't mean it no no you said it it's a done deal and saying it can be straightforward I make as endowment and it can be ambiguous or metaphoric I give for the sake of Allah i donate i all of this are binding it's like marriage and divorce the word you say is binding your friend is joking with you he says look at my young daughter she's like a six months old man I give it I'll give her to you and marriage and you're laughing I said I accept her as a wife and there are two male witnesses the marriage is binding you're kidding me no I'm not likewise if someone's drinking cappuccino is with his beloved wife they both are hummingbirds they love one another and she says you know if you divorce me I can be a happier woman and she's teasing him and he knows that and he teases her back by saying well if you think so then I divorce you pass me the sugar please you crazy what you divorced man no no no I was kidding man no you are divorced my friend sure I didn't mean it well you've said it whether you mean it or not it's a done deal this is one divorce she'll please find me away get a counseling session pay for it this is how extremely dangerous what we utter what we say it is binding so be careful when it comes to endowment because this is a done deal whether you write it or you say it number seven the conditions stipulated by the person creating the endowment must be abided by as long as they do not country we know Islamic law what does this mean when I set an endowment it is my duty to put conditions so usually when I say okay this shopping mall this is an endowment as for the revenue I would like the revenue to be distributed in the following fields 10% to the messages 20% to the circles of have the Koran 30% orphanages visa 60 now 40% for Dawa which is in which includes printing of leaflets of books of the organization's of TV channels of radio broadcasting the Koran in Africa whatever this is what the person creating an endowment had set as rules and conditions they must be followed to the letter as long as there is nothing wrong or against the Sharia it has to be followed it's not your problem after 10 years is it no no but we don't need this we don't know you have to follow it as it is and some people may make this which is number 8 that the endowment is for the benefit of one's children and grandchildren so usually in most cases this refers only to my own sons and daughters but the children who do not carry my name would not be included so if my daughter's got married their children won't carry my name they would carry their father's name so they're out that the children the girls my girls they carry my name they still in until they die as for my sons their daughters and their sons carry my name I'm their grandfather so they are having a share once my granddaughters get married they're out and it continues for those carrying my name now the scholars say that in endowment both boys and girls are equal ensure while in inheritance the boys the males get double the share of the females but in depth but in endowment no they're the same so if I die and I leave $300,000 behind and a daughter and a son the son gets 200 the daughter gets 100 but if I leave an endowment that generates 300 thousand a year every year the girl the daughter gets 150 and the boy gets 150 and they're all equal in that now having said that is extremely important to know that endowment is one of the great sources of income for the Muslim Ummah look around you you will find things like is Veda which the wife of Harun al-rashid the bassy Haditha had struggled to make and built only to serve the pilgrims who were stranded without water she built that and she made it if you read throughout history you will find thousands of cases of endowments whether it is hospitals with it whether it is universities and educational institutions whether it is message aids whether it is orphanages and people used to give generously now because the email itself is being reduced and minimize unfortunately we find that so little is being done for Islam whether it's dower whether it's memorizing the Quran whether it's establishing of Masjid we do need a lot of donations the other day Subhan Allah brother from India just came to me and said chef I am blessed with four kids and a beautiful wife and Allah has given me so much I don't know what to do anyhow he goes and he gives me an envelope of thirty thousand three outs almost a thousand dollars I said what is this he said I want this to be an endowment I've heard your talk about lending money and I believe that there are a lot of Muslims who need money and can't afford it so this money I just want it to be regenerating itself by lending it to people and then getting it back and lending it to other people and by this I would be investing with Allah soldier Hanwha and the money is still with me and people are borrowing from it and returning it and it's been circulating for so many years now so there are people who have this idea of contributing of giving for the sake of Allah this is the best investment when you put and set an endowment and you die and it goes on after your death for many many years I feel sorry when I see movies of actors and actresses who have passed away but people are still enjoying their movies and generating sins for them when you see a poster of a celebrity is that but the people are still watching his nudity or her nudity and her filth I feel envious when I see someone may Allah give us all a good ending when I see the founder of Islam Q&A dot n know a website that is visited by minimum 100 million person per year and he is sitting home what we have it whatever he is asleep and it's getting so much reward of people benefiting so you should think what is it that I should be doing so that I would be coming into this inch loop insha'Allah and gain this continuous Sabha this salat Angelia anyhow this brings us to the end of today's class today is Monday tomorrow's Thursday well I'm smart and the day after is Wednesday insha'Allah on Wednesday we have an extra class out of the schedule then we will ensure Allah devote that to your questions and answers as of today I have like 29 questions that would consume the hour inshallah maybe not so the admins will zoom Allah he'll send me like maybe 10 more questions so that you will try to answer them on our class on Wednesday the day after tomorrow same time at 4:30 Mecca time and hopefully we will end by if not 5:30 then by 6 o'clock so that we can answer all of your questions so try your best to join me after a couple of days day after tomorrow and until then I live in fear Manila was Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
