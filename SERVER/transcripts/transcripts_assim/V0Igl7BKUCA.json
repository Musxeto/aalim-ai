  "transcript": "does one looking at himself nude or his wife looking at him nude affect his state of Woodill or of washing the answer is no the things that break your wouldl are limited so if you know them if you learn them like the things that nullify your fasting like the things that nullify your hatch this is the beauty of learning your religion once you master these things you don't need to come and ask me so if you pass wind if you urinate if you difficut if anything comes out of your private part if you sleep and if you eat camels meat these things break your wood what about if I smoke it's a sin your world is intact what about it about if I watch a movie it's a sin but your Moodle is intact what about if I listen to a song it's another sin your rudl has nothing to do with it so once you master this you know whether you look at yourself or your wife looks at you the prophetess that I'm used to bathed with his wife together and there is nothing wrong in that and it does not affect your world one Allah knows best"
