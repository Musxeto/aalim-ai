  "title": "Seeking refuge & mercy from Allah at certain ayahs in salah when praying alone & in congregation",
  "transcript": "so we know that during the prophet's night prayer you stop a certain aat and he would ask Allah for his Mercy or he would seek refuge in Allah or he make tus my question is um can you explain how you can act on this do we restrict ourselves to only these three instances during night prayer or a matter faster than that if you're praying for your own on your own and you pass by an Ayah where ask Allah from his favors so you may stop pose and say when there is mentioning of Jenna or Allah's Mercy you say oh Allah I seek your mercy when there is mentioning of Hellfire and the punishment and torment of it I seek refuge in you from Hellfire and the likes but if you're praying behind an Imam and the Imam doesn't pause and continues it's best that you just just listen and Allah Knows Best"
