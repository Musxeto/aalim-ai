  "transcript": "I have a question uh this probably little bit technical question in regards to Salah can you teach us uh what it means by bid or innovation in Salah and um I'm attaching this to uh Hadith uh that I'm reading in regards to when uh the prophet is praying in congregation with sallu alaihi wasallam is in uh congregation with um um and from his position of R and then when he comes out he says and someone says uh yeah which implies um or implies to me that probably the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam haven't thought anyone or said anything uh to that particular person yet so what in context of what would be b or what's the limitation uh can you teach us something about this thank you it's very easy it's a but because the prophet approved it it became Sunnah now if I do it today something new I say after and I say uh Hallelujah and I say it's good it calls the Christians to come and accept Islam uh do I have anyone to approve it no then this is this is taking you astray this is rejected so whatever was done at the time of the Prophet Alam he approves it it becomes a Sunnah if he disapproves it we know that it's wrong for example may Allah be pleased with him prays is with the prophet goes to his tribe because he's the most learned one he leads them in Isa for them but he prolonged the ISA by by reciting Surah Al Bak one of the companions F praying behind him said this is too long he left the Salat continued on his own and went to his farm CU he has to irrigate his farm and go to sleep following morning he has to work after the prayer was over the good samans went to M said the guy left you and he prayed on his own so M said he's a hypocrite the same good samans went to the man said mu says you're a hypocrite so the man said I'm a hypocrite okay he went to the prophet and he said a prophet of Allah m is doing so and so and so this is taking too long if the prophet said you have done a good job mu that would have been a Sunnah the prophet said are you causing chaos and F between the Muslims he was very angry when you pray and lead the prayer shorten your prayer so that those behind you there are the sick they are the elderly there are those who have errands to attend to would find it suitable so mu learned his lesson another man in the Salat and this is a good example for you inshallah and us to learn exactly how to differentiate in the Salah they're praying a man sneezes and he says alhamdulillah and the man next to him says the companions were outraged whoa so they started looking at him in Salat you know in Salat they used to look they used to talk in the beginning they used to talk in the congregation you join the congregation hey boy what's happening he said I'm cool and you go join the Salat until Allah says stand up to Allah in silence so that was prohibited so the man when he saw that the companions are looking at him said he said it loudly why are you looking at me may Allah make me die so that my mother becomes uh the mother of someone who's dead so the companions started doing this yeah and he shut the heck up so the guyus zipped it after the Salat the prophet said bring the boy so they brought the man he said my nephew the the son of my brother these this prayer was not done to communicate and speak like this it was only for Quran and so the comp companion said by Allah the prophet did not reprimand me did not say harsh words to me no no one you more uh uh tolerant and merciful than him now the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam advised the man who said what he didn't advise the man who said which means when you sneeze you say alhamdulillah it's not a see the difference the one that was wrong the prophet corrected the one was okay the prophet left alone so I hope this answers your question inshallah"
