  "title": "Can grown up children sleep in the same bed as their parent? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother says is it permissible for a grown-up son to sleep in the same bed as his mother or a grown-up daughter to sleep in the same bed as her father the answer is no this is not permissible the prophet alayhi salaatu wa sallam said order your sons or do your children to pray when they're seven and beat them for not praying when they're ten and separate between them in their beds so separating between the children when they go to bed when their children this is far less than having a grown-up man sleeping with his mother when they're asleep and on the same bed they don't have control over what they do and hideous things can be done so definitely this is not something to be promoted and Allah knows best"
