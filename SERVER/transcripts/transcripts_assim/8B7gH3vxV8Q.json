  "transcript": "Antonio says someone told me that if anyone prays 40 days without missing any and pray in the first row all his past sins are wept is this so he yes there is an authentic hadith 200 prayers 40 days without missing the first takbir not necessarily in this first row you can pray in a second the third the most important is that when you are in the row the Imam says Allah Akbar you say Aloha you're not walking in you're too late if you're walking in you have to be in the position to say Allah but immediately afterwards whoever does this Allah will give him two certificates of innocence from hypocrisy and from Hellfire so this is an authentic hadith and it's a great reward to try to accomplish"
