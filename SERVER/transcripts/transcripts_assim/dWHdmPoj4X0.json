  "title": "Why do Quran teachers confuse? Two Harakat Madd & Makhraj Mandatory in Prayer (Salah)? assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Dali from Bangladesh. Dali. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Barakatu. Sheikh, you said in Zikr we don't need Tajweed, but we have to follow Makaraj. So, Iqfa, Izhar is not necessary. So, it will be Astaghfirullah and not Astaghfirullah. I am confused what is mandatory in Zikr, like the two Harakamat. We need to follow them. No, you don't. No, you don't. Continue. Like the word Jamal and Jamal, they are both different and the meanings are different. So, my Qur'an teacher said that the Dua, Astaghfirullahaladzi la ilaha illahwal. In this Dua, we have to say Astaghfirullahaladzi la ilaha illahwal hayyul qayyum. No, no. No, that's wrong. That's not necessary. You can just say Astaghfirullahaladzi la ilaha illahul. You don't have to say Astaghfirullahaladzi la ilaha. Because this is Madja'iz. Even in Qur'an you don't have to say this. So, again, don't listen to teachers of Qur'an who don't have Fiqh and don't have knowledge except in Qur'an. Because they have limited knowledge and their knowledge is not authentic. They impose things upon their students which are not mandated in Islam. I don't have to say ghayril maghdubi alayhim wa laddalleen. I can say ghayril maghdubi alayhim wa laddalleen. That's a job. So, no, you have to have madmutqal kalimi, blah, blah. All of this is good. It's nice, but it is not mandatory. And we should not put hurdles in front of people and make life difficult for them when there's no necessity for that."
