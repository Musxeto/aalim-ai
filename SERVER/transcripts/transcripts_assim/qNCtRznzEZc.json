  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum I'm son my name is Asha hun oh I have a question why as a Muslim we do good deeds with the main goal of attaining Jenna should we not a my goal a good deeds to please Allah because he's are created and he deserves and loves to be pleased are we not wrong in defying our goal because our goal should be pleasing Allah not to and just to enter Jannah okay the question is clear why do we seek and make du'a to enter gender and do good deeds to enter Jenna while we should purify our intention and do it for the sake of allah azzawajal there is no contradiction because worshipping allah azzawajal has main pillars and these three main pillars without them worshiping Allah would be incomplete and scholars the described it as having a bird a bird has a head and it has two wings and a bird flies when one of the wings is not functioning well the way of flying is not well and it might not fly well and it might fall and if the bird did not have a head then the bird is totally dead so in Islam the head of the bird is a las love anyone who says I do not love Allah he's a kafir because this is the essence of worshiping Allah and the wings are fearing Allah and hoping in what Allah has and when the fire complained to Allah o Allah I have eaten myself I'm eating myself because the fire it is so hot it is so ferocious and destructive it is eating itself so Allah gave it two breaths one in summer which is the highest degree of heat and one in winter which is the coldest breeze of freezing and Allah addressed fire by saying you are my wrath i punish people with you and Allah addressed paradise and he said you are my mercy and I admit to you those who I have mercy on them so when you worship allah azzawajal seeking his mercy that is seeking his paradise then you're fulfilling what allah has told you and this is why allah tells us in the hadith i have prepared for my servants what eyes did not see what ears did not hear what hearts could not imagine so allah has prepared Jenna and he gave it to us as a reward and he told us you do this you get Jenna so no one in his right mind you say o Allah love you so much I don't want your Jenna you don't want to get my gender you go to hell no you have to worship Allah you have to love allah you have to want to get to jenna and you have to fear hell because it is ullas anger and wrath so i hope this answers your question"
