  "title": "Permissible to use Electric Scooter for Tawaf and Sa'ee? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The second question I have is, is it permissible to use the electrical scooter for tawaf and sa'ee? As for your second question, it is permissible to use the electric scooter for tawaf and sa'ee for those who are in need, such as the elderly or those who are tired, those who are sick, and even those who are healthy. It's permissible, but their reward would be less, and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions, and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
