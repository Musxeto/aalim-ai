  "transcript": "a way of life a way of life a way of life to the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam brothers and sisters in islam welcome to a new episode and a continuation on the topic of marriage i am your host with us in the studio we have brother salim al-amiri brother as promised we will deal with issues pertaining to marriage particularly the matters of finding the right spouse what are the qualities which we should look for when finding a spouse if you allow me sir we i think it would be best that we begin with the qualities sought after in a wife and this is illustrated beautifully and eloquently in the hadith of the prophet where he says that a woman is sought after for four qualities her wealth her lineage her beauty and for her religious commitment and the prophet after that said so get the one with the religious commitment may you prosper the literal hadith says may your hands be dusted so this might be a warning that if you do not then what you're holding is dust or it may be taken as the arabs usually use these words to mean may you prosper so the prophet ali is telling us that the first quality you should look for is the religious commitment how do we define religious commitment well this is a very good question a lot when they come to mary they focus on two things she wears the nikap and she doesn't listen to music and that is it this is what people think is the most important thing in a woman and this is definitely wrong because religious commitment means that you have a point of reference where you can always turn to when there is a conflict and likewise with the man but we will come to discuss this later on inshaallah if i have a conflict with my wife and if she does not have any religious commitment that makes her forces her to comply with the truth then we have a lot of uh differences among us but when we have a dispute and she says right and i say left and we go back to the quran and the sunnah there would be no dispute none whatsoever because we are putting the quran soon as our judge oh let's just make a point in the west for example it's interesting i don't know if this refers to saudi but in the west wearing niqab is quite a commitment because it's not it's not only not the norm wearing the cab well in some countries is even illegal now in the west unfortunately unfortunately but in england even in england where it's more tolerant it shows a commitment so sometimes it's what brothers look for you know and again music is so widely available and and there's so much misunderstanding about it so i mean these criterion sometimes it might be a better indicator in the west than it may be just in for what hasn't meant actually is not belittling the importance of the niqab actually but it is not the only thing you have to look for okay because look what is beyond that i think a foundation maybe and i'm asking the question as well is when we say religious commitment are we talking about the pillars of islam like it's comprehensive in the comprehensive sense that means he is a real servant of allah but does that start at hijab no no when we say religious commitment it's taken for granted that she's a muslim so we don't say first of all she has to pray five times a day this is by default when we're talking about a righteous practicing brother looking for a righteous practicing muslim so how would he define that she is righteous practicing if she's wearing the neck of she's not praying definitely she's a hypocrite what i'm saying okay so if we say that salaat alhams five prayers are a default and then what is religious commitment i'm saying that is religious commitment just going back to the hijab issue because that's what you guys are saying really in the worldwide audiences watching peace tv you may find that for some people praying five times a day and upholding the five pillars is real religious commitment among some communities this is not even practiced they will still consider that person as a muslim and i'm sure you we've all got experience of people uh practicing brothers and practicing sisters i mean when i say practicing they fulfill the pillars of islam and their families are forcing them to marry not literally forcing but putting huge emotional pressures on them which we discussed previously to marry their cousin who doesn't pray who doesn't fast who doesn't have any type of religious commitment at all but still has the label muslim so this is a real genuine issue that exists i also noticed that as we went you know from different countries we started off you know brothers looking for an akov and you might find another country no they don't when they're looking for a wife it started shifting so i'm saying that maybe that word uh that deen it is broader than it's broader and it's also i think it depends on a man who's getting married as well maybe he has standards that maybe he's not so firm in his salah and he wishes to marry a woman who is furman and her salah so that she can make him stronger if i may comment i stated that this was the common mistake that people do when they look for a righteous woman i did not say that this is the criterion that one has to uphold to i said this is one so likewise being practicing and righteous means that you fulfill all what comes in islam if a person is not committed to islam this is something wrong in him but this does not justify for us to say okay you may look for someone that is loose with hijab or is loose with her prayers but alhamdulillah she believes in allah and the prophet assam even if she prays once every blue moon no we are saying that the what is meant in the prophet's hadith is in black and white choose the one who is religiously committed and how do i define if someone is religiously committed or not i definitely would say a girl or a woman who does not wear the hijab and prays five times a day she is not religiously committed so we are setting the benchmark we don't go to the west or to other countries and say that these guys don't abide by the hijab the men don't grow their beards so let's go down a little bit let's customize islam to their need this is what we're trying to avoid we're trying to set the benchmark and i hope i think that that's fine from one angle but the other angle is that it's just that the point being is that the reality of people's conditions is what are their expectations i think this is the thing is that it's important to understand i agree we don't want to set the benchmark lower than what it should be and no one here is saying that dean should change from place to place but what people in their various cultural situations might consider to be religious commitment is very very different across the spectrum and i think let's be realistic here we all know that when men go to get married they're obviously looking for the looks maybe there was a time when people got married for lineage and other things right now we know straight out people are marrying for looks so the brother who's listening to this wants to know how do i combine this you're saying the woman of piety and he's looking for a beautiful woman how does it get combined the hadith doesn't contradict doesn't doesn't deny the hadith talks about what people prefer that's why it prioritizes mentioned that they will look for the beauty they will look which is natural but the hadith is giving them what you should i mean now when i'm sorting my priorities yes she is beautiful he doesn't pray should i marry her the prophet is telling you no because this beauty will vanish this beauty will disappear after a few years yeah okay she is wealthy maybe overnight she becomes bankrupt so something which is going to last okay and this will make your real life the marital life really successful so let's be practical then so he finds a woman that's incredibly beautiful and her dean's not that strong and then he finds it no let us now define the strength here he's not that strong here things are relative does he meet the minimum does he maintain her prayers does he wait the hijab the minimum let us say and then he has to work on her to build up her iman can i pinch you a scenario yeah let's just say we have uh a cultural situation let's just say pakistan it could be pakistan it could be in india in some places maybe even people don't even you may be surprised but they don't i don't know if this is true anymore it certainly used to be true maybe 20 years ago people didn't even know about hijab they thought shawal kameez i remember my ex-sister-in-law used to think that shewalkamis was the islamic dress and hijab is the islamic dress of the arabs they just thought hijab was the arab custom this is our custom she had no idea about hijab but someone may be religiously committed from the point of view is for them what allah says and what the prophet says is the most important thing but they may not be outwardly displaying things that we look as normal characteristics of this is what a good muslim should be doing but her heart her intention her her whole way of looking at things is if this is what islam says i will do it and often one of the things that is often put in front of me is that you have sisters wearing niqab for example who have the most atrocious manner backbiting behaving in a really uh terrible way having no empathy no compassion you know very virtues that are not islamic virtues yet you may find a sister who doesn't wear hijab maybe out of ignorance but she has very good qualities very good characteristics what are we talking about here in terms of religious commitment before we go on we're going to take a short break stay tuned we'll be right back inshallah a way of life of life welcome back so you had posed a critical question did you intend one of the i'm throwing it open for comment see i think it is very important that we make things clear from the beginning i mean and with the the objectives and the aims of such programs on such a series of discussions is to educate the muslims yes we know the situation of our ummah and that's why we are in this mess okay it's the yaha the ignorant it is high time to call a spade a spade okay it is high time to educate the muslim not to leave them in the dark yes i agree this sister who is not wearing hijab maybe he is doing righteous this that many of the practicing sisters under and it is a reality and many of muslim brothers who they when you look at them they don't have beats and masha'allah they are fasting every monday and thursday they have to malay they have such we know these things facts but here we are telling things should we complement each other i mean i'm going to get married a practicing brother i'm always telling the same problem with the sisters by the way when she oh he is mashallah practicing brother oh mashallah i told them in many of my talks that don't accept the make your criteria that his beard is hitting his navel oh he has a long beard and has short soap no how about his akhlaf how about his manners how about his dutifulness to his parents that's why they should these things we are going to address so here we want to strike the balance so here when the prophet saw him said that dean he's talking about the muslim and we know the meaning of muslim one who submits to what allah says and the what sallam said yes i have my shortcomings may allah give me the strength and that's why i say we have to be pragmatic the minimum then you try to help her and to build up her iman and inshallah things will come truth is there's seems that there's a lot of misconception among the muslims when it comes to identifying righteousness because we have the outer appearance and we have the inner qualities and characteristics and i've found as you have found probably in your expeditions that some people are totally concerned with the outer appearance while ignoring the essence and the substance and on the other hand some people say it's all about the substance the outer appearance makes no difference and the truth is it's a combination of both forces hadith comes to my mind and i think when we talk about the religious one for me subhanallah this is a very powerful and important hadith for all of us to think about the companions came and asked the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam about a woman she said they said this woman she does a lot of extra prayers and she does a lot of extra fasts but she has an evil tongue and annoys her neighbors and the prophet said subhanallah he said she is a person of the hellfire a person of the hellfire and they asked about another woman they said she doesn't do a lot of extra praying she doesn't do a lot of extra fasting and she just something to her neighbors and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said she's a person of the paradise and i think here's the thing is that when we talk about the religious one this hadith gives us a very important clue because unfortunately a lot of us imagine that religiosity is performing a lot of rituals and this is what a lot of muslims do they perform rituals the salah is a ritual they go through but does this salah really connect them with allah and what's the proof of the pudding as we say look at the person's character look at that like you said are they do they obey their parents what is that how do they treat what does their neighbor say about them you know so i think these are the things we need to look at what i believe is a religious commitment is what i said in the beginning that it is having a point of reference it is the submission the willingness to go to the quran and sunnah and abide by it so when i say this i do agree that there might be a woman who is masha'allah excellent character very kind very generous but and everything else is good but she doesn't abide by the hijab she doesn't maybe she does not pray on time but she prays so if i would to say you go as a imam of a masjid or a die and marry her and be hopeful and wishful that inshallah she will become a practicing muslim in the future there is a big problem and that problem is that i'm gambling there is a possibility that she would have three or four kids and becomes more defined and insisting on not wearing the hijab on not practicing as allah instructed us in the quran my problem is with religious commitment is that a lot of the muslims nowadays don't refer to the quran sunnah they refer to everything else but the quran so they bend the rules and sometimes break the rules my point of view is that if you're getting married to someone this should be on the top of your priority list and that is a boy or a girl is their point of reference quran sunnah they have no dispute but if i say this is what allah says in the quran he she says my mother says something else imam so and so in that country says something else so this is not religiously committed person and we will come inshaallah to discuss more qualities of the wife other than this inshallah which would i have a different approach because i know we're talking about you know the qualities of a woman that she should have religious commitment but somebody came to me i was doing like a goal-setting workshop and this is the type of brother that's always going around telling people i want to get married i want to get married i want to get married he likes to show off that that he's not married and he's looking so then after this goal setting workshop he comes to me and he says you know it was number one on my list and then i jokingly said to him i said what jannah was your number one goal and then he felt shy and he said no marriage was his number one goal but then i realized that maybe let's step back from the woman's religious commitment how about we make this person's number one goal being jenna then when he goes to approach marriage then he can say is this woman going to help me get to jannah because that's my number one goal not marriage we had discussed that i believe we built the we built the whole discussion on that very foundation in the very early episodes we spoke about the relationship with allah and i believe you mentioned that the the marriage institution is one which is based on taqwa based on the objective of life and don't get me wrong if you can get someone with all these qualities beautiful lineage wealth and this commitment then masha allah i think you know what i find sometimes is that um the language we use is very easy to use even a simple word like religion if we say the word religion today words trigger in people's minds certain concepts and unfortunately because we live in a very secular age in very secular materialist societies that have divided religious life from normal life when you say the word religion what comes to people's minds is a set of rights and rituals that have no real bearing on one's life at all and and for many people this is religion whether they're you know jews muslims christians it's just some rituals i go through this is the problem so i think sheikh mohammed was saying which is a very nice point is if you rephrase it if you think of it in a different way because you marry the religious one a person will think okay make sure she's doing this and that and she has follows all of these and you may clear chef we weren't no one was saying that you are suggesting they have to wear niqab but it's an outer manifestation of religiosity but it doesn't mean the person is really has this connection with allah and so i love the way that sheikh muhammad rephrased it you know okay is she going to help you get to jannah this is the question isn't it really because that's why the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he's saying that is she going to help you get to jannah hold on a second though i agreed yeah let's look at it from an another a third angle uh how are allah azza the dean of islam is one which is simple in a sense and practical and if you go through the quran and the statements of the sahabah they made the behavior of the people the appearance of the people and indication to the essence it's not a guarantee but um when the people said he said we treat you as we see you behave and if you show us about this woman i mentioned the hadith she prays a lot she does a lot of extra fasting correct so externally you look at her religiosity no no that that would be the foundation there are exceptions to the rule it doesn't mean that you see okay let's say his sister is standing somewhere and a brother is trying to find a wife he sees a sister within a club okay she must be on good terms with allah now that is an indication after that indication there's verification now you go through a process where you can identify whether it is a bunch of you know rights or rituals that this lady is engaged in or whether there's a substance for her iman but turn it around usually and this is how the deen functions unless there are if there's appearance wise there's lack of commitment then that indicates that the johar the essence there's a critical issue there and i think it's so important to remember that of all the people watching plugging into peace tv okay sheikh had it right from the absolute beginning you had it right on the spot in saudi arabia but what criterion of righteousness is that wearing niqab in saudi arabia it's not a criteria it's normal for everyone to do it and women do it customarily i've seen it they put they come into the airplane with niqab they're flying to england it all comes off and they're showing all the hair and this and that some of them not all no i didn't of course not all of them stuck for a lot but i'm meaning i've seen it that niqab is just a cultural practice what judgment what criterion is that of righteousness nothing like you said it's nothing so uh abu musab in this case the outward appearance doesn't mean anything it has to but till islam made that a reference but brother in another place you will have a culture where the nekhar they don't even know what is in their if the issue is not the nikah brothers and sisters the issue what meant that there is always and this is true this is our belief there is a link and there is a relationship between the the external and the internal which is the fact whatever helps the people to judge you yes okay so this so always say this and that's why then if comes what is hypocrisy hypocrisy when what is shown is different from what is inside so our islam that both so when i see a person appears to me he is masha'allah committed to the deen and all this so i have to take it and unless it is proven otherwise right this is our day i want to throw i want to throw something into the into the mix the time is over and it's hot the temperature is high enjoying it yes that's why we're going to discuss this in the very next episode we promise we will continue inshallah this hot discussion so we look forward to you joining us in the very next episode for tuning in salaam alaika"
