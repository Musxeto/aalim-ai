  "transcript": "we will have the opportunity to listen from our International speaker so ladies and gentlemen brothers and sisters without any further Ado we would like to invite SE aim al-hakim from Saudi please welcome SE aim [Music] however no one on earth says I'd like Allah to test me I'd like Allah to test me with poverty and illness and hardship I don't want Allah to test me with wealth and with high position and a good job nobody says this because the end result of tests are two things and this is alhamdulillah this is weird what is this I'm not used to this at all so if I feel drowsy and fall down somebody has to pick me up and I'm I'm an old man you expect me to go round I'll do my best but sometimes and how should it be clockwise or anticlockwise they did not say this in the protocol but alhamdulillah so what is our topic for today our topic is very known to all of you to all Muslims but this is what our dawa is about the basics do we after 15 centuries reinvent the wheel it's not logical the Quran is the Quran the Sunnah is the Sunnah so what is changing what is the variable it is us we change we tend to flip and this is why we always have to go back to the basics now let me see how this works because usually I use my iPad but now Samsung is paying me more so no no I'm joking they're not paying me more it's a little bit less anyhow so let us look each and every one of us is a Muslim correct mashallah now there are things that each and every Muslim is not excused not to know of so for example to know that there is only one God worthy of being woried is anyone excused oh I didn't know I thought that there were Idols Buddha was okay no this is not okay you have to believe in the Oneness of Allah okay also each and every Muslim knows that prayer is part of Islam fasting Ramadan doing Hajj zakat so you're not excused if I didn't know Ramadan was obligatory for me to fast I thought maybe it didn't December is good no you have to know this because you're a Muslim and part of knowing Islam is to know that killing people fornicating committing Z drinking intoxicant doing drugs dealing in RBA is all Haram no one is excused to say w I didn't know I had a girlfriend for 20 years nobody told me it's Haram now you know these are things each and every one of us has to know now how many years did the prophet Alat wasam spend in Mecca before going to Medina 13 years he lived for 40 years in Mecca 40 years jiel peace be upon Him came and said so he became a prophet then Allah says he became a messenger and he stayed in Mecca for years now knowing this fact in Mecca there was no fasting of Ramadan this was in Medina there was no Hajj this was in Medina there was no zakat this was in Medina there was no Salat this was after 10 or 11 years from him being in Mecca as a messenger so what was he doing what was the prophet doing in 10 to 11 years everybody giving dawa mashall giving da to what H giving da to okay I can give you da to in five minutes then what I don't know sheh I don't I I did not come here to be tested give it to us andas let's go home so the prophet Alat wasam spent 13 years in Mecca establishing a establishing Islam in the heart establishing the love of Allah and this is what we have a big zero in women she my wife my husband watches pornography my husband cheats on me my husband does not pray fure men she my wife doesn't wear the hijab my wife flirts with other men my wife does not pray sheh my son smokes does drugs does this does that and so on so what's the problem the problem that these are all symptoms s they're not the core sickness if I complain of headache give me two Panadol in America two Tylenol it will go away 6 hours BOS excellent after 6 hours I will come again the headache is back take two pills 6 hours it's back take two pills take two pills take two pills in am I helping you no because I'm curing the symptom not the real illness look at the Muslim world look at your house and my house look at your heart and my heart and you will find the illness cascading on our lives so what is the illness we do not have proper a we don't have proper IM we talk about the symptoms wear the hijab grow your beard pray in the Masjid good but inside the illness is regenerating so much bacteria so much infections and it's going to resurface with different symptoms the prophet Alat ensured that he instills in the Muslims a strong immune system system so when they went to Medina and calamities after calamities war after War who stood firm Those whom he raised for 13 years in Mecca they did not budge they did not run away so nowadays you know I offer counseling sessions lots of people come to me so when I speak to them one to one I say M let me talk to you about some of the illnesses you have he said okay so I say to them what are the pillars of IM theym Sal zakat and I said no youm these are the pillars of Islam what are the pillars of Iman he said huh they're different he said yes they are six said oh nobody told me this is one of the things that each and every Muslim has to know you have no excuse ask your children what are the pillars of Iman I don't know what is the name of the World Cup or ronaldino where does he play ah Saudi Arabia mashallah they know things about actors actresses singers pop stars but when it comes to religion they have no knowledge this is your fault so what are the pillars of Iman to believe in Allah to believe in the angels to believe in the scriptures to Believe In The Messengers to believe in the day of judgment and to believe in the Divine decree whether good or bad easy all of you know this of course anyhow so alhamdulillah so now if we look we will find that this D we live in is so beautiful we enjoy every moment a good meal we enjoy a good car a big house a good job money bank account a good spouse good times we enjoy all of this don't we however all of this will come to an end all of this beauty that Allah has created for us will come to a final destination because this is only a station like the train station but then it has a final destination when the train will stop and in this station we are in Allah is testing us and after that we die and after we die we're buried where is your grandfather his home Sheikh I'm not talking about him about the great great grandfather oh he's dead We buried him 50 years ago okay so each and every one of us will die and be B and then the tests of Allah that he has given us the results will show on the day of judgment on the day of Resurrection on in Arabic we call it the final day and you know the Arabs have a tendency whenever something is is of great importance they give it a lot of names Allah is the most important thing in life how many names does he have 99 names that we know of otherwise he has unlimited number of names that we do not see I'm to four may Allah make it easy say a mean I didn't hear you okay thank you thank you so has many names Sur names and all of these and many many names different names for what for one day how long is this day it's a very very long day some say 50,000 years and some say no this is the accountability actually the stages of Life are three one this dun how long is this Dunya for me as long as I live because when I die dun is over yeah but people will live I don't care the hell with them all I'm dead what would I benefit nothing I'm dead so duny is over when I die then I go to Al and Al is between and how long will I stay in my grave this is maybe a thousand years 10,000 years maybe aill million years then what then you have to go to the day of Resurrection the day of gathering and this is when everyone is resurrected at the End of Time the system of this universe that we see will be disrupted will change every day the sun rises from the East and sets set the West sometimes we take selfies the Sun is setting mashallah and this happens every single day at the end of the time there will come a day that the sun I'm waiting for a selfie for Sunrise whoops the sun is coming from there Compass where is the East where is the West this is over this is the day of judgment okay I have debts I want to pay back to people I have rights I'd like to give back to people I have to apologize to my wife for abusing her for 41 years too late give me one chance please too late it's the day of judgment this is the day I should have made time more this is the day when the system of the universe will change and the heavens the the beautiful heaven look at when you look at the sky do you see any crack any opening so perfect in my house you see cracks in the ceiling in the wall on the floor in the heavens there not a single crack on the day of judgment it will split open it will crack the Sun and all of the stars their light will diminish and go away and the Earth would shake and tremble and the mountains big mountains will be blown up to Pieces then this is the announcement from Allah this is the day of Resurrection the day of gathering this is when Allah orders the decomposed bodies of the people in the graves huh my great great great great grandfather yes but he's ashes he's dust he's nothing Allah will order how many billions no trillions maybe all of them will be resurrected their bodies will turn back to their normal form and their souls will be put back in their bodies and now they are alive all of them will go to the land of gathering where is the land of gathering H I don't know Google it will not tell you rerouting no it will not tell you the land of gathering is a sham Syria Palestine Jordan this all area is called Aram this is where Allah will gather all human beings this is the land of gathering and Resurrection so now it's time for accountability whatever good you did you will see it today and whatever evil you've committed whatever sin you have done whatever transgression you impos upon other whatever even my to my wife I will see it but seriously I don't do them to my wife she does it to me but I have to do this for film purposes I have to go back home and sleep if I don't say this I will not anyhow so on the day of judgment accountability will be taking Place those who do well go to Jenna for how long 10 years no 100 years no a million years no how long for eternity neverlasting never ending you mean no death no no sleeping no what are we going to do in Jenna you're going to enjoy your head off you're going to enjoy Beyond imagination you can't even imagine it but Allah promised you you believe okay what about those who did bad Deeds who did not believe who were cfir who were not following Islam they will be taken to Hell Fire to do what to be punished to be tormented to be suffering for their disbelief but why we lived only for 60 years why should we suffer for eternity 60 years Allah did not stop giving you evidence after evidence you could have believed if you wanted you didn't so what should we do to you kiss and makeup no no kissing no make makeups we're going to throw you in hell you're going to suffer for eternity now you're alive you have the chance so to believe in the day of judgment is one of the six pillars of Iman that I've mentioned earlier you remember it alhamdulillah very good it's the fifth pillar but what does it include to believe in the day of judgment there are four more most important things very important things four like we all from why we follow Quran we follow Sunnah we don't follow philosophers philosophy we don't follow people of logic we follow Quran and sunah we're Muslims difficult no not difficult so what is our belief when it comes to the day of judgment four things number one you have to believe in what is ever preceding death so do you know anyone who did not die yet Every Creature whether Jin or human will die of course we have an exception is ISA peace be upon him he's in the heavens when he comes back at the end of time to kill the Antichrist he will live normally and then die like all human beings so everyone dies so you have to believe in death you have to Believe In The Grave whether it is a garden of paradise say a mean may Allah make my grave and yours a garden of paradise or it can be a pit of Hell may Allah protect us all also you believe in the major and minor signs of because there are minor signs that have already come and there will come in the future but there are 10 major signs among them is the descendants of Jesus peace be upon him the Messi the Antichrist the da thean the smoke many many things and of course among all is the death of our Prophet Muhammad this is one of the major signs of now number two part of believing in the day of judgment is to believe in the resurrection so now we're dead we are in Graves our bodies are gone decomposed dust to dust ashes to ashes but we believe that when Allah wills it we will be resurrected number three we believe after Resurrection there will be accountability what do you mean by accountability ah there is a Day of Reckoning there is a day of holding you accountable for whatever you had done so there is a scale where your good deeds and bad deeds will be placed in and this scale has a tongue and has eyes and it speaks like the Hadith tells us and we believe in the straight path they told me you have to walk from there to here on the catwalk so I was thinking of but then I thought that that's not inappropriate for me so in theat whoo it is sharper than a blade and thinner than a hair and you walk and it's dark and you're afraid of slipping those like you inshallah with good deeds it's dark it's pitch black they will have light like these spotlights they can see and walk in confidence some will walk as quick as Lightning it's over thisat is a bridge over Hellfire to some they can just go it's wide some they will be like tornadoes according to their Good Deeds how much good deeds do you have alhamd some of them would be like people riding on a quick horse or fat boy Harley-Davidson they they will go or a ninja so that people of Kawasaki would not be angry I don't know ninja kawazaki Honda whatever again Samsung all of this is paid huh anyhow some will be running tomorrow we have a marathon I hope they're all wearing appropriate clothes anyhow they run some of them walk fast some of them it takes them like from to they have a lot of sins and it's taking a lot of time and they're afraid some don't have light they have a light on their toe so it lights and then it's dark they stop when it lights they walk they stop and some of them walk and then it's dark and they fall into hell may Allah protect us and then they will find the pool of the Prophet Alat wasam where you will get to drink from the pool of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam may Allah make you and me drink from it if you drink from it you you will never be thirsty till eternity and it's as white as milk as Crystal Clear very beautiful you believe in all of this then we come to the fourth category and that is you believe in heaven jenah and you believe in Hell jenah is for those who worshiped Allah like you who were praying like you who were avoiding sins like you who were terrified of the day of judgment who were afraid of going to hell who fear Allah's wrath and punishment but they have Great Hopes in Allah's Mercy they will go to Jenna and those who are not like this they will go to Hell Fire so the real life is not our life on Earth has an end ask me I'm 64 how much longer do I want to live 200 years then what then death so what am I waiting for when death comes I cannot say no alhamdulillah I'm happy I tried my level best to do good things I have my own shortcomings and flaws you do not know of but I don't have any reason to continue except to gain Good Deeds fill up my grave with hassanat when I die whoa this is my home this is my Kasa I will find inshallah what I want this is the real life not this not your car today is 2025 January you buy a new car very happy it's a new car it's one of the best cars to months down the line you say a newer car my car is old I wish I had a new car next year you come resentment my house is old the following year my wife is old what are you going to do you're going to see everything not nice yes because this is not the real life the real life awaits you in Jen when you are the neighbor of who's your neighbor Prophet Muhammad allahar and who's the next door neighbor Abu Bakr Omar Ali all the companions are your neighbor what a beautiful life okay how much do we have it will go on forever for eternity so what am I doing here on Earth I'm talking to miserable people like you no inshallah you're not miserable I don't know anyhow so going back why then people don't believe in the day of judgment why do we have atheists Idol worshippers disbelievers saying no no no no there is no life after death because they are in denial they know deep down each one of them know that there is a day of judgment but they don't want to tell you they want to explore life they want to indulge in Haram they want to do everything that answers their whims and desires so they talk to you there's no day of judgment we Muslims do we have anyone do we need anyone to explain or to convince us of the day of judgment yes or no they fell asleep I told you they're going to fall asleep I told you again we Muslims do we need anyone to convince us that there is a day of judgment no because we believe in the Quran and the Sunnah so as I believe that this woman is my mother do you believe your mother is your biological mother do you have a DNA test maybe you are adopted still without a DNA test you will not say hm is see my mother sometimes she behaves strange no no she is your mother because this is a conviction you have in your heart we Muslims don't need anybody to convince us so how can we convince the atheists there are many ways but I think taken too much time huh how much time do I have I'm finished questions I didn't even scratch the surface why do I say that this is a very important topic because it deals with your AA this is what you have to teach your children this is what you have to teach your spouse this is what you have to teach yourself because if you have strong belief in it you're the strongest mmin nothing can shake you you are like a mountain no matter how tornadoes come you will not be moved a single centimeter so how can we prove to them well in the Quran there are logical evidences Allah tells us in the Quran in Crystal Clear you're an atheist you're a disbeliever you're an idol worshipper listen Allah says and it is he who begins creation then he repeats it and that is even easier to him so when you say to the atheist Allah will resurrect the ashes and the dust into human beings ah this is too impossible how can he do this I said he created you from nothing so to repeat from something is easier if I manufactured an Apple so Samsung would not be happy so if I manufactured an apple and someone comes and dismantles it into pieces I'm the manufacturer is it easier for me to combine it and make it a phone again I'm the one who made it I made it from nothing Allah has the highest of all examples so this is example number one example number two Allah says the creation of the heavens and the Earth is greater than the creation of mankind but most of the people do not know so when you say to them Allah will resurrect you it's difficult why who created the heavens who created the Earth it's Allah so which is more difficult creating you or creating the heavens definitely the heavens and look how many eyes do we we have here I'm not talking about the glasses I have four eyes but I'm talking about the actual eyes how many eyes do we have oh a lot how many eyes exist on Earth 7 billion multiplies by two 14 billion Eyes Can America Russia China produce one eye one no how many eyes are being created in the wombs of pregnant women 2 billion so look at the creation of Allah of eyes how many eyes do billions of animals in the world have oh a lot how many eyes do trillions of birds flying in the sky how many eyes are there in the oceans lobsters I love lobsters shrimps and different kinds of fish trillions and trillions and how many billions of eyes do insects how many insects do we have who created this and you're doubting that Allah can make one like you you're crazy Allah can make trillions Like You by just saying Allah all what he wants happens with his will now Allah says among other things because we have to WRA up they will not feed me for dinner when you see this Perfection this Earth this Heavens these animals this creation this is perfect do you think Allah creates all of this and then okay game over what kalas noas we're destroying everything and nothing no this this is not possible Allah says then did you think that we created you uselessly and that to us you would not be returned so exalted is Allah The Sovereign the truth there is no deity except him Lord of the noble Throne Allah did not create this Perfection to dismantle it destroy it and then Halas go home what do you mean go home game over no I paid money I want to play play more I did a lot of good deeds Allah would not let people go unaccountable and this is why when we see what's happening inza and the killing and the murdering and the suffering of people do you think Netanyahu and his friends will go okay kalas you die it's over no there has has to be Justice and Justice is on the day of judgment all those who do bad the rapist The Killers the thieves those who take bribes those who make upon people there has to be be a day of accountability can we go on oras well I don't know they will kill me anyhow what are the benefits that we can reap from believing in the day of judgment number one when you believe in the day of judgment it is easier for you to wake up early at 4:5 to pray faure I slept at 1:00 a.m. yesterday to wake up at 4:15 come on 3 hours I need time to rest but when I believe in the day of judgment to said okay if I don't sleep I will get Jenna but if I sleep I will go to hell and what is 2 hours extra in my sleep compared to 1,000 years in my grave no I'm going to wake up I'm going to pray I'm going to do my Vick I'm going to just read my Quran and then if I need I will go back to bed so when you know that that there is a Day of Reckoning of reward Things become easy who wants to go for Hajj I want I want okay mashallah go who's holding you but Hajj is difficult Hajj is hard so many people food is not served on time I am hot the weather is not good transportation is late oh I don't want to go for Hajj but if you go for Hajj Allah will erase all of your sins all of my sins yes when is that on the day of judgment okay what about the hardship there's no hardship what's waiting for me is much much more and this is what means when Allah says indeed these disbelievers love the immediate and leave behind them a grave day who doesn't like clubbing and partying hey let's go to nightclub dance and twerk I can't twerk but I can even barely work I can't walk TW so yeah clubbing partying music dancing like I'm doing now well this is don't invite me next year I'm getting busy I'm used to speak like a she in a Podium and I know they making me go like in the circles anyhow sorry so everybody loves to party to have a good time to have a drink to smoke to do Haram things but when you remember that there is accountability this holds you back it refrains you so now I know many people who used to smoke cigarettes the best cigarette they say is after a meal would you eat lunch and you sit and drink coffee with cigarette best cigar it now after repenting after leaving it you say to them hm like a smoke they said you kill me and I will not smoke why it becomes so bad so bitter so distasteful because they know what awaits them on the day of judgment so we Muslims work for the day of judgment even if we can't see the fruit I'm giving you dawa do I see the fruits after dinner maybe inshallah if they put mango train or mango or maybe I don't know you do what you do with your children maybe you will not see them growing up but you anticipate when I'm in my grave when I'm on the day of judgment I will reap good Deeds the prophet saysat if the final hour comes while you have a shoot of a plant a small plant in your hand and it is possible for you to plant it before the hour comes you should do so what's the point the hour is 10 minutes away if I plant it the whole world will be destroyed the prophet says don't think like this act and anticipate paid the reward and you will be rewarded for that and this is why the Muslim is the most content person on Earth no matter what calamities happen to him he's content there's a difference between being happy and content when your son dies you're not happy you're content meaning go to the people our brothers and sisters in Gaza they've lost their parents they've lost their spouse they've lost the children how do you feel sad but alhamdulillah content go to USA go to Europe go to Russia my Shaha dog died how do you feel oh devastated I don't know what to do I'm going to kill myself over what over a Shaha one sister once reverted to Islam from Norway she called me in a counseling session she I've reverted everything is fine alhamdulillah but I have one problem said what she said I have a Chihuahua and I love this dog I don't know what to do with it said make hot dogs and the call was terminated anyhow so we Muslims have content because we believe in the day of judgment anything that happen happens is not serious because we will find the reward on the day of judgment the disbelievers can't have discontent this is why they have depression they have OCD they have suicide rates how many Muslims commit suicide maybe in your whole family and your relatives and your friends and your community you don't know even one person in America they commit suicide like crazy they overdose with drugs they take drugs and they die why because they don't believe in the day of judgment I have a problem so I have to run away from it anyhow my MC is doing the 100 spot to run come thank you thank you very much sh for the beautiful and amazing to all of us now it's time for Q&A session"
