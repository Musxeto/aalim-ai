  "transcript": "consider subscribing sister and she says what are the conditions under which a wife can ask for a divorce according to Sharia so marriage is a sacred bond between a man and a woman it's not between a man and a man indefinitely it's not between a woman and a woman this is a natural thing it's a religious thing in all religions that it's between a man and a woman and this Bond is tied with the name of Allah and according to the Sharia and therefore to dissolve it that would be a heinous crime unless there's a just a legitimate reason and justification for that and this is why the angels were sent to test the people and they told them do not learn from us because if you learn from us we teach you black magic and that would take you out of the fold of Islam we are a test from Allah don't learn from us the Devils learn from them as mentioned in verse 102 chapter 2 Surat al-baqarah they learn from them what they separate between a man and his woman and this shows you how bad black magic is to the extent that Allah mentioned one of the negative consequences of it is that it separates between a man and his wife therefore the prophet said Allah any woman who asks for divorce without a legitimate reason would not enter Paradise and that is a serious threat so a woman cannot just simply because she is on her menses oh she doesn't feel good and she says I don't want you polish divorce me this is not valid and this is a heinous major sin unless there are justifications legitimate reasons in Islam what are they in short if there is harm on the woman then she can ask for divorce what kind of harm real harm if the man is a cycle he refuses her to leave the house he refuses her to speak to anyone on the phone she doesn't watch anything uh um Halal not use the internet and he is keeping her as a prisoner of war this is totally Haram this is real harm and she can ask for divorce if he prevents her from seeing her parents and relatives she can ask for divorce if he is having rage fits and he has bad moral conduct he's abusive his words are really hurtful he always criticizes her makes fun of her looks and her cooking and abuses her and curses her and swears at her she can ask for divorce if he is really ugly and she's unable to look at his face that is where his wife could not look at him and she said had I not feared Allah I would have spit it in his face whenever I look at him because of his ugliness this is a legitimate reason if she feels from herself that she's unable to give him his rights whether an intimacy or obedience and that would make her a renegade and would take her out of the fold of being a loyal obedient submissive wife that is a major sin so in order to avoid such sin she goes for divorce this is permissible if he's impotent or is unable to fulfill and satisfy her in terms of intimacy if he does not provide for her financially and he is using her as a sugar daddy and she's the one who works and provides for the house very legitimate reasons for divorce and so on but if she asks for divorce for no reason I don't like him he doesn't take me to uh every year he doesn't change the furniture every six months he um I I just have doubts that he has uh Haram relationship no proof but it's just my gut feeling no this is totally prohibited and so on"
