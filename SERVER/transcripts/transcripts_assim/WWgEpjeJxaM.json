  "title": "Can I boycott my Parents and Siblings because of their Sins? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a brother says my parents allow my sister's to travel alone and also allow them to take part in mixed gatherings I tried to make them understand the seriousness of this matter but they take it very lightly I work in another state so can I stop talking to them and stop talking to my parents just to make them realize first of all this needs a lecture by itself what is the ruling on abandoning and boycotting a Muslim for the sake of his sin this was done by the prophet alayhi salatu salam who is the prophet and ordered the rest of the people of medina to do the same when three of his companions did not go with him to the Battle of Tabuk on the ninth year of hijra without any justification or a legitimate reason and they by coated them for fifty days until allah revealed their innocence and repent accepted their repentance in Chapter nine of surah at-taubah also we have other narrations to prove that the Prophet as I'm used to boycott any of his household whenever they would lie so if he heard the lie from them they would by cut he would by cut them until they repent and show remorse however in your case my friend definitely goes without questioning that boycotting or abandoning your parents is out of the question it's totally Haram it's a major sin you are not even allowed to be disrespectful or to raise your voice against them let alone by caught them your sisters follow their father and it's his responsibility to give them the green light and he's the one who's going to be held accountable on the day of judgment and not you now you living in another state how would your sisters perceive you oh my nagging brother my police brother every time he talks to us don't do this don't do that you to cover up you have to not attend mixed places and this is all what we hear from him they would never accept your Dawa they would never take you seriously so what to do share forget it no focus on the positive side encourage them give them a sweet talk talk about normal things that they are interested in and once you are certain that they love you they respect you they believe that you want the best for them maybe then you can talk to them and logic with them and strengthen their a man but to monitor them and to just to police them over these issues though there are serious issues but it's not your call it's your father's call he is their Guardian and he will be held accountable on the day of judgement and he might also be thrown into hell because of his irresponsible behavior with them this is how I see it in Allah knows best"
