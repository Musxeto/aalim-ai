  "transcript": "Muhammad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. I was going through this book titled Collection of Authentic Invocations by Sheikh Albani recently and there is this expert that caught my attention under the title Seeking Refuge Upon Looking at the Moon. It says that the Prophet ï·º once looked at the moon and said and I quote, Oh Aisha seek refuge with Allah from the evil of this for indeed this is the evil of the darkening night as it comes with this darkness end quote. Underneath Sheikh Albani writes in his commentary and I quote, this hadith shows that it is permissible to point with the hand towards the moon end quote. Sheikh unfortunately I'm a bit confused in regards to this. Is it part of the or is it a recommended act that whenever someone goes out at night and sees the moon he or she should point at it and seek refuge in Allah from the evil of the darkness that the moon brings? First of all I don't have knowledge about the authenticity of this hadith though I have some recollection that in the tafsir of chapter 113 when you go to the third verse and it refers to from the evil of this and point to the moon when it's full or the likes. So if we go to the commentary of the hadith probably we would find that when the moon is full a lot of bad things may happen, maybe some reptiles, maybe some insects, maybe some likes of harmful things would come out. When I'm not talking about werewolves of course because this is a fictional thing but again it's attributed to full moon and I think maybe some psychologists say that when the moon is full this is when people with psychiatric illnesses may suffer the most and it has to do with the tides and so many things that change with the full moon. So if the hadith is authentic and if we go to what the scholars commented on it most likely it would be related to this and to the verse of Surat Al-Falaq"
