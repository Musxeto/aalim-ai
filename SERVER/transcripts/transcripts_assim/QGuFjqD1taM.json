  "title": "Can we pray Funeral prayer for those who did not pray? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "our first question is from a brother who says can we pray funeral prayer of a person who used to not pray during his lifetime this is a frequently asked question and this is an important question because it helps me show you the process of the thinking process of illusional Jamar now we have a hadith that clearly states that a person who does not praise a kafir banal more evil shurkia will go free taco salad roll by Muslim between man and shirk or Co for is abandoning salat Allah had already been in Albania whom ocelot the pledge that is between us Muslims and them is prayer fermentor akka have occurred kafir whoever abandons it he is a kafir now this hadith and many more evidences state that a person who does not praise a kafir - Alistair no aljahmeir this is known as alko for or hokum Belko free a lumen it's a general terminology now the people of deviancy like Al hawa rich they would say ah okay who doesn't pray is a kafir Heidi doesn't pray my cousin so one plus one equals su he's a capital and this is wrong because when the Prophet says may Allah curse those who deal in Reba I don't go to the bank and say to people working in RIBA and loans and say may Allah curse you may Allah curse you may Allah curse you this is not what the prophet has some said he said it in a general term but to have it specifically implemented on an individual no this is a different story we have to ensure that the conditions are fulfilled and make sure that the obstacles are removed before confirming that this person is a kafir and this is why this is known as theoretical takfeer which is a piece of information and knowledge but to implement it you need to have the practical takfeer and therefore when a person dies now we know that he did not pray how did you know that I had never seen him pray in a Masjid he could have prayed home his wife said that he didn't pray maybe he prayed when she went to the bathroom or to the toilet or to the kitchen so you cannot judge a person as easy as that and get him out of the fold of Islam if he was not tried and convicted if a panel of judges did not speak to him and address him that what he's doing is a major sin and it takes him out of the fold of Islam and he was defiant and insisted not to pray if this did not happen and he died then the default is that he's a Muslim which means that he can be inherited which means that he can be preyed upon funeral prayer and we can ask Allah for forgiveness for him this is the practical way of doing it whether he is kafir or not this is in Allah's hands unless it was proven in a court of law that he was labeled as a kafir he is considered to be a Muslim and Allah knows best"
