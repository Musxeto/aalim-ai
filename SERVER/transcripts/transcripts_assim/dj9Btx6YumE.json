  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah remember the definition of Purity uplifting the major and minor uh ritual impurity and removing the physical impurity so what is meant by physical impurity it's something that we can see we can smell we can touch this is what is meant by phys physical impurity and iter refers to every dirty substance that the lawgiver has instructed us to avoid so it's not oil or grease that is filthy that we don't like no it is what the Shar the lawgiver has told us that this is to be avoided such as urine such as feces such as the blood of uh some animals the blood of mances and and the likes these are totally impure and such impurity is divided into two types accidental impurity and inherent impurity so what is meant by accidental impurity this is what we all know of to be impure a a pure piece of ground a carpet my clothes my body this these are all pure when something comes and tarnishes it and makes it soiled or impure so if I get a drop of urine on my hand on my clothes on the spot that I'm praying on in this case this area becomes impure it has to be purified and cleaned how whether you wash it or use any means of removing this impurity and then we have the inherent impurity and an inherent impurity is an impurity that cannot be purified because it's something that is so impure that can't be purified uh um because of its impurity of itself such as a dog a pig a donkey donkey droppings the poop of dogs these are the the the feces of human beings and the likes these are impurities that are impure and will always be impure it has to be removed totally and there is nothing you can do about it if you wash a dog with Ocean or seawat forever it will remain impure no matter how many times you wash it or shampoo it or clean it so how do we purify an area that has impurities on it well there is three categories of imp purities major medium and rare and it's this is not has nothing to do with Stakes where it goes well done medium and rare but these are the three categories of impurity the toughest and hardest of them all is the dog's saliva and this has to be washed seven seven times one of them with soil or sand with Earth this is when a dog licks a utensil whether it's a bowl or a plate or a dish or a glass that the dogs drinks from we have to wash it seven times one of these seven times has to be with soil or with sand and the likes the normal types of impurity are the ones we know uh menstruation blood urine feis and the likes normal nasas or impurities the light type of NASA is the urine of a newly born male child that has not eaten solid food as long as the child is suckling 5 months old 6 months old and it's male then the urine is taken lightly the NASA is taken lightly in the sense that we don't have to wash it scub it and squeeze it wash it again no just sprinkling water over it making the water run over it would suffice why male not female this is the Shar that we have to abide by so coming back to what or how to purify the nasat it's very simple if it is a dogs saliva that we find in utensils we have to wash it seven times what about if a pig licked it is the pig saliva the same the answer is no this is only restricted to dogs any dog any dog whether small big it doesn't matter what type or species of dog it is and why do we use soil because this is what the Shar told us this is what the Sunnah told us some medical reports say that the soil or the Earth has this ingredient in it or substance that can kill certain microbes or germs or uh uh worms found in the dog saliva either way we we don't know we just apply the Shar and if there is any added value alhamdulillah if not we just do what Allah tells us to do this is part one of purifying such hardcore impurities what about the rest of the impurities washing them once is sufficient as long as washing it takes away this uh um the mass of the impurity this does the job if once is not sufficient and the mass is still there the impurity is still there we wash it again if not then we wash it a third time until it is gone usually urine and the likes once would suffice what about if there is mass found for this impurity like feces for example in this case we have to remove the mass the bulk of it we have to remove it then we wash the traces of it until this uh uh succeeds and removing this filth or this impurity remember there is a NAD who came to the Masid of the Prophet sallallah Alam and urinated in the middle of the Masjid the prophet told them to leave him until he he's through then he ordered them to pour a bucket of water on the spot where he urinated so the amount of water overwhelmed the amount of impurity and that purified it because the ground was made of Pebbles and sand and that was sufficient and the same goes with the rest of impurities now is water required to remove the impurity the the answer is it's the best purifier but if we can remove the impurity so that it does not exist anymore with any other means then so be it so you can for example put it under the sun for a couple of weeks so that the wind and the sun would remove it totally and purify it it can be we can use detergents that would purify it and likewise if we use dry cleaning where they don't use water they use chemicals but they bring us the piece of cloth pure and clean and and there's no traces of njasa so be it and there's no problem uh in that at all now what about if we come to talk about um the different types of of impurities the type that are discharged from private parts so what comes out of your private part is NIS with the exception of seen but what about urine it's NES you have to wash it off what about Mei or prosthetic fluid or precom this is also NIS it has to be washed off what about wedy w a DI wedy is a discharge that usually follows uh uh when a person urinates or in extreme cold weather or when he carries a heavy uh substance then it may be discharged it is also um impure and it's nudes and it has to be washed off in the same fash fashion we wash things um with water once would be sufficient and if it does not succeed in the first wash then we wash it again until it is uh removed and what if we have places that we're doubtful originally doubt does not impact certainity everything is pure until proven otherwise but if I'm doubtful whether there is Pur impurity or not I'm certain there is impurity I'm not certain where the place is but I'm certain there is an impurity I have to make my level best to guess most likely it's here so I should wash this area that I feel that is most likely to be the case and what about if that I'm certain it's in that area then definitely this goes it's a no-brainer you have to wash it either way if there is a possibility that it might be this one might be this one 50 50% but I'm certain that there is NASA then washing them both to be safe rather than sorry would be the best solution and
