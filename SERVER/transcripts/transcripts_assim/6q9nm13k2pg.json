  "transcript": "amiral from Malaysia uh she I just have one question of the night I was just wondering can I have an advice to become how to become a great Scholars just at the previous college such as but right now I'm just a regular student studying in business I'm just a Layman I don't know erotic I don't I don't make much the Quran I only know uh the family players in fasting so how can I so how can someone like B become a scholar what should I do and what university should I do uh should I go I mean so amiral question is an often repeated question High ambitions to be a great scholar like mimbazen and al-bani at the moment he doesn't speak Arabic he doesn't memorize the Quran he doesn't do anything except pray five times a day and fast Ramadan this means that you have to go to the basics if a similar question was posed to a professor in medicine uh or in any Sciences how can I be a doctor what would the doctor say you have to go to university and start from orientation then start your way up studying all the necessary Sciences likewise to be a scholar in Islam you need to learn Arabic fluently I'm not speaking about being a student of knowledge I'm talking about a scholar you cannot be a scholar unless you speak Arabic fluently and be able to understand what each and every word means the grammar The Sciences of it you have to learn the Quran read it thoroughly understand the meanings of it and if you memorize it that would be a very high plus but at least you should know the verses of the akam what it means the abrogated verses and the the different Sciences of the Quran you have to know the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah the authentic and the weak and the fabricated the books of Sunnah such as Muslim Etc you have to understand the science of us then you have to go into Fick of each school of thought beginning with one school mastering it then spreading to the other schools of thought and so on I'm talking at a process that may take you like seven to ten years minimum of four to five hours a day if you want to be a scholar and most people would say forget it it's like saying I'd like to be Mr Universe the best bodybuilder in the world how do I do this I say you have to manage your diet you have to hit the gym three to four hours a day you have to have a different lifestyle and this probably would take like five to six years I'm not including the anabolic steroids or anything else if you want to be natural lots of people would hit the gym for a couple of weeks and then say forget it this is too difficult that's why to be a student of knowledge is a very difficult process let alone to be a scholar it takes a lot of patience a lot of endurance a lot of Tolerance and not everyone can be able to do that so in order to reach your high Ambitions you have to start from scratch and Allah Knows Best"
