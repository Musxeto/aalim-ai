  "transcript": "uh sumayya from the UK my question is um uh the day on Tuesday just like last week I was it was the time of my period so I was expecting my period to come and I saw blood yeah it wasn't a discharge it was actual blood I was sure about that but then the only thing I was unsure about is the flow of it it was coming continuously like there wasn't a time that I was dry like it was continuously there and but then it didn't have the catching Force like um I usually get it feels like slowly coming and it was not small quantity at all and it was like that the whole day and until the night in the night time and during the night time is when the whole gushing and falls and you know the usual one that I'm familiar with came so my question is I didn't pray until the night time because I'm sure of what to do so is that my period the scholars say that once the flow of blood is established this is a woman's menses so if she sees yellowish or brownish discharge this is not hermesis it did not start yet if she sees a dropper too this is not her Menses because this is not the flow of blood but if you as you described you sow real blood and it's continuous coming on but it's not gushing yet it is continuous and it's and and a lot of quantity this is your period you don't have to do anything about your prayers inshallah"
