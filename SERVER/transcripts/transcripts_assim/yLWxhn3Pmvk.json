  "transcript": "Marcin says non-believers mostly asked this question why did your prophet sallallaahu Salem mariya Isha when she was just a child how do we respond to them first of all you do not have to respond to every question that you're asked if someone asks you in an appropriate question would you answer him so if someone asks you about a previous sin did you ever try champagne have you ever gone out with a woman and fornicated and use it or a stuff for Allah I can't lie okay yes I did or no I didn't know you don't answer such questions now if the person asking this question is someone who's objective who's fair who's just who's interested in learning about Islam no problem in answering him if he is someone who is just trying to tarnish the reputation of Islam trying to cast doubt in your mind avoid him and do not pay any attention to him but seriously Sheikh come on why did the Prophet as a salam when he was like 53 years of age marry a child of nine years of age this is unheard of wait and don't fall into Satan's trap gather information do your homework make a research to understand the circumstances then you can answer this insha'Allah with clarity and transparency first of all the Prophet was 53 years of age when he married Aisha was he married before that yes he was matted when he was 25 years of age for a quarter of a century he married a woman who was 15 years older than him so he married a woman of 40 when he was 25 and remained married to her until she died when she was 65 years of age this isn't the track record of a womanizer allahumma salli wa sallim ala muhammad this is the track record of a decent man in the prime of his youth being satisfied and content with an older woman for 25 years definitely this man is a decent person okay sure but again why did he marry this child after she died that is hadiza may Allah be pleased with her he married a woman his age so their Benzema she was also 50-plus years of age because she's a she was a widowed and she was alone and he wanted to console her by marrying her and I by the way before the Prophet proposed to her already Jubei ravana mother have no idea may Allah be pleased with him his father proposed to Abu Bakr for his son so he proposed to Aisha to get married to his son jubail but when Abu Bakr declined then the Prophet hasn't proposed why did the Prophet propose a racist because Allah ordered him to marry her in a revelation and he saw her picture twice brought to him by gibreel why did he marry aisha because she was the daughter of his life time friend his best friend Abu Bakr and they wanted to strengthen the bond so he married her but again why at this young age this is the norm at the time of the Prophet eras salatu salam this is the age that girls got married in don't judge their error with the standards we have today in Kyrgyzstan today the average age of marriage is from 10 to 13 in Mexico in some states they have that the age of marriage is 14 and in some it's 18 even the idol worshippers the Jews the Christians for 13 centuries no one had ever spoken about why is he or was he married to such a young girl because this was normal Roman hoppip who was like in his 60s married his friend's daughter the daughter of Adi who was a child of 11 or 12 years of age that was the norm Abu Bakr when his daughter have Homer himself his daughter have son when she when her husband died he went to Abu Bakr who was way older than hit him himself telling him or asking him to marry his daughter so this was the norm and if you are objective you will find that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam married a young girl married an old woman married a widowed married the daughter of his fierce enemy abu sufyan married the daughter of a jew married different types and arrays of women to collect and combine and join the community and the society and he married her because of her wit and intelligence and intellect he knew that she would teach his Ummah which actually happened the affairs of her religion so this is in a summary why he married her may Allah be pleased with her"
