  "transcript": "hadith number three hadith number three was mentioned in chapter number two dutifulness to one's mother the authority of malawia even what's his name in arabic i don't know um may allah be pleased with him that the prophet said that he asked the prophet you're all prophet of allah who should whom should i be dutiful most he said your mother then your mother then your mother then your father then the next nearest relative and then the next nearest so this hadith talks about the issue of being kind to your mother more than anyone else why why does islam encourage us to be more tolerant more kind to the mother than the father first of all by experience who do you fear most father or the mother father no one thinks twice you fear your father more than your mother that's why you always take the shortcut mother i need this i need that why ask me ask your father no no no no i cannot ask him you ask him so you keep on insisting on your mother more than your father my wife when it comes to waking up the girls for fajr prayer she spends 40 minutes waking them up and she comes with years on her shoulders coming i'm tired i cannot do this can you help said yeah sure hey wake up immediately they wake up i don't know why i don't have a stick in my hand but this is something that allah has put in the father the mother can don't do this don't do this don't do this awesome they're not listening to me said bent meaning girl and khalas stops that's it i never beat them i never shouted them but this is sufficient this is from allah not because i'm a sheikh i know all of you have experienced this this is why it is extremely important threefolds than the father to be dutiful to your mother why the mother is weak the mother is vulnerable the mother can be insulted by the son or by the daughter while the father wouldn't be the mother had more has more rights over you than your father why it's the father who buys me the car is the father that provides for me the shelter the food the clothes the school what does my mother do the mother does everything she is the one who carried you in her womb for nine months and if you see the agony and the pain of labor us men cannot do this can can you be with your wife in in labor time no i cannot i sit and cry next to her i this is not i cannot do this yes i can go to the gym and i can work out for two hours without her i cannot have the pain she's having and after that sleepless nights for at least a year [Music] when the child is suffering stomachache breastfeeding not sleeping on time i usually kick my wife out live next door in the sec i want to i have work i have to sleep she has no problem so all of this and you go on from year one or two until you are a grown-up man and she cares for you whenever you're sick whenever you're hungry whenever your clothes need ironing whenever you have a problem you don't go to your father and say father i met this girl and i love her he will smack you in the eye you'll go to your mom she says how old is she where does she come from she is affectionate she has a lot of feelings for you she loves your success and she loves you when you fail your father loves you only when you succeed when you're when you fail you're not my son you're somebody's else but now when you are doing well he loves you your mother loves you no matter what happens even if you're a drug addict even if you go to prison even if you are the imam of haram she loves you and you're always her child until you get married then you're someone's else child this is why she's jealous from her sister from her daughter-in-law and problems come this is not our problem anymore let's not go into that so being dutiful to your mother is extremely important in islam [Music] in the book al-bukhari there is a hadith beautiful hadith it's not with us today when ibn omar may allah be pleased with him was in hajj and this yemeni man from yemen has his crippled mother on his shoulders so she's like 40 kgs nothing much but imagine carrying her all the way and putting her on your shoulder and he's doing tawaf and while doing tawaf he says in poetry he's boasting saying that i am my my mother's humble camel if all the rides around are scared i am never scared and i'm always carrying her uh with bravery and then he looked at ibn omar doing tawaf with your mom on your back i know people are shamed from holding their mother's hands in the market getting her out of the the car and getting her into the car helping her when they're 70 or 80 years of age ashamed this is not befitting why doesn't the maid come why doesn't my sister come so he says to ibn umar oh even umar do you think i have repaid my mother doing hajj carrying her this is something who can tolerate this ibn hammer said by allah you have not even repaid one construction of her labor even one pain of her labor just a single one this is not sufficient now compare apple to apple when was the last time you kissed your mother's feet when was the last time you brought joy into your mother's heart being beautiful compare how you treat your wife and how you treat your mother i will not go into rights because this would require probably a different workshop and it will make people angry however this is important for you to think the wife has to think how does she treat her mother and her husband although her husband comes as a priority this doesn't mean that you cannot be kind call her every day six seven times i know people who live in the same city see their mother only twice a week for half an hour from my relatives they come to see their mother for one hour a week they live maybe half an hour apart what kind of a sun is this if you don't stick to your mother's feet even if she's a kafir even if she's not a muslim this is the time to show her the beauty of islam by being a real muslim see talk is cheap i can talk forever but you judge me according to my actions i judge you according to your actions not on how many hadiths you know by heart or what you do or what you do not do now if we look at how the people of the self used to deal with their mother you'll be shocked i'll give you a few examples zubair is the nephew of aisha yeah i'll be pleased with her you know aisha the mother of the believers he said if your parents anger you never ever look at them straight in the eye with anger how many times have your children looked at you in anger it's like a stab in the heart sometimes we do it and we do not realize it your father your mother says a remark you don't like what do you do you give them this look that they wish they had not brought you into this world because of that your mother says your wife did not call me for a whole week and you look at her like this you're not a beautiful son you're a bad son he says muhammad may allah have mercy on his soul one of the great tabirin whenever he was at the court of his mother he used to lower his voice to the extent that people thought he was sick just because he was in the presence of his mother look at the respect they had when you are at your mother's side what do you do you laugh you joke you raise your voice until your mom says lower it down a little bit this is not the way of the self he used to lower his voice until people thought he was sick one of the salaf his mother calls him from the end of the hall or the house and he says yes mom so that she can hear him and he thinks what have i done i raised my voice he frees two slaves he thinks that he had done a sin he frees two slaves for the sake of allah to compensate for his sin a lot of the salaf and this is narrated by a number of scholars they used to refuse to eat with their mother from the same dish why he says i'm afraid that my mother would have looked at something she liked and my hand was quicker now if you sit with your mom with a dish of fruit in front of you before even she looks masha allah he cleaned the plate white and his mother even did not reach out no the salaf would not do this they would always give preference to their mother let her eat after she's finished and satisfied you may try to eat as well a man came to the prophet allah wanting to perform jihad so the prophet asked him is your mother there he says yes she's alive she'd stay with her he asked him twice he asked him three times and then the prophet told him stick next to her feet because paradise is there [Music] now compare this hadith to the many youngsters who come and say we want to go to syria for jihad we want to go to iraq for jihad we want to go to afghanistan we want to go to this and that for jihad masha'allah good what did the prophet say alas stick close to your mother's feet sheikh this is difficult to stay next to my mother's feet and obey her this is difficult i'd rather have a bullet this is strange people do not understand islam as it's supposed to be there are priorities follow the priorities you enter jannah follow your own priorities i don't guarantee that you will enter anywhere you want now one would say my mother is evil [Music] there are evil mothers yes are there are there evil mothers astral yes there are this is a fact of life however this is your test i get so many phone calls from sisters crying from brothers complaining of how evil their mothers are and they're right but this is their test from allah if your mother was kind loving compassionate and willing to do anything for you where is the test of being dutiful you have to be respectful and beautiful the test is when is the opposite you"
