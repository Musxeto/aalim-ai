welcome to lessons in fact today's chapter deals with menstruation and we have introduced this chapter last program and talked about some of the issues related to it and inshallah today will begin in breeding the hadith hadith number 118 narrated by Aisha Claudia low on her Fatima bint abou Haresh had a problem full of blood and a loss messenger sallallaahu re wa sallam taught her the menstruation blood is a dark recognizable blood so if they've come then avoid fryer and and if it is the other like color blood then perform wood meaning ablution and oversaw for ladies blood is for that is the blood of a vein and in the Hadees of asthma been obese for diallo on her reported by abu daoud the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said she should sit in atop and when she sees a yellowish color of the surface of the water she should take a bath once for the zoo in assert prayer and take another bath for the Maghrib and Isha prayers and take a bit once for the fajr prayer and in between this time she should perform ablution before of performing any egg of worship which rests purification this hadith deals with menstruation and it deals with it in the sense that lots of the problems caused by menstruation is when a woman has this bleeding and it's mixed with menstruation if a woman only has menstruation then she has no problem the minute she sees the blood she stops from praying refrains from praying and the minute that blood stops she goes back again but the problem is with the times that she's not certain whether this is ministration or it's just normal bleeding Fatima bint ABI Hebei she was one of the female companions of the Prophet Allah saw Sarah among others and they say that there were at the time of the Prophet I saw some ten female companions who used to have what we call SD Harbor which is not menstruation but rather a sort or form of bleeding that makes a person mixed up whether it is or it is not the monthly period so Fatima came to the Prophet is awesome and told him about your case and the Prophet asked her Salalah Salem to recognize the bleeding because menstruation has certain characteristics to it the color is black and dark different than the reddish color of normal bleeding the smell is not that pleasing different to blood and it is usually discharged it comes out accompanied by stomach and back pains while normal bleeding is not so usually internal speaking the monthly period is between six to seven days and some women are a bit longer than this others are quite shorter than this scholars say that there is no limitation for the minimum period meaning that it can come for just half an hour and it can come for a day it had come for six or seven days there's no minimal period for it but there is a maximum they say that it could not exceed 15 days because it's a monthly period and if it exceeds 15 days then it's exceeding most of the time and it cannot be the case normally so they say the minimum there is no minimum the maximum they say it's 15 days and what happens when a woman has this ISTE ha ha what does she do if a woman has this bleeding and she's mixed up she doesn't know if this is her menstruation or it is a normal bleeding scholars say that after looking at all the hadith we have there are three steps to be followed in sequence 1 if a woman is used to having her period in a designated number of days whether in the beginning in the middle or in the end of every lunar month she's she has a fixed a monthly period then this is quite easy for example if a woman since she reached the age of puberty he's used to having the first day of every lunar month until the sixth day her monthly period this is a period of her monthly period and after she got married after maybe taking the birth control pills and with all these things that increase or decrease the hormones and the food we eat and the things that we consume something happened and this monthly period or this menstruation was disturbed and she started seeing the blood for about 20 days every month this is not possible it cannot be menstruation so what would she do scholars say that she will sit my meaning sit she will not physically sit she will refrain from praying and fasting her usual monthly period which starts at the very beginning of every lunar month and ends on the 6th of that month and the minute the sixth day is over she should shower and start to pray though she is still bleeding because this bleeding from sixth day until the 20th of that month we considered this period to be st haba so this is number one which is that she should refer back to her monthly period that she is used to because she knows that for the past six seven ten years it's always been coming on the same time now if she doesn't have a fixed monthly period meaning that when she reached the age of puberty and she started to administrate three four years she had would have it at the beginning of the month in the middle of the month at the end of the month it's mixed sometimes she has it for two months she doesn't have anything and sometimes it comes ten days in a row so now she is faced with twenty days a month bleeding of course it cannot be her menstruation as we said that the maximum is 15 so so watch what she do she doesn't know when to begin and went to end as in the hadith of father limit abeja by the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam told her that she should look at the signs he told her that the menstruation blood is a dark recognizable blood so if it comes then a void prayer and if it is the other light-colored blood then perform a rouble so the Prophet is asking her to distinguish and as I said there are three signs usually a opening menstruation blood which is the color the smell and the pains accompanying it and women have a feeling they know so if a woman does not know when her period starts then she should recognize and try to distinguish which is which and the minute she distinguishes this is the beginning this is the end then afterwards she may perform a perform Moodle for every Salah and it doesn't matter what comes out because this bleeding is just a vein but what happens and this is the third step what happens if the woman does not know when her period starts or ends and is unable to recognize she's bleeding 20 days every month and simply she cannot tell they all the blood from day one to day 20 he's the same looks the same whether it's thick and black throughout the whole period or it's light throughout the whole period what does she do scholars say that she must refer to her relatives she must look at those who are related to her in the sense that she looks at her sisters she looks at her mother and she sits or she refrains from praying at the same time they're doing because usually speaking families you know girls and women in the same family shared mostly the same period of they they have the same period maybe it's because of the genes maybe because of this or that regardless they usually have the same period that's the family the females in the family share the same period in time so if this woman does not is not able to recognize which is which then she should look at her sisters if she doesn't have a sister her mother's if her mother's mother is too old she looks at her aunts her cousins and accordingly because she cannot recognize her distinguished she has to stick with them and presume that this is the period that she should refrain from fasting and consider herself to be mister waiting and afterwards she can easily perform ablution and pray now in the hadith of a smart meter amazed the Prophet SAW Salim is telling her to have obligatory baths for every two prayers the hora Nasser one bath monitor Manisha one bath roger one bath scholars say such as abu hanifa malik and the Shafi that is not obligatory and that this hadith this order was either obligated or the hadith is not authentic but to say what some scholars also say that such as an imam met he says that this is preferable its recommendable why because she is not certain if this is Priya period or not so she may perform a total bath for everything to prayers and this is what we call aljahmeir sori joining on the surface because one delays the just before Oscar prayer and she performs Mosul totally back total back and she prefer performs the her prayer exactly just before the event for us a prayer is is called and then she praised master prayer as if they were joined together similarly is with Mallory Manisha and Roger is by itself stands alone but again asking a woman to perform obligatory bath three times a day is asking too much though it's better for her veins though it's better for her bleeding because water helps her bleeding and it decreases it nevertheless we cannot make it as obligatory the scholars say it is preferable I think we have a short break we'll stop inshallah stay tuned and we'll be right back your life and ask other questions please what like that you have to comment on that and to give me how can I answer listening to the van a repeating after the Morden is similarly a highly recommended act of worship so how does he require tumor this is what you call it and invalid analogy because simply there is no comparison between answering four out of five in any exam and skipping a forever such as or a pillar such as a prayer no one is exempt from prayer except women during their menses the system solid also wants to know if a woman has to cover her feet when she spray before fokaha a new hanifa canonical Shafi'i you augment the diverse representatives of the foetus schools are in agreement it is haram Salam aleikum wa rahmatullah wa barakato and welcome back the following hadith was narrated by Hamner bin Josh who will read this for us a teeth 119 narrated by Hamner bin - Josh my prolonged bleeding flowed abundantly and severally so I came to the prophet sallallaahu Salam to ask for his religious opinion he said this is the result of a stroke or stabbed by the devil therefore you must observe your men's of for 6 or 7 days you should observe your menses menses for 6 or 7 days then take a bath and then take a bath when you see that you are purified and quick clean pray right and quite clean oh I'm sorry ok and quite clean pray for for 23 or 24 days and fast and praying for that will indeed I'm sorry sending my glasses ok ok indeed suffice you suffice you and do like this every month just as the order women men straight I'm sorry and are purified but if you are strong enough to delay the vote repair and advance the austere prayer then take a bath and combine the dog and Ostra prayer then delay the Mela rip prayer and advance Taisha prayer then take a bath and combine the two prayers do so and take a bath at Fed meeting dawn and perform the dawn prayer a Las messenger sallallaahu Salim said these two opinions this one appears two options ok these two options this one appeals more to to my liking meaning taking a bath at these 3 times daily ok Zek Allah here it difficult reading without glasses as it's difficult reading with glasses I have problems and look at it there's two small letters nevertheless we got the information we need it and this is exactly what we mentioned before the break is the same thing just as a reminder Hammond I've been Josh was one of the Companions of the Prophet era so Salaam it is said that there are three sisters all daughters of Josh Hammond I've been Josh Zayn have been Josh another one and they all had this is the harbour among one of the ten companions female companions that had this and Hammond up in Josh she's a well-known companion she was punished for saying something that was not true and lawful of Ayesha may Allah be pleased with her and please with her too and she was punished for that she is well known her sister is the wife of the Prophet zeyneb bent Josh and again I don't think we have to go through the hadith as it explains what we have mentioned just before the break nevertheless we say that it is not obligatory for a woman to have a total bath three times a day if she has this is the hub of this running bleeding but the Prophet says are some that this option is preferred to me he wants he likes this the Prophet Isis on that though it's not obligatory so if a woman has the power to have obligatory baths also three times a day this is good because the Prophet preferred this and it's awesome and it's good for her bleeding it helps stop the bleeding inshallah it would be considered as a form of cure and medication the following hadith narrated by omaha Biba Ben Josh so this is the third sister there's Zeynep man Josh Hamner when Josh um Habiba min Josh this hadith was read by Aisha excuse me hadith 120 I think it's ready alright narrated I saw D Allah who and her Habib ability just complained to a lost messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam about the blood which flows beyond the menstruation period he said keep away from prayer the length of time that your menses prevented you then take a bath and over and over and over prayers and si use to take a bath for every prayer okay this hadith was reported by Muslim so it's an authentic hadith and it tells us that um habiliment Josh did not perform three obligatory prayers three obligatory baths for during the day she performed how many five it shows you how strong she was because she didn't even want to have any slight a doubt that her prayer was not acceptable and it tells us also that a menstruating woman must not pray and this is not mentioned in the Quran right does it say that administrating woman must not pray the Quran no it doesn't and again this is very important nowadays we have Satan doing so many things to divert us from our right path and one of the oldest trick in his book is to not accept hadith so you find a lot of people you know showing that there are people of knowledge and their pious and when you tell them that the Prophet Allahu Alem said so-and-so say well excuse me I did not hear this from the Prophet so I will not accept it only talk to me with the Quran now on the surface this looks like a good argument because yeah okay the Quran is a world of Allah hadith we have weak hadith strong hadith by Sahih hadith entik unauthentic it's about a hassle and this is not the case at all because the holy quran is a general book that is explained to us by the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam by his actions by his deeds and by his words otherwise it would have many fish sufficient and enough for allah so gel to reveal the quran and have everyone has a copy and that's it there's no need for a messenger or a prophet this is not the case if we look in the Quran you will find that there are hundreds literally hundreds of issues that the Quran did not mention to us and without the sooner you're in trouble so whether you take it all or leave it all whether you take Islam all of it Quran and Sunnah or don't try to make up a new religion because in the Quran it doesn't tell you that you have to pray five prayers in the day and night it doesn't tell you when to start and when to end it doesn't tell you that fajar is rhetoric our mother is three and the rest are four Rakas it doesn't tell you what how to do them how to prostrate how to bow it doesn't tell you what to read and what to recite does it tell you about zakah how what's the percentage to pay on your gold and silver and what should what's the percentage to pay on currency or on the products that come from the ground you know your crops and and fruits and vegetables it doesn't tell you what you pay for your cattle for sheep or cows camels how much it doesn't tell you all of these things there are so many things that it doesn't tell you and it doesn't tell you that a menstruating woman must not pray only the only the Sunnah tells you so so you can separate them when that is why the Prophet erase a lot Sarah warned us and said beware I don't want I do not want to hear that a man sitting you know on his couch leaning down on it and saying listen listen whatever is in the Quran we accept whatever is not in the Quran we reject this is unacceptable prophet world and said salah salem i have been given to the quran and similar to it with it which is the revelation of sunnah the prophet does not talk anything except in accordance to the revelation of sunnah the quran is different allah jalla tells him to say something but in the sunnah he makes his own judgment he says what allah still tells him or he thinks is right if it's wrong immediately allah will correct him as we've mentioned this before brothers do you have a question we find few of people that reject Sunnah because they believe that our Quran is revealed by Quran is protect by Allah so there's no change inside it but can we say to the people who rejected the Sunna Kavya or not well this this is a very important thing it is not our job to label people it's now this is the the talk of the hour if you begin looking around and labeling people you'll end up in isolation so this guy rejection is kafir this guy does not put his right hand on his left hand while praying he's kafir this guy different we put your right hand on your left hand I mean that in holy quran days many first that a lot of automatic Omarosa for who do and how come an event out at a Almaty or Russell amerimike oh yeah Oh what you say first is fine completely understand what you're saying but now to say that a person is a kafir or not there are conditions that have to be fulfilled and there are restrictions that have to be removed and you cannot come to a person prostrating to Buddha he's a Muslim but he thinks that this is okay you cannot go and tell him you're a kafir this is an Islamic Lee acceptable you have to fulfill the conditions that he has knowledge that he knows that this is not acceptable that he is willing and that he's the power to choose and you have to remove the restrictions which are that nobody's come forcing him to do so he has no doubts or so on so labeling people is completely out of the question Allisyn that evil Gemara say that whoever does this is a kafir but we don't say individuals are kafir okay so it's a different story now if a person I tell you if a person refuses and rejection completely he's a kafir now I know that dick or Tom reject son he claims to be a Muslim he it depends only on the Quran I do not have the right to go and say well one plus one equals two whoever Jackson as a kafir he rejects sooner then he's a kafir no this is wrong it's a long process and you have to go through that it's a scientific process it's not for you and I it's for scholars to bring this man show him what wrong he did and to clarify things to him if he still insist and he persists on on doing this the judge will give his verdict on him I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program I promise you in sha Allah next time we meet we will try to elaborate a bit on this issue Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
