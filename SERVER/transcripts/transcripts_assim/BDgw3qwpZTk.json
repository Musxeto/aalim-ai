  "title": "Wudu water for evil eye, must I collect their snot & spit too? (For doing ruqya) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "when i want to collect someone's wudu do i collect the snot and spit and in the hadith what does sweating the garments mean whose garments is it and is the water poured on the head and if someone doesn't use a lot of water and will do uh is it and not much do you collect all the water on his head this is something that we don't have specifics of so this is why some scholars went to the generalization aspect and saying that no you don't collect the spit and the snort of a person who is making wudu for you because the hadith is just speaking about washing the face the hands the feet and the inside of the garment what is meant by the inside of the garment so my t-shirt the inside of it which touches my skin this is to be washed and the water that washes that area from my t-shirt is to be collected and again this is something of ishti had we don't have specific details of how it's been done the symbolic way of just washing the hands the arms the face without anything that might be unhygienic and the inside of the um the garment that is the one i have described to you and allah knows best"
