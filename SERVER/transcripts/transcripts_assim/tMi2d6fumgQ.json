  "title": "Can a woman in her menses give ghusl to a deceased? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says can a woman give a soul to the deceased while menstruating the purity of the person washing a deceased corpse is not of relevance so if a man is in the state of major ritual impurity or he is not in the state of voodoo does not have any impact on the action he's doing because he is washing a person who's a deceased so this is not related and likewise if a woman is in her period and she is washing a deceased female there's nothing wrong in that insha'Allah"
