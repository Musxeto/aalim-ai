  "transcript": "Al [Music] one of Allah's greatest blessing and favors upon us as Muslims is unity and this is something that Muslims all over the world are proud of as it is the essence for development for for prosperity for advancement in this life and if you look at our forefathers if you look at the companions of the Prophet you'll find that they do not come from One Tribe they're not siblings of a father and a mother they come from different parts of the world Bakr is from Arabia ban is from ABIA is from the ban or at least he was captured there Salman was from Persia may Allah be pleased upon them all yet they were United they were Brethren they were United upon the Quran and the of the prophet and nothing could have divided them and this is why they conquered the whole world in a number of years it is astonishing the development the progress that Islam brought into these beduins who used to invade one another attack one another had nothing in this life they had no value but when Islam came it transformed them into an a real nation that managed to introduce so much for Humanity and to civilizations now look at the Muslims around us they are originating from different countries different ethnicities yet they have what unites them their lord is one their messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam is one their is one their book they abide by is one and this is the greatest Miracle ever because this is the word of Allah that has not changed for the past 15 centuries bring me one single book that can stand such a test you will never find and it's not in a language that is not known except to a handful of people it's in a language that every single Arab understands so if you go to Yemen after Allah liberates it inshallah or you go to Sy after Allah liberates it or go to whatever countries are going to say may Allah liberate all Muslim countries because at the moment they're not United and this is what happens so if you go and recite an Ayah every understands it you will find that they pray the same prayer worldwide if you go to Siberia if you go to Alaska is m is three the rest are four there's no difference of opinion each has two s you find them that they fast the same month no one comes and say Ramadan is hot this year tell you what I'll pass and fast after 3 4 months no Ramadan is Ramadan no one comes according to their tourist office and say I don't want to perform Hajj with all these millions I'd rather come after 3 months can you book me and he goes on alone with an umbrella standing there what are you doing my what do you do no we all worship Allah in congregation in so even if you go to graveyards and you will go one day inshallah you and I we usually visit one day we will not visit we will go there to stay Subhan Allah do you know that any Cemetery any graveyard in the world for Muslims it's the same every single dead person is lying on his right side facing the worldwide this is the system it shows you that our religion is based on Unity whether you are in China whether in your Arabia whether you are in Europe once you see a Muslim you can recognize if he is a true practicing Muslim so you use the same greeting which isum regardless of your language now this Unity is a characteristic of our religion imagine a million five Muslims in one area shouting screaming talking sleeping eating doing whatever they want to do once the is given it takes 30 seconds for them to stand in a row that is so perfect no one can do this in the world not even in Disney World so Disney Mah we see the roads are straight and everybody's organized no one can do this in 30 seconds but you see this unity and they know if they do not fix their rows Allah will be angry with them and this is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said about the prayer that straighten your draw otherwise Allah would make your hearts different meaning that there will be enmity and we see this in sometimes in our masjids I'm talking about my Masid in Saudi Arabia the first line the first row after the if there's a gap and one wants to come into the Gap what what do the other two on the side do they try to not make a room for him try to annoy him try to make it difficult why this is not your home this is Allah's house so yeah but it's too tight what do you want if bring a couch this is Sal you should tighten your your Rose you should not leave any Gap so the hatred is in the heart we have a problem in our hearts this is why we don't have the unity we want Salat it illustrates our Unity when we pray five times a day in the Masid shoulder to shoulder greeting our brothers when they when we see them loving them and you can see this even more when it's a Friday F today tomorrow tomorrow's F Friday let's look how many rows in the Masid for f and 6 hours later let's see how many RS for J the masjids are full and people are praying in the streets where were they in they were working Shah you have late shifts a lot in Kuwait we have lots of late shifts in Saudi Arabia nobody comes in for f we have have a problem then you find this even bigger inid mashallah the whole um is going for Eid prayer some people who do not pray at all the whole year not even Friday this is something you have to attend and then you come to Hajj where you see it manifested in front of you when four or five million Muslims come together and you can see the harmony now disunity dispute differences among Muslims is a cause of Destruction this is known from our religion Mas may Allah be pleased with him tells us that he once heard a man heting the Quran so he heard something different to what he heard from the prophet so he went to the prophet and said oh prophet I heard a man reciting the Quran in a different way that you had taught me so the prophet listened to him and said both of you are correct why this is the seven and this is not our topic but you know that it was revealed in seven dialects and all from Allah what we know nowadays is one di so it is applicable yet the prophet said told abdah do not differ do not differ with one another because those before you they differed with one another and they were destroyed this brought destruction upon them so the prophet is telling us unite and do not differ now difference of opinion is there between you and me you would like to eat briyani I don't eat bani there's no need for enmity or hatred among ourselves what is prohibited is when hatred and enmity [Music] arise abui one of the great Scholars of uh uh the first three generations he said I disputed once with an IM sha you know who a shaf and we departed we could not solve the dispute he says Hal and I say har he gives evidences from the Quran I give from the Sunnah so we differed and we departed he said at night he came and knocked on my door so I said who is it he said Muhammad IDR so I thought who's this of course Sha's name is Muhammad but he could not consider that that this is the great Imam so when he opened the door he saw a shaf and he the shaf took his hand and shook it with love and friendship and said Abu can't we differ in opinion yet still be brothers in Islam says I have never seen anyone wiser than a sh you and I may differ on whether I put my hand over my chest or under my belly and we would yeah fight over it and maybe not talk for 20 or 30 years over what over silly things not that the is Sil but if I decided to pray with my hands down is my prayer valid of course so why differ with one another because of where to put my hands at prayer this is not logical anything that causes hatred and enmity among the Muslims is prohibited in Islam and this is why Allah made intoxicants which is wine whiskey whatever and gambling prohibited even if we play play cards okay I say whoever wins will buy uh uh uh the loser will buy him dinner and we play and I win how would you feel when you buy me dinner you will feel that you have lost and you will feel like a loser and you won't like this this is gambling so Allah says Satan only wants to cause between you animosity and hatred through intoxicant and gambling and to avert you from the remembrance of Allah and from prayers so will you not deess so this is one one of the great reasons why Allah made drinking Haram people say what's wrong with being a social Drinker it's a wedding and this is champagne I drink a sip or two I'm not going to be wasted I will not have a hangover but it is Haram because Allah prohibited even a single drop even if you go to a restaurant and say that w we have this steak but we cook it with some Brandy we burn it it's gone but it gives it a good taste Haram not even a single drop even in selling and buying transactions making money if it involves disunity among the Muslims it is prohibited but I'm going to make a profit out of it we think that if I make a profit then I'm smart and you're not and I manage to get your money by being smart Allah the prophet said do not envy one another and do not bid one another out for raising the price this Hadith is a long Hadith very powerful it requires a lecture by itself because it has so many uh good meanings and and lessons we can learn from the prophet says do not bid one another out of raising the price there is an item and it's being optioned and five of us collaborate to fool our brother so he says one one fths I say 10 he says 50 he says one so the sixth person thinks that it's of a value so he raises the price more than what he deserves the prophet said this is cheating and it's Haram if he were to know he would hate all of us even if we had the longest beards the prophet says and do not hate one another or nurse grudges and do not give your back to each other all of these Acts cause enmity the prophet sayam and do not enter into a transaction when your brother has entered into that transaction not even to propose I know abdah proposed to FAA and she accepted I am envious so I propose to F I'm rich I'm more handsome as you can see I'm more influential and she accepts how would abdah feel for breaking his engagement he would hate my C this is Haram the prophet said you should not propose when you know that your brother has why because this causes disunity Etc the prophet said it is not permissible for a man to abandon his brother for for more than 3 days when you meet one another each one looks the other direction and the best of them is the one who begins Salam why did the prophet give us 3 days why didn't he tell us that it is prohibited for a Muslim to abandon his his Muslim brother for one second because Allah knows that we're human you made something that made me angry and I'm human I could not suppress my anger but Allah gave me only 3 days to vent and to cool down after 3 days you cannot exceed that you must reconcile with your brother you see him you say this doesn't mean I have to invite you for dinner but at least there is this bond between us that we have still Muslims exchanging Salam now this Unity is apparent obvious when the prophet migrated to Medina the first thing he did was to make everyone from the immigrants from migrants from Madina he assigned someone from Medina from the to be his brother so the prophet made Salman and Abu D Brothers ABD and brothers and brothers and so on to the extent that if one died the other would inherit him and this remained for a period of time until it was abrogated in chapter uh 8ah at the very end of it being united being one is bar it's a blessing from Allah not only in major things even in small things such as eating the companions of the Prophet complained once to the prophet they said oh prophet of the food is Never Enough we travel with you and the food is not sufficient what did the prophet say maybe you are eating on your own he said yes each one takes his plate and sits under the shade eats alone so the prophet said don't do that eat together and do not disperse each one eating on his own so joining the congregation in eating gives you bar and Subhan Allah this is noticeable when we get little food and there are like five or six people if we gather and eat from the same plate it suffices and everyone is full if we sayah and we eat but if each one puts in his plate immediately the the food is over and we're still hungry and this is part of the blessing of Allah through unity and the Bara goes Whenever there is this unity and division there is no bar and Baraka needs a a lecture by its own by the way because everything we do requires Baraka do you need Bara in your health yes what time do you guys sleep usually in in qu in in jinda where I come from we wake up at 9: p.m. so I don't know if you're sleepy or so do we need Baraka in our wealth do we need bar in our children do we need Bara in our time do we need Bara in our memory in our knowledge in our work we need Bara in every single step we make without the Baraka of Allah even your breath you inhale you cannot exhale if Allah doesn't allow it so we need Bara in every way but whenever there is this Unity the Baraka is taken out a easy example that you all know the prophet came into the Masid and two of the companions were disputing and fighting and their voices were raised in the Masid no you took this much from me no I I gave it back to you so it was something Financial so the prophet wasam came out the other the following day and he said Allah showed me the night of decree so I know exactly which night it is but I came to the Masjid and so and so along with so and so were're fighting and disputing with their voices raised and I was made to forget it and Allah uplifted it imagine the bar that we would have had if we knew that this night of Ramadan is the denied of decree which is better than a thousand months but it's gone because of this Unity of division of raising your voice and fighting with your Muslim brother and this is exactly what Shan plots for this is his work this is his strategy what is Shan's mission and vision well I didn't read the financial statement no you don't need to just visit his website www sat.com what what is his mission and vision to divide the prophet saidan erects his his throne over water and dispatches his soldiers in the world they come to him so one says I was with this man until he fornicated he committed Zena he said he did not do a thing tomorrow he will repent the other one comes and says I was with this man until he stole money he said he did not do anything tomorrow he will repent a third person comes or Shan small Shan he says I was with this couple until I caused them to divorce and Shan says you are the man and he makes him sit with him on the throne division this Unity this is what Shan wants the prophet says the ISL has given up that the worshippers in the Arabian peninsula where we are would worship them Shan gave up there's no possibility that you would find some of the worshippers in the Masjid taking a small Buddha what is this they said I have prayer of M no nobody among the Muslims would worship any uh devil or Idol this is a fact however he did does not give up by causing Discord among the Muslims so he will sow the seeds of Discord among the Muslims worshiping him no way but I I know he says that I can cause division among the Muslims I can cause hatred I can one single word that you say without noticing would cause your brother or your friend for so many decades to not speak to you what have I done Allah you said something you did not pay attention but I used to do pranks I do used to do practical jokes on him I used to do so many bad things yes Shan Was preparing him and now is the time so this this is the mission and vision of Shan imagine what is the best title you could have either to be from a or from the is there any higher ranki no it's not if you are a m or if you are this is the top anyone could find nevertheless the prophet called it stinks he said this stinks why the ANS and the M were in an expedition two of their slave boys were getting water from the well they fought one another they punched one another the Ansari boy went to his tribe and said oh an look what the M did to me and the muaji slave went to his people look what the an did to me and the two groups of great Muslims of an and M wanted to fight the prophet came he said what are you doing you are calling by the call of Jah pre-islam call leave it because it stinks they were calling oh the prophet called it it stinks why because it's causing division among the Muslims and this is what is happening today Allah tells us about our powers our strength will go and disappear if we disunite if we divide Allah says in the Quran and Obey Allah and his messenger and do not dispute and thus lose courage and then your strength you will lose your strength would depart and be patient Allah has prohibited disunity and Division in the Quran and there are so many ayat the time does not allow me to mention it to you but listen to this Allah says and do not be like the ones who became divided and differed after the clear proofs had come to them and those will have a great punishment don't be like them Allah tells you look at the Muslims they are exactly like them we are so de divided among ourselves we have these imaginary borders between countries yet each one thinks that his country is the best his ethnicity is the best his tribe is the best and no one looks at what Allah looks at Allah says in the Quran indeed those who have divided their religion and became sects you oh Muhammad are not associated with them whenever you make a sect a cult that is not related to Quran and Sunnah and you think that we are the Elite we are the best and everyone is the scum of the world Muhammad s our Prophet is not from Among Us he's not happy to be one of you this division this this Unity is what the prophet clearly warned the Muslims off when he said that the Jews have divided into 71 cult or sect the Christians have divided into 72 sects the Muslims will be divided into 73 sects all of them are in Hell except one so the companion said which one a prophet of Allah he said the vast majority of the Muslim um and in another interpretation or another Hadith authentic he said whoever is on what me and my companions are on so you want to know if you are part of the JAMA you want to be to know whether you are among the same sect or not compare your lifestyle compare before that your belief your Creed your in accordance to the of the prophet and his companions and of those three favored uh uh uh uh generations and then you can tell accordingly so Unity is a very important topic but it's fast and it has so many branches that we would not have enough time to talk about but the one minut qu question I don't think there is a a currency that is more bigger than the DIN and this is deceiving W when you come and buy something he says [Music] what and then when I go home any so the question that poses itself what do we unite on what kind of unity are you looking for there can be no Unity Among Us except on the Islamic a no way we can unite because of a country or an ethnicity or a language the only way to unite is through the proper of the prophet and his companions so no mutual interest nothing of of such Allah says in the Quran and hold firmly to the Rope of Allah all together and do not become divided what is the Rope of Allah we look up and we don't see any ropes the say the of Allah is Islam and some say it is Quran and it's the same thing it all leads to the if someone says it's a Sunnah it's the same thing because you cannot have Quran without Sunnah we have those those who want to divide the religion and undermine they said we only believe in the Quran whoever says this and rejects the Hadith is an apostate is a CF because how can you only take the Quran without the Sunnah know the Sunnah has been written 300 years 600 years you don't know even the real Quran you don't even even know a letter in the Quran how dare you say something like this without knowledge and how dare you say we abide only by the Quran show me in the Quan that is and four show me how to pray from the Quran are you crazy and I can to speak endlessly about the benefit and value of the sunah that Islam cannot exist without it an is the miracle of Allah it's a complete book but Allah would have sent each one of us a Quran and not revealed it to Prophet if there was no need for the sunah h take a copy of the Quran read it implement it why did he send us the prophet to implement it to explain it to even complete things that needs to be told about and that is why he was given the Revelation other than the Quran which is the Sunnah so we have to abide firmly to the Rope of Allah which is Islam or the Quran or the Sunnah because without abiding by the stroke We Will disunite We Will differ and this is why the beauty of Islam you say left and I say right we're disputing who will judge Allah says if you dispute among you in something refer it back to Allah and to the prophet so Quran andah when you find the answer for our dispute in the Quran and Sunnah no muslim would say no I will it's an issue of dispute it's Crystal Clear in the Quran but what are you talking about there is no dispute in the Quran and the with the grace of Allah what should we unite upon upon Quran with the understanding of the favorite three generations the generation of the companions where the Prophet was with them then the foll following generation of then the third generation which is no one can be better than these three generations their understanding is the ultimate understanding of the Quran and the Sunnah do you expect someone to come 15 centuries now says I came to an understanding in the Quran that no one ever thought about a guy came in Arabia where we have so many things he said has a meaning in syani language mallah what does that mean he said I'll tell you every single everything has a meaning in syani language Allah says it's a it's an Arabic book and you say there another language and he gives interpretations okay where is from this interpretation he said it's an video he said I'm shocked how all the companion did not know this fact it's very simple how did the did not know how did none of the people knew this Subhan Allah Allah gave you revelation after 15 centuries claiming to know something something that all these Generations not know this is defense without any doubt so we would like to unite on Islam Quran and but also we must unite on something else what do we call our Creed Islam correct at the time of Abu Bakr anyone would say I am this I am that what are you Muslim Muslim when the sects began to appear and the deviancy and the Innovation and the different Cults appear the Muslims had to identify themselves so they used to use the [Music] name that's a very easy name why because you're not this is identification but why because among the Sunnah there are different sects so we abide by the which the prophet mentioned in his all the 72 sex are in Hell except one who he said how do we identify in his other whomever is on the same footsteps of mine and my companions this is the JAMA also part of the JAMA is that we surround we go around we abide by our Muslim rulers we do not oppose them we do not go against them as long as they are Muslims whether in hardship or Prosperity whether in what we like or we dislike we must as ordered by the prophet that we adhere and Obey even if he was a wrongdoer even if he was a transgressor now one would say why would I accept such a thing first of all because this is Allah's order this is what the prophet told you to do yes she but democracy we can do this we can have a revolution we can repel we you are going against the teachings of the Prophet we have dispute go back to the Quran andah this is what Allah ordered now the ruler might be someone who does not fear Allah he might lie he might take money from the treasury of the Muslims for himself he might favor his family yet when the Muslims agree to follow and Obey a transgressor unfair unjust ruler this is far far better than being dispersed or divided or disunited what did the prophet sayat whoever comes to you when you have agreed upon following and obeying a ruler and this person the second one wants to divide you and make you dis United the prophet said kill him and thei is in Muslim so Unity is so important that anyone who comes against the Muslim ruler he's a Muslim and then this is a very important thing as long as he prays and establishes prayer he's a Muslim he might have shortcomings who doesn't we all have shortcomings the prophet said whoever sees from his ruler something he dislikes something he despises he must be patient the prophet is telling you you must be patient because whoever goes away whoever diverts one single shiver from the path of the JAMA and he dies he dies the death of J of pre-islamic era imagine if you go against your ruler now this might sound a little bit strange because the mainstream all over the world is against this it tells you no don't approve of this you have to Rebel you have to uh uh make Justice sound rise over all you have to do this you have to do that and we heard about the Arabian spring they call it now it's changed into summer into Autumn now summer Arabian summer it's hot humid like Kuwait's weather is in August very bad but what did we benefit from the Arabian spring nothing we have four 5 million refugees we have killings we have destruction we have poverty we have chaos and Discord all the scholars of Islam since a long time ago they said there is no without an IM without a ruler and he cannot be a ruler if he's not obeyed when he says if your ruler tells you do something is it no thank you not today this is not a ruler and there is no J so the characteristics of the JAMA is that they obey and they adhere now we ask another question is it possible nowadays to have Unity among the Muslims from east to west we have Muslims in Singapore in Indonesia in Malaysia we have Muslims in India Pakistan Bangladesh San we have Muslims in the Arab world from the Gulf to uh uh uh the ocean in Morocco alers we have Muslims in Nigeria in Kenya we have Muslims in Europe we have Muslims in America we have Muslims everywhere Subhan Allah can we have Unity yes we can but on what because there are different sects there are differences among the Muslims can we simply blend in people have gone into too far extremes and we inshallah will try to take the middle path the path of the Prophet the path of what are the extremes one extreme says that we cannot at all tolerate anything that is not what we are believing in and doing so this is known as the bush way if you're not with me what you're and there are groups of Muslims are like this so if you're not with my group if you're not following and obeying my leader my sh then you are not from my way I will fight you to the day of judgment Subhan Allah why is this they focus on little things and they expose shortcomings mistakes as if a person has nothing good in him and in the far extreme you find Muslims saying that as long as you call yourself a Muslim if you are a if you are if you are if you are if you insult the Quran as long as you claim you're a Muslim you're okay you're among us and we will Co collaborate and cooperate and this is also wrong this is diluting Islam this is not proper Islam a man came to the prophet while he was on his way to battle and they were far below the number of the enemy so the prophet needed every sword they could use and the man said oh prophet of Allah can I join you he said have you become a Muslim he said no he said go we will not take the assistance of a non-muslim this is a clear directive from the prophet that Unity cannot be accomplished except on a however we as have love and compassion to all Muslims so I'll take you and if you make a mistake with love and care I will try to correct this mistake and if your mistake is within grasp and can be tolerated even if you don't coincide with my practice I will accept your mistake but when your mistake is something related to which makes you one of the 72 sets now remember difference of opinion in does not make a big problem why do we have four schools of thought school of abif school of Malik school ofam school of four schools of thought which one of them is among the saved sect H or all of don't even think twice you don't think twice how can it be all of them one puts his hand below the nav one puts it on his chest one does this in which one does that one these are all minor differences depending on their understanding of the Hadith or whether the Hadith has reach them or not or whether they think theith after reaching them is authentic or not he this is easy stuff the prophet none of you should pray except in B so the companions all left Medina going to B in the way the sun was about to set they stopped and said okay if we do not pray Assa the sun will set and we will miss so let's stop and pray the other party says no if we stop and pray then we have disobeyed the prophet so they differ a group prayed and a group went on once they reached B they spoke to the prophet and they told him about what they had done the prophet did not command a single word he didn't say to them you did well or you did bad and they did not fight one another you Infidel you prayed against the instruction of the Prophet no you Infidel you made the sunet and you not pray you don't believe in Allah and you C nothing which shows you that such difference of opinion is accepted one says you have to pay zakat for women's jewelry the other says no it's not a Muslim this is your opinion this is your opinion there are following that opinion that opinion difference of opinion but when it comes to here we have to put the red flag this is a noo Zone when someone says for example and this is probably you hear this when we say to the children where is Allah the answer is up the Heavens the word in Arabic Fe is a preposition which means in such as when I say the pen is JB but this is not the interpretation of the Hadith it's one way of inter interpreting it fee can also be on over or on top and this is what means Allah is not surrounded by the heavens Allah is over on top of the heavens as in the [Music] Quran is selling the sorcerers who converted to Islam I will crucify you in the trunks of the trees in the trunks of the trees no here it means on the trunks of the trees a second meaning for a in Arabic language is height so as is is synonymous to height so Allah is in the height meaning Allah is high so nowadays we find people say no don't say this why says no this is an innovation the prophet is the one who asked the slave girl when one of the companions slapped her face she was a slave she was a shepherd and a wolf came and ate one of her sheep when he came to know that he was angry he slapped her then he felt remorse so he went to the prophet told oh sorry Prophet I did something wrong he said bring the girl so the he brought the girl and the first question the prophet asked oh girl where is Allah she said in the height or over the heavens then he asked a second question who am I she said the prophet of Allah the prophet said set her free because she is a Believer we teach our children this now there are sex saying no Allah is not in the heavens or over the heavens Allah is everywhere subh this is a breach of our belief in someone says you cannot describe Allah as this or that you can not describe Allah except with seven attributes which is hearing uh uh seeing uh living wanting speak speaking etc etc etc and all the attributes of Allah in the Quran said no we will twist the meaning of it one says that Allah doesn't know what's going to happen in the future Allah does not decree what will happen Allah does this Subhan Allah these things we cannot compromise if someone says Allah is the creator but there are people who control the universe so we go to dgas we we go to the dead people and we ask them to do things for us and they do this for us someone says that the prophet is alive and he is Among Us and people can give pledge of allegiance to him in person you know that there exist these people they say if you say mamad 500 times every single day you will not die until you see the prophet live nothing in a dream and some of their peers and say in their books and their lectures that we went to Medina and we shook hands with the prophet from the from the grave and I was telling them why you pull him out he would have solved our problems if you shook hands with him bring him out he says he said I as well what you're saying is crazy what you're saying is insane is not related to Islam it's completely against the religion of Isam so there is no compromise someone says that yes there is no muslim except the who follows and believes what I believe and others say terrorist ra all Muslims we should join forces and join hands therefore we must always remember that we are one nation no matter what your color is what your land language is what your ethnicity is whenever you're asked you say proudly I am a Muslim and we're United on the on the Quran and on the Sunnah we cannot find any room for our own interests because all what concerns us is Islam and our point of reference is always the Quran and the Sunnah Allah says and if you differ in anything among yourselves refer it to Allah and his messenger if you believe in Allah and in the last day finally the enemies of Islam have discovered our weak point which is division they have this same divide and conquer or divide and Rule they have applied this in all Muslim countries India was once a whole they divided it into what you see before that centuries ago and theia Spain Portugal the Muslims reigned for eight centuries not one year 10 years 100 800 years they have ruled but when you read the history W you cannot control yourself from weeping and crying they went into so many visions and struggle for power it's this chair that makes people crazy once they assume power and sit on the throne they went to the extent of joining forces with the CF against their Muslim Brothers which makes this as aier of Islam and this shows you that in 8 centuries if Islam was a religion of compulsion they would have forced everyone to become Muslim in India so many centuries they've ruled if they compell them to accept Islam they would have but there is no compulsion in Islam but at the same time there is no fairness in what they had done spending Millions over the duration of 20 years to build a grave on his wife's grave and called it Taj Mahal and using so many resources and so many people how can you call people to Islam when you enslave them like this so whenever there is inequality Whenever there is Discord and disunity and division Islam will not prospers but the religion of Allah will always prospers so it is us who will be on the losing end it is US whom Allah would take us away and bring fresh people who would abide by the Quran and the Sunnah who would unite who would come to a point of reference which is the Quran and the Sunnah and this would cause them inshallah to be victorious I pray to Allah that he unites the Muslims I pray to Allah that he unites Us in this beautiful country I pray to Allah that he unites our communities to be as one not to differ to make us go to our Scholars local Scholars and to listen and adhere to what they say not to listen to Tom Dick and Harry to be and to do as much as we can to remain United small differences between us can be overlooked as long as we have the Target in front of us and that is the prosperity of Islam the victory of Islam the development of the Muslims but when each one of us think only of his own interest only of his own ego and refuse to come to logic to wisdom and to consult the scholars we will remain divided until Allah takes us away and bring others who would honor his religion and Allah Knows Best m"
