  "transcript": "uh sh I wanted to ask about the time of necessity for Asser prayer here in my area the congregation prayer starts at 5 and hanafi starts uh ass at 4:40 and Shafi at 3:30 so and by five the shadow is at least three times the original length can I play with them in congregation do you do you have any other alternative most of the mocks around my area pray around that time if you don't have any other alternative and you're stuck between praying alone but at the beginning of the time or praying with the congregation but by delaying it to the time of necessity the answer would be pray with the congregation and Allah Asel is most forgiving most merciful but do not pray alone"
