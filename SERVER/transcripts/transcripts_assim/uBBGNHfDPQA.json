  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So my question is One time I was praying Fajr and I said the Adhkar of Sujood. I went to Sujood and I said the Adhkar only once and I wanted to get up and as I was getting up, I don't know when I got distracted but my mind just went out of the Salat a bit and I came back to the Salat kind of got distracted and I found myself still reciting the last Alif of Rabbiyal A'la and I doubted like did I say this Alif inside the Sujood so I didn't perform Sujood quickly like I didn't touch the ground once and I didn't come up so am I supposed to repeat the Salat? I ignored it because I had OCD so I didn't want to go to Sujood again No, there is no need for you to make the Salat again Alhamdulillah"
