  "transcript": "My second question is that in Sayyidil Istighfar we say that, O Allah, You are my Lord, and I am held in the right to be worshipped except You. You created me, I am Your servant, and I abide to Your covenant and promise as best as I can. Does it come under making an oath or any kind of pledge, sir? Okay, I will answer inshaAllah. Thank you, Sheikh. BarakAllahu Fikih. As for Aqeela's second question, which is about Sayyidil Istighfar, I am upon Your pledge and promise that I promised not to sin and to fulfil my dues and obligations to the best of my ability. This is not an oath. This is saying that I am doing my level best to the best of my ability. It's like saying, Wallahi, I will not do this inshaAllah. So saying inshaAllah means that you're not obliged to fulfil such an oath because you made a condition. And saying to the best of my ability is also stating a similar condition, and Allah Azza wa Jall knows best. That's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azza wa Jall, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
