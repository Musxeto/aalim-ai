  "transcript": "of the wives of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam one of the mother of the believers was an honorable woman from a respected family from Quraysh she was the cousin of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam which clearly indicates to Muslims that there is no prohibition none whatsoever even there is no kuraha or it being disliked in Islam for a person to marry his cousin as the people in the West may considered as incest in Islam this is totally normal the Prophet married his cousin the Prophet gave his eldest daughter zina to her cousin and he gave his own youngest daughter Fatima to his cousin Ali bin Abi Talib this was normal and totally permissible and Muslims disregard what the medical professionals may say there might be cases but this is not the norm and when having trust in allah azzawajal and following the quran and the sunnah and what Allah has made permissible we cannot come to medicines I medical science and simply scratch out what Islam says so if medical sciences come and say copying is harmful it can be infecting with diseases it does this it does that we say hold your horses you have no right to speak about something that is proven in the authentication which the Prophet had done that is awesome not only that he instructed and recommended us to do it so we have to draw the line where we tell medical sciences to stop if things interfere with our Islamic practices we simply tell them stop and know your limits what is proven in the Quran and the Sunnah even if the whole world including the w-h-o say that it is wrong we don't with all due respect care because we have our Quran in the Sunnah that prevail over all so the Prophet married his cousin this honorable woman her name was zaynab bint josh Bindra Bob Guiney immoral SD her mother was Omaima bent Abdul Muttalib in Hashem the aunt of the Prophet Allison the paternal aunt her marriage has a long story to it and this is what she is remembered for mostly if we go back in time when the Prophet Allah saw Sam was married to mother Khadijah her nephew Hakim of Nizam gave her a slave boy and this slave boy was abducted somewhere in Arabia and sold as a slave otherwise he's a free boy from a free family and from the Arabs so she noticed that the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam who did not have a son of his own as we know his sons all died at a very very early age and he only had daughters when she noticed that the Prophet RA salatu salam took good care of him she gave it to him as a gift the Prophet Allah so Allah accepted that gift and he loved that boy as his own to the extent that he freed him from slavery and he was known among the people of Mecca as Zaid you know Muhammad so they considered the Prophet has chosen to be his father through adoption and everybody knew that he was the son of Mohammed and he declared it alia salat WA Salam if I were to die he would inherit me in if he would to die I would inherit him and he was known they do maha-rathah to be the love of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as a son and his son who salem is eight was also the love of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and that is also a different story for another time Zaidan Haritha grew to be a man so the Prophet Allah salatu salam wanted to get him married so he selected his own cousin alayhi salat wa salam and it was well known at the time that there was this caste system which islam came to abolish and to remove there is no racism there is no caste system in islam and what would be best - practically prove that to the people than to marry a free slave to an honorable woman from parish so the Prophet Allah saw Salam as some narrations say went to proposed to zina zeyneb accepted thinking that he was proposing to her himself but then he corrected her understanding and said no I'd like you to marry Sahib no Haritha and she was shocked and refused how would a woman in my status marry a freed slave so the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam insisted to abolish racism and the caste system in islam practically so she argued with the prophet alayhi salatu salam as they were arguing allah revealed in the Quran it is not for a believing man or a believing woman when Allah and His Messenger have decided a matter that they should thereafter have any choice about their affair subhanAllah this ayah rarely will find Muslims referring to it it is obvious Allah decided in the Quran the Prophet erase or some decided in the Sunnah yet we tend to have second thoughts we tend to argue yes but why this by why not that and make our own decisions which goes totally against this ayah the moment saying I've heard this ayah me Allah be pleased with her she submitted her will to Allah and she said as long as this is from Allah then I accepted so the Prophet Allison was happy with that and they both got married unfortunately they both tried to make it work but sometimes hopes and wishes don't materialize Xena could not live with the fact that her husband is a free slave while she is who she is and her parents are who they are so there was always this resentment this sort of disrespect not being content which to xate may Allah be pleased with him he's not a blind my a blind man he can see he can sense and feel so he wasn't happy in this marriage he used to always go to the Prophet Alice or some and complain about what he's suffering from seeking advice or actually seeking approval for divorce because life cannot go on in such circumstances however they did not know that Allah revealed to his messenger salallahu alaihe wasalam that he would marry Zeynep after him and that Xena would be the mother of the believers so the Prophet did not a less awesome tell him this did not expose this and he kept telling him fear Allah and keep her with you so keep your wife and fear Allah and he kept on repeating this over and over again now it was 'unless plan subhana wa ta'ala the planner of all planners to abolish not only racism and this the caste system but also to abolish adoption and this is why in the beginning of chapter 33 sorted as AB allah azzawajal prohibited adoption where I take a son or a daughter give them my name make them Muharram to my relatives as if they are from my own offspring and giving them a share of inheritance all of this was abolished was totally prohibited and banned in verse and in chapter 33 by the way sorted as AB is a lot about this incident and a lot about zina may Allah be pleased with her so he kept on telling him do not divorce her do not divorce her until he reached the level where he cannot tolerate it anymore and he divorced her allah azza wajal revealed an ayah mother aisha said if the Prophet Allah saw somewhere to conceal any ayah he would have concealed this ayah but he can't conceal anything because this is from Allah and if he were to conceal anything allah azza wajal would annihilate him what was this ayah Allah says in the Quran and remember o Muhammad when you said to the one whom Allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor upon who's that it was eight whom Allah gave him the favour and blessing of marrying someone as such as Zeynep and had many multiple favors and blessings upon him so when Zaid allah says in the quran when Zaid had no longer any need for her we married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons so going back to the i from the beginning the situation was xate divorced his wife now it's your obligation o muhammad to marry his wife but she is my daughter-in-law according to the pre Islamic ideology of jahiliyyah well this is what allah azza wants to abolish so allah says and remember o muhammad when you said to the one on whom Allah bestowed favor and you bestowed favor upon keep your wife and fear Allah while you concealed within yourself that which Allah is to disclose and that is she becoming your wife and you fear the people while Allah has more right that you fear him why did the Prophet fear the people because he was afraid that it will tarnish his reputation when the idol worshippers would say that look at this man he married his own daughter-in-law but actually he did it because she's not his daughter-in-law and this is what Allah Azza WA JAL commanded us and proved to us in the Quran and then when Zaid had no longer any need for her and Zayde even know Haditha is the only companion mentioned by name in the Quran so you won't find Abu Bakr Omar Othman Aelita any of the companions at all only xate subhanAllah his name was mentioned in the Quran Allah says we married her to you in order that there not be upon the believers any discomfort concerning the wives of their adopted sons when they no longer have need for them and ever is the command of Allah accomplished so the moment the Prophet married are in salatu salam zina it was over the thought of adoption was gone and there nothing as such in Islam a couple are interested in a boy or an a girl to adopt they can do that but it's not called adoption it called it's called sponsorship so they take the child in the custody the child is called after his own family father and family name if we don't know who the family name or what the family name is we give him any name that is not related to us he grows up knowing that he is not our own child he's not our own flesh and blood and he would not inherit he would not be a muharram to my own daughter biological daughter because they're not related and he's not related to my wife either unless she suckled him before he was 2 years of age and he there are a number of conditions and rules regarding and governing this issue but the main issue is no adoption as known in the West at the moment so once the Prophet married her alayhi salatu salam it was known to all people that adoption is no longer existing that he's not his adopted son anymore and that they would not inherit one another Zana may Allah be pleased with her was one of the finest women of her time in terms of religious commitment in terms of generosity doing favors to the people in terms of fearing allah azza wajal and this issue of fearing allah azzawajal by the way it's extremely needed in our times yes you might find someone who's practicing with a long beard like myself and looks righteous and pi is short soap praising the message it but actually he doesn't fear Allah and you can judge that through his actions through his interaction with others and one of the scariest things we read in the Sunnah that one of the four characteristics of hypocrisy and there are so many of them one of the characteristics of a hypocrite is when he is at dispute with another he transgresses and I've seen this - Muslims used to being good friends best friends and for one reason or the other one wants to break the other and they start fighting and saying wrong things backbiting even lying and manipulating things I would've Allah this is a clear indication that they don't fear Allah zina did not have this may Allah be pleased with her and I'll give you an example one of her characteristics that she excels when it comes to be compared with other wives of the Prophet alisov salam is that Allah gave her in marriage to the Prophet as of Salaam from seven heavens from above seven heavens and she always boasts about this to her co-wives by saying that your parents your Guardians got you married to your - the Prophet as Salam I was married to the professor by the instruction of Allah the command of allah through gibreel the arc angel without any witnesses without any guardian without any Mahad all of a sudden the Prophet barged in the house as she was cleaning the skin of animals and this is known as tanning so she used to and with her own hands the skins and sell it and she used to stitch things and sell it and whatever she makes she gives to the poor and this was one of the things that made people praise her more than any other of the prophets wives at least a lot with Sam so she was tanning her skin of that ship and the Prophet barged in and she was startled in the beginning but when she knew that it was Allah who gave her in marriage she was very pleased and happy with it and this is why most likely the Prophet threw a feast and prepared food that is not the usual for his other wives where there was she there was meat and and and lots of good food and invited the companions to feast with him the hijab was revealed in that incident the ayahs in surat al-ahzab chapter 33 of not remaining in the prophet's house at a solemn after the food is over chit-chatting because this annoys the Prophet was also revealed at the day when the Prophet as Salam called the companions to eat the Prophet Allah saw some himself praised her but they did not understand except after his death when they asked him who among your wives is the first to die after you and he said the one with the longest arm in the beginning as we mentioned before soda was the largest in size so she was the longest in arm so they thought that soda is the one but they soon understood the meaning of the hadith when zeyneb was the first one to die because the Prophet was referring metaphorically to the length of her arm in giving charity to the poor and among what she's praised for is the compliment of other co wives which is different and difficult usually there is this rivalry between the co wives so each one is jealous from the other which may cause them to cross the line jealousy usually leads to crossing the line and if someone does not have support from Allah to fix their own shortcomings they fail the test because they don't have the fear of Allah Aisha says that Xena was sent to communicate with the Prophet that is a lot salam on behalf of other wives because he used to favor aisha and the people as we mentioned before used to send their gifts on her day so the other wives complained and said o prophet of allah this is not fair let the people send their gifts randomly not to specify the day that you go to our issue because then we don't get anything they first sent fatima they sent on Salama and nothing changed and then Zeynep came herself in the presence of Aisha to argue with the prophet alayhi salatu salam and that is a different story but listen to what i described zeyneb of which she came she said I never have never seen a woman so religious practicing and righteous she was the only one from the prophet's wives is awesome who was competing with me over the heart of the Prophet Isis a meaning that the Prophet loved Fatima loved Aisha as his favor wife but he also loved Xena due to to her beauty due to her lineage due to her relationship to him and so many beautiful things in her she says I had never seen a woman better in religious practice than Xena not pious as zeyneb not truthful as Xena not connecting to her kinship as zeynep and she was huge when it came to giving charity now when these complements come to you from your rival from someone who's supposed to be envious you should know what caliber zeyneb was not only that in Haditha - if that's a very long story where the hypocrites slandered mother aisha an accuser of committing adultery with sephora lmmortal may allah be pleased with him and the revelation stopped for a month and it did not give the prophet has some any hint whether she was innocent or guilty and the Prophet could not judge he believes that his wife is innocent he loves his wife immensely but this is a case that needs evidence because we have accusations so the Prophet did not know alayhi salatu salam three of the great companions of the Prophet RSS Saran slandered mother Aisha being affected by the gossiping of the hypocrites and they declared it the hypocrites did not they just whispered among themselves these three companions fell in the trap of the Shaitaan they were Mustafa the cousin of Abu Bakr they were has habit the prophets poet and there was or or the third was Hamner with Josh the cousin of the prophet o Sam and the sister of Xena by Josh she fell in the trap of the Shaitaan and she said that she fornicated with that great companion the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam did not know whether she was innocent or guilty he used to ask people for circumstantial evidences so he asked I leave now batalov he asked Sam Abney's aide he asked the maid then he sent to Zainab and Josh and he said to her and she's the co wife the rival of Ayesha and he said to her o zaynab what did she do or what have you seen that meg might be suspicious of her YCJA Zeynep said o prophet of Allah I protect my saying my eyes and my hearing I know nothing except goodness about this woman yes of Hanna law even at times where you can score a point her fear of allah azzawajal prevents her nowadays when we see men dispute or women you can tell there is no fear of Allah they don't see it you can judge it you can tell that these people don't fear Allah Azza WA JAL and subhanAllah she kept on living with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam a happy wife and a mother of the believers until the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam died when she died she stayed about nine years or 10 after his death being the first of his wife wives to catch up with him adding his salat wa salam and she is his wife Anjana during these years she did not change a bit she used to work with her own hands whatever she sells she collects and she feeds the poor and she gives to the kneading she had no interest in this dunya and one year ah Oh Marhaba may Allah be pleased with him the Caliph the second caliph collected money from the treasure of the Muslims and he sent it to Zeynep in what it was a big pile of money showed so she saw it as a burden and she said may Allah forgive her mark why didn't he distribute the money himself to the nine wives of the Prophet Isis and instead of authorizing me to do so so the messenger said o mother this is not for the rest of the wives of the Prophet Sam this is only for you and she said subhanAllah this is mine so she asked them to put it on a big plate and she covered it with a dress and she started to tell her mate get your hand inside take a fistful and give it to the house of so-and-so take another fistful and give it to the house of so-and-so and she cupped Shaykh she kept on distributing it to her relatives the poor of her relatives orphans those in-laws of hers and she divided it until only little amount of it was left and when they uplifted the dress to see how much was left they found 85 Durham's which is peanuts compared to what was there when she saw that amount of money she raised her hand and said o Allah let this year be my last so that I won't have to see next year's gifts from omec and she died that same year she was 53 years of age"
