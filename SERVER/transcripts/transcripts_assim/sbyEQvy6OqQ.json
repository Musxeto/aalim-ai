  "transcript": "[Music] 78 says good and bad both are from allah but the following verse 79 says good is from allah and bad is from us what do these verses really mean if you go to the quran you will find that these two verses are back to back and it cannot contradict the quran cannot contradict let alone have any conflict between two verses back to back so allah says in the quran what translates to the meaning when something good befalls them they say this is from allah but when something evil befalls them they say this is from you say o prophet both have been destined by allah which means that they attribute evil things happening to them to the prophet al-islam as a bad omen so if there's an earthquake this is all because of you meaning that you brought this bad omen to us allah says this is all from allah meaning the creation and the ordainment the pre-destiny of it this is from allah good or bad it's allah who created it it's allah who pre-ordained and predestined it fifty thousand years before creating the creation now the following verse says whatev um what comes to you of good is from allah but what comes to you of evil o man and the most authentic is o prophet because this is addressing the prophet is from yourself and we have sent you o muhammad to the people as a messenger and sufficient is allah as witness what does that mean it means that it is permissible to attribute events to the causes so if someone has an accident and the mechanics say the accident was due to faulty brake pads would it be sinful to say oh the accident happened because the brakes didn't work or should i say the accident did not did the accidents took place because allah pre-ordained it and it was this turned it yeah it is but what caused it it's the faulty brakes so attributing to things or events to the causes is totally permissible from this eye and there is no shirk in it there's nothing wrong in it so now i hope it's clear that the difference between the two verses is when the idol worshipers attributed evil things to the prophet salam this is not because he was the cause of it rather because they believed that it's bad omens and he's the cause of it and allah said to them no everything is created by him and everything was predestined by him but when someone falls sick or a calamity takes place or deaths occur this is because of my own flaws and shortcoming as the cause of it yet it was created by allah and predestined by allah and i hope this answers your question"
