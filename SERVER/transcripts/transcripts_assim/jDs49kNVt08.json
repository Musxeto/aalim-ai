  "transcript": "amatulla says can you put some light on this practice where people hang some big stone with a black rope not in their shops in their restaurants and homes they say this will protect from evil eye black magic and provides good business she says this is in most of the homes and shops in Bangalore I don't know if this is in most places there but the practice itself we have to look at it through the magnifying glass of Islam so if I'd like to know what's the ruling on me using a fan we look at it from the magnifying glass of Islam it says that is it something religious do I have any beliefs in it is it something that I try to get closer to Allah or to protect me or to bring benefit to me no it's just a pen that I write in the conclusion default is Helen go ahead use it so everything I do I have to look at it through this magnifying glass when I come to the question of a Mottola when you put a black stone oh sorry when you put a big stone and a tie a knot made of a black rope and you claim that this brings good business and protects you from evil eye and black magic any Muslim would tell you that this is not from Islam but if you go a little bit higher any scholar who has knowledge of Quran and Sunnah will tell you that this is an amulet this is a Tamim this is something that you put in order to prevent harm from coming your way or for bringing benefit and good things your way good business and this is there's no doubt that you're associating others with Allah this is why I pray to Allah I believe in till he said yes you believe maybe in two types of to hate the third you don't now you're believing that other than Allah provides for you this is why you're putting this stone so your belief in it that it protects you what's the difference between you and those who tie a blue stone saying that this protects from the evil eye what's the difference between you and those who tie a rope around their wrists or around their necks and they said that Mawlana has recited some ayahs and blue in it this is exactly what was mentioned in surah 113 min Sharia never hurt if you look at we seek refuge in allah azzawajal from the evil of those women the witches who tie knots and blow in them to cast their spell so all of this is shirk and it nullifies a person's islam if he believes that it brings good luck or it prevents black magic and evil eye so definitely this is totally out of the question and it's against tho heat"
