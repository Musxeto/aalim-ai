  "transcript": "I wanted to know about clear and ambiguous verses in the Quran regarding how does one know that which verse in the Quran is clear or ambiguous for example inat Allah says the hand of Allah is over their hands meaning the ones who placed Allegiance with the prophet now the would say that the hand means power or authority on the other hand the would say it is like the literal hand yeah it does make sense that the hand could mean power or authority but again how do we know which one which ver is metaphoric the attributes of Allah are they're not the attributes of Allah subhanahu wa taala are unambiguous and Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala spoke to the Arabs in what the Arabs understand so when Allah says that he has a face that he has two hands saying that he has two hands any Arab would tell you that this is definitely not power or authority or a favor when I say in Arabic I have a favor upon you that you have to repay so this is a favor Arabs know when I say this statement they know that this is not a hand that means that it is a favor but but when Allah mentions in the Quran to Satan why did you not prostrate to what I've created with my two hands not one hand all Arabs know that no this is not power or uh uh Authority because if it were an ambiguous word or a metaphoric it would not be dual it would be one so these are and all the salaf from the prophet his companions acknowledge this they've never had any of these doubts that the ashar or the mates have these are all came at later times of Innovations and corrupt AA the three favorite Generations had no issues with that none whatsoever and this is why the prophet saidat the best of generations is my generation that is of the companions then the then the so this is what the prophet indicated now ambiguous or not ambiguous mutab that can have dual meanings here and there they are things that we have no knowledge of but we believe as they are such as what will happen on the day of judgment how Heaven and Hell Is and the likes these we believe as it is but we don't go into it some verses of the Quran can be mut hat that is or that are understood with other verses so when you come to one verse that says whoever commits a sin and the sin uh uh incubates him and surrounds him then he will abide forever in Hell Fire the look at this sin and say okay this is kab then they take their AA saying that all Sinners who commit major sins are disbelievers and in Hell forever how you dare such a thing so we have this Ayah okay this is Ayah you have to govern it with other verses of the Quran and hadiths that help you and entitle you to understand but due to their ignorance they do not do this so I hope this answers your question"
