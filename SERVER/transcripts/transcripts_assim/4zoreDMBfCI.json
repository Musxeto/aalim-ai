  "transcript": "Ahmed from the US my question is what is the ruling on a security guard securing a mid during J and missing jum because of the shift would he be excused from jum due to this a security guard is someone who is obliged to protect their property whether he's protecting the Masjid itself especially in the US and North America and Europe where a lot of the islamophobes uh terrorists tend to try to attack the messes and the worshippers so it's a communial obligation upon them to protect the masjids or they're protecting a mall or an office building or a shop and again as their job is to protect the premises they're Exempted from offering jum prayer and they can pray it without any problem inshallah introducing NIS a privacy focused Islamic matchmaking app that follows the sunna no photos no chatting and a Wall-E involved matchmaking process find a Pious spouse the sooner way download NIS now"
