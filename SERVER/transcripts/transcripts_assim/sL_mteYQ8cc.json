  "transcript": "foreign foreign Muhammad foreign verses from the Holy Quran and comment on them the first thing that came up to my mind suratul Fatiha not because it's the easiest to recite but it is by far the greatest Surah in the Quran and whenever we listen to it we don't seem to relish the sweetness of Iman and this is an indication of the illness that we're suffering from and how sick our hearts are by far is the greatest Surah in the Quran may Allah have mercy on his soul says that Allah revealed 404 books they were all what was in it was summarized in four books the Quran the Torah the injil and the zabur and all what was on these four was summarized in the Quran and all what was in the Quran was summarized in Surah and suratul Fatiha is summarized foreign the prophet told them that this is the greatest Surah in the Quran it is so great it has a number of names for it it is it is called asalat it is called ashafiya it is called the prophet approved that it is and it is the greatest means of Rokia as well to those who do not know Allah azzawajal says in the very beginning and I don't think I'll be giving it it's statue well not the status it is I will not give it it's right it's due right when we summarize it in 10 minutes but it is essential whenever you recite the Fatiha always have in your mind the following the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam says whenever a person recites addresses him by saying I have divided the Fatiha into two between me and my servant so when my servant says Allah responds to that every single person of us Allah responds to him by saying my servant has praised me Allah says my servant have has complemented me Allah says my servant has glorified me Allah says this is between me and my servant into half um says to you when you're praying this is for my servant and my servant will get what he requested now look where you find your heart when you recite this beautiful Surah a lot of us don't even know what it means praise is due to Allah the Lord of all that exists praise and thanks alhamdul is not complementing Allah azzawajal you're praising Allah and you praise Allah not only on the blessings that he has given you but also on anything that befalls upon you even calamities you have you make an offer hunt for Allah and who is he is the Lord he is the sustainer he is the creator he is the provider and he's the owner of all that exists foreign is he Lord of vengeance is he Lord of anger Allah says he is the Lord of Mercy he created you to have mercy for you so if you obey him if you worship Him He will be merciful to you and what is the difference between is a description and a Rahim is of action and some say like Abdullah is the one who loves to be asked and Abrahim the one who is angry when he's not asked and some say a Rahman is for all his creation and Abrahim is specifically for those who believe in him a then we go on to Maliki yamuddin and he is the king and the owner of the day of recompense of the day of reward and Punishment and the word a Deen means religion and also means recompense and reward and Punishment and this is the one of the greatest verses of the Quran because it displays our humility our poverty our need of his support without him we cannot inhale the breath that we take and also without him we cannot exhale it is only because of him subhanahu wa ta'ala and that is why we limit all our our forms of worship to him and did not say no forms of worship except for him subhanahu wa ta'ala and you can look at the different forms of worship and then it comes the part that we need most and that is we need you in every single thing that we do in our lives without you there is no success no happiness no provision no health no wealth nothing would continue without Allah's Aid and help to us and then we ask Allah which means guide us to the straight path but we are already Muslims so what path are we asking Allah to guide us to Scholars say this means that make us steadfast on the straight path so if you guided us alhamdulillah we're Muslims we cannot guarantee to stay and remain Muslims how many people around you how many dies how many scholars have turned back how many regular people is it because of them is it because of the environment is it because of their families Allah knows best but we know for certain that it is not because of our own experience and strength that we are Muslims It Is by Allah's guidance to us so that is why we say with sincere Hearts not of those of the Jews and the Christians at the prophet Islam interpreted this to us but the path of the prophets and Messengers the path of the sudden the path of the martyrs and the path of the righteous and I believe that this is about it this is not an interpretation of a Fatiha will need tens and hundreds of lectures lessons and books to go through the Fatiha and you will not give it it's right may Allah have mercy in his soul wrote three books by the title of madari King man in the levels three volumes of more than a thousand pages and by Allah if someone gives me a paper and tells me write an A4 paper on the Fatiha I would fail to do that"
