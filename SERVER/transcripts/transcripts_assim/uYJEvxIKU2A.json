  "transcript": "Dima from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Are you Dima? No, I'm Kaif. No, I have Dima who is supposed to be waiting online. Who's on the line? Hello? Yes. Yeah, I'm Kaif Sheikh. Yes, Kaif. What can I do for you, Akhi? Yeah, Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam Yeah, I'm working in a MNC company from 2018. And where? MNC. MNC. Multinational company. Okay. Yeah, from 2018. On COVID time, our company asked us to put COVID vaccine. Mostly, I don't go for allopathic medicine and not like to put. So, I bought certificate and give it the ID number to our company instead of put vaccine. My company said that if you don't put vaccine, we'll take disciplinary action. Akhi, I cannot understand you. You work in a multinational company since 2018. Your company asked you to do what? COVID vaccine. What is that? Vaccine. Vaccination. Vaccination. Okay. Yeah, COVID. They asked us to put COVID vaccination. Okay. But most likely, I don't go for allopathic medicine and don't like to put. So, I bought the certificate and give the ID number to my company. Okay. So, you cheated and lied. Okay. What's the question? Yeah, my question will be, will my salary haram? No, your salary is halal. If your job description is halal and the work you do is in compliance to the job description and the job requirement, your salary has nothing to do with you cheating and lying in that you're not vaccinated for COVID-19. But you have to repent and ask Allah for forgiveness."
