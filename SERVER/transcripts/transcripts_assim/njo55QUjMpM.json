  "title": "Can I Hide my jail time & deportation from a potential spouse? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Wa'alaykumussalam and you are? Ibn Muhammad. Ibn Muhammad from India. Yes sir, what can I do for you? Sheikh, I was not practicing Muslim before and I used to live in the UAE and some things lead to another and I had an addiction for drug use and eventually I was caught and I served time in prison. I was deported. I maybe stayed for 8 months in there. I was deported. Now I am a practicing Muslim for like 5 years. Alhamdulillah. I think Allah showed me the real way by making me go through a phase where I have to turn back. So I am thankful Alhamdulillah. But I am 28 years old now. I am planning to get married. So in my part of the place there are a lot of people from the UAE and I am getting proposals from the UAE as well. But I am deported. I cannot go back there. So if I am going for a proposal, I still, nobody knows that I was in jail for 8 months. I kept it concealed. I think Allah concealed my sins. So I know I am not supposed to expose it but I want to know like potential spouse, what should be my limit of if I have to say or should not say because if I don't say and they ask me to move to UAE or something or anything like that, I cannot do it. First of all, Alhamdulillah Azza wa Jal who guided you back to the straight path and the good news is Allah forgives whatever had happened when His servant comes open and forward in repentance and remorse and asks Allah Azza wa Jal for forgiveness. The defects or bad things in a spouse that impacts the marriage itself must be told up front. So if you have a disease that hampers the marriage or a defect or a deficiency or something that would make your spouse repel and not feel comfortable which impacts the marriage itself, you have to expose this and say it up front. What happened in a person's past stays in the past. As they say, what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. This is better. What happens in the past stays in the past because doing time or going to jail and coming out clean does not impact an individual. You're not applying for a job or something similar to that that requires to know your criminal record. This is a marriage, Alhamdulillah. You earn, you have a house, you can function as a husband and you are a practicing Muslim. This is all what counts. What happens in the past remains in the past. If they ask you to move to the UAE, you say I have legal problems that prevent me from entering without exposing your sin. Many people were deported due to loans they could not pay off or due to other reasons other than being in jail. So there is no need for you to say and you don't have to elaborate. If they insist, tell them I'm not going to say. Alhamdulillah and the supply is far greater than the demand. You will have so many other proposals, Insha'Allahu Azzawajal."
