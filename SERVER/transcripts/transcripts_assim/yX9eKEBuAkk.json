  "transcript": "Yunus from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuhu Before stating my question Sheikh, I would like to say that I don't want to label any person So the question goes like this If any, I know some Muslims who say, who claim themselves as Muslims And quotes Ahl-e-Hadith scholars, like Salafi scholars when it comes to any fiqh issue But at the same time they say that Zionism is not at all a dangerous ideology And whoever says bad things about it is an Islamist and extremist This is nonsense Zionism is a plague and it's a disease And anyone defending it is a retard Someone who has a deficiency in his thinking powers and in his intellect Because it's a racist-based cult and belief that is based on apartheid So I don't believe any Salafi, let alone Muslim, would defend Zionism at all"
