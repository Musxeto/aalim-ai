  "title": "How long can we wipe over our socks for Wudu - 24 hours?",
  "transcript": "is from the uk he says when we wipe over the socks does it have to be exactly 24 hours so it's like when the 24 hours end wudu is invalid no it doesn't mean that at all it means that if you begin wiping not the wudu the wood could have happened six ten hours earlier you're still in wudhu and then after some time you put your socks on you're still in wudo once you break your wudu this time of 24 hours does not begin yet when does it begin once you make new wudu and wipe over your socks so let me give you an example and i hope i don't take a long time doing this i made wudo for fajr and i put my socks on i prayed fajr and i prayed and i prayed asar with the same original wudu and maghrib time i answered the call of nature so i went at maghrib time performed then you will do and i wiped over my socks this is when the 24 hours starts not from fajr from maghrib time and this ends at maghrib time the following day which means that if i performed numerous but the last one was 10 minutes before sunset of tomorrow so the 24 hours are not over yet and i wiped over my socks and i prayed maghrib with that wudu prayed isha with that prayed with her prayed night prayer the wudu is valid though the 24 hours were over because i didn't wipe after the 24 hours rather my wudu is still intact after the 24 hours so i hope this answers your question you"
