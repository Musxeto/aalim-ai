  "transcript": "tar from Bangladesh how are you doing alhamdulillah would you like some yes okay after inah go straight to the question don't ask how am I okay okay my said an IM in India does the ASU very fast and he rises from ru very fast in a way that he has to R the fa and in the subcontinent people don't see it mandat to recite F behind the in a silent RA in such a case if I recite the whole F and then catch up with the IM in Ru is that valid this is valid inshallah if the Imam is super fast and you're unable to catch up with him but I would highly advise you that you should not pray behind such an Imam even if you have to pray the second Jama or choose a better Masjid because congregational prayer Isa prayer is the essence of your day whether it's or this is the F prayer a pillar of Islam if you don't pray it correctly what good is it and if the Imam is ignorant and doesn't recite it correctly as if someone is rushing behind him and and running to to beat him up then this guy doesn't know and you're better off praying somewhere else"
