  "transcript": "Talha from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is that in my school like they have a lot of haram things in the school They have lots of things, haram things in the school like they make us do music They make us have like in those celebrations stuff like that, and then I want to go to an Islamic school Yeah, but sometimes my parents don't have the ability to take me to an Islamic school And they say that it's like times of fitna right now, so just try to avoid the major sins so then What I just do is I just try to do the minimum I can and I try to avoid as much as I can Because the teacher says if I don't if I don't do like what they tell me to do They're gonna call like the head teacher and stuff like that So that's why I just try to do as much as as little as I can in this in the sinning part And So am I sinful? Because I don't know what to do because I can't I can't go to an Islamic school. I try to tell my parents First of all it is not permissible to engage in haram activities at school We Muslims have a purpose on this earth and that is to establish the religion of Allah and To carry his commands to the best of our ability When we come to The fork of the road and we have to choose between following Sharia or following man-made laws and regulations and When following man-made laws and regulations I am completely Disobeying Allah Azza wa Jal and falling into sin I Have to stop This and not do it And would not justify it by saying well if I don't comply this would happen and that would happen at the end of the day, I'm as a Muslim ordered to not to fall into sin and We're not talking about something that is mandatory as the law of the country such as Vehicle insurance for example. Okay. There's nothing I can do if I want to drive I have to do that but to go to school and To listen to their nonsense filth and Kufr and disbelief Maybe if we forced to engage in physical education Freely mix go to the swimming pool with opposite gender Maybe have wrestling matches with the opposite gender and touching and coercing and what is this? What it's gonna end what's the bottom line where you say no taking off my clothes No, I don't I won't do this. Anything else is okay So this is where you guys have to draw the line your parents have to draw the line Allah did not force you to go to such countries and live among the disbelievers Until you're stripped of your religion You compromise your religion you have to make a stand They say it's democracy they say this put your foot down and say enough is enough We're Muslims. We don't do these things So this is the bottom line that you have to find a way out of it and may Allah make things easy for you"
