  "transcript": "We have Ashraf from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu. Wafiq Barakallah. This is an issue of dispute among scholars. And the main pillars of this dispute are And the middle path was chosen by Imam Malik, may Allah have mercy upon them all, who said in silent rak'ah, it is a fard that your prayer is invalid. But in loud rak'ahs, like the two rak'ahs of Maghreb, of Isha, and of Fajr, the recitation of the Imam is sufficient for you. And this was the choice also of Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, who had a small booklet written on this topic by the name of Al-Imam, Bi Hukm Al-Qiraati Khalfa Al-Imam. And this is what he concluded, may Allah have mercy on them all, and this is what I'm inclined to, in a nutshell. Loud rak'ahs, when the Imam is reciting, this suffices for those behind him, they don't have to recite. Silent rak'ahs, they all must recite or their prayer is invalid."
