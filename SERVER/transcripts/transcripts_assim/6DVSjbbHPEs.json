  "transcript": "Alam I took your advice last time and it worked but I have one more question if that's fine that's fine um I want to learn Arabic for many reasons such as to learn the Quran what it says um and generally just to know Arabic so I can be a better Muslim no so can you just give me advice um on how to Arabic because whenever I try either procrastinate because it was so hard or I just you know I just don't do it w my friend unfortunately this is something that has to do with you nobody could hold your hand and force you to learn Arabic you're a grown-up adult I can't hold your hands and take you to the toilet to answer the call of nature you have to do it on your own so learning Arabic if there is a strong motive in your heart towards learning the Quran the language of the dean to know more about Islam firsthand without needing intermediates to explain it to you then you will find the urge and the enthusiasm to learn it but if you not if it's just because I want to and it's fun it's cool you no you you're not going to be able to do this you have to motivate yourself and know the great reward and fruits and benefits you will reap from that"
