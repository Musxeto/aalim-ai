  "transcript": "Imran from Sweden Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Hey Sheikh, bro, I got a question. My school, which I go to, I cannot pray like on lessons. They do not allow prayer. I can't go to the corner because then they will like become suspicious. And like I am really struggling to pray because they're like, they barely know Muslims there and there's like some hood guys. Imran, prayer is not something that you ask permission for. If you are at a school and you are in the West and in the so-called democratic country, like Sweden or Germany or any other place else, as Muslims, we don't go to the authorities and say, excuse me, can I have five minutes to pray? No, I just find any location that is empty and I start praying. Nobody would dare and stop you. So go ahead and pray, bro, don't ask for permission. Yes, they have the authority to not allow you to go out of the school during school hours to pray in the masjid, for example. This is logical and understandable, but no one can stop you from praying. You're allowed to go to the toilet to answer the call of nature. You're allowed to skip classes. Sometimes you're allowed to go and play in the gym. Who cares what they say? Don't even bother ask. Have honour and pride in your religion and do what you have to do without caring about these disbelievers and what they say and what they permit you to do. Pray. You're not harming anyone. You're not offending anyone. They have the audacity to burn the Qur'an and to authorise it through the highest courts in their country and that's okay. And when it comes to you praying alone, if you want to tap dance, nobody's going to say anything. If you want to strip out of your clothes, they're going to clap you and say, keep up the good work. But if you want to pray, they're going to criticise you. To hell with them, with all due respect."
