  "transcript": "foreign [Music] is the following dua oh it is you we worship and unto you we pray and prostrate and towards you we hasten and you we serve we hope for your mercy and fear your punishment verily your punishment will fall upon the disbelievers oh allah we seek your aid and ask your pardon we praise you with all good and do not disbelieve in you we believe in you and submit unto you and we disown and reject those who disbelieve in you these beautiful words were not from the prophet's words then why are we saying it in kunut because these words are from rumar may allah be pleased with him and he's one of the four rightly guided caliphs whom the prophet alaihis al-assam told us to follow his sunna and the sunnah of the four rightly guided caliphs and rulers who come after him so this is one of his sunnas and saying it in witter is valid however it is highly recommended that we use the previous dua which the prophet alaihis allah taught it personally to his grandson al-hasan ibn ali may allah be pleased with him and with his father moving on to the following chapter after salaam of which a prayer so we prayed night prayer we prayed eight long raqqas then we concluded that with three raka's of witter what should we say afterwards the sunnah is to say three times [Music] we say this three times which is glory be to the king the holy one is and we say this three times prolonging the last time so we say on the third time subhanallah some narrations lord of the angels and the rule that is jibril peace be upon him however some scholars grade this edition rabbi miller as weak so it's best to just say the first part subhanallah three times the following chapter deals with anxiety and sorrow now each and every one of us has this amount of anxiety and sorrow in them and this is inevitable this is part of our lives so what to do when we are affected by such calamities there is a beautiful dua which the prophet alaihis allah taught us to relieve us from such depression from such grief from such worries and anxieties this dua goes as follows i'm your servant son of your servant son of your maid servant what is this an introduction to what i want by expressing who i am and by praising allah and glorifying him so i acknowledge all of this and then i say my forelock is in your hand meaning the forelock this area if someone grabs you by it he can move you wherever he wants and this is an indication that allah is capable of doing with me whatever he wishes and wills your command over me is forever executed so i believe that your command has to be as you have written and your decree over me is just and i accept and i'm content whatever what you had decreed upon me i ask you by every name belonging to you how many names does allah have we don't know allah has many names though we are instructed to know understand implement and apply 99 names that we can find as this would lead us to enter jannah but we acknowledge that there are many names other than these 99. so you ask allah by every name belonging to you which you named yourself with or revealed in your book so the one revealed in his book we know or you taught to any of your creation or you have preserved in the knowledge of the unseen with you these are names we don't know of what do we ask you by by your names that you make the quran the life of my heart and the light of my chest or breast and the departure of my sorrow and a release of my anxiety or grief or whatever worries me this is what the dua that the prophet allah taught us to supplicate to invoke allah azza with whenever we have something that is worrying us so we say with ahab what griefs me and this is something in the past and al-ham is the worries that i have that might be anticipated in the future so i'm seeking allah azza to make the quran the light of my chest and to make it the life of my heart so that it would eradicate all that worries me and all that what gives me and if you say this du'a allah indeed will take all of these things away from you this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you for a manila foreign [Music] foreign"
