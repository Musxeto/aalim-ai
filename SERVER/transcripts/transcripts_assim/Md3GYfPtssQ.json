  "title": "What is the ruling on completing the Quran recitation by sharing the reading of Quran (Quran Khatam)",
  "transcript": "from kuwait yes my question is many uh ladies from the subcontinent we gather in houses during ramadan and uh with the miya of doing the khatam or dora quran we just take chance and recite quran so that we complete it very quickly within five days or ten days or something so is it permissible is it from the sunnah okay so let me understand this correctly sitting in a house where one of us recites the quran loudly and the others listen to it in order to gain reward in order to understand the quran maybe someone would comment on an ayah and it gives an explanation this is something that is highly recommended in islam and it's highly recommended to be done in the masjid as the companions used to do there's nothing wrong in that doing this silently like in some places they distribute one juzo for 30 women and each woman recites on her own one jesus so in 20 minutes they've accomplished the full quran and they consider themselves as of accomplished the full quran this is an innovation and this does not count as reciting the whole quran but if one as the companions used to do recite one part or a part of the quran and then hands it over to the following person in their recite and it goes on like this this is permissible in sha allah this is different from what is known as khatm which people do in funerals for example when they gather for mourning and they're deceased and they distribute quran to recite and give the thawab the reward to their disease this is a clear innovation allah knows best you"
