  "transcript": "finally adiba says i have heard that yawning is prohibited when you're praying because that's from shaytaan but it happens mostly with me that i on while praying how can i overcome this or is it okay and is my salat is my prayer valid if i yawn this was the instruction of the prophet the prophet said salallahu when one of you is praying and has the urge to yawn he has to suppress it as much as possible how do you suppress yawning some scholars say that you bite your lower lip so that you don't open your mouth and yawn freely and the prophet said assam if one was overwhelmed i i want i have this urge to yawn and i cannot suppress it then he should cover it with his hand he should cover his mouth with his hand so this has no impact none whatsoever on your uh prayer and allah azzawajal knows best"
