  "transcript": "Arthur says that he suffers from anxiety and he believes that he is possessed by jinn and we have answered and addressed this issue so many times on this program but hamdulillah but just to recap not everything that we go through is a result of evil eye and v j-- in possession or black magic this is not true there is however depression and this is something that is human and people get depressed even believers there is an anxiety there is rage attacks all of this is human nature we have to address these issues and problems and not overlooking the the fact that there is a possibility it can be in possession but this is the least of our worries because this is one in a million it is not possible that you go to a family in a building and you find that the whole building complain of being possessed by jinn the jinn don't have anything except to go and possess people don't they have work to attend to don't they have lives to run what is this so most likely it is super superstitions but there is a percentage that are afflicted by such things but this is not the norm so the biggest problem is when I convince myself no no I'm possessed I have demons in me I have jinn to Christians and three Jews how do you know that no I know I can tell they to me in my dreams I get sleep paralysis I can't concentrate I don't do this I don't do that and I knew that I have to do Jin's possessing me because when I go to restaurants I usually ask for kosher meat Subhan Allah what is this people convince themselves and once you allow this illusion to overwhelm your life you're done with so what should I do first of all depend and rely on Allah Azza WA JAL alone second make Rukia on yourself and the rakia we always advise people to do is to bring them some water or normal water beside the Fatiha after each time three times five times seven times whatever ayatul kursi the last two ayahs of surah al-baqarah and the last three : of the quran and drink of this water wash your face multiple times during the day and night and inshallah you will be good as new also for your anxiety you have to try and ask others to advise you so you have to consult with elders with wise people with those who can give you solid advice even if you go to psychiatrists but they have to be trustworthy Muslim psychiatrist not anyone else who would probably tell you that you have a flow in your orion complex and maybe smoking is part of thinking of breast feeding from your mother or something like that nonsense stuff so you have to look for someone to give you good counseling and to walk you through this and thirdly be positive have trust in Allah have to work cool couple of days ago I uploaded on my youtube channel a lecture by the name of I think the full trust in Allah or taurah in arabic is words - what could that the lecture is in English go through it it gives your Eman a boost it makes you trust allah azza wajal because everything is in Allah's hands so why worry when you know that for granted and everything that was predestined fifty thousand years before Allah created the creations once you do this inshallah you will be saved from all of that without any problem"
