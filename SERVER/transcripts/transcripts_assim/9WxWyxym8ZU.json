  "transcript": "uh brother assad allah from canada uh was his call was interrupted and he was asking about what is known as jealousy is something that is highly recommended sunnah in the shaffer madhhab and it was mentioned in sahih al-bukhari by malik may allah be pleased with him who said to his companions shall i show you how the prophet hassam used to pray and among them were companions of the prophet so he prayed a prayer where whenever he stood from a witter to an even raqqa he would pause a little bit after the second prostration and then stand up this is known as gelset some schools of thought do not recommend it others recommend it because the hadith is obvious and he is describing the prayer of the prophet he's a companion who saw the prophet so it is a highly recommended move in the salat now if i understand the question of assad allah correctly is this to be done only in two prayers like fajr or can we make it in the four raka prayers like dohur ansar the answer is the latter we can do it in any two raka's or four raka's because in the four rakah after the third raka when you stand up for the fourth you don't sit for the shahad so instead of going straight to standing up you do this if you wish"
