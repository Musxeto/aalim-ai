  "transcript": "Yasin from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is if all Muslims all around the world change themselves and act upon Quran and Sunnah would that help the people in Palestine with the grace of Allah? Akhi, it is not important to help the people of Palestine or of Chechnya or of Afghanistan or Iraq or Libya as far as I'm concerned more than helping myself. So you should not focus primarily about people here and there and do whatever you want to help them instead of helping yourself. This is illogical. Let us assume that there is no conflict on earth at all. Will you or will you not abide by the Quran and the Sunnah? The answer according to your logic, no need. So your question is irrelevant. To help our brothers and sisters in Palestine, phase one we have to implement Quran and Sunnah in our lives, in our homes, in our neighborhoods, not for them rather because Allah ordered us to do this. Now there are many venues that we can explore to help them whether to share their cause and plight on social media among the very important means of victory is dua. We have to invoke and pray to Allah Azza wa Jal to help them and to help all those who are oppressed and to free the Muslim lands constantly not just because there has been some unrest or attacks or air raids and then after three four months when things subsides we go back to sleep again. This should be an obsession till the day we die that we make dua and let the cause be alive among our loved ones among our children and to call for it 24 hours seven days a week and Allah knows best."
