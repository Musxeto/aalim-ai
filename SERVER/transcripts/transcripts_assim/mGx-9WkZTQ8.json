  "title": "What to do when someone insults our Prophet ‎ﷺ? Can we take matters into our own hands?  |AlHakeem",
  "transcript": "uh zanar from the uk he says a very good question what should we do when someone insults the prophet this depends if you are in a muslim country this is a major offense that requires the intervention of the muslim ruler so you simply report this individual to the court or to the muslim ruler and it is the duty of the muslim ruler to execute after going through uh legislative processes and going in front of a panel of judges and this is done in muslim countries the honor of the prophet is way more important than anything else so in muslim countries this is a cardinal sin this is a capital uh uh um offense that has to be addressed by the muslim court system and usually after interrogation after all the uh dealings have been done it is they give the verdict of executing this person who offended the prophet sallam if you are not in a muslim country or if you are in a country that does not rule by islam or if you are in a disbelieving country a kafir country in this case you have nothing to do but to leave either you defend the prophet salam with rhetoric and explain to that individual that what he's doing is wrong and you explain that to him but if he is an abusive person he doesn't want you to defend the prophet he doesn't want to learn or to listen rather he want to insult you so you have to leave this a place and boycott that problem that person and warn others from him you must not take matters into your own hands because this would turn the community into a jungle where everybody talks with someone ends up shooting him and when asked he said he cursed the prophet also no that's easy so anyone i want to assassinate or kill i just say that he uh uh cursed the prophet allah the prophet sallallahu alaihi no matter how much they depict him in offensive and heinous drawings or ridicule of him nothing would touch him not even this close imagine these imbeciles who cursed or depicted the prophet sam in drawings who are they they're nothing who remembers their names or whoever mentioned their names no one allah said in the quran the one who hates you o muhammad is the one who will be cut from being mentioned or from being ever remembered the name of the prophet is mentioned 24 hours seven days a week all over the globe there is no single yard or meter or foot or inch where you will not find the name of the prophet hassan mentioned listen to the adhan being called five times a day the akama being called five times a day and every time you will hear the name of the prophet saws mentioned and billions of people offering salutation upon him do you think that a french frog would come at the end of the day and insult our prophet no they can't so be proud of your religion ahi but don't be provoked to do something that would backfire on islam and the muslims they insult the prophet alison if they want to dialogue yeah we can talk about it but if they don't and they just simply want to insult leave and go let them bark as they wish they're not going to harm no one but themselves and allah's best"
