  "transcript": "thank you foreign the prophet salallahu in the beginning of the seventh year of Hijra had decided to attack the village of hyber as it was the last stronghold of the Jews at the time and the Jews were continuing to steer problems around Arabia they were continuing to provoke the tribes to attack Medina and to attack Islam so now with the truth implemented between the Muslims and the pagans of quraish the prophet had all the time to attack the remaining stronghold of the Jews so he declared that in Medina and instructed that only those who are willing to fight and decide of the Prophet Islam and for the sake of Allah would come with him meaning that he told the Hypocrites that there will not be any booties so they will not get any use of going out with him so the majority of those who went with the prophet Allah were those who gave him the Pledge of Allegiance under the tree the tree of radwan or who gave him the pledge of radwan when they were prevented from entering mecca for umrah on her Debian the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam left Medina with his companions now we all know that the village of Khyber is to the north east of Medina and if you look at the map you would find that the prophet Allah took a very interesting route he came from the northern part of Khyber instead of coming from the southern part which is closer to Medina and the reason behind this choice of the prophet sallallahu he wanted to cut the way so that the Jews could not flee and get reinforcement from their allies the tribes of ratafan and they cannot flee to a sham area the Sham region so the prophet saws had a very tactical and strategic move to prevent them from escaping and he attacked Khyber from the northern part of it now Khyber was divided into two parts the first part was divided into also two parts and these parts were known as and the first part which is a natat was composed of three fortresses known as The Fortress of Naim asab and the Fortress of azuber while a shock was composed of the Fortress of Ube and the Fortress of nizar and they were all strongholds in the sense that they were all elevated from the ground they were in a high position so whoever wanted to attack them was from below of that high position first of all started by surrounding and sieging the place the area and the Jews would not give in the prophet saws would keep on inviting them to accept Islam and they would not comply and they said bad things to the prophet why were they so defiant why didn't they accept the call for truths or to surrender didn't they learn from from didn't they learn from what took place in the previous battles with the tribes of Arabia didn't they learn from what took place in Mecca with quraish when they tried to attack the Muslims in the Battle of Badr and also what took place in the battle of they were hoping that they would be the one to succeed in defeating the Muslims and why was that because they were promised by Abdullah that don't pay any attention to the army of the Prophet saws and he gave them an early warning before the prophet saws reached their Village sent them a message telling them that the prophet is coming be take take your guard and don't worry because the men with him are not feeling they're not fully armed and they're few and you have the upper hand the Jews were not satisfied with the promise of Abdullah to come to the rescue they themselves sent two of their dignitaries they sent both men to the tribes of ratafan telling the tribes of ratafan that we will give you half of our fruit fruits for one year okay and they promised to come and assist if they succeeded in defeating the Muslims no if they came to the rescue not defeating they just wanted them to fight with them so of course if they won the war this means that the Jews will comply and fulfill their promise to the tribe of ratafan so when they were surrounded by the Muslims and the prophet sallam is calling them to surrender they could they would not comply and accept this on the hope that Abdullah obey will send his army of Hypocrites and the tribes of watafan will also send the reinforcement to the rescue and to their unfortunate luck none of the above took place yes it is the habit of Abdullah obey the the head of the Hypocrites he did not send a single soldier and the tribe of watafan they've tasted the strength of the Muslims before and they've tasted what Allah had done to them on the battle of the battle of the trench and the battle of the parties so this thought that let the prophet sallam take care of the Jews the hell with them everything will go in vain they knew that it was inevitable the prophet sallam was Victorious whether they like it or not started by sieging their Main and biggest Fortress and they fought bravely but it was all in vain the prophet salallahu told the Muslims that Allah and the prophet sallallahu will give the flag tomorrow on the day of hyper to a man who is loved by Allah and the prophet and who himself love Allah and the prophet saws at first thought and wished to be the one he says that I've never prayed and hoped and looked for being the leader except in this event because it's a testimony from the prophet Allah that this man is loved by Allah and by the prophet salallahu they all gathered everyone is wishing and hoping to be the one Muslim everyone was hoping to be the chosen one and when it was morning the prophet saws asked where is so they told him that he was Ill he had a sore eye and or he had trachoma in his eye so They Carried him to the prophet Allah the prophet spit in his eyes and it was as if it had nothing wrong with it he was cured on the spot so he gave him the flag and he told him go to High bar and fight so he went and just as he was going out not looking at the prophet sallam told him go where and do what what to fight them on so the prophet instructed him to go and fight in the name of Allah and call them to Islam not only to fight to call them to Islam and he told him that if you succeed and getting one man into Islam this is far greater to you than the wealth of the whole world which indicates that the prophet Allah message was for the guidance of humanity not for Bloodshed not for killing people and not for gathering this worldly booties he went to call people to Islam and to get them out from Darkness into the light the first fight was at the Fortress of nahim where the most powerful Fort it was it is the most powerful Fort and in it was the most powerful Jew by the name of and he among the Jews was considered to be equivalent to a thousand Warrior so he went out of the Fortress and he sought a duel he challenged the Muslims who would like to come and fight so the first one to come and fight with him was the uncle of Salem may Allah be pleased with them both he was he was a strong Warrior yeah so he came and exchanged blows with him and the first blow fell in to his armor yeah so his sword was stuck so he went to hit him once again and by mistake his sword cut his elbow in a vein in his elbow and some say it it hit his knee so he was injured and he died because of this injury so the companions thought that he caused himself to die so his struggle and Jihad was in vain and Salama heard this and he was very angry so he went to the prophet and he told him about what the people talk and say and he himself the prophet sallam told him this is complete lie has two rewards and he is among the best of my companions so again marhab is calling for a duel who fought him this is inshallah what we will get to know after the break stay tuned so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize God and enjoy his blessings in this life and his Mercy in this life and in the Hereafter as well Allah each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of Allah the Almighty which no one shares or is compared to Allah in it um and welcome back so after hammer could not achieve the mission in that duel and win the battle and win the fight with bragged about it and kept on saying poetry that I am the one and only who's man enough to come and fight me and stepped forward may Allah be pleased with him he came also saying poetry to marhab and the exchange blows and not before long marhab was a dead body his brother Yasser saw this and out of anger came out and also sought a duel with the Muslims and may Allah please with him came forward and killed him in seconds the Muslims fought for three days and nights besieging this Fortress as the Jews left this Fortress and went to the the other Fortress by the name of Saab and the Muslims for three days and nights besieged that Fortress and felt really tired and hungry and among the best tribes that fought that day was the tribe of Islam Banu Islam and due to their hunger they slaughtered donkeys and they ate these donkeys and before it was permissible for them to eat donkeys and in this battle the prophet Allah told them that it had become forbidden for them for Muslims to eat donkeys so domestic donkeys it's forbidden for us to eat while zebras wild donkeys are permissible for us to eat and this tells us something it tells us that if you ask a person a Muslim what are you allowed to eat the answer would be everything except one two three and four the things that we're not allowed to eat are a handful therefore everything in this world is permissible for us to consume and eat accept the things that Islam told us that it is forbidden to eat again the Jews sneaked out to another Fortress and to the other and to the other until they went from anatat the area into al-katiba and leaving their children and leaving their own wives as a as as prisoners to the Muslims because they just wanted to flee the fighting and and so many incidents the Jews themselves were betrayed by their own people in one incident while the Muslims were surrounding one of the strongholds they could not open that Fortress they could not conquer it so a Jew came and told them that even if you stay there for a whole month you would not be able to open that Fortress simply because they come out at night and they take water from their Wells and from their Springs and go back again but if you cut their supply of water you will be able to uh defeat them in a matter of days and so did the the Muslims they cut the supply of water and they managed to defeat them managed to surround and besiege which is the one with the three fortresses that was weak that was not as far as as strong as the other and the shock and he surrounded it for 14 days and Allah through the fear the fear and Terror in the Jews Hearts they decided to surrender to the prophet on the condition that they may leave with the clothes they're wearing along with their uh wives and children the prophet Allah agreed on that and he took their promise that they would not deprive or they will not prevent him from anything that they have only your clothes you're allowed to go out you're not allowed to keep any gold or silver or Treasures or anything of value and if you do not disclose these things to me if I knew that you were holding it back or hiding it this gives me the right to kill you so their leaders agreed to that and among them was uh he was their treasurer and he brought him forward and he asked him about the money and the wealth in heat swore that they didn't have anything one of his cousins came and as they say blew the whistle on him and he told the prophet Islam that I've seen him go around a particular area they dug that area and they found the treasures and the wealth of the Jews so the prophet sallam instructed his companions to to kill him because the Jews themselves uh killed one of his companions a few days earlier and that was Mahmoud the brother of Muhammad they threw a big Stone in his head from one of their fortresses and he died so he executed him uh uh an exchange for the killing they did now was in the hands of the Prophet saws and his companions I would like to ask about the main reason to attack Khyber the main reason was they it had the Jews in it and the Jews would never ever honor their treaties so they kept on trying to provoke the tribes of ratafan they were aiding the polytheists in uh quraish and they were going out of their way to undermine any effort of the Muslims to live a normal and peaceful life and that is why whenever the prophet sallam exiled any of the tribes the previous tribes they went to hyber and they kept on with their secret Communications with the people of quraish and with lotafan trying to find the right moment and the right spot to attack Islam and that is why it was inevitable that the prophet sallam would go and punish them but this was not the proper time because of his struggle with the people of quraish of Mecca and now after the truce is implemented with the people of Mecca it was time for him to move on and clear this front of the Jews so who he was planning to attack them before but he was waiting he was waiting for the right moment of course yes he was he was he was the prophet sallam had plans for everything but he was waiting always for the right moment so that he would not jeopardize this Young Nation of Islam in Medina Salaam started to divide the booty they got from and the Muslims because of their uh small number they had a lot for each one of them and Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him said that we never had enough of food until we conquered and you remember that we've said that is pleased with her told us that two months used to pass on the houses of the Prophet Allah Without fire being ignited inside it to cook on and they would never eat cooked food for two more considered consecutive months and when her nephew asked her so what did you eat she told him in these two months we had only dates and water to feed on so even Omar when he say when he says that he never had a full stomach except when Allah granted them and gave them this tells us about the booty they got from Khyber one also important thing to know is that the migrants and muhajirin they themselves after the battle of Freiburg gave back all the Farms all the trees all the palm trees that their brothers from the ansar gave them when they first came to Medina if you recall when they came to Medina they were poor they had nothing so their brothers gave them half of their property the Farms the Assad gave them half of the farms and they refused to take that so they ask them is it okay for you if you work in our farms and we give you half of the Harvest so the mahajirun accepted that and now after high bar they had enough money to give back to their brothers from the Assad what they shared with them in the very beginning now the Jews had nowhere to go the only place for them to go was to a sham which means that they have to leave the whole of Arabian the Arabian Peninsula so they came up with the idea and they suggested to our Prophet saws that they remain in hyber and they work as laborers not owning the land because the land is not theirs anymore and they suggested to the prophet sallam that they would work as laborers and they would take half of whatever they form for they take half of the crops gave the matter some thought because the Muslims did not have slaves the Muslims were not free to go and work in these Farms it's a hundred kilometer to the north of Medina it's far so the prophet sallam gave the ID some thought and he came to the conclusion that that was a good suggestion so he agreed that the Jews remain in their Village though it's not their Village anymore it's not their land it's not their farm and he told them that he has one condition that is you may work in fiber as long as we allow you to but once we think or once I think it's time for you to leave without any notice I may ask you and order you to live hyper and go to the Jews this was an excellent compromise because this meant that they kept their houses they stayed in the land and they kept on Farming and harvesting and to the Muslims also it was good because they had people to work on these lands and pay them half of what Allah gave them from it I believe that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time oh oh my God hahaha"
