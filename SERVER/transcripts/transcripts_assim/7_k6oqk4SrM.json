  "transcript": "well this is a good question a lot of the brothers uh uh mentioned that there is a Dua to be mentioned at the beginning or the end of the year and none of these duas uh are authentic they are all fabrication it is not part of the Sunnah to celebrate nor to congratulate people with happy New Year that is Islamic New Year uh alhamd we don't have uh Islamic Christmas as well because now it's it's the season of holidays no it is not part of the Sunnah to congratulate people with the New Year part if someone does and say or happy happy Islamic Year and may Allah make this year a happy one for all the Muslims all over the world you would Sayan and may Allah make it happy to you as well because whenever someone congratulates you with something that is merely permissible or not related to Islam it is is okay to reply in in a good fashion in a good manner but do not initiate it yourself do not think that it is part of the Sunnah because it is not and Allah Knows Best"
