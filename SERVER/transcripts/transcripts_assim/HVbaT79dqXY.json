  "title": "Combing the Hair of Prophet(Characteristics of Prophet) Ash Shama'il Al Muhammadiyah assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] the chapter we're about to discuss is the calming of the hair of the Prophet wasam how the prophet Sall alhi wasallam dealt with his hair because we took the description of how long it was now we talk about how he used to take care of it mother may Allah be pleased with her said I used to calm the hair of the Prophet uh while I was menstruating so a woman taking care of the hair of a man while in her menis is permissible AA also said may Allah be pleased with her that the prophet of Allah used to love what is beginning with the his right hand his right side and his right foot meaning to use the right side and prefer it over the left so he used to love this in his ritual purification when he purified himself in his caling when he calmed his hair and putting on his shoes when he doned them and finally abdah may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet of allaham forbade coming except at intervals what do we learn from these hadiths number one it is totally permissible and acceptable for a woman to calm her husband's hair even if she's in the state of mensis there's nothing of feminism here saying No this is is degrading I'm not going to do this I'm not going to do that on the contrary such feminist ideas go against Islam and sometimes unfortunately a lot of those feminists exit the fold of Islam with such mentality when they prefer such weird external ideas to the Islamic etiquette and behavior it is part of a woman's Good Deeds to serve her husband whether feminists like it or not it is part of getting closer to Allah and this is one of their gateways to Paradise so mother AA used to do this and would find a great deal of Pride serving her husband not only that the prophet Alam used to prefer using the right hand side over the left hand side and this is mentioned in so many things that you begin with the right hand side whenever you wear something whenever you give or take as the prophet said whenever you eat and drink because Satan drinks and eats with his left hand and would give and take with his left hand so the people of the right are the people of J as mentioned in the Quran they would be handed their books and Records on the day of judgment with their right and it means that whatever as IM nawi stated whatever is preferred and recommended and honored is usually referred to through the right hand side like wearing the garments or wearing your sandals and shoes like entering the Masjid like you using the seak which is a toothbrush like uh uh applying uh um the eyeliners like clipping your fingers like trimming your mustache like calming your hair like uh uh the so many things when you exit the toilet all of this we begin with the right hand side eating drinking shaking of hands touching the black stone it is always recommended to use the right hand side whatever is contrary to this the left hand side is advised such as when you and exit the Masjid when you blow your nose when you clean yourself after uh Urinator or defecating when you take off your clothes when uh you take off your shoes you begin with the left hand side all of this is to honor the right hand side and a question that people always ask unfortunately in today's Times what's the ruling on oral sex Subhan Allah this is not something that came to us from our ancestors this is something that came to people from watching porn unfort unfortunately and if this is the status of the right hand side that Allah honored it and that we should not touch our private parts or cleanse ourselves with our right hand because it's an honored organ in our bodies what about the mouth that we utter the shahada that we recite the Quran that we remember Allah with isn't it more worthy of being honored this is uh um uh something that we need to ponder upon as for for the last Hadith the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam um forbade men from calming their heads or beards except at inter intervals what does that mean the prophet s wasallam is directing us is advising us that we shouldn't be so luxurious in life so soft in our style of living people who keep on calming their hair and their beards like every half an hour if you're stuck at a traffic light the man in front of you is just doing this to his hair the following traffic light he's doing it again this is not part of Islam's etiquette because being a man requires that you be tough you be strong yes to come in a nasty way of looking is not recommended like nowadays A lot of the youth have long hair and it's fuzzy and and untiy this is unpleasant to look at and the prophet used to tell men who had such hair to use uh uh things to relax their hair to make it calm down and be presentable so doing this is part of the sunah but overdoing it is not part of the Sunnah because it makes someone more feminine like adoring your adorning yourself like this every half an hour brushing your beard and and head every half an hour is more suitable to women the hair like the hair thing not the beard of course because this is not the character of a tough strong man who is ready to meet the problems and face them and go to fight in the cause of Allah and to do things that are expected from men to do and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave you"
