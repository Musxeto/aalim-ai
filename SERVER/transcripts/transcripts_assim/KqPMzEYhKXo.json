  "title": "Punishment of grave & prayer invalid cuz of urine on him? Will he be in hell forever Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "question is about the Hadith from sah Muslim where the messenger sallam was passing by two graves and then he said that those two persons in the graves are being tormented and one of them didn't keep himself safe from being defiled by urine so does that mean that whoever doesn't clean themselves after urinating that their prayers aren't accepted and also that they they would end up in Hell forever as we know there is no Jenna without praying okay first of all Hamza you should know better that you have only the right to ask one questions so embedding two or three questions in the same question is not fair secondly the Hadith is authentic of course without any doubt it means that a person who knows that there is urine on his body on his clothes or on the spot he's praying knowingly and doesn't do anything about it his prayer is invalid and if his in prayer is invalid he will be tormented in his grave not necessarily to go to hell forever these are two separate things people can be tormented in their graves and in the day of judgment taken to Paradise people can be tormented in their graves and in the day of judgment still go to Hell Fire for some time and then uh admit it out and admit it to Jenna people can not be punished in their graves they have no punishment in their graves but on the day of judgment when they're held accountable for their sins they are thrown in Hellfire for some time and then admit it to Jenna so these two are not always related the torment of the grave and the torment in Hellfire they can be separate so they would that person would be uh tormented in his grave would it be for eternity in Hellfire it depends usually it's not because he prayed now he was misunderstanding he was negligent he was lazy his prayer is invalid but does that take him out of the fold of Islam this is something in Allah's hands and Allah knows best ra"
