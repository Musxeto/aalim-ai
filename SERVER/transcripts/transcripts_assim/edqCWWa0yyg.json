  "transcript": "Huma says I need to know about the cat that is it given on a fixed day of the year or can be given in installments throughout the year secondly should the zakat amount be given altogether to a person or a group or can be given to different persons as required or requested firstly the cat has two conditions without which there is no obligation of paying zakat condition number one it reaches the threshold the nisab for cash and silver it's the value of 595 grams or more for gold it is the 85 grams of pure gold or more the percentage is 2.5% of each the second condition is that a full lunar year passes while this cash gold or silver is in your possession if 11 months and 28 days passed and then you spend it there is no circuit it has to finish a full lunar year now can we give it installments the answer is no the zakat is for the previous year so once it finishes one year you have to give it immediately maybe a day or two delaying it for a reason a week may be accepted but shouldn't be more than that because it is the right of a poor person one says okay I have a poor relative but my zakat is due today and my relative will come in five months time and I cannot transfer it to him what should I do give your relative a call if he is poor and needy and tell them that I have X Y Z of zakat for you so how do you want me to deliver it to you if he says keep it with you until I come five months later no problem you are interested with it if he says give it to someone to bring it over then this is his wish and by calling him and taking his instructions you would have paid your zakat on time if you are unable to communicate with him and take his authorization give your zakat someone else do not get do not give it to your relative because you cannot wait for five months with the zakat with you without his prior authorization now can we give it in installments of last year's the cat no but you can do that for your next year zakat so today I gave one thousand reals zakat of last year I have someone who's in need so I calculate or I estimate that next year's the cash should be the same one thousand reals maybe a little bit more so from today I give this needy person a hundred reals per month until next year's zakat time or date I calculate how much did I pay i paid twelve hundred years a hundred every month every month how much is next the zakat when it's due is I calculate and I find that it is 1,500 so I have three hundred balance to settle I found out it's a thousand only then two hundred would be a normal Sabha and it's not part of the zakat so I hope this clarifies things a little bit for you"
