  "transcript": "Sister Amina from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So my question is, I've been looking for a job for the last maybe two years since I moved here, but I've been unable to find a job. So I met someone, a non-Muslim, that wanted to help me. He has a tutoring contract with parents to teach their children English, mathematics, and stuff like that. So he said that he can let me teach the children, but the only caveat is when the parents ask me if I have experience, I have to say to them that I have three years' experience, which I don't have. So I said, I cannot do that. And he said, well, unfortunately, I have to be able to do that. I said, I cannot, it goes against my beliefs. So he said, okay, you don't have to say anything. Am I allowed to still go there, even if I don't have to say anything? I asked her, what if they ask me? She said, they're not going to ask you. You don't have to say anything. So tomorrow, come and meet me there, which is tomorrow. Am I allowed to go ahead with this or I should just leave it alone? No, as long as you're not going to lie or cheat, teaching children is a permissible job. So there's no problem in you going there and applying for such a job without lying or saying that you have a three-year experience when you do not have. Alhamdulillah, as long as he said, you don't have to say this, you can go and work without a problem. Al-Fatiha."
