  "title": "Voluminous Reading of the Quran in Ramadhaan - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "some Muslims are continuously engaged in reciting the Quran in the month of Ramadan and they do uh Quran they complete the Quran many times how many times is a Muslim supposed to you know finish the Quran reading as much as the Quran especially in the month of Ramadan is good alhamdulillah the prophet has recommended but each thing has its limitation doing more is good but you can't do excess and the had of a beloved prophet in say bukari number six Hadith number 5054 where the Beloved Prophet Ali wasallam said that when a person asked one of the sahabas that how much Quran should I read so the prophet said that read the Quran once in a month so the sahaba said I can do much more than that so the prophet replied that read the Quran once in seven days and that was a common practice among the sahabas that they used to read the Quran once every seven days and that's the reason the Quran is divided into seven Manzel you know each Manzel is little bit more than four ju four parts and the Quran also has been divided in 30 parts so if you recite one part one J every day in one month you can complete the Quran that that's what is normally recommended if you can do better then every week if you complete the Quran that's alhamdulillah but the prophet also warned it's mentioned in thei ofi Hadith number 2949 that the prophet said that anyone who completes the Quran in less than 3 days he has not understood the Quran that means if you complete the Quran Less Than 3 days if you read so fast then you will not understand the Quran it's just like you know as you said like a pate fashion very fast very fast it's useless even though you understand Arabic you won't be able to understand the Quran reading so fast so it's important that when you read the Quran you should understand the Quran so this Hadith again of Hadith number 2949 which says that if you have read the Quran in less than 3 days it is as though you have not read the Quran besides mentioning the time span that it should be 3 days or more can't be less than that it also gives another indication that only reading is not sufficient understanding is also important so therefore I always recommend that besides reading in Arabic also read the translation instead of doing Quran twice in the month of Ramadan read once in Arabic and once the translation if you don't understand Arabic instead of doing four times the twice in Arabic and twice the translation in the language you understand the best so at least besides reading you're understanding what our creator has asked us to do and you can implement the message of Allah subhana taala so the best is that the prophet said that if you don't read the maximum it should be I the minimum time period required is 3 days so you cannot complete more than 10 times the Quran in the whole month of Ramadan but the normal practice was in seven days they used to complete the Quran once so it's about a little bit more than four times or once at least in the month is preferable hope question"
