  "title": "Is it prescribed or sunnah to avoid having intimacy with your spouse during Ramadan? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "to ask um about mountain ramadan and about the intimacy about human wife is it prescribed to be a totally uh stay away from it for a month or it is prepared for the last 10 days i was not sure so i don't get to know my country okay so if i understand your question correctly you're asking about issues of intimacy between the spouses am i right yes stay away from having an intimacy no no no no there is there is no sunnah listen don't mix apples with origins if you don't like your wife and you'd like to stay away from her say that be man and say i don't want to see you for a whole month don't attach this to the sunnah the sunnah has nothing to do with this with this the sunnah in regards of ramadan only came to indicate that the prophet al-islam during the last 10 nights of ramadan 10 nights of ramadan he used to tighten up his waist wrapper or apron meaning that this is metaphorical for not having intimacy with their wives only in the last 10 nights of ramadan and this is not a recommendation this is what he used to do so if you think that i'd like to follow his sunna and stay in the masjid of course when you stay in the masjid you're not gonna have any chance to meet your wife and be intimate with her so this goes without saying no i'm talking about someone who's not doing atticaf sitting staying home yeah it is recommended it is preferable if you devote the time night time to prayers to hajjud reading the quran only in the last 10 nights of ramadan but there is no problem at all of being intimate during each and every night of the last 10 nights of ramadan so there is nothing prescribed akhi neither in the beginning nor at the end what is haram is to be intimate with your spouse during the day time of ramadan when you're fasting you have to avoid that but other than that it is permissible without any problem inshallah"
