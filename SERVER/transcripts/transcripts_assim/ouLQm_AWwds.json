  "transcript": "and uh from the emirates my question is that is it mandatory for muslims to do normal wholesale once in a week okay julia from the emirates there is a hadith of mandating russell every week where the prophet assam says it's a mandatory upon each person who has reached the age of puberty to shower once a week even ambassador please with him explain that to us and he said i'll tell you what the reason or with the wisdom behind this at the early stages of islam we used to work in medina hard labor so we were farmers and we were traders and we used to work work from fajr to sunset and we had only one garment each so we didn't have a a full wardrobe of suits no i had only one garment that's on me and i have to take it and wash it and stay home naked until it dries then i can wear it again and it was made of wool so as they were working under the sun and it's hot you can imagine the smell which was offensive coming from their bodies with the wool it's even worse like some say it's not an odor it's an oh dear so when they used to come to friday and is packed in the masjid they used to be offended from each other's smell not their own but from the others uh people's smell so the prophet mandated islam that they must perform russell before they come to jumwa and then few years down the line when things became easier and money was among the people's hands and they could buy clothes it could clean more often this was uplifted so i hope this answers your question you"
