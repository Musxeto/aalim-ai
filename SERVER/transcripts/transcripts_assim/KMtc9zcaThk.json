  "title": "Will a person be accountable for giving evil eye or being jealous, doing black magic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "alhamdulillah my question today is if somebody gives a person an evil eye or there's a black magic and that person gets affected ill health and he dies let's say it's a young person who was very energetic and healthy and he dies um so that person didn't know this that he was harmed by someone doing some evil on them or giving them man so would that person who gave the EV ey or did the black magic or something will be punished on the day of judgment or will this person be able to avenge that person on the day of judgment for doing such a thing in this dun and trying to uh destroy their life okay first of all any form of transgression in this dun is accountable on the day of judgment providing that it was intentional and hence evil eye is mainly un intentional I see a mug and I like whoa this is so beautiful look at it wow this is perfect and it breaks I didn't do it intentionally sometimes we say this to our own kids look at him jumping around like a jumping Flash jaacks and breaks a leg I didn't do that intentionally so am I S ful for that no because this was unintentional and Allah is most merciful most forgiving does not hold us accountable for something we had no hand in we had no intention in Black Magic is a different thing Envy is a different thing this is with determination that I do such a thing so yes such an aggression would be uh uh some sort of bringing torment of Allah to you on the day of judgment and you'll be held accountable for that but what is unintentional there is no sin in that on you inshallah"
