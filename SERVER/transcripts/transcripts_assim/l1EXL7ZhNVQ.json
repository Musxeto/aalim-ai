  "transcript": "says what's the ruling on cupping in Ramadan and the answer is cupping is an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion that you should not do it because the prophet said the one who makes cupping for others and the one who is having cupping done for him he they have broken their fast so the scholars uh held on to this Hadith and they said that it breaks the fast other Scholars have other evidences that prove it does not break the fast as in the Hadith that the prophet performed cing himself while in the state of fasting but the issue is a long issue of dispute and alhamdulillah as long as we have night time we can do that when you are not fasting just to be safe rather than sorry"
