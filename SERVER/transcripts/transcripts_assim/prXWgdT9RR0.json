  "transcript": "um I have a question about um marriage because recently I uh got married and um one of my require requirements was that uh the one that I'm getting married to is uh Muslim that prays and is a virgin like me and some weeks now after her marriage um I found out that she she never was a a virgin and she have done it with multiple guys before me will I be sinful if I leave her and is is it wrong for me to how how did you come to know she she told me herself out of the blue or you interrogated her or insisted on her or please tell me I'm not going to be angry yeah let's be transparent no I I didn't do that but uh I remember she asked me what's what's one of the things you like about me and I told her I like that you are clean just like me you know I never interrogated her or pushed her to tell me okay first of all this is a problem not a lot of the man face unfortunately or fortunately but some May and we've stated this so many times and we got a lot of hate mail because of this when we say when you repent to Allah and you conceal what Allah has concealed it is sinful there's no way out of it there's no doubt among any scholar of Islam I'm not talking about ignorant imbeciles who who write on the Internet or on Twitter or in platforms like this who don't even know how to clean themselves after defecating I'm talking about Scholars of Islam they all agree that it is not permissible to disclose your previous sins that you've repented from so if a man was a Playboy spending his time between Monte Carlo Nan and casinos in Las Vegas and all of a sudden he repented to Allah and he started growing a beard and acting like a proper Muslim when once he propose is he obliged to tell anyone the answer is no it's not he's obliged he's prohibited from telling anyone after marriage he feels so close to his wife he wants to yeah confess it is totally prohibited if you do your sinful Allah will not forgive your sins because this is the Hadith like for a woman so one says but she I'm a virgin I want to marry a virgin girl well the definition of Virgin in Islam is a woman who's not married in a marriage contract we have and a virgin and someone who was previously married so a virgin is a one who did not marry before we do not disclose whether she was engaged in premarital relationships and had one or multiple boyfriends this is something in the past Allah concealed now she's a practicing woman she's a memorizes the Quran she's one of the sweetest people you may ever encounter so she must not tell anyone no matter how far or close or even hint about it if after marriage you discover by a mistake of this woman or by any other means that she is not as you have thought her to be Allah Asel forgives major sins Allah forgives shik for those who repent how wouldn't we as humans have the ability to also forgiven pardon and move on if she checks all the boxes she's clean she's pure she's hijabi she's practicing she prays on time she's a excellent wife and she's going to be an excellent mother W even if she was whatever she was before marriage I would not care all what I care is about today her pasts are in the past and Allah concealed them and I'll put a lid on them and I move on but at the end of the day it's your call and Allah Knows Best"
