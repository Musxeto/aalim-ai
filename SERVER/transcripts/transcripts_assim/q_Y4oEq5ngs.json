  "title": "Taught someone sins in the past, now I repented, should I correct them or advise them now",
  "transcript": "and finally suffer from uh north america um i wanted to ask if somebody has told or advised others support things back then but doesn't remember what does remember do they need to rectify that to those people or is change within themselves enough i have no idea what you're saying safa like maybe they said they said listen to this music in the past okay and and now you've repented i'm still accountable to them okay so this deals with being a role model or telling people how to do a sin continuously and then repenting what to do if i were to engage in such a sin so if i taught someone how to smoke or i taught someone how to download a movie this is sinful every time that person smokes or downloads a movie i'm getting accountability for that and the sin is ongoing so what to do if i repented and sought allah's forgiveness and had remorse i should rectify this by going to the person i taught him how to smoke and say to him this is sinful i was wrong you have to repent to allah and quit smoking doing this is sufficient and i move on and if there is no possibility for that in this case then there is no need to indulge in such a thing in the sense that if i taught someone of the opposite gender and i repented it's not at all advisable for me to go and speak to her and say listen we used to do this and that and this is haram you have to stop no i have to cut all communications because my relationship with her in the beginning was haram so basically speaking yes if there is a possibility of advising these people reminding of allah bringing them back to islam and rectifying my sin that is what a person should do and allah azzawajal knows best you"
