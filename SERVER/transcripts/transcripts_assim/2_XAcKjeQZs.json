  "transcript": "from pakistan from kashmir he says i have a friend who says heinous things about allah so he says allah is everywhere and not only that he says that i see allah in objects around us at the end of the room i see allah in this table in this animal in this thing now if he said i see allah is everywhere like many ignorant imbeciles say we don't jump the gun and say that they're kafir because they may have misunderstood the verses may have misunderstood a hadith may learn from their scholars whom they respect and they know no one better so they are laymen they don't know the quran they've never read the quran they've never read the hadith so we don't jump the gun but when your friend goes way further than that and claims that allah is in objects or creatures or animals or human beings this is total blasphemy there is no need to any go beyond and try to double check this is kufr to claim that allah azzawajal gets into objects or people or creatures and that you see allah azza this is totally disrespectful so such people usually we consider them to be part of a cult known as who claim that allah azza can be transformed into different creatures and and objects and he can be in such things is above his throne over everything he is in the height subhanahu wa ta'ala and it is not befitting of a king or a ruler or a human being to be in the bathroom or under the carpet or as these imbeciles say let alone allah the almighty subhanahu azzawajal so first of all you have to if you want to give dao to this imbecile you have to talk to him about the existence of allah you have to talk if he acknowledges then you have to talk to him about islam if he then you ask him what are the references of muslims and if he acknowledges that they are the quran the sunnah it's very easy to go to the quran if he doesn't confirm that these are the references and he decides to follow his whims and desires or his logic or his philosophy or whatever he wants to follow then this guy is not a muslim because it's obvious that he is a hypocrite full fledged hypocrite wanting to change the deen and this is why the disbelievers in the west in universities and academics etc they value and glorify ibn arabi al-halaj those who are heretics those who are people of blasphemy and they say that their poetry is so nice this this and that but actually because they are of such caliber of hypocrites who want to deviate and change islam and take people out of the fold of islam"
