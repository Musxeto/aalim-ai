  "transcript": "Now the next question will be from our lady's side. Sheikh I have two questions they're similar. The first question is Sheikh there is a tendency of our youth to be influenced by people who are doing so many inappropriate actions on social media and when one tries to advise them they all gang up against him or her and they say that Allah guide whoever he wants. The second question which is similar to the first it says an advice to the husband who allows their wife to be influencers others are the cameraman themselves behind their wives. Okay the first question because I have a short-term memory so I forgot the second question. Let me go for the first one and then when we come to this you remind me. What was the first question? What did we eat yesterday for lunch? I think I was fasting. But it says there's a tendency of our youth to be influenced by people who are doing so many inappropriate actions on social media. When anyone tries to advise them they all gang up against him. Okay so we have a situation. Now I do not ever entertain the idea of giving light to the public in darkness while burning myself like a candle. Everyone is going to praise me you gave us light. Yes but I'm burning myself. The hell with you. You find your own light. I'm not gonna kill myself. So if finding inappropriate things means that you will be affected by this filth and scum in order to give them advice stay away. Don't care what they do because it's gonna impact you negatively. Your main priority in life is what? Save your own neck. If I am going to save the whole universe while going to hell. No thank you. Let the whole universe go to hell. I go to jannah. Oh shaykh this is selfish. Whether it is selfish or selfie I don't care. What I care is save my neck. The prophets on the day of judgment they will say because they know this is not their position. Only Muhammad is the one who says I will do it. All the messengers say nafsi nafsi. I'm not gonna care about anyone except myself. So why do I say this? A brother came to me once and he was a righteous practicing student of knowledge and he said to me shaykh I am devastated. Why? He said I became addicted to pornography. How is that possible? He said shaykh I'm a teacher in high school and in my country in Saudi Arabia we have a place that governs the internet and whenever you see something inappropriate you report it they block it. So he says I get students coming to me saying teacher this website shows pornography. So I enter the website I take the url or whatever they call it url whatever who cares and then I report it and they block it and I like this. So I started searching and I find every day between 40 to 50 websites like this open. So I block it with the grace of Allah azza wa jal to protect the community. What I did not know is in order to find the website I have to see five seconds to identify with pornography. These five seconds extended to 10 to 15 and then downloading the whole movie and then enjoying it and then now I'm addicted. I'm subhanallah. This guy was the candle. He did many many good things but when you block one website 10 every second are generated because the evil people know how to find loopholes so you only focus on yourself save your neck. Now you see something inappropriate you give one advice. Akhi this is haram. They say not mind your business move on. Go to other people that would benefit and you say yeah give us advice but to keep on insisting on going to them and knocking on their door every single day this is haram this is haram this is haram. No you cannot shove things down people's throat. Give it a try once they don't listen they don't benefit run and go. There are thousands of people waiting for your advice and your good nasiha. I hope this addresses this."
