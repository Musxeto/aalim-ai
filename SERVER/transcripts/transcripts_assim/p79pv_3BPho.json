  "transcript": "Hamza from Pakistan. My question is regarding yesterday I asked the same question, I asked the question yesterday but I couldn't ask properly. It is that I had, my question is that I had a deal with my father that if I study every single day he would deposit 30 dirhams, he would give 30 dirhams to me. So if I'm praying, if I'm studying a subject for example bio or economics I would, the way I'm studying it or the subject I'm studying it, is it haram if it prevents me from praying or if I'm not praying and I'm studying and does that mean that the knowledge which I've gained is not legit with me knowing that, that means that I know that this is not right and I'm still doing it. So does that mean that the knowledge which I've gained despite me knowing that is haram or not? These are two separate things Zaki, not praying is a separate thing. It's like saying Sheikh if I don't pray and I sit on my lazy chair and I breathe, so is my breathing sinful and if I drink some green tea while not praying am I sinful? These are two separate things. Your studying has nothing to do with not praying, your not praying is sinful. Now if you don't pray and you do something beneficial, you go to the gym, you eat, you drink, you study, these are two separate, will Allah put barakah in it? I doubt it. But is it haram for you to study or to learn or to benefit from the knowledge you've gained when you skipped prayer? No, these are two separate things and Allah knows best."
