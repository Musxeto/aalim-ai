  "transcript": "so my question is two days back I did my GLE and I forgot to rinse my nose and mouth after 10 minutes I remembered and I did it and I continued praying without knowing the validity of the G is it considered aser and I should I repeat the G and prayers when did you rinse your nose and mouth what's the the the gap between your rul and rensing them of about 10 minutes it's about about 10 minutes inshallah it is acceptable though it would have been best for you to repeat the because rening the nose and the mouth is an issue of dispute whether it is mandatory or a highly recommended Sunnah the most authentic opinion is of course that it is mandatory in both W and however due to the difference of opinion and due to the hardship that might be caused for those who are ignorant and have done it out of forgetfulness and out of ignorance if it was done immediately afterwards some in the school of thought that say that it is mandatory to Ren your nose and mouth they say that the parts oful the sequences not mandatory or known as Al muat so if you leave a gap like between ta and if I make my TA in the morning and I go to my hotel room and I come in the evening to do my they say it's okay because the m to have them uh done simultaneously is not a must some of the scholars say that this is applicable as well to but the most authentic is that you should do it all at the same time but due to your case due to the 10 minutes Gap I pray inshallah that everything was fine and Allah Knows Best"
