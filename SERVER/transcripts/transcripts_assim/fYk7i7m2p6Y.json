  "transcript": "Adrian from Serbia uh can you show where mustache hands so we can know to where we can trim it the there isn't any specific limitation to it but the scholars say that the mustache should not exceed the upper lip and it should be moderate in length not to be very heavy and thick so that even if you drink milk or something you would find traces on your mustache the Sunnah is that it does not exceed the upper uh uh lip and it's trimmed now if you trim it more than that that would be good but you do not shave it so you you fall short from shaving it and you trim it to number zero for example if you're using a machine and that would be fine"
