  "title": "Urge to use washroom for every prayer, can I do Sunnah prayers first, then make new wudu for fard?",
  "transcript": "Misbah from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam I have a problem. Whenever I'm getting ready for congregation, I suddenly feel an urge to go to the washroom. Even no matter which Salah it is, it always says the same for me. Can I pray my Sunnah prayers at the beginning of the time and just before congregation, I do my Wudu again? Is that okay? Yes, there is no relationship between praying your Sunnah and immediately afterwards praying your Fardh. As long as you offer them both within the beginning and the end time of the Salat, you're fine. And if you're getting such feelings every single prayer, this is Shaytan. Suppress it and move on with it if you don't have any medical issues and Allah knows best."
