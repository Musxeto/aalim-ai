  "transcript": "Hadith number 187 in the book of from the book of which was compiled by may Allah have mercy on his soul the Hadith was narrated by Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him and he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam forbade keeping one's hands on one's waist while praying and in another version for albari AA may Allah be pleased with her said this is the practice of the Jews we know that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam described a number of things to do in Salat and he clearly stated pray as you have seen me pray so the instruction to us is to follow him step by step in the form or in the way that he used to pray and without any doubt if we succeed in doing this we will attain and is the essence of Salat as described earlier so what is this posture that the prophet told us not to do Scholars say that forbidding to put our hands on our waist and the waist is whatever is from the hip till the rib cage and the prophet described to us by uh saying that this is the way of the Jews when they pray so putting your hands over your waist can be like this because we know that the Sunnah is to put your right hand over your left hand on the chest and there's a issue of dispute among Scholars whether to put it under the navl or over the navel and the most authentic opinion is that you put it on your chest which is from here to here but to keep your hands over your waist either this way or to fold your hands like this this is the way of the Arrogant prayer is a form of worship where you display your submissiveness where you display your humility to Allah to do like this like the rappers do or to as may Allah peace with her describe that this is the way of the Jews when they pray this definitely defies the humility you should Express in your Salat and always remember the more you follow the prophet Alam in every single act of his prayer the closer you get to Allah the more you will attain in Salat with the grace of Allah so this is one way of attaining and that is by staying away from what is prohibited during Salah and among them is folding your arms or uh having your hands or arms over your waist Hadith number 188 this was narrated by anas may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam said if supper is brought and the prayer is ready start with it that is with the food before you pray the and this Hadith was agreed upon the Hadith is crystal clear and there will come inshallah at the end of this chapter a similar Hadith where the Prophet forbids us from praying when the food is being served and Scholars go against this Hadith and this is their consent or at least the majority of their opinion in a number of conditions one of them is that when the time of the prayer is so tight that if you eat the prayer time would go out so the majority of Scholars say that you have to pray and leave the the food later on because there is not enough time yet those who among the SCH schol say that uh uh is a priority more than the time itself they say no you eat and this is the opinion of the school of thought IB says it is mandatory upon you to eat and not to pray and if you pray your prayer is invalid another case is when you don't have the urge to eat so the food is being served but you had a sandwich like 5 10 minutes ago and you're full so no one would say no leave Salat and sit and eat because the urge to eat is not there and therefore you would not be confused and your mind would not be occupied by the food being served but if it is the other way around if you're hungry if you're just coming back from work or the food is being served and you have the urge to eat you want you have the desire to do so the scholars say in accordance to this Hadith leave the prayer and this is not only for M as the Hadith stated here because there's another Hadith where it says prayer and there is a general Hadith which which states that whenever the food is being served so regardless of the prayer as long as there is the urge to eat and you want to eat and the prayer is due start with the food all of this so that when you start to pray your mind is free it's not being occupied by worldly matters so you fulfill your prayer and you give it all what you have because there's nothing on your mind and this shows us that it is an issue of conditioning if you succeed with the grace of Allah to condition yourself that when you come to Salat you cut all barriers you cut everything that connects you with this dun and you fully uh uh come and try to fulfill your prayer if you condition yourself and train yourself you will soon inshallah reach a very beautiful and high level of in your prayer this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
