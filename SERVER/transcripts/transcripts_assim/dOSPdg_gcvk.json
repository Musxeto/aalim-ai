  "title": "Am I sinful for dropping my sister off at a school that does a Christian prayer",
  "transcript": "Mikael from South Africa Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I just want to know my sister goes to a non-Muslim school here in our area and I know that she's in the midst of her examination period. I used to go to that school and I know that in the morning before the exam, whilst all the students are seated, they do a prayer, a Christian prayer and we're not really allowed, from what I can remember, we weren't really allowed to leave the exam once the exam papers were handed out. So am I sinful if I drop out of school in the morning? Well this is not a big issue because your sister is not participating with them in this prayer, Christian prayer. So when they're saying their Christian prayer, she could be reciting Ayatul Kursi, she could be reciting anything of the Quran or the Shahada and there is no problem in that. The problem is if this is a mixed school where she does not abide by the hijab and she free mixes with boys and the likes, that is problematic."
