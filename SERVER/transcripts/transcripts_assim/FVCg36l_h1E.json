  "transcript": "so album arrows question is clear the price of the property is 1 million dollars assuming and when you come to sign the contract you pay two hundred thousand this is the government registered amount and this is what they would register in the deed and under the table between you and the seller you give him the balance which is eight hundred thousand why usually they do this to evade taxations and to yanny avoid any means of losing extra money on the whole total amount this is considered to be cheating and breaking the law but is it haram it is haram because you're breaking the law of the government it's a crime and if you were caught red-handed they will put you in jail but as long as the price is fixed which is a $1,000,000 between you and the seller and you give this the transaction is correct but you are sinful for breaking the law"
