and welcome to this new episode of a new program that is known by the signs of the hour and this is a live show which means that we can interact you can ask your questions but because the topic is so vast and huge and we have only five days a week during the month of Ramadan inshallah starting from today Sunday Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday of every week during the month of Ramadan I'm not sure if I'm going to continue in the last 10 nights of Ramadan or not this is still a bit vague to me but because the topic is too vast we will open the lines for your calls if there any questions regarding the topic or something that is related to it if inshallah you have questions the phone lines will be dedicated after half an hour or 25 24 hour uh 24 minutes that is from now so at 5:30 at at uh 3:30 local time Saudi time inshallah we will be taking your calls if you have any uh questions to ask the signs of the hour why is it so important that we would dedicate a program for it don't we have a lot of more important things to discuss well first of all you all know that there are five pillars of Islam and there are six pillars of Iman of belief and one of the pillars of belief is to believe in the day of Resurrection so what does that mean it means that you have to believe that there will come a day that Allah asael would bring All Those whom he had created and hold them accountable for what they had done in this life and anything that is related to the Hereafter anything that is related to the day of judgment or the day of Resurrection or the hour anything that is related to it it is part of this pillar the belief in the day of judgment so when we talk about the signs of the hour when we talk about the blowing in the trumpet which annihilates all living creatures and the blow of the trumpet again when Every Creature would be resurrected and it is the Day of Reckoning when we talk about the resurrection about the Gathering of the cre uh all the creatures in one open Plaza and they would be displayed to Allah when we talk about being hold accountable when we talk about the scales and how Allah would weigh Deeds would weigh individuals would weigh their records and these scales have a a tongue that speaks with it and it has eyes that looks with it when we talk about the and the path that all the Muslims and the Hypocrites as well would have to pass over and it is erected or it is found on top of hell so whoever passes is saved and whoever doesn't falls into hell when we talk about Paradise heavens and we talk about hell all of what governs these issues this is part of the belief in the day of resurrection and because it's important Allah asael has mentioned it in the Quran and in the Sunnah and so many times you find in the Quran those who believe in Allah and the day of judgment or the day of Resurrection the prophet so many times tell usam it it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah and the day of judgment to travel without a m so many whoever believes in Allah and in the day of judgment he should say good things or refrain from Talking he should honor his guest he should not uh harm his neighbor so the prophet so many hadiths can the day of judgment and the belief of it to the belief in Allah and a Muslim and when we talk about a Muslim I'm not mentioning those who are not practicing when we say a Muslim we mean a Muslim who is practicing who is adhering to the instructions of the Quran and Sunnah who is living Islam when you see him you think that this is ISL Islam reincarnated in the sense that whatever he does it relates to Islam and whatever he refrains from it goes against Islam so you have to know exactly what do we mean when we say a Muslim so when you look at a Muslim you find that his life is different than any other human being because the things that govern his life are limited yet his perception of life is unlimited neither by time nor by place a Muslim believes that this world we're living in is a temporary phase 60 years 80 years 100 years at most and then you're going to die but your death inaugurates your eternal life so we look at this life as a transen life it is passing by it is not a place for us to stay it's like a person traveling A Thousand Miles and after 100 miles he goes into a gas station fills it his car up buys a sandwich and moves on no one once he pulls at a a gas station no one would start to erect a building and to reside there because this is just a station so a Muslim he looks at this life in such a fashion time wise and also location wise this world we're living in is so limited it's so small my objective as a Muslim is a paradise that Allah Asel promised those who do well and believe in him and follow the prophet Alam this paradise Allah told us that the weth of it is is like the heavens and the Earth and Allah did not disclose to us how long it is so if the weth is as big as the heavens and the Earth then this is definitely a place that we want to be in and we know that it would satisfy all the things that we were patient and tolerated on this life this is different to someone who does not believe believe in the day of judgment and when I say someone who does not believe in the day of judgment this might be because he is a non-muslim or his belief does not Excel and does not reach the level that the Quran and the Sunnah tell us to be so you could have a Muslim but not a practicing Muslim and his belief in the day of judgment is very little and that is portrayed in how he acts and behave in his life therefore your belief in the day of judgment varies you have people who know for sure and they're certain of the presence of the day of judgment and that is why you find it showing in every single thing they do in their lives and you have someone who is medium rare he does things that go in accordance to his belief of the day of judgment s such such as praying fasting maybe he does some charity work but at the same time he's so indulg in lusts and desires that as if he thinks that he's living forever and there is no accountability and there are those who do not believe in the day of judgment Al together so they live their lives in chaos and this is so much different than a proper practicing Muslim the way they look at things is different the weight and the scale that a Muslim weigh things is different than the other who do not believe in the day of judgment Muslims fear the punishment of Allah and they hope for the reward and the pleasure of Allah Asel so that is why they always balance they do well and they stay away from what is not good and you can see this portrayed in a muslim's way of life whenever calamities fall upon him whenever there are tribulations you will see his stead fast on Islam you will see his strength of Iman you will see his tolerance and being patient when calamities strike because he knows that Allah asael the almighty is the one who rewards and he knows that what Allah asael has stored for us is much better than this life that we live in and the prophet told usat in an authentic Hadith so strange and wonderful the Affairs of the believer when he's struck by a Calamity he's patient and he Praises Allah and this is good for him and when he's struck by favors and blessings of Allah asael he is grateful and he Praises Allah Asel and this is good for him and this is only for the"
