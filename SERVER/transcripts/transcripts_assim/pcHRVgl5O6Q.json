  "transcript": "brother and sisters first on behalf of theic center of I would like to welcome you all tonight on this really important evening with the to thank for accepting to deliver the lecture today and the QA session and tomorrow we willing a this will be held in in city and it is next to the parliament [Music] white without any further Ado we would like to start the Q&A session the questions were asked online we had put up a form and lot of brothers and sisters responded and we have the questions with us I will ask the questions in the sh will respond in Sign Language I don't have a microphone the sh so if it's sign language yes if you understand sign language y okay we'll start with the first question [Music] in uh the first question is can you please draw clear line between Heth or speaking badly of a person in his absence and criticizing the person who is an official position or an organization leader is this is criticizing an organization leader or the official person is it permissible toze it was the prophet who identified what is Reba when he said is to mention your brother with something he hates so when one of the companions objected and said what about if my brother is as I have mentioned him so I said he's short and fat and he is short and fat I said he is stingy and he's very the prophet said this is this is backbiting when you say what is accurately describing him which he hates people to delegate among themselves in his absence but if you accused him of something that is not in him this is slandering you have slandered him which is a combination of and L lying which is even worse so it doesn't matter islamically whether he's a government official or not it's the same sin worldly it matters because he's going to throw you in jail he's going to take your money he's going to ex trite you out of the the country he would do evil things he's an official what you crazy so what is the benefit of it there is no benefit except that it cools your heart a little bit when you vent when you say oh this ruler did this did that me Allah cursing me Allah Breaking Me Allah then what is there anything going to change nothing only thing that will change is the amount of hatred of you created in people's hearts towards him which is not beneficial believing in the day of judgment this man will suffer do you want me to swallow it or it's okay okay because it's becoming too intimate anyhow so this is not permissible now becomes permissible in Necessities someone who is going to a scholar quote unquote who's not a scholar who's deviant who's a man of innovation who has corrupt AA and the brother is naive he doesn't know so I have to go up and and tell him this guy is a deviant uh uh innovator he has corrupt AA don't go to him the brother said don't backbite so no this is not backbiting this is to clarify and to warn similarly someone comes to me and says uh brother so and so has proposed to my sister do you think we should give him in marriage and I know the brother is a womanizer till date or he does drugs or he is having something that would not make people want to give him in marriage till date now I have the option to say a if you trust me don't give him in marriage but I will not expose him because he does things in secrecy I cannot expose him and tell you he's a junkie or he does drugs or he does this and that I can't but if you trust me if he insists and there is no other way around to warn him except to expose him I have to because he's coming to ask in Sunnah one of the female companions came to the prophet Alat wasam and said to him two men propose to me mub ab sufyan and Abu Jah which one should I choose what did the prophet say said as for mua he's Stone broke he doesn't have money as for Abu jaham he's a person who does not leave the stick from his shoulder which means in Arabic either he beats women or he's a frequent traveler the stick he puts his clothes in his bags and he like a backpack and he travels a lot so he wouldn't be a very good husband when he travels a lot but I suggest that you marry us Z and she married him and she was very happy with him so the prophet exposed someone comes to ask you I'm going into partnership there's a joy venture between me and brother Abdullah and he said wo brother Abdullah deals in River brother Abdullah already cheated Six Brothers before you he took their money and fled and I said I will not backbite him all the brother will be the seventh no you have to expose you have to say so these things you have to be careful of sometimes it is not backbiting if it's a form of identification so do you know sheim uh which one the one with the big nose oh yeah I know he's he's funny man okay I'm a big nose I have to do something about it this is a form of identification do you know Ahmed yeah the short man no no I'm talking about the tall guy okay I know him you know abdah that the fat one this is not to backbite this is to identify and this is found all the books of Hadith and so on they describe people in the Hadith of the Salah when the man said oh prophet of Allah is the prayer shortened into two or you forgot and his name was nicknamed as the man with the two long arms because he had two long arms so the prophet said what did say he described him of having to the the man did not say she you hurt me you insulted me by calling me this name no this is a form of identification and it's pretty uh uh normal inshallah and I hope this answers your question before we move to the next question there's a silver Taho on the right hand side of the mid which is blocking some cars please you could move it the next question is I working in an Islamic Bank and it has been acquired by another bank I may lose my job and I have got an offer from a non-islamic bank should I join the non-islamic bank please advice Allah says in chapter five [Music] collaborate upon righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate upon aggression and vice and sin so joining an an un-islamic bank which is a conventional interest based bank is totally prohibited even if you work as a janitor or as a security uh uh guard or as a driver you have nothing to do with collecting riba you are collaborating with them and the scholars say that this is not permissible may Allah provide for you and for all of us Halal risk the next question is my husband does not want the hassles of a worldly life and wishes to live on Ms can a man live his family and live a life of solitude on another planet PS have got a MAG wife also our are I beg to differ from your question because I have experience in counseling sessions I can tell by a few words definitely you're not only nagging you are a woman who scrutinizes the man to the extent that he wants to flee the whole earth and take an xflight with alen musk to another planet life doesn't go on like this it takes two to tangle and most women unfortunately don't seem to see anything in this universe other than themselves being the center of it and everything revolves around it and that would be entirely true with a lot of men so a lot of men also think that the whole universe revolves around them and the women should only do what Simon Says stand on one foot for half an hour and now jump what is this she's my wife she's obliged to obey me and the wife thinks no he has to do this he has to do that where are my rights okay we will give you your rights but where are your obligations and responsibilities what do you mean you're obliged to do the the following List have you done anything of it no but he didn't do any okay now who came first the egg or the chicken we can spend hours Without End debating but we will not go anywhere and at the end one of us will go to Mars so again you have to come down to earth and speak and communicate with your spouse to identify the problem to put the pros and cons of your spouse on the scale and see what overwhelms and then accept if the pros overwhelms the cons the good things in them and try to overlook the bad things nobody's perfect except the prophet Muhammad Alat wasam so don't look for Perfection before you look in the mirror and if you look in the mirror you will look for another plan as well and Allah knows BL the next question is why are most Muslim Scholars silent on the brutality atrocity in oppression in Gaza yeah what a beautiful question what did you do my friend what did you do why are Muslim Scholars are silent and not doing anything what did you do oh I criticize the scholars Muslim schol ERS all over the world are talking within their ability and I am certain that they're all praying night prayer and tud and doing a lot of Dua and they're doing everything in their ability but we have limits we have boundaries no it's not a my business she go and throw yourself from a building to make a statement be my guest I'll follow you when you do this I'll follow no you're a scholar okay then sit down and shut up if I'm a scholar listen to what I have to say you don't have the ability to speak and judge things from your Ivory Tower when you yourself are not doing anything the scholars have limitations have boundaries and they do the Lev best yeah let's assume they're cowards let's assume they don't have a fine don't they have many many good things that they're contributing to the community and to the Muslims and then better they it's the only thing left in this world is to do this thing that you want them to do okay we support may Allah destroy isra say a me so someone hesitant H should I do this I don't know my contract is about upon to Renewal next month may Allah destroy so what we support our Muslims brothers and sisters unconditionally not only in Palestine in China in uh uh the rohinga in in in Burma we support them wherever there is oppression but then what oh she you why don't you speak about this and that okay I'll speak about it what about this and that is this top of the pops are we in the the the music industry List the 10 best songs what would you like me to sing for you this is not Islam and this is a problem with Layman with people of ignorance people who do not study the dean I come and give a who good but why didn't you speak about this and that okay next week I speak about this and that good but why do you don't speak and teach the people how to pray said okay I'll teach the people next week how to perform M and the one comes to me she why do you only you Scholars speak speak about purity and urine and mensis what did you speak about something that benefits the um how many topics do I have gazillion how many do I have 54 a year and if you look at my track record of 37 years of alhamdulillah before I retired last year you will find that I've covered everything almost still every at the end someone comes to you and say sh why don't you speak about this so I speak about this next week sh why don't you speak about the S we don't know the prophet so I speak something about the S said sh this is all what you do Sufi stuff talk about politics I speak about politics and then another says you are you're doing this and that speak about tar I speak about tar back again to mensis and postnatal bleeding or or call alen musk and go to another planet maybe they will establish a new Masjid this is not how it is done Islam is so huge so big but when you come with the intention of criticism I don't want to learn I want to criticize the speaker I don't like his voice I don't like he looks how he looks I don't like his Arab attire I don't like his accent I don't like this you will never learn when you come to the with the sole purpose of criticizing W you will not ever learn maybe you will not even enter Jenna why because your intention is not for the sake of Allah your intention is to criticize no come to benefit even if the man giving or leading the prayer is much much less than you in knowledge because your objective is to learn and to get closer to Allah even if a child comes and gives you advice you learn it and you benefit from it and Allah knows best the next question is is it allowed to a woman committed which resulted into pregnancy is it allowed to do what to a woman to to to marry who made the zena the woman I know who made the Z with her it takes two to tango she didn't do it alone on another planet yes huh and is the man asking is the C culprit her partner or someone else oh so many people know the woman I I'm not very good in social media so apparently I have to learn okay no it's not and the marriage is invalid definitely the majority of Scholars say if a man fornicates with a woman and they get married whether she's pregnant or not the marriage is invalid the contract because she's not chased and we cannot say that she is pregnant or not pregnant we don't know if she's pregnant the vast majority say from him is invalid and this is something that to be looked into Case by case but this is what the vast majority of Scholars say now for someone else who is doubtfully a real man to come and marry someone whom he knows she's pregnant from another man what is this I might as well marry a a a public toilet what it's like reusable condoms you don't have those what are you doing this is totally insane for a Muslim to do so the marriage is definitely invalid the next question is what can we tell someone who justifies his sins by saying that actions are just by their intentions and they use this every time to get out of it's a immediately slap him as strong as you can on his face and when he's shocked and say why did you do this said my intention was to wake you up if he's going to accept this alhamdulillah will he he will try to get even why are you doing this my intention was good he said yes but your action was def defitely not good alhamdulillah in Islam we judge by both when interpreting to test you who is among you the best inde Deeds what kind of best ineds those though that are pure and sincere to Allah and that collaborate with the Sunnah so if you do something that does not collaborate with the Sunnah even if your intention is good you are sinful I see a beautiful blonde she's a bombshell I approach her and I said your father must be a terrorist she says why because you're a bombshell so I said to her let's go for dinner and I give her da what are you doing W my intention is to give her da is this acceptable will you guys say she's intention is good of course not yeah I thought you were naughty naughty shh not naughty Professor what are you doing Haram so the intention has to co coincide and be in sync with the action one of them is wrong the the whole action is bad you pray like the prophet Alam your intention is not for Allah it is void your intention is for the sake of Allah but you innovate a new religion a new thing it is void it has to be two together and Allah knows best the next question is is it permissible to read the Quran from the mobile and do we get the same amount of Good Deeds as we reading from the Quran W I haven't touched the Quran maybe in in 7 years I only read it from my mobile and from my iPad and it is the Quran it is this the speech of Allah whether you read it from the Quran whether you read it from the TV whether you read it from memory whether you listen to it from someone this is the word of Allah so there is no problem in doing that insh the next question is it permissible to land at J airport without then go to mikah and rest for a day and next day go to the prophet said when he named the these locations are forever whoever passes through them who is not from their uh uh residency who wants to perform and meaning that you cannot uh pass them and do if you want to make and so if someone is coming from Kuwait where is yourik or known as or this is your so when you come and you come on your flight and you land in J did you make no you stay 2 days 3 days visit the locality then when you want to go to meca you drive all the way to t you wear your whether from jida or from it doesn't matter once you reach the mik you say and you drive another half an hour mecah make your om you're solid good you had not done anything you want to make youram from the airplane that's even better but either way is halal what is not Halal is for you to come to jid and assume your from jid or say I will go to m in and make my from there this is not permissible why because you passed over the mikat so this is the mik you have to go to okay if I come to J and then I go to Medina and on the way from Medina I make myam for known as from Medina itself mik of people of Medina is this valid this is okay because it's far far further than uh your own mik and you are intending om while passing by a valid mik so I hope this answers your question the next question is how can someone break the fast if heing suppose I'm tring from K to KU and I start my fast in and arrive init in the afternoon what when will I my this is something that most Muslims are ignorant of Islam is a beautiful religion and a religion of ease you're accountable not by your watch by the position of the sun when do I as a person fasting refrain from eating and drinking when the F breaks how do I know that if I'm flying over the Atlantic I don't know even what country I'm over I'm over the ocean which time zone should I use your window this is your time zone you look from the window the moment you see the white thread which is the fer the break break of the fer that is horizontal not vertical that is horizontal Over the Horizon this is f you refrain okay I'm still flying I'm fasting when should I break my fast According to which time zone according to your window again yes look at the window you see the Sun is going down going down going down it disappeared y okay what country sh it doesn't matter this is your Islam likewise your your your your all your prayers are are done by looking regardless whether you are on the other planet of the sister or you are on whatever this is Islam it's not related to watch or your app or your uh time zone it's related to the son and Allah knows rest the next question is sometimes for offering Salah I happen to forget the number of what should I do in this situation should I continue or restart it depends if you are suffering from this in every single Salat or every day this means that Shan is messing up with your head most people who suffer from this illness on daily basis they know what they prayed but Shan comes to the 5% maybe you're it's not fourth ra maybe it's third deep down I know it's 99.99% I've prayed for but this is something that is you know scratching me from inside I don't know what to do let us add one this is shaan but if it's normal no I'm Every Day I'm fine I have no issues once every blue moon seriously I am lost I'm confused H three or four three or four in this case the prophet says to those who have it once every blue moon disregard the doubt where is the doubt I'm doubtful whether I prayed three or four where is the doubt the fourth because three I'm certain I've prayed but the doubt is whether I prayed the fourth or not disregard the doubt number four and add another ra and then prostrate for uh uh forgetfulness before the Salam and that is concluding a prayer so I hope this clarifies it a bit the next question is is practicing or learning yoga forbidden in Islam yes it is because yoga is based on Buddhist Hindus Hindu uh Traditions so and they're facing the sun in some postures and they have these yeah uh worshiping other than Allah in this kind of sport though the stretching is good so if you can have a routine of stretches that has nothing to do with yoga or the name or the practice there's no problem in stretching it's good for your muscles but when you say well I'm going to my yoga class this is my yoga mat this is my yoga pants and you have the same postures and facing the Sun at certain uh uh names and and and pauses and the likes this is totally Haram the next question is is wearing a or UL with only Quran versus sh the vast majority of Scholars say that this is a means of shik but some Scholars say that it is not however to be safe it's best rather than to be sorry as for the Hadith of may Allah be pleased with him that he used to hang tablets at some children's necks with verses of the Quran some say that this is this was to be memorized like in they write it on tablet and they rub it and this is one of the best ways of memorizing the Quran write and rub write and rub until it it sticks into her head not that it was to seek protection from Allah so we would not say it's sh but it is means of sh and the vast majority of worn nowadays they don't have Quran they have drawings they have uh certain T tables in them and some wordings that are not even recognizable in Arabic or any other language so this is plain shik the next question is after praying Salah I prefer to stay in my position so that the Angels ask for forgiveness of me but there are many people around who try to move me or go over me and when I do not move they find it through what should I do stay in your position who dares to move you what are you transferable items anybody who comes and and and try to move you go pray anywhere why you want to come to this spot of mine this is ridiculous no this seems that you have low self-esteem you think that everybody is looking at you you hear people you think that they're talking about you so this is your Shan giving you OCD that people want to jump over me they're going to kill me pray and let the Angels pray on you inshallah and make Dua for you I'll make Dua for you as well the next question is when I visit my father's grave his grave is in the middle of the symmetry so while walking towards it I pass by other graes and I make Dua by facing K should I go to the gra to Dua or can I go outside no you can do Dua for anyone who's engraved and engraved who is yeah buried whether he's your father or anyone else without the need to face the there is no need to face the but if you do face the make the grave between you and the and you can raise your hands and make Dua so why do you want to make it outside you're not praying Salat Salat is not permissible to be prayed in a cemetery in a graveyard Salat that includes bowing and prostration and this is totally prohibited but to pray in the Dua and to invoke Allah Allah for them or Allah have mercy on them Allah expand their graves this is permissible to be done as you're walking and this is the Dua we say and so forth no problem the next question is can the answer is no the most authentic opinion is that a woman in on her mensis must not enter the Masjid and the evidence behind this is the Hadith authentic Hadith mother says I was in my home and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was in in seclusion in the in the in the Masjid and the house of the Prophet Alam was adjacent to the Masjid and there was a door where he can go in and out so he asked for something that she would hand him that thing so she said oh prophet of Allah I'm on my mensis the prophet said I know you on your menis your menis is not in your hand you're just going to insert your hand to the Masid and hand it to me which means that he told her that your body is not to enter the Masjid but not your hand your hand is fine and Allah knows best the next question is this question may seem stupid but I know that Allah created human being to worship him but why did Allah need us to worship the humans and GS why do Allah needs us to worship him I understood the first question the devils and the Gins what was it yeah why do Allah create us to worship him why does he need us to worship him why does Allah need us to worship Him Allah doesn't need us and he doesn't need us to worship Him He created us and the Jin to worship Him and the Jin includes the devils and Satan and El and everybody else so Allah created both of us to worship Him and gave us the choice to do so and he doesn't need us if he gather all of us and toss Us in Hellfire no problem if he annihilates us all and does not resurrect us nobody's going to have the the power and authority to question Allah why did you do this why did you do didn't you do that so he is doing us a favor by creating us and by giving us all these luxuries in life and after death he puts us in Paradise for eternity who's winning we are so Allah doesn't need us but at the same time Allah is not questioned why did you do this this why didn't you do it in another way nobody has the power to do this because he's the owner if I take one dinar of my pocket and burn it you don't have the right to complain say sh why are you doing this none of your business it's my din I do with it whatever I want and Allah has the highest example of all Allah does whatever he wants though the we trust that he is knowledgeable that he's fair that he's just and that he's wise subhah the next question is is it permissible for two people from different countries to get married with their Muslims and what is the ruling of the parents not agree the first question of course it is permissible to get married if they're Muslims whether they are from the same country or different nationalities whether one is black and the other one is white it doesn't matter as long as they're Muslims they can get married now whether the parents agree or not not it does not matter what the parents say except for one person and that is the father of the girl he's the guardian and his decision makes it or breaks it so if everyone on Earth agree that these two get married and the father of the girl says no there is no marriage valid and if everybody disagrees including both mothers and the sisters and the siblings they disagree but the father of the girl says I'm fine and the bride or the groom is a real man and he says I'm financially independent yes I can take care of her I don't need anyone's opinion the marriage is valid is it allowed to take profits from fixed deposits in Islamic Bank Islamic Banks if it is an Islamic real Islamic Bank yes but real quote unquote capital letters bold font in red and two underline not everything is real Islamic Banks nowadays everything you just stick Islamic with it it comes fine you have Islamic Art Islamic music in the last uh uh concert a month ago in in in in Scotland three Indonesian women came and played musical instruments in heavy metal and they were hijabi a band in Scotland playing heavy metal and they were hijabis what is this Islamic heavy metal Islamic Rock I don't know how they do it but somewhere oh Subhan Allah so this is ridiculous tomorrow we will have Islamic Billy dancing now how is this going to be it's Islamic Shar certified so you have to look into the dealings of the Islamic Bank is it real or is it camouflaging their transactions by the word Islamic and nowadays unfortunately you can get so many fatwas for the price two for the price of one depending upon the bonuses yes there are Islamic Sharia that follows Islam and Scholars who fear Allah but in the midst of Dr doctor so and so so many people are having the title doctor so and so the doctorate is not an indication whether they're saying the truth or not but people are we have four members on the Sharia board Dr so and so Dr so and so Dr so and so this is kosher mallah and and no you have to look into it if the Sharia board is reliable and they're dealing in Islamic uh dealings yes go ahead put it in fix deposit there's no problem that this is mud they're taking your money and working in halal Investments with low risk and they giving you little profit that is variable and if there is loss you're going to be sharing your share in that loss there's no problem in that in the next question is a person borrowed 200 KD from me and he's unable to repay this amount can I cond this am to Z no you cannot this is hitting two birds with one stone because you know that the 400 KD is never coming back to your pocket and this year you have to give 400 KD zakat over your wealth so you say hm why not keep my 400 zakat and forgive this guys the the debt and I would be hitting two birds with one stone and this is totally prohibited and unacceptable the next question is when someone dies in The in subcontinent B is delayed for some love wants to come from our places is this AOW if the delay is a day or two or so for a legitimate reason and there is no fear that the body would change I hope this is fine but I would never do it why because the prophet yeah okay let's let's be frank without any emotions I know most of you say this my father I have to take the last look you haven't called your father in 6 months now you want to have the last look who you fooling oh he's my brother he's this he's that okay this is the dead person you love him yes what do you want I want to wait 3 4 days until I see him and then we bury him okay if this that person were to speak and we know that he's destined to Jenna would he say okay yeah no no no worries no I'm not in a rush I have enough time time take take your time 2 days 3 days I'll wait or he will say the hell with them I want to go to my Paradise I want to go to my Jenna what would he say so you are depriving him from going to Jenna from meeting whatever he wants to meet and whatever he had worked his whole life for just to see his face yeah he will send you a snapshot what what is this so my point of view is don't wait even one second the prophet saidat to honor a deceased is by hastening in burying it this is the honor because you want to get the man straight to his inshallah reward and favors and blessings from Allah and Allah knows best the next question is in our in there was no Im so a came up and decided and is this of course it's valid just because he Kuai is valid definitely racist what what has his nationality have to do with the question yeah people are so racist nowadays it doesn't make any sense by the way this is also part of ignorance because people don't know what are the pillars what are the mandatory acts what are the sunnas if a non kuti comes and leads the prayer and reads only the fa whether in or or only the prayer is 100% valid he didn't read anything after fat yes it isah not only that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in Hajj in Mina he recited in the first and also in the second in so yeah what did the guy do he did write and he recited the Sunnah and there's no problem in the Salah at all the next question is are we allowed to deny the invitation of our reles has it not accept the invitation what kind of invitation make your question clear here and not generic because now I have to explain it would take time if you said are we obliged to answer the invitation of a wedding this is a invitation or this is a invitation the answer would be if there is no Haram involved like free mixing or listening to music or the likes yes you're obliged to obey and to answer but if someone says no they just want us to have dinner no you not obliged imagine how many invitations I get to dinner every night unfortunately N I hope we're having dinner tonight so but imagine as a Sheikh she please come and have dinner with me come have lunch and I said I have to answer this I would be really any no this is not mandatory the sh invitation marriage or this is you have to answer unless there is a legitimate reason not to answer it and Allah knows best the next question is a little bit long I'm in Kuwait and I'm originally from Pakistan my parents have fixed my marriage with my cousin in Pakistan and I not agree to marry him but my parents because of society are not allowing me to marry someone else what should I do and do the parents have the right to control even this in my life you have to become a man you're a wimp and you don't have a spine no one on earth can force you to marry someone you don't want and ask me she how many counseling sessions have you done with cousins gazillion he married his cousin she married her cousin it was an arranged marriage they didn't want to marry she loved someone else and she was forced to marry her cousin and after the marriage she still thinks about about him and 3 4 years down the line he surfaced on her Facebook and they started chitchatting and now she doesn't want her husband and she comes say I don't love my husband what should I do you accept it in the first place I was forced my father threatened to disown me my brother threatened to put acid water and this is a common practice I think yeah I don't know why they get acid water I have to test every water I get before I drink it so they said acid water and I had to marry it okay what about you you're a man oh my father said he's not going to put my name in The Inheritance and all the lands he will give to my siblings and he did this he did that and I said okay I I work outside I will marry my cousin but I will marry the one I love if I'm in Emirates or in in here or there be a man and put your foot down whether it's your parents whether your mom is threatening you that I have heart attack I will die if you don't marry may Allah have have mercy on you my mother W I love you but I'm not going to destroy my life and the life of the woman I get married just to please you and please my father because this is destruction having said that first of all you have to do a drill you have to do a drill what is a drill before you start saying Oham said don't get married look into the one you're marrying so your cousin that they're telling you to get married to how is she well I don't want to marry her yes she is she was Miss Karachi in 2014 and Mah she's now repenting and she memorizes the Quran by the 10 and she memorizes the six books of Hadith and she is a Pious woman and she teaches in orphanages and she is good in the community and she is checking all the boxes but I don't want to marry her she well you stupid I'm here I'm ready just show me where is your your uncle house I'll go someone like this you cannot miss don't be stupid just because your parents are forcing you to marry your cousin if she checks checks all the boxes where will you find someone like that likewise look at your cousin if he's a man oh she he's Mah he's well respected he's very kind to his sisters and to his mother he's very fair he has a good job he's an engineer he's building his own house he has a lot of work in the community and he's handsome he's athlete he does marathon every two years and he plays uh so many sports he's excellent so but she I don't want to be forced to get married you're stupid he should not look at one like you you ugly pig with all du respect that I'm not talking to you sisters don't get me wrong I'm just generically speaking so if the one proposed check all the boxes go for it chance comes once in a lifetime wasting it just because of your arrogance because of your Defiance but just because of this or that is not a smart thing to do but you have to weigh the pros and cons and Allah knows best last two questions the next question is is it permissible to offer Dua while performing in the the answer is yes without any doubt don't listen to Scholars from this continent or a subcontinent that say do not make Dua in prayer only in na prayer they have no proof to support this Allah ordered you on the Hadith of the Prophet by saying the closest you are the closest servant of Allah is to Allah when he's in sujud so choose whatever Dua you want because you will be answered who said this Muhammad wasam did he say in na prayer no in F prayer no in any do Dua how many gods do you have one who will stop me from making Dua to him I will make Dua whenever I'm in suud whether or na the issue is can I do it in other than Arabic ah now this is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is if you're not a native if if you don't know how to do it in Arabic then do it in your language I can say oh God forgive me I know this but if I want to say oh Allah let me marry my cousin who lives in um somewhere else and who checks all the boxes I don't know how to do this in Arabic do do it in your native language without any problem the next question was about making Dua in a different language the sh already answered that next this Audi for coming today anday with us so just before we leave to announcements the first one is as I said earlier will be tomorrow City and we have HMA charity at the back who are collecting donations for B and other places please donate generously and mayward you all and hope to see you at our future events muham"
