  "transcript": "says if i see a pattern that looks nice somebody designed it but i see it and i mimic it or i do something similar to it and i sell it is this halal the answer is yes even if they patent it that patent is for themselves and for commercially not to be used but if you are interested in it in a painting or a drawing and you or a pattern which is rarely patented i i hope this is the right verb why because patterns are images that don't require a lot of creativity so the patterns you have on some uh pieces of cloth or dresses everybody does this so it's not patent maybe if you take the design and put the designer's logo or the designer's name that would be haram but the way it looks and if you mimic that or you draw it yourself and manufacture it i don't see anything wrong with that unless it is illegal you have to consult your lawyer"
