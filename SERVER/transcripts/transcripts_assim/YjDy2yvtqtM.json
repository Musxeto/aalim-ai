  "title": "Is human nature the same for both men and women? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "it says it is now what is meant by a woman or a man nature is different is this referring to appearances because we are told human nature is the same for all like desires greed jealousy love or of wealth etc no this is not true men and women are different appearances or physically they may look alike having a head two arms two legs being able to speak maybe women speaking more than men considerably but beside that they are different in how they think in how they feel men are more realistic logical they don't involve a lot of feelings in their lives that's why they're they're having hearts of stone while women are emotional they involve a lot of emotions in their life and this is why we love them because if a man was married to a woman without emotions without feelings he feels like he's married to his buddy a friend a man and if a woman marries a man with too much feelings that whenever she speaks to him he starts to weep and cry this is what is this she wants a man that orders her that protects her that steers the marriage and the family to safety so they are different when women speak or sit with other women they talk endlessly about things that men would never ever speak about and vice versa so when I sit with the boys we talks we talk about cars property prices about inflation stocks about politics economy never ever talk about our personal lives I would never say that yeah my my wife went to the the beauty parlor and she's doing her nails I wouldn't do anything like that nobody knows anything about my life women on the contrary when they sit they tell everything my husband did this my husband did that my children went to school and this happened my daughter-in-law said this to my son and they had a fight and they gossip and they exchange stories and they put all of their emotions in it this is how they are built generally speaking there might be some exceptions therefore they are different from one another their orientation is different the way they think the way they talk and the way they appreciate men in general failed to say thank you I got a call from a brother the other day he is telling me that my wife is angry with me and I misunderstood the meaning of a hadith the Prophet says Sam whoever does not thank people is not grateful to Allah so he said from this hadith I thought that thanking people would be Sheikh because I'm not doing it to Allah so I never praised my wife's cooking or doing good things today she gave me a good meal and I failed to say thank you it's a good meal because I didn't want to praise her why not praising her she because in another hadith the Prophet said that if you praise your Muslim brother like cutting his neck how people think the hadith of not praising others isn't things related to religion so if you come to me and says you're awesome you are the most righteous scholar I've ever seen I would say hmm yeah I know that's good and I would act to be humble stuff you see there sure are some you've got this so much to Islam and now we're practicing and now we love Allah all is because of you and I said stuff inside my head is inflating and I'm thinking yeah and I kinda have a lot of good videos as well and the Q&A sessions are beautiful definitely you've enjoyed it I think of myself in a way that Shaitaan is happy this is Haram because with time I'll justify any sin that I do by saying to myself yeah yeah I have treated man so many people enjoy my lectures I'm way in paradise but praising people and things related to dunya is definitely permissible and recommended so your wife does a good job in preparing a meal Wow the food is great masha'Allah you're a great cook this is not an religion this isn't dunya she wears a beautiful dress even so beautiful yeah she faked it Wow look at this dress so beautiful you look gorgeous I don't know which is making the other more beautiful you making the dress beautiful or the dress making you look beautiful this gives you fuel for a whole year of compliment she's satisfied this is totally permissible so when you come to the issue of the nature of men and women it's different women love to be praised you have to praise them even if you like it is it sly is a good deed it's Halong say how look how beautiful she looks how good how she smells how nice her cooking is even if you lie you'll be rewarded for that so yes men and women are different and allah azzawajal knows best you"
