  "transcript": "foreign the supplications at the start of the prayer that is after takbir there are a number of supplications that the prophet salallahu s foreign o allah distance me from my sins is just as you have destined the east from the west oh allah purify me of my sins as you purify a white garment from filth or as we purify a wart garment from filth o allah cleanse me of my sins with snow water and hail this beautiful hadith was reported in muslim and bukhari and this is the wordings of muslim in al-bukhari purify me of my sins with water snow and hail with this order now what does this hadith tells us it portrays to us the relationship between a slave and his master it portrays to us how a prayer should be showing your submissiveness showing your need showing your poverty to allah azzawajal in arabic we say there is no one praying to allah azza except wanting allah azzawajal to forgive him so what are you doing the prophet i salat was clearly displaying his poverty to allah azza begging him for forgiveness so he begins with asking allah azzawajal to make him as far away from his sins as the east from the west they will never meet up and this shows you the humility and the humbleness of the prophet because allah has forgiven all of his previous and coming sins yet he says this in his prayer he says purify me from my sins as the white garment is cleansed and washed and purified when there's stain on it and then he says wash me from my sins and he gave the metaphor that the sins that would lead to allah's punishment in hell fire such fire needs to be extinguished these sins are hot and burning so wash me from my sins with water then a bit colder snow then way colder hail so that a person would be purified now let us be frank when we pray do we say this dua most of you would say yes but do we feel this dua and the vast majority would say no we just pat it we just say it without concentration without feeling the need to be purified from our sins and this is why we rarely find a taste for our prayers unlike how the prophet alaihis allah used to deal with prayer beautiful meanings strong and profound ideas and thoughts behind every single phrase you say in the prayer this is one dua another dua that the vast majority of muslims memorize by heart because it's short and concise the prophet used to say alaihis how perfect you are this is one translation and the most famous glorified be o allah and i praise you blessed you or blessed be your name and lofty is your majesty and none has the right to be worshipped except you what is this dua this dua was narrated by umar may allah please with him they all said that the prophet used to say this dua though it's not in the sahih the first one is higher in authenticity yet the scholars say that this one is greater due to that it is pure praising of allah glorifying allah the almighty so you say glorified be you and praised and blessed is your name and high and elevated is your wealth and majesty and there is no god worthy of being worshiped except you so you're not asking for anything you're just simply praising allah the almighty which indicates that you are totally devoting your prayer to allah azza nothing for your sake and again and again we repeat the dua is divided into two types one which everybody knows the meaning of asking allah oh allah give me o allah provide for me o allah forgive me o allah admit me to jannah the second type of dua is the dua of glorifying allah and praising him such as where is the dua this is the dua of yunus when he was in the belly of the of the whale subhanallah there's nothing you're asking for you're just praising allah the almighty such praise is considered to be dua but it's called fana du al ibaada dua of worship unlike dua of requesting o allah forgive me o allah protect me o allah give me. this is dua al-masala asking allah and both are types of dua such dua and is to be said in the beginning of the salat and this is all the time we have till we meet next time i live overload [Music] foreign"
