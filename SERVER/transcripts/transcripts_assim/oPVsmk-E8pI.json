  "transcript": "so nowadays when you go to a soothsayer or a fortune teller and the fortune teller tells you that next week you'll get a call from xyz and he will offer you a job and your wife will cheat on you and your mother would inherit a lot of money etc by just going to that fortune teller without believing him you have made the prayers of the next 40 days invalid there's no reward for you at all allah does not accept your prayers for 40 days and likewise those who read the zodiacs the stars ways your luck this week but if you go and you believe so you hear what the fortune teller has to say and then a week later you call your friend and said it it happened exactly as the fortune teller said then you've exited the fold of islam this is without any dispute or difference of opinion the hadith is crystal clear when you believe you become a kafir because you believe that someone else other than allah knows the unseen and he's not a messenger to be told by allah azzawajal of what's going to happen so this belief of yours is sufficient one says okay how did he know well it could have been a wild guess he could have understood that from your answers to some of his questions he could have investigated about your lifestyle what you did in the past and gathered information about you and he could have a companion of the jinn whom eavesdrop to whatever the angels are saying when allah orders them something and they manage to give one another the prophecy while meteoroids strike them one by one killing them until one of them manages to take this piece of information add to it 99 lies and give it to the fortune teller who by turn comes and tells you all of this and nothing sticks of his lies except that particular thing he is dropped as the prophet said so believing that someone knows the unseen is blasphemous even the prophet alison does not know dancing except what allah has revealed to him the angels don't know the unseen except what allah revealed to them you"
