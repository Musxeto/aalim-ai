  "title": "Praying in a different masjid on Friday",
  "transcript": "if the masjid is close to my house that i pray for in usually but during friday i tend to go to a further message or to another is this permissible or not due to its cleanliness and to the air conditioner well this is permissible whether you go to it because of these two reasons or because you like the recitation of the imam or because the khutba is far touching and moving to you than the one next to your home it is permissible but some people think that you should not leave the masjid in your neighborhood and go to somewhere else it's a misconception unless by doing this everybody would be abandoning the message that no one would pray in the masjid no in this case it's it's a different issue especially on friday a lot of the muslims tend to go and to choose a masjid to their uh liking and a message that would suit them best"
