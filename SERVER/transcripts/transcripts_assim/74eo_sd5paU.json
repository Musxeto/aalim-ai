  "title": "Will we enter Paradise (Jannah) by  our good deeds or Allahâ€™s Mercy? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "nor says from nigeria that i have a confusion between in so many places in the quran allah says that whoever does this and that would enter jannah the prophet says whoever does this and that would enter jannah and in another hadith we are told by the prophet that none of you will enter jannah except with allah's mercy or in let me rephrase that none of you will enter jannah through his own deeds so the companion said not even you o prophet of allah he said not even me except that allah showers me with his mercy here the prophet is telling us that the jannah paradise is not in exchange for your deeds meaning that hey i have done this and this this i should get first class i should get business class why am i not getting to jannah quickly why am i spending so much time no wait wait wait your deeds are not a currency you get janna for it's not in exchange paradise is allah's mercy and he gives it to you because he wants to give it to you now he made conditions and one of them conditions is that you make good deeds so a person without any good deeds without any iman coming and say i'd like to enter jannah allah has made a precondition that you work if you did not work most likely you won't be admitted to jannah most likely but if you work most likely you will enter jannah unless you have this arrogance in you saying listen i've done so many good deeds in my life so i deserve to enter jannah regardless no this is not true and in the israelis israelis israelites i don't know how to say it israelites maybe i don't know um the tales that we learned from the bani israel which do not go against our religion and there is nothing wrong in talking about it it was reported that there was a man who worshipped allah for so many decades and he had only a river and a tree to eat from and he died so on the day of judgment allah tells the angels take that my servant to jannah through my mercy and the man says oh lord with all due respect i have never done a single sin in my life why would i enter jannah with your mercy not with what i have done so allah brings the scale and all of his deeds of decades like 700 years or whatever are put on one hand and other side the blessing of eyesight and the blessing of eyesight outweighs it then the man says okay okay i get the point admit me to jannah with your mercy or through your mercy oh allah so definitely it is not our deeds that will entitle us to get to jannah it's allah's mercy but we have to do good deeds as to the best of our ability so that allah would have his mercy upon us accordingly and allah azza knows best you"
