  "transcript": "My name is Benjamin Kokasa, a student of Egalai Media form academy. My first question is you said um when Jesus Christ died um rising up he told the people that he is going to send his father is going to send a comforter to them. But to what I believe or what I learned from church is that he was going to send the Holy Spirit down onto them. So I just want to know from you that what do you people believe it is? The brothers asked the question that when Jesus Christ peace be upon him says that I will send you a comforter when he goes he's talking about the Holy Spirit. That's what the church says. What is my view? Brother I gave the reply to this in my talk. It's mentioned in the gospel of John chapter number 14 verse number 16. Jesus Christ peace be upon him says that I will pray to my father to send you a comforter who will abide with you forever. Gospel of John chapter number 15:26 says but when the comforter comes who I will send from my father he will testify me. Gospel of John chapter number 16 verse number 7 says nevertheless I tell you the truth. It is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter shall not come. The criteria for the comforter to come is that Jesus Christ peace be upon him should go. Only after he goes will he send the comforter. If you say the comforter was the Holy Spirit, we already know from the Bible that the Holy Spirit was there before Jesus Christ peace be upon him came onto this earth before he was born. The Holy Spirit was there in the womb of Elizabeth. The Holy Spirit was also there when Jesus Christ peace be upon him was being baptized. So this prophecy cannot refer to the Holy Spirit. It refers to no one but the last and final messenger, Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him."
