  "title": "English Book about Rights and Obligations (Fiqh) of Marriage | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh my question is do you know of any book preferably with an English translation that's concise but covers all the bases about the rites of marriage, the vows, what can be seen in during the luck and also I've heard like there's also I believe it's the Hanbali school which has clauses to the vows, do you know of a like a comprehensive book that covers all the basic rites? Unfortunately, Wa Jazak Abdul Rahman, unfortunately Akhi I don't read English at all, I do not read articles in English zero, all what I read is in Arabic so my English comes from listening not from reading so I don't know what's available in the market. However, if you go to extended books of fiqh probably like Al-Sharh Al-Mumti' of Sheikh Ibn Al-Uthaymeen, you'll find such information extended and elaborated upon and hopefully this weekend on Friday and Saturday, this coming weekend, I'll be honoured to join Sheikh Salim Al-Amri in Kuwait to do a workshop on the rites and obligations of the husband, of the wife, of the parents, of the children, so maybe inshallah within a week or two this would be available on my YouTube channel and then it might be beneficial for you to go through it. Allah Azzawajal knows best."
