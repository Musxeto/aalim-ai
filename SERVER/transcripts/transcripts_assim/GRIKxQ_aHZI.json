  "transcript": "Omar from Germany my question is about the Hadith where the sahab never bent or move until the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam raised or placed his head so they fell in Pro pration after the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so we see many uh Brothers in the MOs who leave the pillar before the IM or move while the Imam is moving or even reach the next pillar before the Imam so is the prayer uh valid of this people now the Hadith you've mentioned is authentic the companions say that we would not Bend our backs until the prophet's forehead touch the ground this is when we fall to prostration nowadays people the moment the Imam goes a little bit forward they jump to prostrate why to show people that we're so keen on worshiping Allah and this is one of the ways of Shan's infiltrating your head people see others when the Imam sits after rising from sujud people are still in the sujud position we are halfway in T and the guy is still in in in suud what are you doing after sometime you just move him say maybe you're asleep or something and after Salat said no I wasn't asleep I was making Dua what you're doing Isam you have to follow the IM the prophet ordered you this when he said if he were to make you then make so you must not delay so much and at the same time you must not rush ahead of your IM intentionally so if the Imam goes for sujud says Allah and he goes to sujud and you're already in sujud before of him intentionally your prayer is invalid you're sinful and you are invalidating your prayer why because the prophet said was made to be followed not to be raised so if you delay too much you are sinful and if you delay to the extent that he moves to the following pillar while you're still in that previous pillar then your prayer this pillar is this raak is invalid number two when he moves you move afterwards that's a Sunnah number three when he moves he moves identically to him this is Mak as in the case with those people who out of ignorance the moment the IM says you say them giving Salam with the Imam so if the Imam doesn't say the second Salam they're just going to be stuck there okay what are we waiting for this is not right you should give your Salam after the Imam finishes Salam onto the left then you start the fourth category is those who race and are ahead of the Imam doing it intentionally invalidates their prayer"
