  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Can I wipe on a sock that has a hole of like a penny size and how high does it have to be above the pointed ankle part? Jazakum Allah Khair Wa Jazakum In order to wipe over the socks when making ablution or wudu, the conditions are number one that you put these socks on while you are in the state of minor ritual impurity which means that you've made wudu and you still did not break your wudu regardless whether you put them on immediately or after five hours as long as you are in the state of wudu that allows you to pray you can put them on. Condition number two that you keep on wiping on them for 24 hours for a resident or 72 hours for a traveler. Condition number three that the socks cover the area that is usually washed so it must cover your whole foot including the ankles so if a little part of the ankle is showing the wiping is not valid. Now if I have a small hole in my sock would that jeopardize the validity of my wiping? It's an issue of dispute. The most authentic opinion is that it would not jeopardize your wiping because what you're wearing on your foot is still considered to be a sock and the companions may Allah be pleased with them did not have the luxury of having intact socks or all the time because they used to travel on foot for miles and hundreds of miles which means that definitely they it had some worn out socks that had a hole here or there and this is the opinion of Shaykh al-Islam bin Taymiyya and other great scholars that a such a hole does not invalidate your wiping and Allah knows best."
