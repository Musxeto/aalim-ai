  "transcript": "Hamza from Sweden uh so basically there is online website similar to eBay but in Sweden the thing is that when you're buying stuff online what happens that if you buy a something there maybe worth let's say $600 equivalent then when you buy it normally if someone was example not to send the item the website has no like liability that let's say you get scammed but if pay them for example maybe $10 or something out of that then if he doesn't arrive or something then you get the money back that was like besides the $10 because like I'm thinking that if I were to buy about this I'm thinking that because it's insurance basically but like otherwise and you can't basically buy stuff from this website it's like otherwise cuz i' I've happened myself that I've been like scammed because I didn't buy yeah this is Hamza this is known as buyers protection fee it is exactly like what PayPal has as well they take like 10% maybe or or or a little bit less whenever you buy something extra now the seller who is selling it if they take it against his will but he agrees simply because he wants to sell it is considered to be his commission to them however the buyer himself when he opt for this that is equivalent to Insurance because as you've said you're buying a $600 worth of merchandise and you can't guarantee whether the sale or the deal would go on successfully or it's a scam and you will lose your money so you pay them a percentage so that they guarantee your uh uh money uh some people would look at it as a commission where this third party guarantees that they will block your uh money until you receive the merchandise and agree that it is as requested and then they release the funds to the seller and they keep and retain their commission for this job and basically this is halal but if it is a form of insurance where it is not needed in this case it becomes Haram so how do we understand whether is it insurance or a commission we have to look into the details if the third party for example a letter of credit or a bank doing this job when you're transferring money to South Korea to buy um bags from them and you they manufacture it for it for you you send them the money the bank holds the money the manufacturer sends you the goods once you receive it the bank representative and yourself check that it is safe and as per the specifications the bank releases the the funds this is halal because what you're paying or what the bank is actually taking from the transaction fee as his fee and commission is legitimate it's not an insurance but we have to look into this website that is providing you with the same concept if it is the same concept that the bank is doing this is Hal but if it is not and then is a possibility of fraud because some uh uh places would not look or investigate the moment the buyer says I did not receive the products or it isn't as I requested they block the money and they refund it to the buyer and a huge loss would be occurring on the seller this is Haram and not permissible and it's not the same concept and Allah Knows Best"
