  "title": "Gaming as a profession: Is having a career in video games permissible in Islam? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "r says i wanted to know if gaming can be considered as a career because nowadays all the kids are exposed to games and successful games which influence the kids to enter in such industry and does islam forbid such things or not first of all games vary some of them are halal to entertain yourself by playing and some may be haram due to the content which goes against islam gods zombies crosses bringing the dead to life worshiping other than allah fortune telling fortune telling um sorcery etc so it varies however video games are looked upon game by game if it doesn't distract you from your obligations such as your prayers on time in the masjid such as your studies such as obeying your parents if the content is halal there is no music there is no free mixing there is no nudity there is no uh exaggerated violence there is nothing wrong religiously dealing with akida or your religion as a muslim and if it is not an obsession meaning yes it doesn't distract you from your obligations but it takes three four hours a day if this is not the case then this is permissible to entertain yourself by playing it however to go to the second level and make it as a career requires a lot of dedication of your time of your mental uh um ability your focus your concentration to the extent that it becomes an obsession you cannot reach this level of having it as a career without you thinking about it during prayer without you thinking about it all day long and what to do and how to strategize how to monetize and get money out of it maybe doing youtube videos showing people how to reach the following stage how to hack some tricks and be able to win this is not part of islam and it shouldn't be what a muslim does simply because the prophet al-islam used to make in his dua and he used to ask allah by saying and i seek refuge in you allah from knowledge that is not beneficial and this is knowledge that is not beneficial it's not going to benefit the muslim ummah it's not going to benefit other individuals it may benefit you for the money but again it would probably mislead and misguide other muslims elsewhere along that line we know that the prophet said allah that no one would be removed from his spot on the day of judgment before being questioned before being asked and among the things that he's asked about is his youth how did he spend it so this is part of the things that you will have to answer on the day of judgment and believe me you don't want to have this as a career and to answer about it in your grave or on that or on the day of judgment because it's not something that is beneficial and allah knows best finally suh"
