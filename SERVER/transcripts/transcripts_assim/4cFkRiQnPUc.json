  "title": "Is doing good deeds for worldly gain - RIYA? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Tehreem from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi I had a question, so I know that if we show off acts of worship it can be real but is this for like all good deeds that we do? For example, my parents asked me to do something and I do it but then I want them to sort of appreciate me or let's say I'm being really nice to someone and I want but like in reality I need something back from them, so am I sinful for this? So Riyah is to show off and the sinful showing off is in any form of worship, so whether it is prayer, fasting, giving zakat or sadaqah, teaching someone a beneficial knowledge, Qur'an or Sunnah etc and you show off, this is Riyah and it can reduce your reward and it can cancel your reward. If you show off in normal things of dunya such as cleaning the living room, why are you doing this? I'm showing off that I'm a good person and I do my chores and at the same time after finishing I want to go to mom and ask her for permission to go and visit a friend, when she sees this she might agree, so this is not a form of worship that you're expecting ajr and reward from Allah Azza wa Jal, so there's nothing wrong in doing so. What is wrong if you do such Riyah or showing off in matters related to religion and Allah knows best."
