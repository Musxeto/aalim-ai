  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] salamé allahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD he what a suti I mean living in a  father and he was happy he urged me dear brothers sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number eight from our main anivia this hadith was narrated by Abdullah Omar may Allah be pleased with him and with his father that the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam once said I've been ordered to fight against the people until they testify that there is no one worthy of being worshipped except Allah the Almighty and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah and until they establish the salaat and pay the zakat and if they do that then they will have gained protection from me for their lives and property unless they commit acts that are punishable in Islam and their reckoning will be with Allah and this hadith was reported by Al Bukhari and Muslim the hadith states that the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam was commanded to fight now once people hear this they will immediately start to raise question marks and point fingers and jump to the gun Islam is a religion of violence Islam was spread by the sword they can say whenever they want all the time however this would not change the reality that Islam is a balanced religion it's a religion of peace and it's a religion of justice and it's not a man-made religion this is a religion from Allah Almighty who created the heavens and the earth and if you analyze and look in a holistic way you will understand not only that but you will appreciate the wisdom behind these hadith Islam is a baños religion the Prophet said I was ordered sallallahu sanim to fight the people until they testify now fighting is not something that is violent and unfair it is violent in the sense that one party has to subdue the other this is logical that is why people fight yet fighting is not killing boxers are fighters and they do not kill one another they fight and fighting is not only for the disbelievers or for the non-muslims it can also be for the Muslims let's go back to square one I've been ordered to fight the people who ordered the Prophet arrest them to do so it is Allah no one orders the Prophet is awesome except Allah Almighty so it is the command of Allah and if you go to the noble quran you will find the command of allah to fight why do the muslims fight is it to gain more area is it to have authority is it to gain more wealth and money no the fight of the Muslims is only to implement the law of Allah Almighty that frees the people from worshipping human beings into worshipping Allah the Almighty and this is the cause and the reason the Prophet says I've been ordered to fight the people until they testified that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah so these are the three things that he was ordered to do so Allah Allah he was ordered to fight until the people believe in Allah and His Messenger pray and give zakat that is it ok then what is this what kind of fighting is this in Islam jihad the most famous word that non-arabs know and non-muslims no thinking that it is associated with terrorism jihad is a noble cause and this is not the right time to go in detail though I would love to but jihad is to fight the disbelievers jihad is to fight one's own whims and desires jihad is to fight the hypocrites by exposing them jihad is to fight and oppress the devils and the Satan's around us so it has many forms and means of fighting in Islam jihad is divided into two types defensive and offensive the defensive side of it no one argues about its legitimacy if someone invades your country if someone attacks you if someone attacks a group of Muslims it is a fault for them to defend themselves and to fight back providing that this would not lead to their total annihilation this is defensive jihad and this is understandable and recognizable no one tells an oppressed nation to sit back and relax and watch the invaders coming in taking their wealth and their territories and enslave them so this is their god-given right offensive jihad is not applicable nowadays not because it goes against international laws but because the Muslim communities the Muslim rulers the Muslim countries are not abiding by Islam so how can they be expected to spread Islam but in idle situations when we have a sovereign strong Muslim practicing country the ruler is obliged to go and wage offensive jihad offensive Wars not to kill people but rather to spread the word of Islam and this is what the Prophet used to do erase a lot was Sarah he used to send his troops and he used to tell them give them the choice of three one embrace Islam if you accept Islam you're one of us we leave you alone keep the land keep everything we're gone if they refuse then tell them you have to pay Taxation known as jizya it's a minimal amount of money by this money you get to stay in your country enjoy your lives not only that if attacked by any other nation or powers you don't have to fight it is our responsibility to defend you we will die defending your country and if they refuse to accept Islam and to pay the taxation or the jizya then we have to fight them until they submit this is the rule of Islam and whether you like it or not this is what's being applied nowadays even non-muslim countries are doing the same a hundred years ago they invaded almost all of the Arabian and the Muslim world look at what Britain Portugal Spain Holland Germany Italy look and France definitely look what they had done to Morocco Algiers Libya Egypt Sudan the African continent to India to Pakistan Bangladesh to Indonesia and the list goes on and on they've invaded these countries and these people the invaders were not Muslims but it is built in them to conquer to invade and to rob the nations from their wealth and to take anything that they can take away they've enslaved the Arabs the Muslims for so many decades and now they claim that Islam is a barbaric religion it is not Islam does not call for or the power of people it does not call to enslave people it does not call to gain more and more territories on the contrary so many incidents in history prove that the Muslim armies were told to retreat and to surrender what they have conquered because they betrayed a treaty or they did not say the truth and this caused the invaded nation to accept Islam when they saw this and they said this cannot be in normal laws this has to be a divine law so the Prophet tells us a lot Stan I've been ordered to fight with the people not to kill them and we will elaborate a little bit further after the break so stay tuned images images and depictions of our Messenger Muhammad sallallahu aleyhi wa seldom have spread around the globe endless residence being upon being his life is being examined in the glare of the global media spotlight it is the duty of every Aliyev dreams to present to the world the truth of his life and the excellence of his character we have not sent you O Muhammad to do this you have to know your prophet it's something that you simply can't afford to be ignorant of study the exemplary personality of our Prophet peace be upon him which attracts people of all faiths and nationalities in know your Prophet peace be upon him every Tuesday at 8 p.m. and repeat telegraphist at 8:30 a.m. UK on peace TV we are not addicted addiction implies a short-term fix one doesn't need to get into the zone to talk about this long you do dower because it is a natural result of your commitment to the one if you don't [Music] effective combination in the propagation of true Islam is found in Bauer immobile join me a real Islam as we go through our yoga only on piece TV one of the tips to make the task of Dhamma result-oriented in Dhamma illallah next on peace TV Salaam alaikum and welcome back so the Prophet tells us Holly salat WA Salam that Allah commanded him to fight the people until they accept Islam and this as illustrated before the break is not a choice that you have to make it or you die there's no compulsion in religion we all know that and there is no compulsion you have a choice of three things either you accept Islam or you pay the taxation or you face the Muslim army and as stated before this type of offensive jihad does not exist nowadays it will come back with the grace of allah azzawajal when the muslims go back to their religion and this is why everyone tries their level best not to have the muslims go back to their religion not knowing that when the muslims abide by the quran and the sunnah peace and security would be spread all over the world as it was at the time of the Companions of the Prophet Allah so Salam within a hundred year of the beginning of the message of Islam 3/4 of the world where muskan and the whole earth did not see such peace justice fairness and prosperity throughout the whole world fighting is not only with the disbelievers and this shows you the fairness and justice of Islam fighting is also with the Muslims Allah mentions in certain huge rot that when two factions of the Muslims fight against each other we have to try to reconcile between them and if one of these factions is the oppressor and it transgresses over the other it is our duty to fight this oppressing force there Muslims it is mandatory upon us to fight them because Allah does not allow oppression and we have to bring matters back to justice and fairness so fighting is not only with the disbelievers fighting is to establish the law of Allah not to establish the law of individuals not to worship individuals it is to free the people from being enslaved to their systems or to man-made laws again Islam is not an oppressing religion each and every individual is entitled for a fair trial you cannot convict people without trying them Islam does not permit you to do this and this is why the prophet alayhi salat wa salam says in the hadith and if they do so then they will have gained protection from me for their lives and property if they accept islam they've got protection from all the Muslims no one can do anything to them and their lives and property are in safe hands unless they commit acts that are punishable in Islam and even if a person commits an act that is punishable in Islam would not be convicted unless tried when it comes to the law of Allah Almighty that prohibits the killing of children of women of the elderly of people of religion monks and priests Islam prohibits all of this nobody highlights this they only highlight what they like and they only tried to deflect and repel people from looking into what Islam is really about Islam is the religion of peace Islam is a religion of balance and it is a religion of justice and fairness so the Prophet says Alastor am I will fight the people until they believe that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah Almighty and that Muhammad is His Messenger and these go side by side if you believe in the existence of Allah and it is oneness but you refuse to believe in the message of the Prophet a list of some you're not a Muslim and you have to be or you have to submit your will to the Almighty by believing in the message of the Prophet as I'm not only that you have to establish prayer and you have to give the arms or zakat what is the prayers to be established what are they there are the five daily prayers originally they were mandated as fifty and this is the only thing that was mandated in the seventh heaven directly without the message of gibreel the archangel peace be upon him and this highlights the importance of prayer everything else was revealed to the Prophet al-islam through Jabril the messenger of allah except prayer the Prophet Arif Salaam took the instruction directly from allah subhanaw taala without any midi years and it was fifty at the very beginning and when he met Moses peace be upon him on the sixth heaven he told him go back and ask Allah to reduce it because I know the sons of Israel and their stubborn and your people are not so far from that they will not be able to pray fifty prayers a day so the prophetess I'm kept on going back and forth until it finally settled to be five prayers from fifty to five prayers so the Prophet eraser Sam tells us that he was commanded to fight people until they testified the testimony and they pray they established the five daily prayers and who will gain from these prayers Tom Dick or Harry who will get a Lowell gain from it no the prayer is for yourself for your self purification to get closer to allah azzawajal it helps you do what Allah commands and it helps you to stay away from haram and that is why those who pray five times a day you will not find them lying or cheating or consuming intoxicants or fornicating or dealing in Reba why because the prayer disciplined them and this is something between you and Allah however it is the most important form of worship in Islam to the extent that if a person does not pray he is not a Muslim even if he says Lila Hill Allah even if he says it a hundred times he is not considered to be in Islam as a Muslim because the Prophet told the Saudis or some that between man and Co for that is disbelief or shirk that is associating others o Allah between man and these two things is abandoning prayer and then the Prophet says I am and they should give zakat and what is the cat as mentioned before the cat is one of the pillars of Islam it's the third pillar of Islam whenever you find prayer is mentioned in the Quran most likely you will find it also associated with giving zakat because the cat is a financial form of worship with it prosperity is spread among the Muslims it's a minimal amount taken from the rich given to the poor and it's literally given to the poor in the sense that if you have savings cash that exceeds the price of five ninety five grams of silver and this remains with you whole lunar year after one year you have to give 2.5% so if you have $100 this is 2.5 if you have a hundred thousand dollars this is $2,500 to be given to the poor and this was mentioned in verse 60 chapter 9 the eight categories of receiving zakat who should we give zakat to it was mentioned in the Quran also the Prophet says any salat wa salam if they do so then they will have gain protection from me for their lives and property unless they commit acts that are punishable in Islam and the reckoning will be with Allah which means that the profit areas are some only judges what he sees as for the people's intentions this is for Allah and they will be accountable for what they believe and that is why the hypocrites used to come to the Prophet area salata sooner and they used to say we bear witness that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that you are the messenger and servant of Allah and they used to come and pray in the masjid and allah tells us in the quran and allah testifies that they are liars they are hypocrites they are in the bottom level of hell why didn't the Prophet kill them our assassin because he was only commanded to judge people by their appearance by their actions not by their intentions and this cascades down to us I don't have the right to come and say this man he has ill intent he's deviant because he has in his heart this and this and this this is not my right because I only judge what appears to me and that is why when Osama bin is aid may Allah be pleased with him and with his father went into expedition with the army of the Muslims in came back victorious he was telling the Prophet Allah so sir we did this and when the Prophet was very happy because they were victorious and then when Osama was standing the Prophet Isis a time there was a man killing the Muslims a brave warrior so I had a duel with him and we exchanged blows and then he was cornered and he felt that I will defeat him and kill him and just I was getting there he said la ilaha illaallah so I knew that he said this only to protect himself so I stabbed him and killed him the Prophet when he heard this his face changed and he said you killed him after he said la ilaha illallah now imagine the scenario the man is in war in battle in a duel his fighting people are dying in this disbeliever who's an enemy when he felt that he was going to be killed he said la ilaha illallah what would you have done you and I probably would have done the same yet the Prophet corrected it and said you killed him when he said I had a lot so some said profitable I was defending himself it wasn't the embracing Islam is he's an enemy he said what will you do on the day of judgement when la ilaha illa llah comes the one that he stated did use open his chest and see that he was lying or not this is something only Allah knows so he kept on repeating it and repeating it and he was reprimanding Osama for what he had done therefore the reckoning is only to Allah we judge people by their actions and deeds by what we see not by what is in their heart and from this hadith we learned that on the day of reckoning the people will see good or evil that what they had done even if it was the weight of an ant of good they will see it and if it's the weight of an ant of evil they will see it this is all the time we have until we meet you next time via Manila well Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music]"
