  "title": "Reciting 'durood' after Friday salah and other innovations!",
  "transcript": "faran from the UAE I have a question I'm basically from India and wanted to understand that in certain masss uh especially after the Friday Salah they read the Salam toool wasallam on the microphone in a loud voice what is the ruling for this and what is the correct practice okay any more questions uh that's all uh at the moment okay I you can if you could kindly give any reference to the Quran or the uh that will help me to to to spread the the message okay brother fan from the Emirates had uh a question which is a basic question and he's asking for the reference from the Quran from the Sunnah so that he can argue with people I'll give you a very easy reference brother faran Muslim mother may Allah be pleased with her said the prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam said whoever innovates anything in our religion that is not part of it it is rejected so anyone not only offering theud Sharif as you call it in your country not only offering the salutation to the prophet Alam through the microphone any act you see me or any other person doing you should ask is this part of Islam if yes then can you provide me with the evidence if I don't have any evidence then it is innovated in the sense that did the prophet Alam ever offered the salutation upon himself loudly or in congregation after F prayer or after Friday prayer there would be no muslim to claim this even those who are doing it if you ask them is there any book Hadith bukari Muslim Abu Etc that is authentic referring to us that the prophet had ever done this that the companions had ever done this that the had ever done this that the had ever done this and the answer would be no so how do I dare and come and say yes but this is good we we should do it do you know more than the prophet his companions yes or no said no I don't know more than them in this case if they didn't do it is it part of the religion where Allah said the almighty in verse three uh chapter 5 today I have completed your religion is it or was it part of the religion at the time of the prophet he said no they didn't do it and in this case we tell this person that if the prophet didn't do it and it's not part of the religion in this case it is a new religion so those who give the aan for example in Turkey in Syria in some of the North African countries you find them that 15 minutes before thean of f they recite aat by the microphones the salutation on the prophet in a melodic way as if they're chanting nid and then the aan comes and after the aan they say the Dua also Lou what are you doing says this is good we're teaching people this is Allah did the prophet do it or not this is the 1 million euro question beside now if you open the door for Innovation some says yes he is our Master he is our but can anyone in his sound mind insist on using the word say in everything even inah so he says and say can you say this inah or even better can you say this in thean or would this nullify your aan Innovation is endless dean of Islam is limited so you cannot worship Allah by adding or Subs substracting anything you don't like this is the religion of Allah so those who innovate those who insist on giving a lecture before jum and then the aan comes and then the the Imam who was lecturing for an hour in his native language comes and gives two speeches in Arabic he doesn't know what it means the audience do not know what it means and then he makes the Salah in countries that they may pray and after the prayer is over they all pray four ra what are you praying they say we're praying then what were you praying before said no this J is not valid because the IM the original ruler is not here and he's the only one who can pray what nonsense is this so you find Innovations in every every place and every time because people are away from the Sunnah who's prospering who's benefiting from this these are the rulers these are the imams the these are the leaders of innovation of deviancy who are milking the masses for money by controlling them with these superstitions and nonsense that are not related to Islam this this is why when we tell people come to the Quran come to the Sunnah with the understanding of the Prophet Alam His companion and the and the you will find someone blocking this call and saying no this is not permissible you cannot understand Islam on your own who should I understand it through he said only through me you're not allowed to learn Islam or to worship Allah I was in Syria decades ago and I went to a Masjid and the mid's Imam was a well-known Sheikh at the time and he's the leader of a of the sufis and he said in public lecture that you cannot worship Allah except through the prophet Alat wasam and you can not reach the prophet Alam except through me so when you pray when you worship Allah you have to always Envision me because I'm the mer that reflects your worship to the prophet Alam and he reflects what is this what kind of a religion is this this is how they make money and this is how they control their masses or if you wish their herds and they manipulate them and play with them as they wish so what they are doing after jum what they are doing before the aan what some of them are doing after the conclusion of the Salat they put their hand over their head feeling that they would fly away or when they hear the aan and they hear the name of the Prophet Alam they kiss their thumbs three times and wipe over the ears and they claim that whoever does this would not become blind or uh would have illness in his eyes all of this is baseless if there's anything authentic as such do you think that we would not call people to it we are calling people to abide by the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat in the very smallest things let alone the mega things so even when it comes to the beard or the way you eat or the way you give Salam or the way you sit in uh uh uh uh prayer or the way you fold your hands or raise your every single detail we invite people to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam wouldn't we also invite them to such things if they were from the Sunnah so all what the people need is to broaden their thinking and Minds not be sheep following their Shepherds who are dragging them to uh uh Innovation to let loose of what they had inherited from their fathers and forefathers of following deviant sects and schools of thought and Sh who do not even know Arabic and their moral conduct is at the very lowest they have to expand their Horizons follow the Quran learn the Quran follow the prophets Sunnah and love it with all their heart and then inshallah they will be guided"
