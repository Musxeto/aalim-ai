  "title": "Images on Newspapers, Products etc prevent Angels from entering our houses? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I'll clip says it is known that angels do not enter the house which has images of living beings what about the images on newspapers book covers other daily used products which are kept in the house it is impossible to keep them covered at as these images are everywhere in the house so do the Angels not enter these houses also I personally don't know the images that the prophet told us about halahala to Sam in an authentic hadith let it cool mother Iike to wait and physical boon wallah so rotten well at him said the Angels do not enter a house which has a portrait a statue or a dog full stop now when I buy diapers for my grandchildren and it has a picture either this picture is a photograph or a drawing if it's a photograph it's less Haram than a drawing because this is the image that Allah has created so my picture on Twitter or on Facebook this is Allah's creation it's like I'm looking in a mirror no one would say he stay away from the mirror because you're creating something other than Allah no but when it's drawn by hand this becomes more Haram because you're imitating the creation of Allah surgeon now when we buy these things it is as you've stated difficult to stay away from them however if you do your level best so when the diapers are erect and you can see the photograph and you put it down to cover it when there's a newspaper or a magazine with a picture but the back cover doesn't have a picture has a maybe perfume or a watch or something you turn it over this is the best you can do to the best of your ability inshallah the angels will continue to enter"
