  "transcript": "the next question is i'm asking about the oil or jelly which they claim that it protect you from satan is this authentic is that what from satan like an oil that people put on their body to protect them from satan is this authentic no no there's nothing like that this is all baseless and nothing protects you from satan except seeking refuge in allah azzawajal by saying applying oil setting yourself on fire throwing yourself from a high riser dipping yourself in mud all of these are nonsense there is nothing in islam that has any uh credibility to back up such a claim most likely those who sell the oil are making a lot of money because they're fabricating and they're playing on the sentimental sentiments of muslims by saying oh this is frog oil it's good for you it protects you from shaytan and this is all nonsense"
