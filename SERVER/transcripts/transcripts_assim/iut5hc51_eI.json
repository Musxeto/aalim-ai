  "transcript": "foreign one of the beautiful things in islam is that the feeling of being there for others and one of the most times one of us feels vulnerable is when he falls sick that is why it's an essential concept in islam to visit the sikh so the following chapter when visiting the sikh what to say hadith 147 the prophet whenever he used to visit someone who was ill he would say allah never mind anime this is a dua may allah does not make this bad for you and he says never mind may it that is the sickness be a purification if allah wills so this is a dua and it's part of the etiquette of visiting sick people to uplift their morales to be positive to remind them of the reward to remind them of their soon-to-be recovery why because this is what people visiting the sick should be doing unlike what people may go and say oh a relative of mine died with the same illness last year or whoa man you look very bad how are you feeling you look horrible all of this is not positive and it's not part of islam and people should avoid doing this also part of the dua hadith number 148 the prophet alaihis salatu assalam used to ask allah azzawajal and he used to say i ask allah the supreme lord of the magnificent throne to cure you this that is dua is to be said seven times as allah to say it seven times in the presence of the person who's sick what will happen the prophet told us that whoever says this and it was not predestined for that sick person to die allah will cure him so say it with conviction say it with belief seven times should we say it so that the patient would hear it the answer is yes this throws confidence in his heart that there are people who who are making dua for him and who are actually asking allah for his uh help the following chapter the excellence of visiting the sick there is great deal of reward at the sight of allah azzawajal when you visit the sikh so what is it foreign allah if a man visits his muslim brother it is as if he walks weeping the fruits of paradise until he sits imagine i leave my home and i go to my sick muslim brother to visit him the distance i'm traveling from my home to his home or to the hospital as if i'm reaping the fruits of paradise because i am doing a great deal of good deeds and this continues until i sit and when he sits he's showered in mercy and if this was in the morning then 70 000 angels will send their prayers upon him until the evening so they will make dua for you and if this was in the evening then 70 000 angels would send their prayers upon him until the morning for what for half an hour visit to your sick muslim brother who you just visit him for the sake of allah and to make dua for him and to make him feel good about the suffering he's undergoing look at the great rewards and hasanat and good deeds that allah gives to you for such a trivial job that we may think of skipping and not doing the following chapter is the supplication of the sick who has renounced all hope of life first of all muslims should not be despair but this dua is suitable for someone who feels that his death is inevitable and near so we all get sick but some time in the day we feel so sick that most likely it's going to be our last hour so what to say well this is what the prophet used to well he did not used to he said it once when he felt that it is his dying hour he said o allah forgive me have mercy upon me and unite me with the highest companions who are the highest companions these are as in surah 4 chapter surah nisa verse 69 whoever obeys allah and the messenger there will be with the prophets the sudden the martyrs and the righteous so these are the highest companions so when one feels his death is near he asks allah azzawajal for forgiveness he asks allah azza for mercy and he asks allah to admit him to paradise with these righteous predecessors of ours so that we would have eternal happiness may allah grant me and you such a status in paradise allah foreign [Music] foreign"
