  "title": "Jealous of the kafirs due to their success & feel restless and anxious, what to do? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is from the past couple of days i've been going through a difficult time in my life where i'm not able to focus and my daily life is being affected like yesterday i was in my room in a dark room i was not speaking to anybody in the night i could not sleep i was moving my body was moving because of restlessness and i was roaming around the room i don't know why and um it's it's it feels like as if i know this life is eventually gonna end but it feels like it's gonna last forever and when i look at the kuffar i sometimes feel jealous but i know that this is only for them in this dunya but i still can't help it i don't know what to do okay first of all there are things in life that need conviction and not only knowledge so we all know that we are eventually going to die no one has any doubt at all even the disbelievers even the richest men on earth you go to them and they say yeah death is inevitable everybody is going to die nobody has ever lived forever okay what are you going to do i said nothing i'm going to continue to be a tyrant to abuse those who work for me to deal in riba i'm going to continue to oppress people and buy their businesses and make them broke i'm gonna ruin people's lives i don't care don't you believe that you're gonna die i said yeah so even go to the muslims you believe in life and after death said yes you believe you're gonna die definitely you believe in heaven and hell he said most certainly i'm a muslim then why are you not praying on time why do you fornicate why do you drink why do alcohol that is intoxicants why do you smoke pot why do you abuse your wife why do you disobey your husband why do you not respect your parents why do you steal money why do you so many things and they acknowledge you say yeah yeah we know it's haram and we know it's bad but don't you believe that you're going to be tormented in your grave to say i believe in the torment of the grave but i'm not one of those but you're doing the whole nine yards i said yeah but i believe in allah's mercy and what about allah's punishment no no this is for the disbelievers we are not going to be tormented so it's not knowledge that people lack it's conviction that drives them and pushes them to do the right thing now you have the knowledge but you don't have the conviction and the reason might be attributed to so many factors it can be attributed to lack of trust dependence and reliance on allah known as tawakkul if you had tawakkula on allah dependence on allah you know that he would take care of you so you would not have these anxiety fits and attacks you wouldn't be restless whenever shaytan hits your head you say i have allah azzawajal with me he's my protector it can be attributed to your lack of belief weakness of belief in the divine decree which is one of the six pillars of iman if you believe that allah has written down everything that's going to happen till the day of judgment and that was 50 000 years before creating the whole universe so it's done whatever we're going to do it's been written whatever is going to happen it's written if someone dies among our loved ones it was written 50 000 years ago am i saddened definitely yes but would i do something that would be considered to be complaining objecting or any sort of not being content at all because i believe that this is something that allah has predestined so there are so many factors that may attribute to how you feel how to cure this and how to get rid of it by reading the quran i read the quran sheikh you're not reading it with your heart you're just reciting it with your tongue i want you to read it with your heart allah says in the quran to his messenger we reveal to you from the quran what makes your heart steadfast so if it makes the prophet's heart steadfast when it's restless and we know the calamities that the prophet had faced then by default if we believe and we read the quran our heart would be content and calm we will find the tranquility and the peace in the quran because it is to our hearts like honey to our bodies the best antibiotic the best medication to your whole body is honey cure is in it as mentioned in the quran to most illnesses and diseases so whatever is happening to you sarah you have to acknowledge a universal fact and i always reiterate and say it over and over again every single individual on earth is being tested some are tested with wealth some are tested with health others are tested with poverty and with illness so each one of us has his own calamity don't ever be deceived by how things look don't go and look at the richest man on the on earth oh he builds spaceships oh he travels to space he has so much money he does this he does that wallahi he is the most or one of the most miserable people on earth don't be deceived by his smile by his constant dosages of tranquilizers whether physical or sentimental and mental they're just living in oblivious because they know they're going to die and they know what awaits them after death but this world this wealth is so lucrative and deceptive that they're unable to make a decisive decision to make an end of it and work to whatever is after death yeah they may put in their well put me in nitrogen liquid or put me in the freezers or maybe somebody would discover in in 200 years how to give life after death which is illogical they may do this but they are the most miserable people on earth everyone is being tested the prophets and messengers were tested peace be upon them the righteous and the companions were were tested so you're not alone you're being tested now what the results well what the results of your test may be this what will with the grace of allah define you and this would would most likely lead you to paradise if you're among the righteous in the patient or elsewhere may allah protect us all if you're not and allah knows best"
