  "title": "If Allah decrees if a child will be righteous or wicked, doesn't it contradict concept of Free Will?",
  "transcript": "okay now I have two questions is that uh permitted on TV no here is free country perfect so first one I think it's in uh the first first chapter of the Quran and it speaks of during the time of creation when the wom is been created that Allah decrees If the child will be Wicked or rightous which seems to contradict the concept of f that's the first question okay first I don't I'm not good in remembering the second question after you say this so let me answer your first question nothing contradicts the concept of free will but do we have free will I believe we do can you stop your heart no can you stop breathing I can try and will you succeed no problem will you stop the ability not to fall asleep when you're tired and say okay I'm going to stay awake for 5 days no so the concept of Free Will is subjective there are things that we have free will to choose and there are things we have no choice when I was born nobody came to me and say Hey listen you want to be white or black I'm neither I'm yellow I'm from Denia yeah originally nobody came to me and said would you like to be tall short Rich poor from this country from this ethnicity I had no free will so who does yeah but when we come to choosing what to do you have the free will yet this Free Will of yours is not entirely free because you cannot choose until Allah chooses for you so Oh you mean that if a cafir is a cafir this is because Allah chose for him to be a cafir yeah she if I'm a Muslim is it because Allah chose for me I'm a Muslim said yes then what's the point I said wait wait wait do you know what Allah chose for you to be a Muslim or a cafir no until I die there are so many people who are born Muslim and they're 60 years of age Muslims and the last day in their lives they flip and they become a cafir and they die a cafir and there are so many cafir you know stories in the hundreds who were 60 years cfers and the last day they Ser the shahada and they prayed and they died and they went to Paradise you don't know what Allah has written for you and this is why we drive there is a possibility that we may have an accident I'm not going to drive no it's not going to help you because if Allah wills it you'll have an accident while walking I'm not going to walk it doesn't going to help you because even when you're sitting like the brother said don't do this in my fault so what should I do you have trust in Allah you believe that Allah wills and writes and creates with his knowledge whatever he Wills I don't know it I do my best and whatever Allah Wills will happen and I will be held accountable to but I believe Allah is knowledgeable Allah is fair Allah owns everything yes"
