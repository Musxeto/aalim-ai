  "title": "They skipped obligatory parts (ayah) in Friday Khutbah, valid or should I pray dhur? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Adam from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaikumussalam Basically, in Jumu'ah, the person doing the Jumu'ah khutbah, he did some of it in Arabic and some of it in English at school. There was not a full ayah of the Qur'an in Arabic and was the Jumu'ah valid. I was told by one of the teachers there that as long as you just mention it in English, that still counts. It's not an Islamic school. Do I have to pray like four rak'ahs of Zuhr? First of all, there isn't anything specific in regards of Khutbah al-Jumu'ah other than it should be two, separated by sitting in between, and the prayer which is two rak'ahs, led by the Imam. Schools of thought, and many scholars say, different conditions in regards to the number of attendees. Some say forty is the minimum, and the most authentic is three is the minimum. Imam and two in the congregation, listening to him. Some say that it has to be included in it, the Shahada. And an ayah, and a hadith. But there is no proof of that in the Qur'an or in the Sunnah. It's Ijtihad from the scholars. Therefore, I believe that it's a Friday speech, the Friday Jumu'ah Khutbah. If the Imam fulfilled it, whether he recited part of an ayah or a full ayah, or he did not recite an ayah at all, then his prayer and the Khutbah is valid. Inshallah, and Allah knows best."
