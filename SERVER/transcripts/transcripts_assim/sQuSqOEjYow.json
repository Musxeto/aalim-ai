  "title": "Being a nurse and touching male pacients",
  "transcript": "I live in the UK and inshallah I want to do a nursing degree after I finished college but during nursing degree it involves working in clinical placements sometimes I have to take care of male patients in this Western society and nursing also involves washing some patients what should I do is it okay if I study it I believe being a nurse is rewarding career because female companions were also nurses well to me I would not advise you to do such a thing I would not advise my daughter to pick up nursing as a career because as you know it involves shifts and it involves staying 8 to 12 hours a day in hospital intermingling with doctors not only patients but with doctors and sitting with them in their restrooms and restrooms not toilets and forgive my patient I mean in how do you call it they have a name for it where they go and drink coffee and take time off so it involves mixing with the opposite sex it's not something that is casual or something that comes here and there no it is something that is structured it is full-time and sometimes she you would have to stay the whole night because this is your shift so I would not recommend you to study nursing though it is rewarding this true but being involved with the opposite sex in this fashion this is unaesthetic if you are able to have it in an Islamic environment with or in a full female college or Hospital then this would be from sir"
