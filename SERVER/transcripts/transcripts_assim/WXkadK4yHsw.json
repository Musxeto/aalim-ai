  "transcript": "[Music] which is better offering nawafil there is voluntary prayers or doing vicar that is remembering Allah such as reciting Quran praising Allah or doing salat on the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and if I committed a major sin do I have to regret once and forget it or do I regret every time it comes to mind please clarify so this question is composed of two parts first part which is best to pray voluntary prayers or to spend your time doing vicar reciting for an offering salutation upon the Prophet Ostrom or making dua scholars say that whatever your heart is inclined to whatever makes your heart closer to Allah this is better this is one side of the answer so if I tend to feel lazy and sleepy whenever I make thicker but when I pray voluntary prayers I can spend hours after hours without any problem in this case alhamdulillah we know the answer secondly each form of worship has its merits values and times so for example if I'm standing in the voluntary or mandatory prayers while standing nothing beats al-fatiha because it's a pillar of salat so even if I skip Fatiha and offer a thousand salutation upon the Prophet upon the Prophet I so sir I say allahumma salli ala muhammadin wa ala muhammad or i say say you do yourself our lammeter billah idol and jalapeno an Arab dog or I say subhanallah wa ham days of Hannah arabe rally a hundred times this doesn't suffice and my prayer is in because fatty hay is a-rockin it's a pillar now when I go to Roku I'm in the bowing position I'm obliged to say subhana rubella the also handling will be handy if I recite al-fatiha my prayer would be invalid and saying subhana wa birra theme is far greater than reciting the fatiha or the Quran the whole Quran actually it is prohibited for us to recite the Quran while in record or in prostration on Institute position the Prophet prohibited that sallallahu alayhi wasallam when it is between a van and yama it is best for me to raise my hands and make duaa because the Prophet said RA his salat WA Salam that making duaa invoking Allah supplicating to Allah is answered between the van and the Akama of the prayer so this is the best thing to do of course praying voluntary prayer part of the 12 relative is also a good thing to do and then making the care making duaa is also a good thing to do but you part of your knowledge of the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah you should know what to prioritize according to the time according to the situation and according to what draws your heart closer to Allah Azza WA JAL and Allah knows best"
