  "transcript": "sabrina says is it permissible to have go fund me pages to raise money for our education and necessary things that we need it seems that what she's asking about i think it's a web page where you put your problem like i'm homeless i'm sleeping in my car and i don't have any money to pay for the gas and i need money so people read this random people they share it on facebook or on twitter accounts and sometimes they pay something that would make a lot of difference in a person's life and sometimes they won't pay anything so what's your ruling on that first of all this is virtual begging asking people for money is begging and the more you ask the more fire stones you'll gather upon yourself in hellfire and the prophet had made it clear that it is not permissible to beg to ask people for money except for three one a person who's totally stone broke and he brings three male witnesses to testify that this guy is totally broke he doesn't have a thing this person can beg for what suffices him not to become a rich man secondly a person who was affect affected by a calamity a disaster like a volcano a flood a fire that swept off and destroyed everything he has so like a person who has business and fire destroyed his shop and warehouse now he's totally broke so what can he do he can beg and charity is halal to such a person thirdly a person who undertakes loans in order to fix between two fighting and disputing tribes or factions or parties so i know that these two families are having a dispute conflict fights they're having wars so i come to meditate mediate to arbitrate and say listen you're right and he's wrong and you're wrong he's righteous or so but to make a long story short i will compensate you with so and so and i will compensate you with so-and-so so i take upon myself financial loans to fix what was broken between them in this case i am entitled to ask people to compensate me this is these are the three cases where the prophet assam says begging is halal other than that it is one of the major sins that people would come on the day of judgement without any piece of meat on their faces because of them begging people gofundme or other means of begging is the same and allah azzawajal knows best"
