  "transcript": "My question was regarding backbiting a Non-Muslim So I read it on IslamQA that \nit is permissible provided that we don't we are not saying bad things about \nhis physical features and he is not a [ ]. We can backbite, it's permissible so am I right? Well this is an issue of dispute, \nsee the verse of the Quran says and it is addressed in the beginning, \"Oh you \nwho you believe\", and it says do not backbite   one another, so this is supposedly only \nfor Muslims backbiting other Muslims. Nevertheless, it is not at all \npart of the Muslim's character   to belittle others even non-muslims or to backbite them, or to slander \nthem, or to say bad things.   Simply because this falls under the \ngeneral guideline where the Prophet ﷺ says The Prophet ﷺ says a believer \nis not a person who slanders,   or curses, or uses profanity or vulgar language. So it is not befitting for a Muslim to sit with \nanother Muslim and talk about a disbeliever. Whether he's a president, a \nminister or - and make fun of them. Definitely, if it's about their physical \ncharacteristics and appearance, this is   how Allah created them but to speak about \nthem freely in chit-chat and gossip as if   there is nothing more to discuss in \nthis world but to make fun of them. This is totally not befitting of a Muslim."
