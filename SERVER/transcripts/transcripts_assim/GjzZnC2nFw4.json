  "transcript": "our man says what's your ruling on keeping the Koran on a shelf while my bed is facing it when I sleep my feet would be towards the Koran while it is not above my feets position rather it's exactly at the same height and also when the Koran is kept in the Masjid on the lower shelves and our feet are pointing towards the Koran what's your ruling on that a lot of the people make a fuss they make a big issue out of this situation you'll find people sitting in the masjid leaning on a pillar for example or on a cupboard that has four aunts and the elders come to him say what are you doing move move move away from here so what am i doing so you're disrespecting the Koran so where is the Koran it's behind you so there's nothing behind mr. cupboard it's the bookshelf and I'm giving my back to it said no no be inside there is the Koran this is disrespectful okay you move somewhere else you get pain in your feet you extend your feet towards the Qibla elders come come on remove your feet remove it what it's not detachable what do me remove my feet so no no you cannot point your feet to the Qibla why not say this is disrespectful to the Qibla subhanAllah and if I turn my back to the Qibla so this is respectful dribbler and if I go sideways my feet would be pointing at someone praying it's respectful to the person praying what should I do amputate this is not logical and it's not found in Islamic teachings yes if someone says to me put your Koran next to your feet you're on the ground your foot is here and the Koran is here this is a bit disrespectful though there is no intent of humiliating or disrespecting the Koran I wouldn't say it's Haram but it's inappropriate but to stay in your room and my room is 4 meters by 4 meters or by 5 meters and at the end of the room there is a shelf with the Koran and my bed is to that direction and my feet are facing the Koran and people say no this is Haram why is it Haram by your logic if I'm sitting on a couch and my brother who is a half of he's sitting on the floor I should go and sit on the floor as well because he's a half of I'm disrespecting the Quran this can never end and this is all baseless and is not related to Islam sometimes we tend to make an issue out of nothing and we base our arguments we fight over them which was never done by the Prophet or some nor his companions you're disrespecting the Quran he the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to place his head in mother aisha slap he used to lie down and he used to recite the Quran would you dare and say that this is respectful this would be blasphemy it will be covered if you call this disrespectful so sometimes we have to rethink things over and we have to use what is known as the Islamic glasses spectacles you put them on you see things from the perspective of Islam you take them off it's worldly things you see it like everyone else this is what differentiates us between Muslims and non-muslims practicing and non-practicing that we look at things from a different perspective everything has to be based on Quran the Sunnah so for example I'm sitting in the Masjid I'm reading the or an I come to an ayah that has prostration of recitation so I fold the Quran I put it on the ground and I prostrate someone next to me holds the Quran up I finish my prostration and I sit down he gives it to me who's like a lot about why she'd known as disrespectful to put the Quran on the ground says who said yeah because your feet are on the ground okay I have no intention to disrespect or humiliate the Quran I love the Quran I recite the Quran every single day what are you talking about you can't be more Roman than the Romans you cannot say that this is hilar or Haram without having the proper evidence from the Quran and the Sunnah this is your own preference if you think that this is inappropriate don't extend your feet in the Masjid this is up to you don't place the whole round on the ground this is up to you but you have no right to tell me what you do and what not to do without proper evidence from the Quran and from the Sunnah you"
