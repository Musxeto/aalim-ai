  "transcript": "okay I will I got your question and I'll answer inshah again brother Muhammad from Nigeria is asking about the cartoons and I think he's referring of the Muslims and he's asking about the cartoons that a French newspaper has published a couple of days ago uh uh ridiculing the prophet Alat and he says what to how to react first of all it is essential to point out few things that a lot of the masses don't know first of all Allah instructs in the Quran that whenever something takes place or an event or something new happens in Islam you have to refer it back to the scholars of Islam new happens in Islam you have to refer it back to the scholars of Islam now the mobs and the thugs that are doing these demonstrations and the burning of the flags and the with the flag I could I could care less of the flag of the non-muslim country let alone to be an enemy of Islam or not but the Looting the burning the killing of innocent Muslims involved in this and the demonstrations that are crippling the Muslim State or the Muslim society and they consider this to be part of the defense of the Prophet Alat wasam I would say that they are wrong and they are sinful in what they're doing now people would jump to the gun and this happens usually when someone says the word of Truth he would be always labeled as he is taking the defense of America and uh uh France and he loves the kuf and he does this and that let it be this was said about the prophet Alat wasam whenever something happens who do you take your information from and how do you reach such a decision this can only be done by going back to the scholars of Islam so you go to the real Scholars of Islam and ask them can we demonstrate can we do this can we do that and they would tell you whether it is permissible or not all the demonstrations you see in Pakistan in uh Indonesia in Libya in Egypt in Yemen in anywhere Scholars were not consulted because they would tell you that this is not Islamic so what to do first of all you do not demonstrate because demonstration only brings evil and we've seen what it resulted in what to do if you go to the scholars for example Alan may Allah preserve him one of the great Scholars of Islam when he was told about what was taking place and and happening in the Arab world uh the UPR Rising they said this is the doing of the ignorant it is the scholars who respond it is the organizations that respond it is the governments that respond and alhamdulillah each and everyone is doing their level best though it is not enough I know but they're doing it but on a high level now whoever did the film and the cartoons what is their objective when you do something you have an intention what is your objective what is your target their target is to show and depict Islam as a religion of violence so they provoked the Muslims to do what they're doing and they succeeded now everyone is saying that this is Islam now some would say yes but there are people who would look into Islam and would be encouraged to embrace Islam well this is a byproduct but it is not attributed to their hooliganism and to their violence it's attributed to the guidance of Allah so as Muslims you should protect the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam and his and his reputation by publishing as many as you can through the social uh networks his s his uh beautiful religion the the the incidents that took place and how he tolerated the non-muslims and and the pagans and the idol worshippers who fought him yet did not dare to say bad things about him because he was a the perfect man to ever walk the earth you should distribute copies of his biography of his religion as for example discover Islam in UK is doing and as different organizations are doing this is the way of doing it not by hooliganism and by uh uh violence m"
