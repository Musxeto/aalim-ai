  "transcript": "so in this session we'll he'll share his insights on how we as Believers can navigate Global uncertainty with faith and resilience and how we can play a positive role in shaping the future of our world so without further Ado let's welcome to the stage and listen to what he has to say about the global uncertainty and our role as Muslims in making sense of the world around us and shaping a better future for ourselves and for the world foreign two points I would like to address before beginning this session I'm not a doctor I don't know why everyone insists on calling me Dr asan I do not have a doctorate I never pursued one and I do not like the title it's just awesome secondly it is not befitting to describe someone as devoted himself to the spreading of little devoted watershed give me afraid I'm here on vacation I come they say come you have Biryani you have good meal you stay in a five-star hotel and you give a lecture or two okay we do not know what's the meaning of devoting yourself to Allah see Syria and let's be serious so don't inflate people more than their actual size they're here to give a lecture give a talk but when you say he they devoted themselves to Allah and I think me wow so these two points I just wanted to address briefly so that we put people in there uh actual size instead of giving them more than what they deserve now the title is scary what is the title Global uncertainty I'm a simple humble person I don't know these big words and politics and Global changes in global warming and and the likes so my talk to you is going to be as simple as you and I because this is best than big giving big words and big uh topics that do not relate to us so a big bun a big loaf of bread no this is the old ad they had in the 70s for Wendy's cheeseburgers three old women tall medium short and they come to the cheeseburger shop they find this big cheeseburger the big the tallest older woman says a big loaf of bread the medium-sized woman says a big big loaf of bread and the shortest one which is the grumpiest and oldest of all lifts up the top of the sandwich and says big loaf of bread but where's the beef it's a big cheeseburger but where's the beef so big words don't mean anything we want something that relates to us we want something that we can Implement in our lives so let us start with the beginning this life we're in what is it it is merely a test Allah azzawajal has created us on Earth to test us didn't Allah say in Surat al-mulk Surah a Surah of 30 Ayah each and every individual of us I hope recites it before going to bed we memorize it by heart every Muslim memorizes it by heart why because the prophet Salah told us that whoever memorized it will not be tormented in the grave Ya Allah 3-0 very simple every single night you and I read it definitely and we Ponder upon Allah's beautiful words what does it say because it's addressed to us Allah is not talking to animals Allah is not talking to fish or Birds Allah is talking to you and me so what is he telling us he's telling us who has created death and life that he may test you which of you is Best In Deed who among you is best in what they do so all what you see in life and death is a test however we all deep down in our subconscious think and believe that testing cannot be except with calamities Allah is testing is is with disasters with illnesses with poverty but this is not true Allah says in the Quran we shall make a trial of you with evil and with good and to us you will return so Allah is testing us not only with poverty but with wealth not only by diseases and illnesses but with health not only by insecurity but by stability and security as well all of these are tests from Allah so don't think that you're saved even Abbas may Allah be pleased with him explains this Ayah he says Allah tests us with hardship and prosperity with health and illness with wealth and poverty with Halal and Haram with obedience and with disobedience with guidance and with misguidance all of these are Allah's tests and Allah says to us is not like our teachers testing we can cheat or we can get a tip or we can buy the questions before the test day and why is Allah testing us first of all we have to know that tests are inevitable every single person on earth is being tested and this is a well Universal fact but these tests vary Allah May tests us to erase the many sins we have and we have a backlog we have plenty of sins Allah may love us and tests us to elevate our levels in Jannah so instead of being in the first floor Allah puts us in the penthouse may Allah make you and I among those who in the penthouse Allah says in the Quran and whatever of Misfortune befalls you it is because of what your hands have earned and he pardons a lot and the prophet said no Misfortune or disease befalls a Muslim no worry or grief or harm or distress not even a thorn that pricks him but Allah will expiate for some of his sins because of that anything that befalls upon you what do you say I'm not hearing or alhamdulillah first of Allah this is true but everything that befolds upon you you say alhamdulillah there is good in it that I may not see so so who does Allah test well calamities and testing is a sign of Allah's love to you and I can hear someone says I don't want to be tested and maybe I don't want Allah to love me just I'd like to be safe no the prophet said when he was asked o messenger of Allah which of the people are most sorely tested so the prophet said Allah said the prophets they are the most sorely tested the prophets of Allah then the next best and the next best a man will be tested in accordance with his level of religious Commitment if his religious commitment is strong he will be tested more severely and if his religious commitment is weak he will be tested in accordance with his religious commitment Calamity will keep falling oh a Calamity will keep befalling a person until he walks on Earth without a single sin on him Allah would eradicate and erase all sins because of these calamities that had struck him and each and every one of us has his own tailor-made calamity and everyone looks at other people's Calamity and think that they're better than him so not a soul on Earth walks without a Calamity or being tested this man lost his job another one divorced his wife a third has a disease a fourth lost his house or lost his car or lost his business therefore the happiest of all people although they're all tested the happiest of all people who has content in his heart for whatever Allah has decreed upon him and this is done by looking at other people's calamities the best of it are you [Music] house in the recent crisis by floods by earthquakes by financial crisis to a bank if you lost your house this is a Calamity but look at what happened to Prophet Adam he ate from The Forbidden truth from the forbidden three the forbidden fruit what happened to him not only he lost his house he lost Jannah he was descended from Jannah to Earth and this is why we're all here so how do you think he feels yes Allah has forgiven him Allah has pardoned him but at what price if your son is disobedient if your spouse and I wouldn't say wife so that the women wouldn't hate me but they hate me both ways so what the heck if your wife is again and complaining playing and always whining and you think that you're the worst of all people being tested by Allah azzawajal how do you think Prophet Noah feels may Allah peace and blessing be upon Him 950 years he gives dawah to his people what happened at the end he loses his wife and his own son who refused to believe and follow and they drown in the flood how do you think he feels and have you lost your job Among Us many people who are jobless they're striving they're looking for a job and they feel that Allah hates them they feel that they're being make they're doing Dua and Allah doesn't answer them why is Allah not answering me what have I done to them they're complaining and they're wrong look at Prophet Musa one of the strong-willed Messengers the best of all Messengers Musa did he lose his job he was deprived from being with his mom since birth and he was raised in the house in the Mansion of his own enemy and he goes once he reaches youth and adulthood he goes into the city he finds one of his clan fighting with another he tries to help he just pushes the other and he dies he flees the country and becomes an expat for 10 years working as a Shepherd to just find food and a decent wife so how do you think he feels did he say Allah is not giving me he trusted Allah and look what Allah did to him and look at Prophet Yusuf he is the son of a prophet the son of a prophet the son of Ibrahim the messenger of prophet of Allah for prophets in a row who can be more honorable than Yusuf peace be upon him nevertheless as a child was abandoned and thrown by his own flesh and blood by his own siblings stabbed in the back and thrown into a well caught by passers-by to be sold as a slave raised in the Mansion of Aziz of Egypt only to be seduced by a beautiful shockingly woman and he refuses to bargain on his Chastity as he fears Allah to be punished and thrown in jail for a number of years losing the most beautiful years of his life any one of us if we're if we're to be invited my place or yours I answer immediately Yusuf did not do that he rather was thrown in jail rather than to respond to such filth and sin did he give up if you were in jail for 10 years wouldn't you feel deprived of Allah's Mercy why Allah is doing this to me never give up never mistrust Allah never feel alone he's always positive what did he do he started giving dawah to the inmates in jail and they all accepted Islam and they all returned to Allah he's always positive and this is what a Muslim really is blessed wherever he is this is a Muslim he's blessed at work he's blessed at school he's blessed at home he's blessed in his neighborhood he's blessed in the Masjid even when he goes to the gym he's blessed are he you're wearing a necklace this is Haram you are not praying it's prayer time come your aura is exposed you're doing this you're doing that and with diplomacy and with kindness and with compassion everybody would love you and you will be blessed like all the messengers of Allah finally [Music] we look at Prophet Ibrahim Ibrahim requires a separate session of his own because it's mind-blowing this is why in Salah we say Allah why Ibrahim why not why not Musa Ibrahim is something else Ibrahim peace be upon him a teenager giving dawah destroying the idols being punished by his people by building a huge fire and being thrown in it not afraid did not even blink jibril comes do you need something said from you no Allah he said no no Allah is sufficient for me and Allah says to the to the fire be coolness and safety to Ibrahim so he walks out Allah azzawajal did not give him a child until he was over 80. and his wife was Baron and he thought that this is Allah's this is Allah's will only to be blessed with Ismail when he was over 80. so imagine when your child is 14 years of age and you feel that he is there for you to take care of you when you're old when you are not able to walk you need the support you need someone to back you up Allah gives you this boy and just when he was there for you the command comes the test comes what slaughtered him it comes to you in a dream but you know as a messenger that dreams of The Messengers are Revelations you have no choice but to comply what does he do he puts him on the ground and says son Allah tells me to slaughter you can you do this can you comply with such tests what does the son say father do whatever you ordered I'll be among the patient don't worry just as he puts him down and he wants to slaughter him Allah sacrifices him with a big Ram from the heaven and says to him you have complied these tests are not random but why does Allah test us isn't Allah most forgiving most merciful to Jannah couldn't Allah make life easy and Rosy and pink and multicolor why is Allah doing this to us isn't he capable you have to be careful when asking such questions really careful number one Allah is not your CEO in the company who you can question Allah is not a parliament member who you can question Allah is not your neighbor Allah is the owner of this whole universe so no one has the right to question Allah because Allah says in the Quran he is not questioned about whatever he does but they each and every individual will be questioned so you don't ask Allah these creations are his if he wills it he will toss them all in Hell Fire and no one can object and no one can question him and no one can refuse no one has the right to hold Allah to account if he takes us to Jannah this is his favor upon us and if he throws Us in hell this is his Justice upon us and we are between his favor and his Justice secondly it goes without questioning and each and every individual if you have this slightest doubt you can't be a Muslim doubt in what is fair and just so you do not have the slightest doubt that Allah is fully fair and just and no one is wronged at the sight of Allah this makes you believe that whatever Allah preordains upon you is good for you whatever Allah decrees upon you is good for you I lost my child it's good for you I am sick it's good for you my mother died it's good for you because you believe that Allah azzawajal is the most merciful the most knowledgeable the fair the just thirdly these tests erase your sins the prophet says Trails will continue to befall the believing man or woman in himself in his child in his wealth until he meets Allah with no sin on him this is the Hadith of the Prophet Islam who knows what's happening and fourthly these calamities and tests are a chance to contemplate to reflect to revise Our Lives we live our daily routines unchanged and we keep on thinking that life is good life is great wow I have more money I have more business I have more success I have more children I have no problems look at everyone else they are falling like flies and I am thriving what is happening you get a wake-up call a slam on the face a hit on the head from Allah why to get you back on track to get you to Allah so many of us were so negligent and ignorant with a simple Calamity we all started doing tahajud we started to pray on time we started making Dua reading Quran asking Allah for forgiveness isn't This calamity better than a million dollars yes indeed This calamity made me come back to Allah made me know Allah made me reflect on my life and be appreciative of whatever Allah has given me so it has woken me up from my sleep fifthly calamities reveal our true identity we to the people are good people only calamities expose us and shows do we walk the talk we all mashallah say good words Islam we have to defend Islam we have to preach Islam we have to fear Allah azzawajal but when you test me on my risk when my income is threatened when I get a very Hefty big fat check just to compromise the dinship I divorced my wife 75 times and I would like to get back to her I said three times is enough and the rest is a bonus what is this AK-47 this is divorce what is this you're playing with Allah love my wife and this is a check of five hundred thousand dollars just in case well this is the difference of the opinion of Scholars we will talk let's go for dinner watch out this is where Allah exposes you how many of us were exposed when business transaction was at risk and we had to give bribes or we have to take bribes or we had to cheat we had to lie we had to do this and that Allah says in the Quran do people and this is in the beginning of Surat al-an kabut the spider do people think that they will be left alone because they say we believe and will not be tested and we indeed tested those who were before them and Allah will certainly make it known the truth of those who are true and will certainly make it known the falsehood of those who are liars Allah exposes Us in this life with such calamities the question that everyone may be asking himself how do I become patient when Allah tests me how do I not break how do I pass the test first of all you have to acknowledge that the tests are from Allah the wise Allah the merciful Allah did not send this test to annihilate and and kill you or destroy you Allah azzawajal and this I've heard many times in my counseling sessions people come to me and they start to vent and complain why Allah is doing this why I have prayed to Allah five years and he did not respond to me why is he doing this is this appropriate to talk about Allah why is he doing this if someone was addressed like this or addressed a king or someone of influence he will crush him on the spot how about Allah azzawajal when you speak about him like this when Allah deprive you from what you had asked him he did not deprive you because he's poor Allah owns everything in this universe and when he deprives you he did not deprive you because he's stingy Allah is the most generous and look at billionaires Jeff Bezos Elon Musk Bill Gates Warren Buffett and the likes they have billions and billions who gave it to them their intellect their power Allah and Allah can strip them from it in a heartbeat so when Allah something Allah he and I'm swearing he did this for your goodness in this life and the Hereafter but the problem is that you refuse to concede and believe and this means that you have failed your test how to be patient when you look at your calamity and compare it to other favors and blessings of Allah that has he that he has given you a man once came to a scholar and said scholar Allah has tested me with poverty and I'm poor he said I'll give you a hundred thousand for one of your eyes I said force not I'll give you a hundred thousand for your arm I'll give you a hundred thousand for your leg and the guy says you're crazy I'm not going to give you any of those so masha'allah you have billions you have millions of on you and you complain that Allah is testing you with poverty Allah has given you so much and most of the people unfortunately show their ingratitude I'm not thirsty by the way yeah I always ask people describe this glass some say half full some say half empty it's the same glass correct those who say have full are the appreciative people they always say Ya Allah you gave me half full glass I know people who have no water in their glasses I know people who don't have glasses to begin with so they're always content and happy like those you go to and visit in poor areas how are you alhamdulillah you what you're paralyzed you're blind you don't have a roof on your head you don't have food on the table so yes but Allah gave me so much this is weird and those who say it's half empty they're always bitching and whining excuse my friendship they're always complaining why why not full I know brothers who have six or seven glasses they have bottles they have tanks why me why this empty so they're never appreciative to what Allah has given them when you compare what you have with those deprived you'll always be on top and be grateful and be thankful always say alhamdulillah for what for what Allah has given you if your Calamity is in your wealth say alhamdulillah is not in your body Sheikh I've lost my business okay would you like to give you back your business but lose the ability to walk to be paralyzed how would I do this no no I'd rather be poor but be able to walk be able to see be able to eat if your your health praise Allah azzawajal that it is not in your religion the worst of all calamities is in that in people's religion Allah to lose every single penny in your pocket to lose your wife and your children to lose everything you possess but to maintain on Islam is better than to keep it and lose your Islam why because at the end of the day you're dead we are all Walking Dead when are we going to die how old are you Uncle he says I'm 90. so how long you think you're gonna live I've heard of no he lived 950 years so I think I have another 860. you're dying everybody thinks that I still have some overtime I have spare time maybe another 10 years every 20 years at the end of the day what will happen you're dead so when you manage to understand that the best and most valuable asset is your religion whatever you lose is okay alhamdulillah I pray five times a day I pray for your own time I pray with her I fast I give charity and I'm content with whatever Allah decrees you are in Jannah insha Allah when you look and compare these calamities and see how it materializes into good deeds and hasanat then you will be happy because when you come on the day of judgment you will find mountains and mountains of Good Deeds um who's this it's yours I I think I'm in the wrong chamber I I didn't do all of this yes you did you were tested and you were patient and all of this is yours because you're of your patience and what helps you tolerate calamities as we have a little time is that if you tolerate a calamity then you'll be rewarded but the Calamity will remain and if you don't tolerate it you will be sinful and the Calamity will be the same a man loses his son he's one of two either he's going to be patient or not those who are patients would say Allah and his content oh Ahi you lost your son alhamdulillah aren't you sad and I'm weeping but I'm content Allah chose the best for him and hamdullah he did not make many sins so inshallah he would await for me in Jannah and Allah will substitute me with something better and this is Allah's decree and uh ortainment so I'm happy with that is his son going to come back to life no but he's rewarded the other one starts banging his head against the wall tears his clothes slaps his face complains objects why me why my son why not my neighbors why not my friends what did he do to you what did I do to you and he keeps on complaining and objecting for a whole month what happens after one month he comes down he forgets business as usual he goes to the gym he eats he drinks he enjoys life as nothing has happened is his son coming back to life no but he's sinful and he will be punished for his a a way of behavior and among the greatest of all all favors and blessings of Allah upon us that calamities do not continue they must end imagine how many calamities have passed by you in your life and you remember oh in that year this happened I lost my job I lost my wealth one of the business partners cheated me and took off my money I was afflicted by this I was incarcerated uh now alhamdulillah everything is fine calamities do not continue they must come to an end and this is why Allah says in the Quran so verily with hardship there is relief verily with hardship there is relief two reliefs with one hardship so definitely you will win if you are patient and finally to those who say why do I ask and make Dua Allah does not answer this is not true Allah answers every single Dua you make to differ I have been calling Allah azzawajal for so many years and he did not answer could this be yes or no who those who say yes raise your hand could this be that you're calling Allah for so many years and he doesn't answer raise your hand yes one two okay let's see the opposite no oh okay that's good masha'allah everybody says no this is impossible when you make Dua Allah answers yeah Allah grant me a million dollars [Music] I know it's going to happen the problem is the prophet told us how it's going to happen number one oh Allah grant me a million dollars boom my uncle in Brazil dies he happens to be a multi-millionaire I'm the only Heir so I inherit a million dollars answered my prayer number two this is the prophet saying the ways of Allah's answering oh Allah grant me a million dollars nothing happens the prophet says Allah deflicts harm that was predestined to happen to you equivalent to this so my business was supposed to receive a shock that makes me lose a million dollars one way or the other Allah makes it happen and Allah has the best of planners and alhamdulillah I avoid this loss but I don't see it like Ya Allah give me a thousand a thousand dollars and it doesn't come and while I'm driving all of a sudden a car jumps in front of me I manage to the last second avoid it otherwise I could have crashed into it it would have costed me a thousand dollars but Allah saved me what do I do yeah I'm a good driver Michael Schumacher Formula One this is what we do we see calamities that we have escaped to be our own strength and power and never attributed to Allah by saying alhamdulillah Allah number three Ya Allah grant me one million dollars he doesn't give it to me here he does not deflect harm that was coming to me equivalent to a million dollars but he saves it to me on the day of judgment I come on the day of judgment and I see mountains and mountains of Good Deeds I didn't do this Angels say this is your Dua so never despair never doubt Allah make as many Dua as you want and Allah will give you may Allah be pleased with him said o prophet of Allah then we make a lot of Dua if this is the case I will make six hours of job I'm a winner both ways the prophet said Allah has more you make Dua Allah is more do you think Allah needs you or he's poor how many and I will conclude by that how many times did I decided to say this statement this is the third time third is a charm inshallah I will conclude with that how many humans are on Earth 7 billion give or take maybe 8 billion who provides for each individual imagine once I was in my high riser in Kuala Lumpur to attend the conference devoted for dawa anyhow I I was there enjoying my five-star hotel looking at the people at the rush hour like ants in their motorcycles in their cars in the hundreds of thousands and I'm thinking yeah Allah each and everyone has a problem has a debt has a sick person has needs has desires Allah is giving each and everyone without a doubt every single individual on Earth Allah is providing for only humans even the Jinn in their billions even the animals how many animals in Africa and in Asia and elsewhere how many fish underneath the oceans in the rivers trillions how many birds how many insects Allah takes care of all of them but Allah only gives Jannah to you you want Jannah comply with Allah with Allah's decree and be satisfied"
