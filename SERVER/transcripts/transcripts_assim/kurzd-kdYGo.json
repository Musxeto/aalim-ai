  "title": "Is braiding the hair permissible for men in Islam? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i have a long hair and it's bothering me when i prostrate for salat and i move and etc so can i braid them braiding the hair is a cultural thing not an islamic thing so if you are in a community if you are in jamaica for example and everybody is braiding their hair men are braiding their hair there's no problem it's the customs no problem but if you are in saudi arabia if you are in a muslim country and you braid your hair people would look at you and say bad things because this is not part of the customs in the uk it can be both ways however you tell me how the muslims and the imams of the masjids and the islamic centers there look at you and perceive you when you go with braided hair if they take it as normal alhamdulillah there's no problem in that if they don't and they think that this is more likely to be imitating the kaffar and the disbelievers then you should not do this and you should cut your hair short like everybody else this is easier when washing this is easier when going out instead of taking care of it and it is less dubious whether it's halal or haram"
