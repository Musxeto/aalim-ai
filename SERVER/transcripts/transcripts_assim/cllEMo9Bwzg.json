  "transcript": "you have clarified before that photography is permissible uh so um and you have said that uh so I don't really care about pictures but my uh parents do and they ask me to take pictures everywhere uh so I would like to know if it's permissible to keep them for memory for my parents ja love I did not say that photo photographs are Halal you have to be really careful when you coach something as such photography of landscape of objects that have no life there is no difference of opinion among any scholar that it is halal to take photography photog RS of mountains oceans uh Gardens jungles there's no problem with that at all nobody disputes in that the problem is in taking photographs of living creatures humans animals and the likes and a lot of the scholars say that this is not permissible because this is mimicking and imitating the creation of Allah and it falls under the warning of not taking such drawings and pictures some Scholars say that this is permissible because it is not actually mimicking the creation of Allah it is the creation of Allah so it's like a reflection of your self in a mirror or on a pond of water it's like when you sign a check and you Xerox it when you see the Xerox copy you wouldn't say that this is not mine you said this is my signature because it is your signature however those who permitted taking such photographs they said it has to be Halal photographs so you can't take photos of a man who's not covering his or to be used in an indecent thing you can take photographs of normal men noral pauses without any problem you can take pictures of children without any problem you cannot take pictures of women because this defies the purpose of hijab even if these women are your mam even if she's your wife or your daughter or your sister you can't take her photograph and some argue they say that oh the phone is secured the camera is secured the laptop is secured it's mine I'm not going to going to sell it I'm not going to do anything it still can be hacked it still can be retrieved even after formatting the hard disk it can be retrieved so it's always best to be safe rather than sorry and Allah Knows Best"
