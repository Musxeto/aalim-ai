  "title": "How to think positive of Allah when times are bad? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "well this needs a full lecture times are not bad because time has no power to be good or bad it is what allah has predestined to us that might be good that might be bad and this is why the six pillars of islam the last one is to believe in the divine decree or the pre-destiny whether good or bad so if you watch all of your life cannot be a constant um slope there has to be ups and downs and the curve goes up and the curve goes down sometimes i reflect on my lives on my life i was so [Music] in pain and trouble and there are so many times where i was happy healthy wealthy and i find that this is all part of life where allah tests us so you should not condemn time you should acknowledge that this is allah testing you allah says in the quran and we test you with calamities and with good things and this is a fitna so when allah gives me a million kuwaiti dinar this is fitna i saw i'm happy allah azza loves me and if allah takes it from me and i'm facing charges with the court and i say allah doesn't love me no allah said in surah this is not the case allah gives health gives wealth gives peace of the land and safety to those whom he loves and those whom he does not love but allah does not give iman does not give tranquility does not give the peace of mind except to those whom he love except to those whom he loves guidance comes only to those whom allah loves so whenever you see that allah azzawajal is guiding your heart to be content to be patient to be tolerant accepting whatever happens to you with a smiley face and saying alhamdulillah like zubair he once on the same night lost his son who was attacked or ran over by a horse in the caliph's stables in the caliph barn and it on the same night the doctors say that we have to amputate your foot because there's gonna be gargling in it after all of this happened and finished he said alhamdulillah oh allah you gave me eight sons and you took one and you gave me four limbs and you took one so what you have kept is far greater than what you had taken this is how a believer should deal with calamities that strike him and always praise allah azza and always feel optimistic think positive of allah always tell yourself allah did not deprive me because he's stingy allah his most generous subhanallah and he did not with hold things from me because he doesn't have allah is the most rich and who owns everything so then why do i say oh allah grant me my business is not doing well my father is not having a good income he lost his job allah is doing this as a test and we don't know the outcome of allah's test but we trust his knowledge always remember what he did with musa in the end of surat al-khaf which we recite every friday three incidents he saw a boat with poor people working across the river he said can you give us a lift they said with pleasure he started making a hole in the boat musa was outraged they're doing us a favor and you're doing this in return they walk and they see a child nine years of age playing with his peers he goes to him and he kills him musa was outraged you kill an innocent soul when he explained to musa why he did this we understand that allah azzawajal allah's knowledge is way far greater than ours and allah's wisdom is way way more accurate than ours so we should doubt our own intellect and submit to allah's will and be content with allah's decree and allah's best you"
