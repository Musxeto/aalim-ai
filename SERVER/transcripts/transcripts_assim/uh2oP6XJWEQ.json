  "title": "Are we hitting the devil when we move our index finger in tashahhud? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "when I set for tah I move my finger as I know it's a Sunnah recently I was told by someone when we do this we are hitting Tron is it true the Hadith says that moving your finger in t this is harder on Satan than iron which indicates as if it I'm I'm beating him with an iron Rod so this movement is more painful to him because it means that I'm following the Sunnah that I'm concentrating and he's irritated by it so this is what the Hadith means and Allah Knows Best"
