  "transcript": "yeah okay so my question for today is that recently I encountered a pushy professional begger at the ha Center recently and they are known for their aggressive sales tactic majority of them are foreigners hired by a Syndicate and they are here on a on a tourist visa where they are not supposed to work with such a Visa and they can't and they don't take no for an answer and can become physically and verbally abusive if I call the police they can't intervene only suggesting a costly complaint I know honesty is crucial in Islam but in this situation is it acceptable for me to say that I can't afford to give the money to deter them from bothering me further if I understood your question correctly if these professional Beggars are illegal in your country and they're physically and uh uh verbally abusive and they keep they don't take take no for an answer and they keep on insisting on you yeah you call the police let them take them and extradite them or throw them in prison this is not your problem inshallah and there's nothing wrong in that and Allah knows best this is"
