  "transcript": "from the usa um if a muslim wanted to attain becoming an islamic psychiatrist or psychologist would it be better for them to study and then to benefit the muslims of their catholic country or to benefit the muslims of a muslim country such studies we've we've mentioned this before recording stopped recording stop that's good um such studies require that a person studies islam before engaging in them because so much of such sciences are not based on islamic beliefs and have a lot of corruption in them that may distort your own religion and this is why we say if you want to study psychiatry or psychology this is okay providing you have the basic foundation strong foundation in islamic apida so that you won't have doubts in your own religion without doing this now once you do this whether you practice in muslim countries or non-muslim countries it doesn't make any difference because if you're practicing it in non-muslim countries you'll be able to give dawah to your patients and clients and directly or indirectly and that would be beneficial and if you're doing it in muslim countries you will be also capable of strengthening the iman with your patience and alano's best you"
