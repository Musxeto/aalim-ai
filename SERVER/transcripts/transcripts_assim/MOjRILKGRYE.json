  "transcript": "okay ask sorry so you said in your lecture that God doesn't have a son and it's a big deal grory to him to ascribe a son to him and you even said um how people should react if how people should react if um something derogatory is said to probably our parents um but I want to go into first of all the clarity about God having a son or not and I discovered from checking the Quran Quran does not Quran maybe we pick it one after the other to see some of the things that Quran says and um be able to say like Quran CH 3 39:4 I want to read here but anybody can also read it Quan 39:4 hi I can't hear the last part what did you say Quran says Quran chapter 39 Quran chapter 39 verse 4 verse 4 what does it say okay he's saying there if Allah had want to have to take himself a son he could have choose anyone he wants out of those who he created glory be to him I can't hear you okay maybe you could read it out for me okay Quran chapter 39 ver4 verse four yes so will you read it yes I want you to read it you want to read you you said you can't hear me so maybe you should read it yes okay Quran chap 39:4 if Allah had wanted to take himself a son or have a son he could have choose he anyone he wanted Out Of Those whom he created glory be to him that he have he should have a son now that's my beginning from this quranic verse it is clear that Allah could choose to have a son ah okay I'll give the reply that's your question no that's not my question that's the what's your question tell me this a you are misinterpreting the Quran what's the question tell me I will tell you okay so this verse doesn't means Allah and truth I will tell you okay good you ask your question I will listen what's your question there are many quranic vers I want to use to build up the question so that you can answer it clearly what's your question good the question is can Allah have a son and when we look at what the Quran itself is saying the first one is that it's saying that if Allah want to have a son he can decide to have a son that is number one number two is now that um he said that in Quan 6 verse 101 101 Quan chter 6 verse 101 he said he is the is the originator of heavens and earth how could he have a child when he have no mes he created all things and had perfect knowledge of everything now Quran I don't know if I should continue should I continue yes okay a question yes Quran chapter 6 verse 101 is saying that if Allah choose to have a wife we is going to be the partner because he doesn't have a partner but Quran chapter 19 Iman Ayah 2021 the same thing is a question that Mary Miriam asks the angel who actually came from from verse 17 Allah shows that he came in the respect in the appearance of a man in all respect and dialogue with him and tell him that you have a son and he said how can I have a son without a without knowing anybody I got a question so he was able to have a she was able to have a son without an husband so in Coran CH 6 ver 101 that is also possible by Hal because Allah said whatever he lies to see question good so and continue with that your first verse was which the first quranic ver was which sir the first quranic verse yes I not finished the first one no no what was the reference reference Quran chapter the first one Quran chapter 39:4 okay fine I got it the brother quoted two verses just qu Sur zum chapter 39 verse number four and Surah Anam chter 6 verse number 101 and Surah zum CH 39 ver number four says if Allah had intended to take a son he could have chosen from what he creates whatever he will exalted is he he's Allah the one and prevailing now the brother asking a question this means if Allah wants he can take a son and similar in Surah Anam 6 verse 101 so brother saying that Allah can take a son if he wishes that's the question okay but the verse is very clear if yes yes but it does not it is not befitting for Allah to have a son complete the full verse if you read this context it says in the in the first verse unquestionably for Allah is the pure religion and those who take protect us say we only worship them who may bring us nearer to Allah Allah will judge between concerning them indeed Allah does not guide who is a liar and a disbeliever read in context don't read out of context so Allah is saying these people are liars and disbelievers then Allah says if Allah had intended that means Allah does not intend to take a son it's a telling so read the context it says unquestionably for Allah is the pure religion Allah does not guide who is a liar and a disbeliever then the next verse starts so don't quote out of context correct if you go to in context you come to know Allah is telling all those people who say Allah is Allah a son Etc they are liars and then Allah says if Allah had intended to take a son he could have chosen from what he creates whatever he will exalted is he that means he's far above having a son okay so this let me complete you ask the question now listen to my answer don't interrupt understand you you don't understand the Quran yeah Allah is saying they are liars what you doing you are taking a verse from the Quran out of context and trying to misguide in context it says that this is all nonsense these people are liars and even the next verse so from here we come to know if Allah wanted he could have done Allah is far superior than this then coming to your next verse of Surah Anam chapter number six verse number 101 it says he he is the originator of the heavens and the Earth how could he have a son when he does not have a companion the Quran says how can Allah have a son when he doesn't have a wife Allah is giving the answer how can Allah have a son when he doesn't have a companion and he's created all things when he's created all things he doesn't require a companion we were created he's uncreated so Allah is saying how will Allah have a son when he does not have a companion he created everything so this verse is very explicit Allah cannot have a son there's another verse in the Quran which says if Allah had a son I would be the first person to Bow Quran says if anyone says Allah has a son tell them I'll be the first person to worship him that doesn't mean Allah has a son there's a verse from the Quran that if Allah had a son tell them I would be the first person to worship him that means Allah cannot beet a son the whole Quran should be read together you can't take out of context Quran is very clearcut inah chapter number 112 verse number 1 to4 which says say he Allah one and only Allah Allah the Eternal and absolute he begs not know he begotten there nothing like him so this is the definition of Allah first you have to know the definition of of Allah and then try and read the other verses of the Quran you can't read out of context and try and misguide the people Allah is telling in this world there are people who are Liars who will say this okay so let me finish what okay you ask the question you have to listen to my answer this is no debate session yes I want you to just not finished the answer with the gr I have not finished the answer vers vers 20 to 21 I have not finished the answer okay sir continue sir do you understand English continue sir I understand why not I do understand you can hear me I cannot hear you because the speakers are there correct so let me finish the answer so the definition of Allah is in surlas chapter number 112 verse number 1 to 4 which says say Allah one only you cannot get me okay this of the Quran says that Allah is true then there'll be a contradiction and there is no contradiction in the Quran Allah says in Surah 4:32 [Music] do they not consider the Quran with care it been from anyone besides Allah there have been contradictions so number one there is no contradiction in the Quran so you assuming that Allah can is nonsense it says if Allah wanted that if Allah doesn't have a companion how can he have a son that does not mean that he has a son now coming to a question of of Sur maram in Surah maram chapter number 19 when Archangel Gabriel comes and asks mother Mary maram you shall have a son she replies how shall I have a son when no man has touched me how shall I have a son when no man has touched me the reply given by Archangel Gabriel is if Allah decrees the matter he just says be and it is so when she says normally yes for having a son you have to procreate for having a son you have to procreate but the reply given by the if Allah decrees if Allah Wills but Allah does not will Allah can create Adam Alam without father and mother he created Eve with a man without a female he created Isa Alam with a mother without a father if Allah decrees a matter he will but Allah will not decree ungodly things like becoming a human being like having a son that's for human beings it Allah cannot go against his definition you understand if Allah decrees a matter yes but did Allah say that no Allah says he begins not know begotten so this is the definition of Allah the moment he beets he sees it to be God the moment Allah has a son he will cease to be God do you understand if if the definition of God in the Quran is Allah does not beget he begets not nor is he begotten the moment you say Allah begot a son he sees this to be God do you understand can I ask a question do you understand this but if Allah begs a son he sees it to be God do you understand this that's Quran chter 39 Quran chapter 39 ver4 we negate that statement if he intended he if it's a question for example it is a sarcastic question for example it's a rhetoric rhetoric if Allah had a son I would be the first to bow that doesn't mean Allah has that's the rhetoric if you correct I will give you a million dollar but you're not correct so if doesn't means it is correct you understand now if Allah had a son I would be the first to worship Him Allah doesn't have a son so you don't understand English correctly because you don't understand English correctly you are trying to say something and quoting out of context first of all you quote a verse out of context if you quote a verse out of context it will Mis guide the people I got the correct context do you understand do you understand that you quot it out of context yes or no if you want me to quote it from the uh from the beginning I can quote it it does not matter if you want me to quote quot it from the beginning like from you have to earlier you have to can we did not okay that's not the problem you did a mistake okay a mistake mistake yes you have to apologize okay you know if I say you know Quran says Jesus Is God do you know that Quran says Jesus Is God okay do you know that out of context okay h i wait wait wait Quran says in 5 verse number 17 a full context they are doing those who say Jesus is God yes I age Jesus Is God is there in the Quran but out of context the context is they are blaspheming they are blaspheming those who say Jesus is God they are blaspheming blasphemy not blasphemy why not blasphemy is to ascribe even according to Islam is to ascribe another God to God so if you say if you quot out of context it is devilish okay if you did it purposely it is devilish okay so so you have to always quote in context you can't just quote half now your question is over no for I already answered your question you wait don't say no you give three references of the Quran I'm saying you give three references of the Quran Sur Z 39 verse number four Surah 6 chapter 6 verse number 101 and Surah chapter number 19 I answered all those three I have not finished on that I was still quoting when you decide you can this is not a debating section if you want to debate you hire a hall I will send my student to debate you no debate no debate it's a question answer session add the last verse Quran CH 21 this is a question answer session you have to go beond concludes the question Quran CH 21: 91 which one Quan chapter 21 verse 91 2191 yes and my question to conclude that my one question which I okay this is the last this is the last reference you're giving 2191 okay what does it say now he saying there thatas do you agree that you made a mistake in the first two verses say yes otherwi the answer I gave now are you convinced that the first two verses doesn't say that Allah can have a son do you agree or not he said if he wants to have a if doesn't means if I say if you are right I will give you a million dollar does it mean you're right that means it's not you to decide it's not me to decide it's Allah to decide if wait listen listen wait wait not not wait wait not anybody don't talk when I'm talking don't talk when I'm talking no do you understand English why not sir do you understand English okay why not I'm speaking English I think you can't understand English I understand then why are you breaking the rules in question and session you cannot interrupt you cannot talk in between do you know that because you cannot again you're talking okay is this a debate or is it a question answer session is a question answer so once you ask a question you have to keep quiet okay thank you you Christian missionaries you're a Christian Missionary I mean what are you a Christian Missionary I'm a Christian I'm a Christian ah I'm a Christian are you a Christian Missionary I'm a Christian are you a missionary I'm a Christian I'm are you a father or a pastor say that again are you a father or a pastor or a I'm a Christian oh you're afraid to tell youty okay you told 21 2191 yes I I've only quote the verse I've not say my question in it so if you permit me to say my question so that you can explain it Coran chapter 21: 91 so my question there is it and is in that build up of that other question is that from that verse Allah said he is the one who sent his Angel J to go and breathe his Spirit into the private part of Mary now I I looking at it even humanly speaking that if I do anything to the private part of a woman anything that comes out of it I am responsible for it now if if it is Allah that send his Angel to take his spirit and breath it into the Mary then Allah is responsible for that child and that child is is is son of Allah likewise like if I did that to a woman is my son okay did you understand my first two answers yes or no yes I will give this answer thank you sir so first two answer you understood I understand that you were wrong I understand I understand you very good so first two answers is agree that Allah now I'm coming to the last now you don't reply back please this say a question answer session he did not tell the verse the verse of the Quran of Surah Amia chapter 21 verse number 91 says and mention the one who guarded her chestday so we blew into a garment through our Angel Gabriel and we made her and a son a sign for the worlds he saying that Allah subhah wa ta'ala has blown his Spirit into Isa Alam correct yes sir I agree with it do you know Allah says in the Quran in Surah hijar chapter 15 verse 29 Allah Brew the spirit into every human being Quran says doesn't mean I'm God does it mean you're God you don't understand the Quran Allah says in Surah 15 verse 29 Allah has brought the spirit into every human human being Allah says in Surah s 32 verse number n he's here blowing spirit means Allah has put his knowledge into every human being including isaam now the problem is you read one verse you don't read the full Quran have you read the full Quran have you read the full Quran I have you read the full Quran cover to cover have you read the full Quran as much as I can ah as much as I can he could read only five verses no or 10 verses no as much as I can means what you afraid to tell that sorry I have not read the complete Quran this is trying to beat around the bush now please don't answer your question is over I've already answered your question I already answered your question now don't talk I'm completing the answer this brother came to deceive the people as much as I can he's afraid to say I read 100 verses or 200 verses or thousand verses as much as I can these are the way the Christian missionaries they try and attack good example of Brothers given here how I give in my talk they come and knock at the doors now normal Muslim would have got scared quoting was out of the context this is a very good example you have in Nigeria this brother is coming here trying to deceive the Muslim audience trying to deceive the Muslim audience the first two he agreed do you agree that the Quran says Allah has Bown the spirit in every human being so every human being is God according to you he breathed the spirit to Mary in a private part to all human being he just that is what the Quran says Quran CH 21: 91 every everybody can read it Quran CH 21:1 don't waste your time go and sit down go and waste our time you don't want to give the answer you're afraid you're afraid to say that I did not read the Quran as much as I can you are trying to go on the internet pick up verses of the Quran out of context and trying to deceive the people when you want to read the Quran read the complete Quran read the complete Quran and then say that the reason they pick up verses they are being trained they are being trained by missionaries how to ask questions out of context"
