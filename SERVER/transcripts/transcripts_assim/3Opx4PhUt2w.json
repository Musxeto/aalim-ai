  "transcript": "rihan's second question she says that sometimes I look at others and I find this strange feeling and I'm unable to communicate I'm unable to link with them this is from Shaitaan you are the one who's putting obstacles I was talking to one of my daughters yesterday and she was telling me that I'm unable to overcome my negative feelings towards some of my next of kin some of my relatives so I said subhanAllah a couple of years ago you had this desire to learn Turkish language and you picked it up in a couple of months a few weeks ago I was talking to you about my intention to learn Spanish it's a beautiful language but I don't find the time to to sit and begin to learn it and in two weeks time she's on her app or something repeating words the comma stabbed yeah whatever and she's picking it up you are the one who puts obstacles when you don't want to learn or to progress you say I can't but when you do any obstacles on your way you will remove it so Rehan you have to win this battle with your own self by saying I can't communicate I can be kind to people I can think of them positively whenever I get these negative feelings I just shrugged my shoulders and throw them away and seeking allah azzawajal help making a lot of drop makes things much much easier for you"
