  "transcript": "sample it's my privilege to be here and meet you and I'm a big fan of your program thank you for the opportunity I am a born Hindu I'm revert to Islam few years back but I am facing issues with my parents and my family things that I have made the biggest mistake by a river change islam and i believe the one and only God is Almighty Allah we came from him and will return to him and I want to convey this message to my parents and I'm struggling to speech them because they are my parents and on this topic I want my beloved parents to enter Jannah and I said at a situation to my mom like in a don't worship the creations instead worship the Creator so I need your advice and to have the courage to go and speak to my parents to entrance Jana thank you you're quite welcome handle I so Virgil may allah the almighty make you steadfast on islam and it's only few moments that is keeping you away from entering gender once you die on islam once you die while maintaining and observing your prayer five prayers a day nothing would hold you back from Geneva Allah now for your fear from advising and calling your parents this is from Japan any fear that you feel to humans this is from Shaitan in de madera como Shaitaan yoo-hoo folia this is straight on who is making you intimidated from his servants from his allies so this is definitely from Shaitaan now how to motivate yourself and to get this encouragement to talk to them I'll give you an example you're a believer Angela you believe in Hell in heaven and you want them to be with you in heaven if you see your father or your mother holding a glass with venom and poison in it and you know the minute they take a sip they will go to their graves they will die instantly would you advise them or would you hit the glass and throw it away fearing that they may harm themselves definitely in dunya you would do whatever you can to save them now life and death is something that everyone is going to pass through so if I die today or if I die after 100 years the end result is death but hell and heaven are for eternity so would you want them to suffer in hell definitely not so you have to encourage yourself you have to as stated in the beginning of the talk make a strategic plan set your objectives because when you have a plan you don't give everything in 10 minutes maybe you have to say something today a week later something else a little bit more a month later but have a long-term plan have a short long-term plan have your objectives try to figure and think how they think so that you can counter-attack that but never ever give up hope every day that passes reduces your chances in saving them from Hellfire so may allah azzawajal guide them and all of your family to islam and make you steadfast on this team inshallah"
