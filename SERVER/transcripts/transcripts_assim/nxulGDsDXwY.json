  "title": "OCD with Saliva on lips while making Sujood, does licking lips invalidate prayer?",
  "transcript": "Romania from the UK um so my question is whenever I'm praying I sometimes the house the level on my lips and when I mix YouTube that saliva touches the ground and then whenever I do a second Institute and I touch that saliva on the ground with my lips again and I lick it inside the Salah somewhere does that invited my prayer and if so how can I avoid it first of all sumayya this doesn't make any sense when someone is drooling and splitting saliva on the ground they would avoid that spot nobody would go and put his lips once again on that spot and lick his saliva even dogs don't do this you are overthinking things this is shaytan messing up with your Salat and if you were to ask yourself to be frank with yourself what did I recite in Salat you would not know why because you were so busy and so engaged in Trivial issues that you don't know what's the benefits of your Salat you're just doing robotic actions and saying things and while your mind is overthinking so many things in in this universe that distracts you from your Salat nobody does what you're doing nobody spits unintentionally and then go lick their spit from the ground come on and give me a break people would even if you go to the Masjid and someone before you prostrated with their wudu on their face and they left a wet mark if you feel the wetness you're gonna change your position let alone to have spit coming to your lips and licking your lips again and come on give me a break how big a person's lips can be to the extent that his forehead his nose and his lips are touching the ground this guy has to have weird flat face or I don't know so the way I see it this is shaytan messing with your prayer big time and this is just the tip of the iceberg you have serious issues other than that which you need to address before this OCD destroys your life you have to get this treated and out of your system may Allah make things easy and I apologize for any rudeness that was unintended"
