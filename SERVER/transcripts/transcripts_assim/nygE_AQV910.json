  "transcript": "[Questioner] says, if a woman leaves her husband's house intending to divorce, where does she spend her Iddah once she divorces him or does she file for khul'a as she cannot go back  to his house for Iddah?  This is something that Allah mentioned in the Quran and Allah gave us the answer to this.  A woman is divorced once or twice and these are called revocable divorces, meaning that  the husband has the right to revoke the divorce and reconcile and they can get back together while she is in the waiting period, the Iddah period we call it in Arabic.  If he divorces her for the third time, it's over, game is over.  She cannot stay in the home, she cannot see him or mix with him because he becomes a total  non-mahram to her on the spot, he said, the third divorce.  In the first and second revocable divorces, she is obliged to stay home.  Sheikh, he just divorced her even though she has to stay the period of Iddah, which is three  monthly cycles generally speaking for normal people who are not pregnant and who still  have their menses.  Three monthly periods, she stays home and their husband and wife, they have full right  to talk, to see one another, to make sleep in the same room but without any intimacy.  Why? Because Allah said in the Qur'an, to the men, do not take them out of their homes  after divorce nor they should leave.  So this is an instruction, they should stay home.  Why?  Allah says in the Qur'an, you never know, maybe something will come up.  What does that mean?  Maybe after the divorce, couple of weeks later, I'm enraged, I'm angry with my wife.  A couple of weeks, I see her in my house, in my bed, and I remember the good old times  and then I think to myself, what I have done?  She's a good woman.  I start to see the good things in her and then maybe I kiss and make up.  That's it.  So the divorce is revocable, one down, two to go.  We resume our lives.  We continue to be in this marriage happily ever after.  So this is one of the reasons but at the end of the day, this is what Allah commanded.  So you cannot leave your home.  You have to stay there.  If you decide to go and stay at your parents' house, then you are sinful.  If He forces you not to go back, then He is sinful but this does not impact the divorce."
