  "title": "Father in law stole my haqq mahr, what should I do? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "munteja says i have a question and to make a long story short um her father-in-law gave her a portion from his house as a maha a dowry and now he has sold the house without her permission which means that he also sold her portion of the house and he is blackmailing his son his son and telling them that he would not give them a penny the son is obedient doesn't want to hurt his father's feelings but at the same time he borrowed that is the father from his son 380 rupees lack rupees and used it without telling her husband and spending the money of the house on his new wife and children what does islam say about such a problem first of all this father in law of yours has committed a grave sin by depriving you of your and muslims when they promise they fulfill hypocrites when they promise they break this portion of the house which was allocated as a maha it's your right to claim it so let's assume that at the time of selling the house it costed let's say ten thousand dollars the portion that is yours this is a debt that he is supposed to give to you and actually the debt is on your husband because he's the one obliged to give you the maha so if he failed to deliver the maha due to his father's betrayal and dishonesty then it remains with your husband to give it to you whenever it's possible or for you to forgive your husband that your father-in-law is a cheater and a liar and he's a crook but now you're faced with a problem either to take him and your husband to court demanding your right or to act wisely and especially when your husband is a good man to separate your financials from your father-in-law totally so you advise your husband that you require the maha from him and that he has to pay more attention in the future to his family to his wife and children's rights rather than squandering and spending off his wealth on his father who is a spendthrift and does not fear allah azzawajal and allah you"
