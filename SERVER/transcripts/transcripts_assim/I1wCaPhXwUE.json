  "transcript": "Salman from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my Masjid is very close to my home. Sometimes I miss congregation Fard Salah due to sleep or any other reason and reach Masjid 10 or 20 minutes after the Fard Salah is over. And sometimes I reach two to three hours later. So if I miss the Fard Salah to go to Masjid or I can pray at home. Jazakum Allahu Khairan. Wa Jazak. Akhi, if you reach Masjid two, three hours later, might as well pray Dhuhr. What is this? No, if you miss Fajr prayer and by 5, 10, 15 minutes and you know that if you go there, you'll be able to catch another congregation Inshallah with other late comers. Yes, it is highly recommended that you go and pray in the Masjid. Because Allah would grant you the same reward as if you've prayed it with the first congregation. Your reason for skipping the congregation is legitimate. You overslept and this excuse is valid with Allah. But not to go completely, it would not be the right thing to do. Now two, three hours later, no, of course, the Masjid is going to be closed. So you might as well pray home."
