  "transcript": "Fahim says is hair transplant surgery permissible in Islam there's a long discussion regarding this but the most authentic opinion is that such a surgery is permissible where they tend to take some cells or hairs from the back of the head which is usually the last affected by baldness and then they transplant these in the skull or in in the scalp itself and it grows naturally so this is to counter a defect and to remove something that is not normal and there is nothing wrong in that cosmetic surgery is Haram when it is only for the use of beautification or altering and changing the creation of Allah but if it is to remove a defect or to fix something that is wrong or that impairs speaking or eating or movement in this case this is totally permissible and legitimate"
