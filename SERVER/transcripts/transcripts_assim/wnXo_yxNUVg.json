  "transcript": "Oh Oh chill r-rahmani r-rahim hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen o sallallahu wasallam of our economy he wear a suit in amin nabina muhammad in winery he was savage main a man assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we move on to the chapter that deals with the prayer of funeral the prayer that we offer when a dead person dies before burying him and when it comes to the funeral rites there are a lot and a lot of rules governing it the first of which we must know is what to do when a person is on his dying bed so it is essential that we visit a person who's dying because this is part of the rights of a Muslim over a Muslim whenever someone is ill it's his rights upon you to visit him and by visiting him we have to encourage him and give him hope some of the brothers may Allah forgive them when they visit a person who's sick when they see him they said y'all Latif what is this man you look so bad wow this is dangerous man you look very very ill as if you're going to die so instead of giving him hope they help and escalating his demise and this is not permissible you should give them hope usage a masha'Allah you look better you should supplicate for them you should give them rakia and also if a person on his on his dying bed he's dying he does not have the flu sometimes you visit someone who has a fever and he has the flu and you say c'est la illaha illallah when you tell him this this is as if he is going to die no but those who are actually dying on the dying bed it is recommended that we teach them how to say la la la la why because the Prophet told us alehissalaam if a person's life ended by saying Leila hila line it was the last thing he says he will enter paradise no matter what happened before that but ordering them to say la illaha illallah depends from one person to the other if a dying person I tell him say la illaha illallah and he says die la la la I should not come to him every five minutes c'est la la la la se la la la say Lila after what he would become fed up especially in the emotional state he's in and maybe he says go away I don't want to say scholars say it has to be the last thing he says so if I tell him say Lyda Hill a lot he says Lila halala and then he does not say anything I should not repeat it for an hour two hours five hours when he says give me a glass of water I give him the glass of water and tell him say Lila halala so that it would become the last thing he speaks and when he dies what is the first thing I should do the prophet said re salatu salam when he came to abou salama to visit him on his dying bed once he died he closed his eyes and the prophets analysis of the first thing that follows the soul once its departing is the eyesight and that is why the most most of people who die they die like this they watch their soul come out of their bodies so the Sun is to close his eyes and if his mouth is open the sunday is to close his mouth as well and that is why some schools of thoughts say that you tie or a bandage so that you keep the mouth closed so that nothing would enter the mouth while the deceased is being prepared for washing and among the things that people do is that they must not supplicate against themselves or say bad things because once a person dies there are angels around him saying I mean whatever you say they say I mean so if a wife comes and starts slapping at faces say I wish it was me not you angel say I mean may Allah kill me I mean so the Prophet says as I'm supplicate and do not supplicate with anything but good because the angels are saying I mean what do we supplicate oh Allah forgive him o Allah forgive me allah pay my debts o Allah expand his grave etc among the things that we should do with the dead body after his death is we should try to soften his joints so we come to his arms and we bend them so that when we wash him it is flexible his knees as well gently not in a harsh way and to cover him entirely to cover his body with a blanket or with something that would protect him there is nothing wrong in uncovering the dead body and kissing so if your father or your brother like Abu Bakr came to the prophet that islam after he died and he unveiled his face and kissed him between the eyes and said to him o prophet of Allah how good you are dead and a life and then it is recommended that we wash the body and washing the body is something that is mandatory we will come to mention how to wash the body later on a shaala because there are a number of hadith regarding this issue we wash the body in a certain way but this certain way is only a formality we have the instruction from the profit at it's awesome to wash the body with water and looters three times or more the minimum is three times we can wash him 57 it has to be with it it has to be odd numbers and then in the last time we wash him with it whether it's the third or the fifth of the seventh we should put some car for which is a form of perfume that would give the body nice smell and at the same time it would help to repel any insects and it would make it tougher for handling then we take the body and we shrouded in three routes we wrap it in three routes we do it in a certain way but if you don't have this certain way any shrouding we do the minimum is one one is enough but the Sun has to do three and after that we take the body and we pray the funeral prayer as we will come to know inshallah then we bury the body in a grave lying on it's right side facing the Qibla all the graves of Muslims are like this so if this is the Qibla the grave is here and the man is light on his right side so the head is on the right side he's entered from the grave like this from the feet of the grave this is the head of the grave and this is the foot of the grape so we insert the body from the feet of the grave and then we put him on his right hand side facing the crib LA and we bury him do we uncover his face or untie his not some scholars say yes we untied the knot but we never uncover the face we make him shrouded and wrapped in his route and leave him we bury him end of story this usually takes two to three hours maximum four hours which shows you that whenever Islam realizes that Muslims need something urgently and frequently it's always easy and likewise end death that happens to everyone it is a calamity it is as described in the Quran Messiah it is a calamity but it happens to everyone so you have to do it you have to get it over with in accordance to the Sharia and alhamdulillah we have a number of hadees governing this issue so we begin with hadith number 155 brother please read it for us narrated above where the law and who holas messenger sallallahu ala salem informed us about the news of the death of anna joshi on the day that he died he went out with us to the masala and we align in rows and he said fort appears Bihari and this hadith the prophet alayhi salatu salam informed his companions of the death of Anna joshy the great ruler of Abyssinia who hosted the Companions when they offered or did their first migration to Abyssinian and the people of Mecca used to abuse them and that is why they complained to the Prophet item they're unable to worship Allah so the Prophet said to them sallallahu alehiwassallaam go to Abyssinia because there is a king that is fair and just and he would not allow any unjustice to be fall upon you and this shows us that the prophet alayhi salatu salam had political knowledge he was not only an imam or a preacher he knew about the countries around and what was happening and that is why he advises people to go to Abyssinia we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah will be run assalamu alaikum and welcome back so Anna Joshi when he accepted the Companions to live in his country the pagans sent two of their messengers and one of them was Amram de las may allah be pleased with him and he tried to bribe the priests and those around Anna Joshi so that they would help him in convincing than a joshi to send them back and then a jaw she refused to do so because he said that these people came trusting me why should I send them back and he instructed his people to give them back their gifts their bribes so the following day he said to him I'm going to asset to him that they say an awful thing about your Lord Jesus Christ so the Nagar she summoned them in his court and jafar even ABI talib may allah be pleased with him the cousin of the prophet alaihi salam displayed their cause and he told them that we describe mesa oh jesus to be one of the greatest messengers of allah and that he was born miraculously out of maryam but he is not the son of god and he recited to him the beginning of short medium and then a jaw she cried and wept when he heard these beautiful verses and said by Allah this is exactly what Jesus was and when his priest complained because they thought that this was unlike the teachings of the Bible or of Christianity which says that Jesus is the Son of God he said whether you complain or not this is exactly what Jesus was and because he was the King they did not open their mouths afterwards Anna Joshi accepted Islam but he was unable to come to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he soon died afterwards of course this happened after the Prophet re Sola Sola migrated to Medina and those who were in Abyssinia also migrated to Medina when he died the prophet said re his salat wassalam that your brother and nagar she has passed away today and he took his companions to the masala and he formed a number of rows and this is important in funeral prayer and he offered the funeral prayer with four takbir why is it important because the Sunnah is that whenever a hundred man offered prayer a funeral prayer Allah would accept their intercession in him in the deceased even if they were forty Allah would accept their intercession and there are a number of hadiths stating that three rows is the minimum so even if you have seven people praying there should be two to three they'd should not pray in one row they should formulate three rows and this is the pseudonym and the Prophet told the salad salatu salam that if four people testified that this deceased was a good and righteous person allowed forgive his sins of course they would testify out of truth not out of lying otherwise if someone dies I would go to four people and pay the money and say testify that he's a good person this does not work like this the Prophet says Ali salatu salam as narrated by Omaha pubmed abusing him if for testified that he's good Allah would forgive his sins and accepts their intercession so the companion said even three and he said the profits three even to the Prophet said even two and that is why when a funeral was brought in front of the Prophet re salatu salam and the people complimented it this mashallah righteous person good guy may Allah have mercy on him the Prophet said Alice awesome it has been recorded or it is affirmative and when another funeral came and everybody started cursing and shouting and saying that this man is bad this man is evil hamdillah we rested from him and now we don't have to do anything with him the Prophet said it has been recorded or it has been affirmative so they asked the Prophet what is this he said you are the witnesses of Allah social on earth so those who you testify to be good allow it accept them and those whom you testify to be bad Allah who'd rejecter so it is very crucial that you have good relationship with everyone so that when you die people would say well we've lost a friend we've lost a brother we've lost a dear colleague may Allah forgive him may Allah have mercy on him now you check yourself when you die what will the people say and having do you love I thought you would never die now we can rest now we can breathe now we can become normal or would they would they feel sad and they would have a great loss in their lives everyone should always think about this how would my siblings feel about with my brothers and parents feel about me my neighbors it is very crucial so the Prophet took them to the masala he took them to the place where they pray there eat prayer why the scholars say that the majority of the prayers of the Prophet Alice of Salaam over the deceased people was out the prophetess m was did not used to pray funeral all the time in the Masjid he did that that maybe once or twice and that is why when Simon have you accost me Ella be pleased with him died I mean she may Allah be pleased with her said bring his funeral to my house and her house was adjacent to the masjid so they would bring the funeral inside the message that she would perform prayer and they the Companions complained they did not like this and she said to them subhanAllah how soon you guys forget wasn't it in the Masjid that the Prophet is salatu salam prayed funeral prayer over Solomon Alberto also Heidemann x dot which indicates that the prophet prayed in the message but his norm was a special place outside of the masjid where they used to offer funeral prayer in in this hadith scholars different in regards to whether it's permissible to pray funeral prayer over someone who's not there or not what's the nagashi there no he was in Abyssinia thousands of miles away will actually hundreds of miles away so is it permissible to pray funeral prayer over someone who died away or not scholars different some of them said yes it is permissible to pray funeral prayer on anyone who's not present it's called salat Aloha if the one who's absent and some scholars say it is not permissible at all and some scholars say it is permissible only on people who have benefited Islam on dignitary people scholars rulers who benefited Islam and had left a mark in benefiting Islam and the Muslims and this is what the humbly met have States for example if i hear of a great scholar of islam in india who had died we offer prayer in Saudi Arabia if a ruler dies whose Muslim and practicing and was supporting Islam we offer funeral prayer on him but this is not the authentic opinion of scholars why because so many dignitaries and important people at the time of the Prophet as salam died and he did not offer funeral prayer give an example such as those who died in battles for example when abu bakr died did the people in Syria and in Egypt and in Makkah itself pray funeral prayer know what about Omar Osman Ali none of the Muslims offered funeral prayer of the absent over them then what is the most authentic ruling the most authentic ruling is that it is permissible only to pray the absent funeral prayer when the deceased no one prayed funeral prayer over him or upon him so na ja she did not have any Muslims to offer funeral prayer in this case we can do that if I hear of someone of a Muslim and Italy or in any non-muslim country and I know that his locality his community they are not Muslim and they buried him even not in accordance to the Muslim traditions they buried him with the Christians do I offer funeral prayer yes because there were no others but if I know that my brother died in a different country and the Muslims they're washed him and they buried him in the offered prayer do I offer prayer in my locality and cities no this is not permissible and I was shocked to know that some sex pray funeral prayer every night before they go to bed every night in the room they offer funeral prayer when you ask them why are you doing this they say because maybe some died here in Zimbabwe or and Timbuktu so I would like to offer funeral prayer for anyone who died and this is an innovation this is something that is not permissible in Islam how to perform the funeral prayer this is inshallah what we will get to learn later on I think we have time only for one question Oh sound like you shake Santa can we offer funeral prayers of a person who faced an accident and we are not able to trace his body if a person faced an accident and he was severely damaged or he was burned or his body was torn into small pieces what to do the scholars say that we gather whatever possible and we perform funeral prayer over him if he was completely vanished and he this is hypothetical but maybe sometimes some types of fires would completely annihilate this person's body and turn it into dust or whatever or ashes and we cannot collect it then yes we offer his funeral prayer on whatever is left or on something that is not present but we do not leave any one of the Muslims unattended without any prayer this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
