  "transcript": "Kathir or cows are says can a person have any special status if they're buried in genital mirela or male or genital bethere why do we call genital mala and genital Bakir any reason behind this any speciality of these two cemeteries when compared to other cemeteries of course these two cemeteries one is in McCann one is in Medina and is there any reward for being buried there the answer is generally speaking no however all scholars say that being buried in a place where other righteous people are buried is a plus so sad them W itas Sayyidi means 8 may Allah be pleased with them and they're both one of the 10 heaven bound when they died in Allah pick which is outside outskirts of Medina close but it's not part of Medina itself they were buried in al Bakir they requested that their bodies are moved and buried in al Bakir rather than being in a locket outside of medina so scholars say that whenever a person is buried in a cemetery where there are righteous people then his chances of receiving dua from people passing by from righteous people coming to visit is far greater than if he was buried elsewhere and this is why Muslims cannot be buried in cemeteries of non-muslims just totally prohibited for a Muslim to be buried in a cemetery of non-muslims all Muslims must be buried in their own cemeteries non-muslims cannot buried cannot be buried with them and they cannot be buried with others it's something that has to be exclusive now having said that it is not permissible to travel from one city to the other in order to bury someone because there is a lot of hardship in it and it's not part of the Sunnah it's delaying the burial for no legitimate reason and a lot of the Muslims think that if they were to be buried in Medina or in Mecca that is of greater reward and this is not true the Prophet said in an authentic hadith it is awesome whoever is able to be buried or to beat let me rephrase that who's whoever is able to die in Medina he should do so now your death is not in your hand so how can I die in Medina this is an indication that living in Medina till you die is highly recommended and reward Obul so the dying process in Medina would get you the intercession of the Prophet Elias or Sanaa would get you highly rewarded for that but to die elsewhere and to fly you to Medina or to drive you to Medina to drive the deceased corpse to Medina this is not part of the Sunnah there's great hardship upon the family of the deceased and this there is no reward in it none what so ever that is mentioned in the Quran or in the Sunna so in a nutshell being buried there is not of great reward those scholars say that the more righteous people are around you the better it is for the person buried there if you are in Mecca itself and you select to be buried in al Maleh then this is ok no problem if you are Medina and you request that you are buried in Alberta then this is fine why is it called genital Allah oral bacteria I have no idea this is only found in the subcontinent the Arabs the Muslims here they have never mentioned any such a word with the graveyard or the with the cemetery like is mentioned here and allah azzawajal knows best"
