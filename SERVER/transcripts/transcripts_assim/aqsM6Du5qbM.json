  "transcript": "Hamza from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Umm Sheikh I've been getting these thoughts so it's like a really bad like I don't want to mention but it's a bad dua right so I've been getting thoughts like oh if you do this then you make a dua umm it's kind of like messing my attention with it like if you say this you make a dua that this will happen stuff like that so I was wondering is dua do you have to say it verbally and can you just say exactly what you want in a dua or can you like yeah that's basically my question I don't understand your question but if I may try to be a little bit ahead of your question if this is generated by your OCD and it's Satan messing up with your head telling you listen if you think about this coffee mug this means that your wife is divorced and this happens a lot with OCD patients so they try to block their heads from thinking about a coffee mug and then they fall weak and could not control themselves and think about it and use it and drink of it then they come weeping to me and say Sheikh I think I divorced my wife because of this no you did not this is again pathetic, stupid irrational childish you call it whatever you want not anything that Satan inserts in your head happens so if I look at this pen I'm going to fly ok I'm going to look at it am I going to fly of course not so these are intrusive thoughts generated by Shaitan only to depress you to intimidate you to make you fall in despair of Allah's mercy and the likes the simple remedy is to ignore and to block I can't Sheikh it's overwhelming well this is your problem this is something you have to deal with either you man up and draw the line and put a stop to it or keep on suffering till the rest of your life nobody is going to care so thinking about something in your mind telling you that oh if you think about something then the dua is going to happen or you're going to make dua or you have to make dua all of this is not applicable or logical just ignore it and don't even think about it and I hope I understood your question correctly"
