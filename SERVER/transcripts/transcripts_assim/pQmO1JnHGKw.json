  "transcript": "perfect with no flood other laws of Allah a way of life a way of life a way of life Islam he's away Vladimiro salatu salam ala rasoolillah hawala Ali Oh Simon brothers and sisters in Islam welcome to this episode wherein we continue the discussion on the domestic challenges which face these spouses and I believe it's time to provide solutions or shall we mention why are they problems first why are they problems what are the causes for the problems solarath matter him handling Salam Allahu Allahu Allah madad you know that we're coming from an Islamic background yes therefore as Muslims we believe that any calamity that befalls on a Muslim is due to his shortcomings well now Solomon will see but so whatever happens of a calamity that is because of your own doing and logical would forgive a lot cannily and Mohammed Amin Syrian said this may Allah have mercy on his soul he said that I commit a sin and I see the traces of my sin on the behavior of my wife which means that if you do something wrong if your sinful this would affect your marriage this would affect your job this would affect your life with directly or indirectly you may not know this but this is your own doing and that is why previously they were so righteous that they can count their sins from nowadays right left and center and we don't know which one of the so many sins that we've committed was all resulted in what we're facing now so I believe that if you want to have a happy life and he stopped doing sin yeah but is that a general rule that every time something bad happens it's because of his sin that takes us in a direction where we're saying that everything is like it's the fault of you it's either attached from it's an hour like 50-something you have done and for example in the Battle of Assad we know that the companions may allah be pleased with them disobeyed a direct order from the Prophet asam and came down from the mountain and hence this caused a great fatality in the army of the Muslims and Allah mentioned is in the Quran that what had happened those were martyred and those who were injured was due to the fault of you meaning as a whole but we can give so many examples of you know things that happen in the prophesy some it wasn't because of any sin and that's just a test from I think it's just an amazing topic that you've opened and I call was just commenting on this because yeah I think this really is to do with your internal state this is what it's all about right and let's just go back to the example right now there is this interaction between the husband and the wife but how do you react to your wife she said something or she does something or something happens in your house how do you react to it you know it may so to different people may react to the same incident in in totally different ways one your reaction may be positive what your wife may say may not annoy you may not upset you at all why because you are in a state of peace and tranquility within yourself but your sins what does your sin really do it actually disrupts you internally okay and so when your wife says something then you don't respond to it in a good way you take it in a bad way so I think the thing is here is that this is generally about calamities is a calamity can happen to somebody to two different people for one person it's a calamity and for another person it's an opportunity that person increases in righteousness increases in good deeds and it's something that actually brings them closer to Allah whereas the other person feels it as if this really is a punishment it's exactly the same thing happening to two different people so I think that the reality is is that it's how you respond and and that how you respond is conditional upon whether you're obeying Allah because in the previous episode we were saying that oh it's a communication issue and now here we're saying it's your sins that caused it so if the guy is sinless then there's gonna be no marital problem yeah may I humbly love salatu salam allah rasoolallah Elias every minute of every day attainment in I'm about I would like to add something we mentioned commenting on the previous episode about the communication okay so a sister should understand that her role actually at home is to make her home paradise on earth heaven on second that what a loss of how to Alice eight second the man needs that place to find that tranquility and peace and a man needs sometimes to be by himself give him that okay you come you want to be by alone by yourself you have problems you need to think about them and she doesn't give you that chance this is sorry but just very briefly for the sisters to understand men this is how men deal with things generally they sit and they try and figure out the problems themselves and when they want some help they're gonna go and ask someone right but whereas women tend to share their problems and communicate their problem so I just want to say so we need to understand it's the nature of the man so if your husband wants to be himself leave him give him that a cake and even when you want to to help him seek the right moment be smart when you should know when to talk to him is in the mood or not now you are not in the mood you have problems she said oh yeah I am your partner tell me everything come on leave me alone okay I want to yes this is the reality I want to thing okay when I need your help I will let you know okay so and we also we seek advice from each other because the professore asylum is our example and he sought a Musa Lamas opinion and piece of advice and he acted upon that so this is very important that is and then let's flip in our allegis right because then the the woman if we're saying that she to communicate then then he needs to listen to her and yes yes and the time were you that we mentioned before the problem would sit with his wives after Asia listening and you have to be attentive and listen to her let her talk but we should know that we cannot make a man a woman or a woman a man everyone has his own different personality this how Allah subhana Allah created us regarding covered the medical problems that took place in the prophets house is its list because of the sins no but Allah is teaching us in the person of the prophet or a seller because he is the role model he is the example to Allah is telling us see if this is my prophet and he had these problems who are you so this is natural that it is going to happen in your house so Allah is teaching the whole Ummah in the person of the pops masala for example he makes his prophet to forget in the Salah to teach us how to behave when we commit such a thing so the Prophet Allah Salem is an example to follow that's why every one of us has a secret things in his life but there's nothing secret in the life of the Prophet you know everything about but truthfully now that answers that issue but one can easily turn around and say okay fine then the prophets who suffered a you body is Salam and know and and we don't have we don't necessarily have that very lesson we know the Sunnah was not you know preserved like the Sunnah of the Prophet Elias Robson isn't it that the scholars have actually addressed this issue by saying that yes the calamities before people and when they before people there are various reasons we are not attacking from that perspective but that is that's they seem to have the big an issue when it comes the why Allah test the people okay to test the people to elevate the status or to expiate their sins or but now Allah is teaching the Ummah in the person of the problem assalam Lapid Canela come fearless will relay the sweatin husana because he is the example so Allah Allah made everything to happen in the life of the Prophet Allah so that when I studied the life of the props wasallam and I deduce lessons we see this how this happened in the life of the Prophet Allah and this how the remedy this how he behaved this is this this is that I believe that when I make or I face a calamity and I attribute this to my sense that it is positive for me yes because it makes me revise my life and try to get rid of my shortcomings so I don't you know make fun of someone who had a calamity hahaha Allah so jealous punishing you for this this is not for me and if a tsunami takes place in X Y Z I would say that this is a test from Allah Allah but I wouldn't say that this is a large the origin is punishing them this there might be some of them being punished some of them being tested some of them Allah surgeon is blessing them with this calamity so that it would erase their sins or innovate they say this in paradise those who drown and this martyrdom for the market yes so we have to take a short break in sha allah and we will pick up right afterwards we'll be right back don't go anywhere Saira Malik Oh welcome back so among the reasons or among the reasons why there are problems is perfectionist or people really trying to create they trying they wish they could customize the spouse like you would do for a car or for a garment and the truthfully this is impossible because they were already created by Allah the way they are is that one of the reasons and if so how do we get over that obstacle very big mistake people make in marriage I mean actually this sort of goes back to the previous we didn't even mention this you know I'm gonna marry someone who's like that but you know what I'll shape them the way I want I'll make that person the way I want to make them it's a big mistake you know and I think this is a very important point I mean specifically the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam for example mentioned about women you know that she's made from the bent ribbon the most been part of the rib is the top part so don't try to straighten her because straightening her will be divorce so enjoy her the way she is and so this attempt to try and check with the wife trying to change the husband or the husband trying to change the wife and we're talking about some essential characteristics we're not talking about here a sin and you're trying to get your spouse to stop sinning of course you have led you clarified that yeah but there's some basic characteristics a person has don't think you can mold a person and I think that's a big mistake in marriages that I want this person like this and that can lead to some very big problems it often happens one like the wife may be sensitive and then the husband says something and she starts crying and I said stop crying this stock right now and then she cries more and it just doesn't works like you just want her to instantly you know act accordingly but it's her nature that at this time she wants to cry and men sometimes you feelin and recognizing that no the reason she cries she carries on crimes because you don't understand her yes because he expecting you to come okay yeah it's very essential really let's have a it is just like a childhood she needs that just try it when it happens and you'll see things would cool down subhanAllah and yeah one of the Michelle said he see he said don't believe your wife when she tells you if you are a man divorce me I don't want to live with you any any more you know what he wants to say love me more mmm what a funky way to say it yeah love me more he doesn't mean it he doesn't mean it I pop the shaitaan would not leave you alone oh come on being man don't see you don't have any manhood what I tell people like she's challenging you see or leave the house and he will be maybe chasing you come back or coward see yes I am coward okay okay bye Oh two things cool down okay come back Saira Malik oh I'm sorry that's what happened Fatima Fatima love the allahu on her Magali upset ali abdullah on who he left the house he went to the Masjid he slept in the messy plate to the Kazan slap the top salah salem kick Abu Turab Fatima what is Holi they left the house and he was angry so she made him meet Ali of the law and her angry the plop salah salem went to the Masjid finds in Dallas leaving the calf of shell down his cheek was and the dust did a father of dust get up Holly of the Alana went back thanks cool down so we it's a matter of understanding and so when she is crying until has stopped crying the reason you are saying stop crying because it hurts you can you feel inside you the poor girl is so you want her to that's why if we smack your child and your child is it's kinda see okay hold it stop because you feel the guilt inside you if if the pain okay so that is very to go back to the issue of you know seeking perfection it's a disease no it's not it's not a disease the illness is in wanting things to be not on their nature for example you marry a woman and you don't want her to feel jealous this is illogical it is something built in she's programmed to be jealous and it's a positive thing what's not positive is if she acts upon it and burns your second and wife's house then you have a problem this is an illness and let me go back and reflect on what share brahim said now when you get married you have to accept your spouse as they are you have to unconditionally love them for who they are now there are small things here and there that you may change your request that it would be modified and edit a bit in you and in them my problem is when people do not live every moment for its own value sometimes Satan comes and they make them fall back and look at the past and they expect people not to change so I would reflect on my 30 years of marriage for example and I wasn't think my wife was like this and that now she's changed and I neglect the good attributes that were perfected and I only focused on the things that she picked up during the journey which may not be that good but I neglect the good side and this is one of the biggest issues the Prophet said this is awesome he said lay off rook McMillan what Mena a man should not scrutinize and you know look for the shortcomings of another believing woman if he likes something or if he opposed if he abhors or dislike something he will like so many other things mm-hmm again be negative yes so living at the present he any have appreciation to what you have and don't look back because if you look at for example how she looks like 30 years ago you're not looking how she used to cook 30 years ago now she is mashallah a professional cook so you have to weigh things better it sounds like we're always coming from the man's perspective it's always like what does the man get what is the manner I think a lot of husbands are like Tabon they're just like they're lazy in the house they want to be served they're watching TV they want their wife to be like this or whatnot and you find a lot of men are not stepping up to be a man maybe a lot of solutions will be if this person you know figures out how to be a man you know things kind of happen we're almost like making it like the woman it's all her job to make sure the marriage goes good by serving and giving him this time and cooking for him and looking good and the woman has the same problem see she always sits back and reflects all my husband used to take out he used to do this he used to do that now she does not reflect on his minimum wage he used to charge and not buying her things now he's buying her necklaces gold diamonds he's taking her instead of the restaurants once a week as he used to he's doing that once a year but to a resort for example for a week or two with the kids or taking her for ombres so the wives but she doesn't want that she just want to go to resort that's for him the profit that is so sam said that they are ungrateful unfortunately so this is a feature that females can't stand out in the crowd with but men there are I have to agree there are so many men my wife always tells me this is she says you guys are lucky the Prophet says that we are ungrateful and that's why we some of us would be in hell but you guys the Prophet did not do this to you yet you are just all so ungrateful an essay by Allah we men are ungrateful yet the responsibility is on us reduces this ungratefulness while the responsibility upon you makes this as a priority that you should be grateful for so I know where you're coming from and I definitely agree with you that the sisters have the right to reciprocate but not yeah and you know the in the other episode where you're saying that companion that his hairs going wild and he's this in that just I was talking about and then when he went and fixed himself up you know probably he just took a shower mmm that's it he just took a shower and she's like he's the best like sometimes it's that simple for the men and I actually if men put in a little effort they might actually find the marriages a lot better true with we did shower and comb their hair I agree but I think if there's another thing I want to point out specifically about what the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam mentioned about the ingratitude of women but this can go any way whether the man is like this or the woman is like this it's not just ingratitude it's it's a specific way of being ungrateful he does one thing wrong and then she treats him as if he never did and it says again this is the what I'm saying and this is you know this is more than just ingratitude this is a volumn this is a really a nasty oppression on someone because yeah you can say you know yeah you didn't do this and you didn't do that but to treat the person like you never did anything good you know your life in your life and I mean the husband can do this as well but it tends to be a little bit more the other way we can know that from the hadith so it's specific type of and I think anyway generally just to mention that we should develop a gratitude attitude we you know it's very important I mean I do this in my family we sit down not regularly but we sit down even the kids we all sit down and we just think about something you know we're grateful for we keep a little diary you know and everyone in goes around the room and we say okay what are we gratefully to Allah for for this week or for this day you know when we think about it what would life have been like if we didn't have this thing and you know there's no reason why the husband and the wife couldn't just sit down and just talk about why I'm grateful that you're my husband and why I'm grateful that I'm your wife you know we we you can do things like that there's nothing wrong and it emotionally in increases the love between the husband and the wife and and our love for Allah subhanAllah this is what Allah reminds us when you say well yeah c'mon could Limassol to move into now Allah Allah has given you from his bounties which they are innumerable you can't call them you can't and if you try you cannot so the blessings of Allah Allah has overwhelmed you with his blessings so we have to be grateful otherwise Allah Allah will take away this blessing if you don't thank him no will remove deprive you of such blessing so you have if you want to maintain and protect unless blessing by you should thank Allah subhana Allah constantly always always you should thank Allah subhana WA Ta'ala well regarding be idealistic the stories we mentioned of Satan or Omar is an example we should keep always seen Omar he made the comparison if he gets upset now what is not a big deal but see what he is doing for me perhaps we can conclude the episode just to be fair and balance things out that the Prophet Elias and I did say hi o come ye o come ye Ali I know how you do completely the best amongst you - the men are the best to their wives and I am the best to my wife so so that the sisters would not feel that it's all them the man is expected to actually be the best to his family and you ask a lot to enable all the men to act according to the hadith and the sisters to be you know concerned and and worried about the narrations which address them in particular and we will not end this yet inshallah we will be having another episode dealing with other aspects of marriage being Allah jacquimo la cara for tuning in and Sarah Mary coming from saliva records we"
