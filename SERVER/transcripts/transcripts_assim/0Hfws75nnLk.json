  "transcript": "my brother has no savings in bank has no gold and unable to pay the house rent can I pay him zakat and do I have to worry about which category needy or that he has some debt that maybe I can pay the money for this is a lengthy question that requires a detailed answer but I'll give it to you in a nutshell if your brother is classified as poor or needy how would I know the difference between poor and needy poor person who does not have what is sufficient so he has lunch but he cannot afford dinner a poor person is someone who is stoned broker doesn't have money at all at the end of the month he receives his salary but in the middle of the month the salad is gone so the remaining two weeks he has to beg or borrow or do this this is poor . this guy deserves to receive zakat money a needy person who is a bit more well-off so yes I have my salary and yes I don't need money at the end of the month because my salary is sufficient however I don't have enough money to pay for my medication I'm a high blood pressure patient have high cholesterol levels I'm diabetic and I don't have money to buy the medication or my wife is undergoing chemotherapy or my children need money to go to school but I can't afford to buy shoes and clothes and books for them but I have a salary that suffices me for the end of the month to pay rent electricity bill and food that's it this person is not poor but easy needy he needs something to fulfill an honorable life so you can give him from zakat as well you"
