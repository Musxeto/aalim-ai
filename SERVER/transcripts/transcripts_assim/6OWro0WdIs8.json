  "title": "Imam goes into Ruku too fast & I'm unable to finish Fateha, what to do? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "our issue is with the silent raka if I joined the Imam in this raka from the beginning and he made Recor before I finished my raka this means there is one of two either he is too fast or I'm too slow if he's too fast this means that the whole congregation will complain and say okay I could not read my Fatiha the Imam was too fast in this case you guys have to go and speak to the Imam and if needed you have to change the Imam because his prayer is invalid he cannot recite it this quick well the hook of the congregation are suffering but this can't affect your prayer meaning if he goes to rock or you recite your fatiha as quick as possible even if he raises his head from the rock or you go and make rock or afterwards and catch up with him because there is no fault on you but if you were too slow then then we have a problem and if you too slow this rock on which the Imam made record and raised his head from record before you catch up with them is invalid and this is your problem you have to work on reciting it quickly now this is in the scenario where you and the Imam began reciting the Fathead together"
