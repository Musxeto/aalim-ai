  "transcript": "Sheikh, you told me before that I cannot give Kaf Paratal Yameen to people with income, so can I give this to beggars, even if they are professional beggars? And is it only to be given to adults, or can it be given to children as well? JazakAllahu Khairan. Wa Jazakum. I did not hear your first part of the question. You must give your broken oath expiations to Muslims who are poor or needy."
