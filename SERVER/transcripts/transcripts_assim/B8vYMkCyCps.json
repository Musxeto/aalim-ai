  "transcript": "my question is if someone has a tumor and if he doesn't undergo an operation he may die but he is too embarrassed to do so because it's in the private part is obligated for him to take medical help if this is certain and that would be a cause of death definitely he would be sinful we've said this before that seeking Medical help and healing to cure an illness can be 80 percent successful 20 percent not in this case a person is obliged to seek medical attention because it is almost certain that he will be cured and not doing this would throw himself In Harm's Way and if The Cure is not possible and a minute percentage so they say okay the operation is 10 success wow and 90 failure in this case don't go for it or don't take the medicine because the percentage is very low depend on broker depend on Dua and whatever Allah brings is good and it's 50 50 it's up to your preference whether to take it or not whether to undergo the operation or not and it's a difference of opinion among Scholars which is better as for your case or for the question you're asking about the tumor if the doctors say that yes this is a normal procedure and if we remove it with the grace of Allah azzawajal the success rate is 80 90 maybe 100 percent then it is a must for you to undergo such a procedure Knows Best foreign"
