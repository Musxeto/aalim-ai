  "title": "Dua to recite for a 2 year old child who does not listen or behave - Anger towards children",
  "transcript": "Safa says please suggest to me dua that i can recite as my two-year-old is very ill-mannered in hyperactive does not listen at all i know it's the age but it gets difficult I feel like crying as he troubles a lot well suffer the course of actions you have is one of two either to continuously reprimand hit beat torture your two-year-old child in order for him to stop and in order for you to vent this pressure you're having and definitely this course of action is out of the question it is filled with negativity and there is nothing positive in it it's temporary maybe the child would stop now but in five minutes he would do it more and more and more or you may deal with the child with love compassion but with discipline at the same time beating the children at this age is not at all recommended they would not understand they'd feel the pain yet all what they can see associated with this pain is feeling ill feelings and hatred so they don't see the love coming out of you when you discipline them through beating them or through pinching them and trying to harm them so you have to first of all understand this is a test from Allah this is their age yes you can discipline them with love with conviction while hugging them while kissing them while giving them things that they enjoy not necessarily candy because this destroys the children and increases their hyperness when you give them sugar giving them a lot of candies and ice cream this causes them to be a little bit hyper but at the same time it destroys their teeth growth the cavities and so many impact on their physical growth as we know sugar is very bad for you so you have to measure the angle you should deal with such a child sometimes discipling them by not taking them places though two years is too young to understand that ok I'm not taking you to Grandma's house because this and that is a child the norm of a 2 years old is to jump over the sofas to grab things to break things to play with the TV set and maybe make it fall on him when therefore they're a little bit more intellectual more knowledgeable that they can hang over the chandeliers and jump from one curtain to the other this is their time this is how they are brought up but this doesn't stop you from trying to inject some order and discipline to them through communication through giving them instruction but without shouting without beating when the child is grown in an environment of complete total and continuous screaming and and torture and beating this is very negative this is how he will be brought up and this is the only way of communication with his peers with other children with other people that he had learned but it when it is with compassion and love and a lot and a lot and a lot of du'a then inshallah there will be positive impact"
