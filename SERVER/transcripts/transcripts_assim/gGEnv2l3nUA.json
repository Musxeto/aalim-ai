  "transcript": "so my question is about the past of YF so do I need to fast them consecutively I was I have broken some Oaths which I was not aware that I have to fast it is like 3 or 4 and I started fasting but I got a little tired so I searched in Islam q and they say that it doesn't have to be consecutive and if not then uh in what period of time is there a period of time like before next Ramadan should I fast it or can I fast it as long as I live zad in Islam Q&A did they say that you can fast or you should first pay the feeding or clothing or the uh sacrifice is this said but I am uh broke and I I am a student and living under my par alhamdulillah I just wanted to make sure that you've understood it correctly so the answer is like Islam Q&A had told you that the most authentic opinion is that fasting the three days for those who are financially unable to feed or clothe 10 poor Muslims or to uh slaughter a sheep or to uh free a slave the experation is to fast three days preferably consecutively but if not there's no no problem in dividing it how far or how long is this period of time there isn't anything prescribed because this is a debt on you if you die today you'll be sinful for not doing it so you have to do it as soon as possible so that you get it off your chest and Allah Knows Best"
