  "transcript": "well this is not an easy thing to do or to know of because the minute you feel that Allah is happy with you this might be a call from Satan to make you calm down and cool down and not be as enthusiastic as you were before there isn't anything that shows you clearly that Allah is happy with you or not if Allah gives you â‚¬50,000 as a gift this does not mean that Allah is happy with you because we see the disbelievers richer than us and more healthier and if Allah deprives you from a job for 2 years this does not mean Allah is not happy with you because we seen we have seen how uh uh I think his name is job a peace be upon him was in a Calamity for 17 years with Leprosy with diseases with illnesses he lost his kids he lost his wealth for 17 years and he was a prophet of Allah so definitely this is not a sign of Allah not being pleased with him so it's all a test you should not listen to Satan when he says that Allah is happy with you or he's not happy with you what you should do is you should feel the fear in your heart that Allah might not be happy with you and you should not look at your good deeds by saying that I did a lot of good deeds this year this entitles me to do something wrong you know a major sin or a couple of major sins no this is not the case you should do as as many good de as you can and stay away from all the sins that you can and have the fear in your heart that there is a possibility that Allah may not accept what I have done and you make this your lifestyle so when you die you've done your best and definitely Allah will not make all of this in vain Allah would reward you for what you have done some Scholars say that if Allah makes easy for you to do forms of worship one after the other this means that Allah have that Allah has accepted the first form of worship and that is why he is making it easy for another and a third and a fourth likewise if you make a sin and then you find that sins are coming afterwards and they're becoming easy you should know that Allah is not pleased with you and that is why he's not guiding you and he's making sin easy for you and you are taking it and accepting it because Allah is not pleased with you and Allah Knows Best"
