So and I really hate this option because cartoon channels as you are aware Of you know filled with music and other literal garbage And so I just wanted to know what are the options that we have? What can we do regarding this because my daughter she's only seven and a half months old and but she's already Hooked into this these shows Okay What is that? Grant your daughter to grow up According to what pleases Allah Azza Wa Jal. It's a huge and grave mistake For you and your wife to Get your daughter addicted to such Shows from an early age seven and month half seven and a half months old What is this? This is preposterous Akhi Take the TV set and throw it out of the house. She'll cry for a few days and she'll get acquainted with Not having one in the house, but if she grows Watching it at this early age when she's two She would like to watch more and more when she's five She would like to watch More and more when she's 10 she starts developing a taste for anime for Korean pop culture for this and that when she's 14, she's looking for pg movies And animated would not do she wants action. She wants violence. She wants nudity You brought all this up. I brought all of my Children alhamdulillah without having a tv set in home And with the grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal 12 of them memorized the full Quran by heart Before they graduated from high school With I didn't put any effort in that with the grace of Allah Some of them teach in universities. Some of them are headmasters of international schools. Some of them are entrepreneurs And doing well in business This has nothing to do with bringing it has to do with the parents Who just don't want to cater for the kids? So they just throw them to the tv set Or give them a tablet and let them watch whatever they want on youtube. This is throwing them in fire So you have to definitely put an end to this and may Allah protect all our children"
