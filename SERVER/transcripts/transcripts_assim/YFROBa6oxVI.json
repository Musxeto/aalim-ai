  "title": "Can I delay my Sunnah Prayer or must I pray it immediately after the fard? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Okay, we have Daffy from Indonesia. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh Muallah Ghani and your family, Jannatul Firdaus. Ameen. And you as well. Barakallah Fika. So, the thing is, I really want to pray Baqdia after every Fardu prayer. Then, I'm also really busy with stuff like school. So, my question is, should I pray Baqdia immediately after the Fardu prayer or can I delay it until the end of the prayer time? JazakAllah. Wa Jazakum. The time of Sunnah prayer is limited to the time of the actual Salat. Not necessarily that it must be prayed immediately afterwards. So, if I pray Dhuhr prayer and I have four Rak'ahs to pray before and I have two Rak'ahs to pray after. So, I pray the four Rak'ahs before, I pray the Fard. Then, the two Rak'ahs after, I can pray it after the Fard. And I can delay it one hour, two hours before the time of Asr. So, before the Adhan of Asr, this is all time of Dhuhr. I have the option to delay my Sunnah prayer till the time is over. And therefore, there is no problem InshaAllah in doing that due to school, due to meetings, due to any reason. And Allah Azawajal knows best."
