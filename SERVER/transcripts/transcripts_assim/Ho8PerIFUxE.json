  "transcript": "Oh these TV the solution for Humanity a person is going to follow the way of his friend so you have to be clear the most important thing in raising our kids is not following our opinions or other penis one of the qualities you have to look in the man that he will look after you and the girl has to pay this is exactly what happens this is a manly and he needs to have families with religious commitment is that a lot of the Muslims nowadays doing this is a mother she goes there the authentic and in order to take cover will you type it in Oh Oh well hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen Ocelot was salaam irises karim while Eddie was happy momentive es una to vallejo median assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh welcome again to another episode I'm your hostess smile book and I have again with me today she loved her he McCarthy she has Salman Al Murray and last but not least the customer Hakim we ended on the last a previous episode talking about the messengers so I believe she'll have the rehema kept silent have a bit more to talk about the messages before we move on to the next pillar as we mentioned you know the viewer comes in you're not going to get an intensive course in this episode about our belief basically explained the hadith of debris of the pillars of Islam in the pillars have Iman pillars of faith go into detail were just mentioning and some basic information and to remind ourselves as Muslims or we believe intermarry mind then non-muslim viewers of what we believe as Muslims so we're not going to cover everything just some of the things but I believe that it's very important that we point out something here and that is that all of the messengers all of the prophets they came with the same message they came with the same message well Lapid Batna the hooligan matin rosula enabled a law which then evil power would that we have sent to every nation my messenger to worship Allah as one and to stay away from above would which is anything which is worship as falsehood we need to stay away from all the messages called to this or we see this all to the poor on and even as you mentioned and the red letter bible if you were to go back to it and look through it you would see i was this was the message of jesus christ himself at a celeb so this is the message and it goes back to the first pillar and reminds the foundation of all the regions it is Joey to believe in Allah is one and worship Him and not join any partners with him and obviously the basic system of belief of all the messengers it's all one perhaps their laws the Sharia it was a little bit different from here and there but the basic foundation of all of the region's it was all one and that's why a lot of Christians when they sit with us and we talked and obviously brothers Meyer who works industry where he meets with a lot of different countries they always ask you questions about Islam and when you tell them so that's very similar to Christianity because the basic message of Jesus and they said to set up also was the same message of Muhammad Ali salatu salam the same message as musa ibrahim abraham de david always the same as that is why they're all called Islam they're all Muslims verily the religion at the side of Allah is Islam this is the submission to Allah surgeon you have mentioned here very good point that they were tell you her this is like Christianity no wonder because all of them they came from the same source that's why there's only one religion which is al-islam submitting to the will of god and all profits our nursing that they were Muslims so that's why some of the fallacies or arguments of the missionaries a Muhammad copied from the Bible because this study is measured the Bible say no and they only differ in the lowes because the law will address the issues of that particular moment of time and that's why I find the law the last law of the Islamic sharia it is so flexible and it accommodates all these changes and pays all these challenges and provide solutions but all the messengers they came with the same message calling the people to worship Allah and Allah alone without associating and importunate a loss of Hannah Tyler tells us where Allah i dinna hamuda allez-vous muirwood elohim a local manila navel into the people of odd this among the perished nations who happen to be in the southern part of arabia so a las fronteras saying and to add we have sent their brother food proclaiming calling them to what our guru la so to worship Allah and Allah alone y ella SE muda aha home sorry ha Carl a comer voodoo laja melaku manila him later all of them they are saying this to the people of the mood the brother Salih calling them a good hola you have no other Ilah you have no other God except Allah Subhan Allah to worship well i'ma Deanna a harem schreiber the same message again Allah call me rude allaha manicou manila handrail and into the people of madyan the same thing tribe is telling them a radula worship Allah you have no other deity to worship as the message of all the messengers is calling the people to worship to single Allah subhana Allah with respect to the acts they act worship no one but Allah and Allah without associating a new partner not calling them to believe that God is one no because that is by default it is there in the nature of human beings I believe that this is any covers it all regarding the messengers and prophets because if we would like to list them and say what happened with them and their people and the punishment and the books that would take a search for each prophet really so if you allow me to move on to the fifth pillar which is the belief in the day of judgment the hereafter the last day and this belief is common between us Muslims and the other religions like in Judaism and Christianity and other religions and it is the driver to doing good and same way from evil because if I did not believe in being resurrected and held accountable for what i do man I wouldn't be here if I did not believe I would not be here because I would have been out there doing everything that crosses my mind because this is a one-shot life I have to live so I'm going to make the best of it I'm gonna do evil things older evil thoughts in my mind I'm going to execute them and enjoy life to the fullest because this is my only shot Muslims believe that everything you do you'll be held accountable for you'll be questioned about and all the good deeds you do you'll be credited and rewarded for that is why they're self-conscious they're always aware that whatever they do they're gonna be accountability that's why they don't do bad and evil things what prevents me from taking your wallet size wise I'm bigger than you so I think I can manage what prevents me from stealing a car or from killing someone or from fornicating or from getting wasted with drugs or whatever what prevents me from doing this is the fact that there are angels writing every single thing and they'll ask me and question me about every single thing and this is the general concept of the day of judgment now we did not go into details of the resurrection of the gathering of the people of the major intercession of the hell and the fire because this is all falls under the belief in resurrection and these are bullet points we can't go through in detail something that the  hasn't mentioned is very important talk about an ever it on a little bit which is the learning why I'm us to leave these things I think that's very important because we enjoy life and I wanted as Muslims we had we enjoy life we have fun but we have certain boundary we won't go across these boundaries to doing other thing like kannamma so say I want to enjoy as much as I can I want to be with as many women as I can I want to get any party as much as I can cuz this is opportunity and he doesn't mean a Muslim wouldn't like to do those things he's a human being at the other day so for example when you read a story about an athlete with a thousand women Eddie who wouldn't like to be with a thousand women I wouldn't matter this too much most people would anyways the thing is now you're leaving it for something greater Yuri man in the hereafter and the pleasures you will find in the paradise so you're leaving it for that you're leaving something to gain something in the future and this is like what he mentioned the beginning it's what drives the Muslim the hereafter and why doesn't a Muslim do a lot of things it's because of that it's because of the issue of the hell fire or the paradise and that's a big difference you see between for example Christianity where they believe that Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior that he died for their sins and that's why you'll find very common when you find a good pious practicing Christian who spent most of his life in the church and a service of the church when he dies they say he's in a better place now and when the guy from the Mafia dies who was also a Christian but just happened to be in the Mafia he's also in a better place now why because that belief is going to have all his sins taken formulas it's like no big deal at the end that's why you'll find there's no boundaries when it comes to head and how long you'll see them in the night club getting drunk fornicating with their big cross on because it's a free pass whereas the Muslim realizes now I say the Muslims don't fall into sin but we still have is something we can be proud of as Muslims we must be proud of the inner society even though there is mischief there is since it hasn't reached to the level that the Western society or non-muslim sighs have reached where they've just everything is open with no limits whatsoever and what actually I mean prevents a person from committing some shameful deeds is this the belief because you see you believe that allows watching me angels are writing my deeds no one is around you but you know allah is watching you this in itself prevents you from committing whatever displays in the Lord and that's why the divine law the law of the Creator is the law that will bring peace and prevent crime so wherever the divine law is implemented you'd find the rate of crimes is less security is prevalent whereas man-made law doesn't stop the crime the prisons are full of criminals because the criminal knows if I am NOT caught red-handed that's it so there's nothing inside prevents him from committing such crime so if I can go and find a way how to escape from being caught red-handed that's it man-made law is full of loopholes even you are caught red-handed those what you call them lawyers because they know these loopholes they know how to to manipulate and bring her out the belief in this beautiful pillar the day of judgement of the hereafter is so vast and huge and I encourage Muslims to go through it from the very beginning of English directed to the great and huge gathering of all the humans at one Plaza anticipating when a larger would judge them to the intercession of the Prophet aerosol of Saddam after they went to all the messengers and prophets and they have dodged it until it reached the prophet who intercedes re salatu salam till the mentioning of the Sirat the tuning of the bridge the men sharing of the cantera the mentioning of the pool of the Prophet s-salam where people drink from that all of these in the description of Jannah and the description of hellfire all of this falls under the belief of the day of judgment which leads us the sixth pillar which is an extremely important pillar of belief sahasam just before you will go to the cut off the belief in the last day which is very essential for a person here who believes him there is a life coming death is not the end of it there is a day where where every human being will be held accountable for all his deeds that he did during his life here and based on that that is where you receive your certificate on that day whether you pass the test or failing the test so that is the most important thing that there is an another life and that is the real life you have to work for this is transient this is test that's why prophet mohamed salah salem said at dunya gen natural cafe original movement this dunya this world is a prison prison for the believer and it is the paradise for the non-believer why it is a prison it is a prison because you cannot do whatever you like a prisoner in his cell his movement is limited so similarly your nuts wants to see this woman you want to see this movie no it is haram but the real life is the next life you have been repay him beautifully he said he said there are two prisms you have to enter one of them there is no other choice you have to enter one of them either the prison in the dunya and you will be released on the day of resurrection and you enter the Jenna or if you want to lead a free life in this world then you will enter that prison which is the hell fire so they believe in the next life actually giving the moment the believer this motivation to keep doing righteous deeds this moves us to the last pillar of a man which is the belief in the divine decree whether good or bad le monde ob-la-da Kyrie he washer drinking and this is something that all Muslims believe and a lot of the non-muslims may find this difficult but they believe if they would know Allah as origin as Muslims we believe that Allah ZOA gel has written down what is going to happen till the day of judgement from the very beginning and in the hadith a prophet or less awesome said when Allah created the pen ally instructed the pen to write and the pen said what should I write and a lot i told the pen to write everything that is going to happen until the day of judgment the Prophet told us about the timing of this writing he said and that was fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation imagine that so our discussion now has been written down and everything has been written down in the preserved tablet that no one knows what's happening or what's going to happen except Allah in it it is written down when we will be born and die it's written in it that I'm going to do this and if I did not do this what would happen everything is written down my marriage my children my dad my illness my job my career my wealth my poverty my health my sickness and this is what makes a true Muslim a real believer because if I'm driving down the road and I'm putting my seat belt and I'm abiding by the speed limit and I have a crash I have an accident what would any normal person do get out of the car start a fight you didn't see you didn't do a true believer what would he do this is something that was the heat long long time ago so I did my best and Allah decreed this upon me what would I do I accept it hamdillah this doesn't mean that i should not sue the man i should not take him to court he should not fix my car but it shows you the content my child falls sick I am sad but I'm content because Allah decreed it upon me long long time ago and this by itself has a number of pillars the belief of in a las decree a number of pillars and to talk about them it would take ages but in a nutshell as a bullet point you have to know that illogical knows everything and you have to know that Allah social wills everything that is happening and that allah azzawajal has written down everything that is happening and finally the fourth pillar which is that allah azzawajal has created every single thing that we do so never think that if i go to the message it is by my own will alone no i am doing what illogical commanded me but it is a large well that preceded that and he subhana allah has helped me to do that I want to point out something here and that's important as Muslims we realize that true everything has been written down and everything has been decreed and this confuses a lot of people because the law has given us as human beings the three will free will to do what you want well hey Dana hoon na no soma thought I showed us the right path and the wrong path and then we take the choice to take that path however law knows and that's what the meaning of the image which one you're going to take and we don't want this to confuse other people as well to say then why work this is one of the traps of Satan where he makes the people fall into this where they don't act upon this number to sell already chosen for me this Allah has told you which path to take he's told you what to do with it is a victim number he says so it's already been he's take this pad do this don't do that so you're being tested just like give an example of the dunya when you're going in to take an exam if you want to get an A you have to work hard to get it at the end you don't know what's really going to happen you're going to study and you're gonna work and you're hoping gonna get the eight but you don't nobody would say this and then on religious affairs saying it's already written what I'm going to get from I going to A&F for DRC so why study i'll just chill out with my friends and hang out tomorrow i'll go take the test somebody wouldn't do that but unfortunately something when it comes to ridges they'll say it's already been written so why work so won't let Shaitaan fullest we're being tested in this dunya but one of the beautiful things about this cutter this belief in the divine decree how it helps some muslim deal with his life now there has been some changes in the Muslim community throughout the world because of the effect of the movies they watch and the effect there brings like you see on the Hollywood movies and something happens they look up to the sky why me why are you doing this to me how they build up looking like this you might find some Muslims who could affect I Z bosons Ryan this on Facebook of Lucia Lena it's still something not as much in the Muslim community because in general you see their Muslim noses from the color of a lawsuit pan without it's from a loss differently the ones that i have seen happen to be Muslims who brought up in the west so they have that kind of even I've seen it in Muslim countries as well but it's not as much yeah it as much and in general you'll find any that the Muslims hamdulillah so something once again to be proud of is that we it helps you deal with the daily pressures we have some countries around the world we just realized recently after the sum of the revolutions that how rich we really are as Muslims you know we knew we had some countries that rich well you know all the country I Richard but they were just the money was getting stolen from them but these people who live in these poor countries poverty you'll find that inside their happy inside their living a good life they can joke about life then you don't see a high suicide rates and the Muslim countries why because they realize whatever is happening is the decree of allah subhan allah tala and that the reality of this life is they're here to be tested to see what's happening to take essentially the point because many people they try to delve into this cutter issues they try to say but how when they really try you explain to them they try and go more and maybe one of you can correct me if i'm wrong i think it was even a bus he gave an example of which saying that when you delve into Hutter it's a something along these lines it's like being in a dark corner of a dark alley on a dark street on a dark night meaning you know how dangerous that would be if you in a corner of an alley in a completely dark alley and a dark street and a dark night it's very dangerous very dangerous and deadly and what have you so he was comparing this over unnecessary delving into the cuddlin and i would advise the people whenever Shaitaan comes to them because this is a great gate for Sherlock to cast his doubts to them I advise them first of all before you complain or you try to justify things with you on logic you have to believe that unless knowledge is lot like ours people say I think what if Allah knows that I'm going to do this why did he stop me Subhan Allah you're not treating your peer unless urgent is your owner is your Creator in the sense that if Allah wills did and he takes all of us and puts us in hell the righteous and the sinners no one would claim that to say yeah this is not fair we are a las possession he creates us he annihilates us it's up to him but you have to add to that that though Allah knows and his knowledge is not alike us Allah is fair and just so whenever you see something is yucky but why it seems to me unfair you have to believe that this is unless ruling and Allah is never unjust to you whatever Allah does there is the Supreme justice and fairness in it and whenever someone claims that this is cutter granny I'm not gonna do why did you steal well Allah willed it why did you not pray Allah did not allow me to do it those who claim to justify their actions by Qatar we tell I usually do this I tell them I go to a high riser and throw yourself from the top roof and if Allah wills it you will land on your feet so yeah are you crazy I'm not gonna do this are you crazy ass game when you knew the other affairs of your life why aren't you praying and you say well Allah wills it will forgive me allah will do this will do that all of you slap him and said this is where a lot sped up you are not accepted will come again to the end of another interesting episode to the viewers obviously we mentioned today we continued on believing in the last day and the importance of believing the last day and information about the last day and we've just moved on and discussed the divine decree and various aspects of that so until you join us next time please make sure you tune in again to peace TV the solution for humanity assalamualaikum warahmatullahi or what I cattle well Oh who Oh hey you me"
