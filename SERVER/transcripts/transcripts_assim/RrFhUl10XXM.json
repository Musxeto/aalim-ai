  "title": "Reciting the Quran before Ceremonies, Lectures, Meetings etc - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Shanna's says I have a small doubt and hope you can clarify at your earliest inshallah okay I just want to know the practice of reciting a surah from the Quran before starting a meeting or a hidaka a circle or any sort of gathering is Sunnah or is it an innovation did the prophet and his companions legitimize this the answer is that what is happening nowadays in all conferences in all gatherings in Masjid lectures in university graduation ceremony you have someone coming reciting Quran a page or so and then they continue to do their function this is a clear innovation the Prophet never had done had done this either Salaam the Imams of Islam had never done this in Islam this is something that came like maybe less than a hundred years ago before that it was never present however if this is done randomly or if it is used to something that is beneficial meaning that I have a lecture on Hajj and they inaugurate my lecture with a recitation on hatch so the guy recites verses of the Hajj I comment on these give interpretations of Seir and I go into my lecture this is totally legit but to have this done every single time this is an innovation"
