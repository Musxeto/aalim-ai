  "title": "How to get our daughters married early to good Muslim men",
  "transcript": "okay so a third question is about the advice of marrying of our daughters early so the question goes this way sheikh i know it's great to marry of our daughters early martial i want to fulfill this sunnah but to find good men is not easy these days how can we get our children to get married and balance that balance that with the what we perceive as lack of trustworthy quality men to take care of our daughters this is an exercise you have to do it's not nobody said it's easy first of all for those who have daughters it is very difficult nowadays to find anyone to marry your daughter i have 13 daughters and it haunts me every day okay those who don't uh are not married when are they gonna get married how can i get good husbands to them it haunts me even worse when most of the unmarried are affected by the feminist call and their daddy will not want to marry what do you want to do raise your nephews and nieces and be their nannies so no no we want to pursue our phd we want to work we want to make money we want to buy a house you are a woman but unfortunately the whole society and all powers in the world are pushing them to this so those who have girls and they want to get give them in marriage the supply of girls is far greater than the demand of boys so for every 10 with girls now you will find one who is willing to get it a man willing to get married of any of these 10. so this is why when girls say no no i got a proposal i rejected it i say wallahi you will regret this because proposals are very rare oh sheikh i got someone who wants to marry me he's three years older than me i don't want this couple years later she said sure it's okay if he's five years older than me can you find me someone and she would not find anyone 10 years later okay it's okay if he's married i'm willing to be a co-worker 20 years later if he's 60 and he needs a nurse i just want to get married and be with a man but it's too late so as a father you need to go out you need to look in the masjid and you need to know people in your neighborhood among your relatives and friends that he's young he's serious he's not a punk who goes partying and hangs out in bad places he observes salah he's good in his school his moral conduct his respect to the elders he's good to his sisters this is something you buy you pay to get married to your daughter because this is a potential man he's not going to be rich he's not going to be famous or but he has the whole life ahead of him to be that so give it time but know what and who to select inshallah masha'allah exactly we're just going to echo of the one of the points that you mentioned in the talk itself which is the importance of righteous company and i think this is a perhaps one of the benefits the long-term benefits of righteous company that you have people that you can trust insha'allah as potential fathers to your grandchildren masha'allah of course of course and you can tell someone by his company so if you come and ask about sheikh hasan who are his company you will know whether i'm a good person or a bad person okay but but i'm not looking forward to get married it's too late for me now so don't do anything take this as a proposal no seriously if i go and if you check my friends you will not find an actor or a singer or an openly sinner you will find people even if they are not practicing muslims they are people who pray in the masjid they are people who are known to have the highest level of uh ethics and moral conduct they are kind they're generous this this this this this shows you what kind of a person because birds of a feather flock together marshall yes again like to remind all of you if you have any pearls of wisdom any brilliant nuggets of wisdom that you caught throughout these talks please do share them at the comment section and also in your personal social media posts uh put a hashtag tsp2021 and put a hashtag be steadfast i've already uploaded one at least so i'm gonna try and upload more masha'allah a lot of brilliant points of wisdom so far even from these two talks masha'allah"
