  "transcript": "counseling so what would you say are the top priority of things now that are affecting us for this day and generation the things that you're seeing answering so many of these questions that are coming to you on the forefront uh the the counseling is different see the counseling is usually divided between match counseling so this is a problem between two spouses one of them wants a solution wants an eye opener or both of them having problems with one another or one wants to divorce or one wants to get married and usually they come to me as a sheikh as someone they trust in religion alhamdulillah and due to the age and experience i have because if i were not on your live show i would have shown you my high heel traces on my head due to being married to two pre in a previous life for more than 25 years together so as a man with two wives for this long or quarter of a century you get to know women and you know that to know how they think so they come to me for an eye-opener because i'm not a psychiatrist i'm not a shrink i'm just there to help them in accordance with sunnah to tell them what's right and what's wrong some of them come to vent i don't take their preventing the session is half an hour they may speak for five minutes only and i do the rest of speaking because i can see exactly what suffering from has given no you're wrong as a man you're a wimp you're not a real man you should have done this you should have done that as a woman you have all the right to stand up for yourself and ask for divorce or do this or as a woman you should fear allah because you'll be cursed on the day of judgment of the things you do now other part of the counseling session is and and this like 35 to 40 percent is about people who have ocd so you get people ocd-ish when it comes to purity they perform wudu in half an hour they spend an hour taking total bas russo they wash the toilet like six times a day more than they pray why do you do this since we feel we think we believe doubts that overwhelm them from shaytan then you go to the higher level or the lower depending how you look at it where these viswas and whispers are about shirk about kufuru so i was putting my uh um earbuds in my ear and i smiled is that kufur i said what the heck what do you mean by kufur said yeah because i remember that the prophet when he made wudu he used to wipe his ears so i smiled he said this is not related this is not kufur this is utter stupidity you should see a psychiatrist a muslim psychiatrist so i get to check with people who think that okay did i commit kufur did i exit the fold of islam did i do this did i do that by opening their eyes and telling them listen this is how shaytan messes up with your head through two ways either you're inclined to partying all night long and drinking booze and womenizing so he doesn't care about your whispers indeed he opens venues and sins or you're in so meticulous about things related to islam so keen uh on on pursuing what it gets closer to allah so he exaggerates things and makes you go to extreme a grain of sand he makes it in your head as big as a mountain so you think everything is making you uh um doomed and uh bound to hell this is my job is to open their eyes the rest of the questions i get are the usual questions about halal food music pre-mixing sometimes consultation of what to do i have a best friend who's not talking to me i have a best friend who mocks the dean or religion i have this i have that and things related to transactions to selling and buying riba and the likes"
