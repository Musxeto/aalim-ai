  "transcript": "Ameena from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So I have a question about I signed up for a phone contract for a survey and it said that if I break the contract within 12 months they're going to charge me a certain amount of money. So when I broke the contract I gave them the money and after a while they called me and returned the money that I don't owe them anything. The employer called me. So I said are you sure? I called them several times and they refunded me the money. Then after a few months they started calling me that I owed them money. But I said but I paid the money and you told me that I didn't owe you, you refunded the money to me. So I decided not to pay. Am I sinful if I don't pay that amount of money for? No you're not sinful because this is the mistake of the employee who refunded you the money and he's the one who's obliged to pay for his mistake. you"
