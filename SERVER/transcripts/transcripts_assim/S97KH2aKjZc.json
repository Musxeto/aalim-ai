  "title": "The Prophets Test VS The tests we face today (Muslims in China, child trafficking, etc) | Assim Al",
  "transcript": "question is from sister afrina what does it mean that prophets were the severely tested people what about now the muslims in china are being tested and those who are child trafficked is their test not difficult nobody said that their test is not difficult but when you compare it to the testing of prophets and messengers of allah azzawajal you will find that it is greater the tests of messengers for someone like nour for example calling his people for 950 not days not weeks not months 950 years nine centuries and a half and they're rejecting him ridiculing him making fun of him and only to take his people who believed on his ark and see his own son and his own wife perish and die with the disbelievers what kind of tests are these ibraheem peace be upon him at a young age 16 or 17 destroying the idols they interrogate him and they decide to build the hugest fire ever and to throw him in it and he makes it then allah tells him when he is 80 years of age to circumcise himself with an axe 80 years and he does that and then he's blessed with a child when he is almost 100 years of age and he's he doesn't know how this could be and then when the child is an infant here he's told to go to mecca which is a desert between mountains and to leave the child and his mother there without any food or water or any inhabitants then when the child grows up to be 14 years of age allah tells him to go and slaughter him and we can go on and on in mentioning the hardship that these great uh uh prophets and messengers faced and definitely what the the yogurts are suffering in china is horrendous but it doesn't come close with all this suffering they can always pretend to be disbelievers they can eat pork when forced they can abandon salah and pray in their mind when forced they can take off the hijab when forced and allah would not hold them accountable for that because they are compelled they are forced and allah does not burden us with such uh uh accountability uh those in child trafficking well this is their test everyone has a test so i don't expect muslims to come and say well is the test of prophet sulaiman who was a king and he could control the jinn mosevir or i who have colon cancer or i have uh uh whatever this or that illness it's it's not the way you think testing is testing is something that allah azzawajal tests people with that can make them or break them and each person's test differ than the others according to allah's knowledge of them so one should not go into what is a territory specified for allah azzawajal to judge and to test others we do not get to question allah and he questions all of his creations oh"
