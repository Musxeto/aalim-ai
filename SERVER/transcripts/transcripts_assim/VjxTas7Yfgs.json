  "transcript": "a sister says can you give some sound advice to our Muslim female vloggers the advice I could give to male and female vloggers number one what are you the answer Servants of Allah number two what reason did Allah create you for answer to worship Him subhanahu wa ta'ala as he created the gin and the humans for the sole purpose of worshiping him question number three is anyone on Earth not tested answer no all humans and Jin are being tested by Allah question number four those who pass the test goes where answer is Paradise those who fail the test goes where the answer is hellfire number five are the things you're doing as a vlogger regardless of the topic of your Vlogs are they in accordance to the Quran and the Sunnah or if we were to rephrase this is Allah pleased with you is Allah agreeing with what you're doing most likely the answer would be no Allah mandated hijab for Muslim women hijab is not a scarf or a piece of cloth that you wear it's also an attitude so Allah tells us women have to wear the hijab difference of opinion whether the face and the hands are included or not those who say say she must cover that and there are those who say no she can uncover her face and hands but this is not all what Allah has commanded women to do they are commanded to go the extra mile by not softening their voice why because their voices May lure and seduce those who have in their hearts so Allah says do not soften your voices and be submissive when you speak so that those with illness in their hearts would not be tempted would not be seduced number three you as women are not permitted to wear anklets that make sounds when you walk because this also has a very negative impact on men normal and those who have illness in their hearts as well and likewise wearing high heels that have this sound when you walk that would draw the attention of any man who's not looking not only that in Islam it is not permissible for a woman to put on perfume that men can find the scent so even if you're properly dressed covered from head to toe wearing low heels or a soft uh a shoe that has no sound to it and when you speak you speak moderately or firmly if you wear perfume and men can find the scent you don't know what Satan does to them to the men when they smell this fragrance the prophet saidat wasam any woman who goes out of her home passes by a group of men who could find her scent her beautiful perfumes she is as if she's an adulteress because she committed such a major sin in Islam all of this gives you an idea how a woman should abide by her hijab it's not only the piece of cloth she wears on her body it's an attitude it's a whole life transforming system where she conceals herself her beauty and anything that may tempt men to be attracted to her so now you tell me when you go on your Vlogs and you appear in different pauses talking naturally what is the impact you're leaving on me as a man and why are you doing this the only acceptable answer is for fame and recognition and this is the curse of social media both on men and women when a person gets recognized and acknowledged the fame he gets when people talk about his Vlog about his website about his uh uh app about his YouTube and Instagram he becomes an influencer he become he becomes uh a celebrity people would like to take photographs with him wherever he goes or wherever she goes this kind of attention is a vacuum machine that would suck you in and leave you for dead because whenever Fame is at the Target of your actions you lose sincerity and it makes you compromise your religion and lots of these women don't care about hijab after some time don't care they even were modest in the beginning now they put eyeliners and Shadow and some make light makeup and some light lipsticks what are you doing this totally defies the hijab according to all Scholars of Islam said yeah but I have to look a little bit nice I have to hide my pimples I have to hide some scars I have to do this I have to do that so you end up losing your religion you end up losing your Iman you end up with a great deal of sins on your shoulders for what just to be an influencer just to be famous just to be recognized by the people then what you tell me by Allah will you find any benefit of this in your grave the answer is no will you find the punishment of what you've done in your grave answer is yes and what awaits you at the sight of Allah Asel on the day of judgment is far worse may Allah Asel protect us and may Allah make our Deeds sincere for his face Islam"
