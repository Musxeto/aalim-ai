  "transcript": "Malik from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So by the way, how can I start, I am going through some personal issues and I've been making a lot of dua for it and I'm also following like the etiquettes of duas and I've read some of Ibn Khayyam's work, how to make dua and everything and I try to follow you know the times where duas are accepted and everything but and I also do other things that bring me closer to Allah but the problem is sometimes when I'm back at home or the next day you know the issues I make dua for get worse and I'm always unsure if this is now a test or if this is waswasa, you know what I mean? Yes, I know what you mean Malik, the issue is that when I ask Allah Azza Wa Jal to grant me something and Allah grants me, this is something I like and when I ask Allah Azza Wa Jal some things and Allah does not give it to me this is what Allah wants, so I prefer what Allah wants over what I want because Allah knows what's best for me, so always be grateful for whatever Allah gives to you and whatever you ask Allah Azza Wa Jal to protect you from or to bring you and Allah does not do this and it becomes worse, be content because this is best for you and Allah chooses only the best but you can't see this, you don't see it because you don't know the future so keep on making dua, keep on thinking positively in Allah Azza Wa Jal and be content and whatever is good for you will happen with the grace of Allah"
