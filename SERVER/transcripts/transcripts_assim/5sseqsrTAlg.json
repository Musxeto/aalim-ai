  "transcript": "and he said that his wife doesn't pray and she left prayer I think a week or a month ago and she said that she prayed to Allah but Allah did not answer her prayer so she abandoned prayer if you're talking about the five daily prayers yeah abdelkader then there is a big problem because the Prophet said RA salatu salam he said that the pledge between us the Muslims and them the disbelievers is prayer whoever abandoned Sprayer he has committed an act of Cofer and in Sahih Muslim the Prophet said I saw some banal mark benabroad Julie was sure Kia will cover between man and disbelief or associating others with Allah is the only thing that divides him separates him from qu4 and shirk is abandoning salat a Buddha would added so whoever abandons it he has become a kafir kafir therefore if your wife doesn't pray the five daily prayers and she confesses she admits she doesn't say it's just I prayed this is different because you're not 24/7 with her you go to the bathroom she could have prayed you go out to the message she could have prayed but if she says no I will not pray I ask Allah so gel for five years to do something for me and he didn't do that for me so I'm not praying at all then this is a problem you should advise her you should be strict with her and if she insists you should divorce her because she's not a Muslim anymore and you cannot remain married to such a person but if she is talking about supplicating which is a prayer making duaa invoking Allah Azza WA JAL she said I'm not going to invoke Allah this is a major sin but she's still a Muslim she has to be taught properly in the right way she has to adhere to the fact that she is slave she is a servant of Allah social she's not talking to a peer of hers when you ask Allah Allah give me this and Allah doesn't give me that or I'm not gonna pray anymore what is this you think you have the ability to take a breath without a loss permission do you think you can go to the bathroom and I said the call of nature if Allah does not allow you - are you insane a single mosquito bite would put you in bed for Allah knows how long didn't you hear of Ebola I didn't Eve of Mars or SARS or what a corona all these illnesses all these problems all this hunger all these thirst all these blessings of allah azzawajal it's all from allah and you think that you can address a lot so as well as you address your friend or your colleague definitely you're not a Muslim come back to your senses and know that you are here to be tested and tried and if you fail you go to hell straight for eternity but if you pass then Allah and your patient and tolerant and you are submissive to Allah and you show your humility Allah so gel when He wills it and when he sees that there is good for you in it he will answer your call"
