  "title": "Can a muslim woman working as a nurse wear the required uniform? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yes what is the ruling on a woman who works as a nurse in a hospital wearing the uniform of nurses and she's wearing something that covers her arms underneath now the question is very easy and we answer this by another question is the uniform she's wearing follows the attire the islamic attire of a muslim woman which has to be oblique not see-through not exposing her bone structure and body curves not imitating the kuffar not drawing attention or attracting attention to others and among other things the answer is no the uniform of a nurse is something that a woman may wear inside of her own home in front of her mahrams or other women it exposes her buttocks her waist her shoulders it shows and exposes all of these things clearly in which means that this is not a befitting attire for a muslim woman and there are no corners that we can cut through this is something that we have to be really serious about because what a muslim woman wears we cannot compromise and unfortunately in the medical field it seems that medicine and the medical profession is becoming their god that says what's halal and what's haram and unfortunately this is becoming a trend in most professions to the muslims even in muslim countries they don't care what sharia says they care only what they want so if you go to a hospital and you audit what's happening in a hospital according to quran and sunnah no extremism nothing of such scholars coming in telling us what's the ruling on a nurse or a surgeon doctor female going into preparation before the surgery doing her scrubs washing her arms the elbows in front of other men exposing that and maybe the surgeon's attire where you can see her neck and part of her chest is this halal islam so this is not our issue now here the issue is is it permissible for a nurse to wear such clothes the answer is simple and straightforward no"
