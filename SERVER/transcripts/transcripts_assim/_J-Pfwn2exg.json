  "title": "Teacher puts me in groups with girls, am I sinful? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um so I currently live I mean I I'm currently in a in a school where it's not gender segregated and that sometimes the teacher puts me in groups with women so my question is that is it allowed for me to work together with women on group works or is it not permissible for me to do so men men are the bread winner as a man you are obliged to go to school to go to university and to work and unfortunately in so many countries that do not abide by the Islamic rulings you may find yourself in a position where you have to freely mix with the opposite gender which is Haram but due to it being the least of the two evils that is working with the opposite gender rather than quitting everything and staying home again and not being able to work or to provide for your family then you may do so by following the Islamic rulings not to be in seclusion with the opposite gender under any circumstances not to uh um freely look without any boundaries but rather you have to lower your gaze not to flirt or socialize or uh uh chitchat freely rather keep it strictly to business 1 plus 1 equals 2 that's it not trying to be funny or humorous Etc in this case inshallah you're fine"
