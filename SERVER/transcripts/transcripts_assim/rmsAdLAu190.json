  "title": "Are all innovated acts of worship sinful and not rewarded | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "and camel from saudi yeah we all know that our is most most merciful most forgiving the act of innovation are not accepted at all so the innovators who spend a lot of their time money and sometimes they do with the full full contemplation and sometimes crying because of this innovation is all this uh innovation will go down to the drain okay so basically you are saying that every innovation would be sinful and a person would be accountable in his grave for it or not i think no benefit at all to all his good deeds okay tamil from saudi arabia is it possible that those who innovate would not benefit anything from their innovation meaning i see so many people celebrate mauled they do thicker after a prayer in congregation they do innovated vicar and they do a lot of innovative celebrations etc is it possible that they will get zero benefit or hassanat over this the answer is it's in allah's hands the hadith we know the prophet said allah whoever innovates anything in our religion it is rejected meaning it's canceled there's no reward in it however no one knows what's in the hearts except allah azza so there might be a possibility for someone who's ignorant who is following his peers and scholars who ordered him instructed him to do this innovation that when he does it with sincerity though he is not following the prophet isaiah due to his ignorance not due to his rejection maybe allah would reward him but this is in allah's hands we cannot say what we have according to the evidences from the quran the sunnah that they get nothing of good deeds some scholars say maybe they would be lucky if they're not sinful so no good deeds but no sin but to claim that they would do innovation and yet be rewarded for that this is something in us allah's hand but it goes against what we uh have of evidences"
