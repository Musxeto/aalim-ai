  "title": "Fasting of a Pregnant or a Breastfeeding Woman - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "just remember man is asking about feeding for a pregnant woman or a suckling woman and the majority of scholars say that this is not applicable there are however few hadiths or reported or related to urban omar and one - if I'm not mistaking ali IBN ABI talib or even our best one of them and they used to tell those who were pregnant to feed a day a poor person for every day they miss but the majority of scholars say now this is not permissible you should make up for the days you've missed so for the past three years four years 120 days you can make up for these days in sha Allah the minute you don't have anything to stop you from fasting the minute you are not conceiving or you're not suckling maybe five years from now maybe ten years from now Allah knows whatever the time is right for you to make up for these days missed you should do them and feeding would not suffice and the miss miss calculation for one of the months how do you go about calculating if you just forgot how many you've actually fasted in that month itself I personally believe that you we're not nowadays through the internet through the newspapers from the calendars you can calculate if the month is 29 or 30 days but always be on the safe side for example if I tell you where they 1,000 days you should know that's a lot so if we go down to 100 days said probably probably less so 80 days you said no it's more so you give or take and always be on the positive and the plus side and this is Allah will be for your own good deeds"
