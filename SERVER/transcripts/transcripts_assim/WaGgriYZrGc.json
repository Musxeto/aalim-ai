  "transcript": "aisha from from singapore she says someone told her that reciting the fatih have for the deceased as practiced in so many muslim countries is not an innovation so my question would be okay if it's not an innovation is it a sunnah or not and if it's a sunnah can you present us with one single hadith in the entire huge collection of hadiths that state that this is part of the sunnah the answer is no never ever the prophet salallahu salaam recited the sunnah the fatihaf or deceased all the authentic hadiths especially the one in the sahih when he buried one of his companions and after the burial he said secret forgiveness for your brother and ask allah to be steadfast because now he's being questioned never ever he told them recite the fatiha for him or do this or do that which means that this is totally a an innovation none of the four caliphs did it none of the companions did it none of the tabirin did it so these people aisha come to you and have the audacity to claim that it is not a bidder what is it then they said oh yeah it's not sunnah okay so what is it it's something permissible how could it be permissible if it is in the religion and when you were using fatiha for it didn't the prophet say allah the hadith was narrated by mother ish muslim whoever innovates in our affairs in our religion what is not part of it it is rejected now reciting fatiha for the deceased is it part of our affairs is it part of our religion which allah stated in chapter five surat al maidah have completed your religion was it part of the religion that was completed at the time of the prophet is some or not if you say no it wasn't then it said clear innovation simple as that so what are we supposed to do for the disease to help the deceased one a lot of dua and you have the sky is the limit seeking allah's forgiveness is for the deceased paying charity so feeding muslims on his behalf the poor the needy supporting islamic channels islamic journals islamic dawah centers all of this is part of the continuous sadaqajari a continuous charity on behalf of our deceased and also umrah and hajj whether you do it yourself or you give money to people to do it on on their behalf this is all something that would benefit the disease and it wouldn't reach him insha'allah"
