  "transcript": "I was not practicing Muslim before and I used to live in the UAE and some things lead to another and I had a record an addiction for drug use and eventually I was caught and I served time in the prison um I was deported it's maybe stayed for eight months in there I got this photo now I'm a practicing Muslim for like five years I think Allah showed me the real way by making me go through a place where I have to turn back twist so I'm thankful but I am 28 years old now I am planning to get married so in my part of the place there are a lot of people from UAE and I am getting proposals from UAE as well but I am deported I cannot go back there so if I am going for a proposal I I still nobody knows that I was in jail for eight months I've kept to conceal I think Allah conceal my sins so I know I am not explosive but I want to know like potential Styles watch the uh my limit of if I have to say or do not do not say because if I don't say and they ask me to move today or something or anything like that I cannot do it first of all alhamdulillah who guided you back to the straight path and the good news is Allah forgives whatever had happened when his servant comes open and forward in Repentance and remorse and asks Allah forgiveness the defects or bad things in a spouse that impacts the marriage itself must be told up front so if you have a disease that hampers the marriage or defect or a deficiency or something that would make your spouse repel and not feel comfortable which impacts the marriage itself you have to con you have to expose this and say it up front what happened in a Muslim a person's past stays in the past as they say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas this is better what happens in the past stays in the past because doing time or going to jail and coming out clean does not impact an individual you're not applying for a job or something similar to that that requires to know your uh uh criminal record this is a marriage alhamdulillah you earn you have a house you can function as a husband and you you are a practicing Muslim this is all what counts what happens in the past remains in the past if they ask you to move to the UAE you say I have legal problems that prevent me from entering without exposing your sin many people were deported due to loans they could not pay off or due to other reasons other than being in jail so there is no need for you to say and you don't have to elaborate if they insist tell them I'm not going to say alhamdulillah the the the supply is far greater than the demand you will have so many other proposals insha Allah"
