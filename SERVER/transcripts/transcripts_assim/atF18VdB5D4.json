  "transcript": "Shomona from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Sheikh my question is does it affect the validity of marriage if any info given is doubtful or false? For example a girl in her marriage in her marital contract Nikah Namah is asked and that if she is virgin and she knows that she is physically virgin like she has never been ever with any men but she has some OCD that is inclined her to touch others inappropriately like she is sleeping with her mom and she feels like her lips touched her mom's maybe true or maybe not or like that she in her while hitting the puberty she has played with her younger cousin sister Dr. Nars like you say adult movie person imitating them like the marriage the marriage is valid Shomona the marriage is valid it does not impact the validity of the marriage Alhamdulillah Have you ever taken a counseling session with me?
