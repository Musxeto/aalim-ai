  "transcript": "shake after embracing Islam um there were times when I was weak and I committed sins which were caught on camera by other people videographed photographed alhamdulillah made Toba This was um in the past so I wanted to know uh the general principle regarding asking people to delete your pictures and videos because some people if you ask them and the whole village went to a certain event and then you ask one person and word gets around you ask them they may delete it but other people may be more uh they may still the problem some people you tell them you're Muslim and they may not delete the videos and pictures they may keep them and some people they may have a picture and video of you but if you bring it to them is it better to just ask them if if you feel like they'll just forget about you and forget about it not to ask them just in case there is that potential that if you ask them and they don't delete it then you brought attention to the situation what personally I'm an inclined to say just forget about it put a lid on it and move on there are a lot of people who are evil and bad and the moment I approach them and say you have a picture of me that is in unappropriate said well oh I didn't know that and they go search and they magnify it and they spread it all over the place so it's best to put a lid on it and just forget it and ask Allah for forgiveness and move on"
