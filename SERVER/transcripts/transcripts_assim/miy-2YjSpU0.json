  "title": "How to deal with Schools that promote and teach acceptance for Homosexuality? |  AssimAlHakeem",
  "transcript": "the government has insisted to teach very young children about the importance of respect and tolerance for people who are different this includes respect for Muslims but also for LGBT people and their choices they have started this with storybooks where the child has two mothers or two fathers what advice do you have for Muslims who have children in such schools first of all definitely Sharif is referring to a nun Muslim country and again the global trend is to enforce homosexuality upon people from a very early age worldwide and the tendency is to force people to accept this so there's no freedom of speech there is no freedom of religion they accuse Muslim countries of not allowing the freedom of religion the freedom of expression and if you go to their country if the imam in Europe or in somewhere close goes on a Friday and says that sodomy is a major sin in Islam in Judaism and in Christianity it is condemned in the Old Testament in the New Testament and in the Koran and that this is an illness this is something that has to be cured they would probably arrest him or at least ban him from giving hot but why they say that this is hate I didn't ask anyone to hate anyone this is Islam this is Koran they don't want this they want you to again to dilute your religion to be in this big melting pot where you let go your Islamic identity where you let go your beliefs forget about Islam forget about the Quran forget about the sooner you are here in this country you have to be a kafir like us Allah said well enter the unclear who'd wanna know Sarah had that Tevye meal at home and the Jews and the Christian will not be pleased with you will not be satisfied with you until you follow their religion or you follow their way this isn't an and this is what we see on the ground at the moment so they force our children to learn this filth about a boy having two fathers who gave birth to that boy none of them so how can he has how can he have two fathers well this is LGBT x YW z how can he have two mothers is he jesus where is where is the father where is the male intervention nothing and they tell you to respect I have no problem with respect we respect all people we have empathy towards thieves about sinners fornicators we feel sorry for them for the sin yet we hate the sin and not the sinful and not the sinner so yes we we do not accept sins we do not embrace them 50 years ago in the UK it was a crime to be homosexual to be gay it was a crime and you could not even mention this Shyama didn't mentioned that in a novel in Johannesburg and Cape Town and Durban in South Africa it was banned to have this Lady Chatterley's Lover because of a word that it was inappropriate nowadays it is not only legal but they force people to do it and they force the Muslim children to learn about it and they condemn anyone talking about it as hate speech and this is totally unacceptable whose mistake is it it's yours and mine why because we tolerated this type of lack of identity lack of stance and position for so many years now we're paying the price had the Muslims stood up together went to the lawyer's used all legal means to fight this and say no we have our culture we have a religion it's not a difference of opinion among Muslims that homosexuality is halal or Haram any Muslim caught Mia caught me any Muslim who advocates who says that homosexuality is permissible or okay or it's a personal preference he is not a Muslim he has nullified his religion he's not a Muslim anymore he's out of the fold of Islam therefore because we in the very beginning were so absent-minded we did not participate we did not take a stand now we're paying the price but what to do Sherif says we have a problem the problem is that you have to take your children out of school do homeschooling refuse totally for this you know that in Europe there are now forcing that children your children and mine girls and boys to have mixed physical education classes which means that your daughter who's 15 16 has to go to the swimming pool with a 15 16 year old year old boy who in his right mind would allow this this is your religion this is your honor and people just because of the buck just because of the good salary they're getting the government allowance and financial support they are getting they keep the mouth mouth shut but they'll pay the price in few years time unfortunately so you have to take a decision now take your children out of school give them homeschooling or get the Muslim millionaires and billionaires there to make private segregated Islamic schools and if this is not possible then migrate leave the country and in some countries by the way they are preventing the families from sending their children to madrassas outside of the country in some countries in Europe if your child is 12 years old you want to send your child to a school in a different country they take their passport because they want to ensure they're brainwashed they don't want them to go and learn their religion elsewhere and this is a fact so it's an issue of survival it's an issue of protecting your identity and this is the global trend strip Muslims from their identity you go to two countries where they put Muslims in the millions in concentration camps they come in Ramadan to them forcing them not to fast taking off the hijab of women's heads shaving the beers of men forcing them not to pray where is the United Nation where are the Muslims they are in deep sleep hibernating unfortunately or by own self being absent from what's happening or turning a blind eye so you have to make a decision okay"
