  "title": "Can I do my Adkhar & rely on it & put myself in harm's way cuz I would be protected? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is uh I have a friend for example he says as long as he does his uh morning and the evening occurs so there's this girl for example that is really dangerous to follow the abundance and purpose along the road like uh every other day you heard us an attack so he says as long as he does this morning and evening Oscar he will follow that word and nothing will happen to him so my question is is it okay do we put that much uh do we just rely on Allah as long as we don't we do our scars or should we take necessary precautions and not follow such as an example Allah azzawajal says in the Quran do not throw yourselves In Harm's Way regardless whether you said or not and your friend is definitely delusional because he is testing Allah azzawajal and this is not a wise thing to do why doesn't your friend say his morning and evening at car and climb up the highest building and jump if he's at God is going to save him he's going to land on his feet and walk away without any problem if it's not he's going to end up a pizza flat with mozzarella and and paparoni in summertella maybe this is not logical the afghar is your Shield from Evil from Envy from black magic with the grace of Allah but it doesn't mean it's not going to happen it doesn't mean that when you say you're at car you're selling saying it 100 with concentration and conviction so many of us may say at car and their brain is wandering all over the universe and not concentrating on what they're saying so definitely what your friend is saying is totally wrong you have to take your precautions you have to say you're a car in the morning and evening but also be protective and not going into routes that may lead robbers or uh people to uh attack you saying that I have trust and dependence on Allah azzawajal this is not permissible at all"
