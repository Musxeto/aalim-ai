  "title": "Father laughed at Son's way of saying 'Assalamu Alaykum' (due to poor Arabic), Is this Kufr? - Assim",
  "transcript": "india says my friend my brother whatever used to mistakenly say like everyone else who is in an arab they can't say the letter in so they would say asim and some would call it awesome it's the same so if someone does not pronounce the in properly when giving the islamic greeting he would say assalamu alaikum he cannot say so his friend or his brother or whatever managed or is trying to fix it so whenever he used to call his father and he said assalamu alaikum his father used to make fun of him what is this and he's wondering is this kufr is him mocking the dean and again i tell my brothers and sisters don't jump the gun it is extremely dangerous to just want people to get out of the fold of islam or to fear the jinn then i'm out of the fold of islam to say a word accidentally i'm out of the fold of islam this becomes an obsession this becomes continuous whispering from shaytan messing up with your head and destroying your life and preventing you and depriving you from concentrating on useful things ask yourself was the father it has nothing to do with the son and the holy ghost was the father of that person who said mocking the islamic greeting or was he mocking the pronunciation he was mocking the pronunciation without any doubt he had no intention to mock a verse of the quran or a ritual of islam so you have to distinguish between what was intended for example someone looks at me and he hates my guts and there's so many out there that do hate my guts with the grace of allah azzawajal i can blame them so they say well look at the sheikh's beard it's like a goat beard it's so funny it's not this it's this so they're making fun of my beard so people jump the gun these are kafir these are infidels they are making fun of the religion hold your horses are they making fun of this ritual of this sunnah of the prophet isalam that he ordered us to do it or they're making fun of me as an individual there's a big difference if they're making fun of the beard because it is part of the religion they are totally out of the fold of islam and there's nothing disputed in this they're making fun of a ritual of islam so those who write in newspapers and draw cartoons and make videos and maybe make stand-up comedies like in the arab world when they make fun of this ritual of the prophet sallam because it is of the prophet of their apostates they are not muslims anymore but if they're making fun of me as an individual as assam they hate my guts and they had nothing intended towards the religion of islam this is sinful but it doesn't take them out of the fold of islam and i hope this makes sense to you faisal"
