chapter that deals with fasting and we have hadith 190 the hadith of mother I shammy Allah be pleased with her this hadith of Aisha may Allah be pleased with her is regarding a person who dies and he has mandatory fasting that he did not fast so what is the ruling on fasting it the profit in this hadith said that whoever dies in such a state his heir must fast on his behalf so the one who inherits from him must fast on his behalf any fasting or a special kind of fasting this is what we will find in the following hadith hadith 191 even I've asked may allah be pleased with him narrated that a man came to the prophet salallahu re who r us Elam and said my mother has died and she did not make up for a month of fasting she was supposed to fast should I fast it the prophets allah waariyan salem said if your mother had a debt would you have paid it for her the man said I would the Prophet sallallahu wasallam said a las that is more worthy of being paid in another narration a woman came to the prophet Aristotle Solomon said my mother has died and she wasn't able to fast a month that she pledged now there is an extra piece of information and there is nothing she pledged it and she said shall I fast it the Prophet said that is awesome if there was a debt on your mother would you pay it wouldn't you and the Prophet said Alice awesome the debt of Allah deserves its payment more than the payments of any one else from these hadith scholars differed by saying that the first hadith in general whoever dies and he has fasting that he did not fast his heir should do that but the hadith of the woman specifically about her case when she pledged it she made an oath to fast a month and she died so scholars differ some of them such as Ali Mohammed be humble and a group of scholars said only the fasting of oath or pledge to be made up by the air by the relatives by the family but mandatory fast of Ramadan they cannot be made up by any person and other scholars said no it is general whoever dies leaving a mandatory fasting that he did not make up it must be fasted by his heir then let us look and analyze these Hadees the most authentic opinion is that as long as it is mandatory whether it's Ramadan or it's a pledge or an oath or it's an expiration because all of these are mandatory and he or she died then it is highly recommended but it is not mandatory for me to make up for these days now why do we say it's highly recommended because Allah did not oblige me too fast on behalf of someone else Allah says well at a 0 YZ one with okra that the burden of someone else would not be carried by others it would be only carried by those who did that and from the hadith the Prophet said whoever dies and he has mandatory fasting meaning that I can make up for the disease if these days are mandatory but voluntary days no so if my father used to fast three days of every month and the previous month he fell sick and died should I make up for these three days scholars say no it has to be mandatory one other issue scholars differentiated between a fast that is mandatory and obliged upon you and a fast that is mandatory but it is not obliged on you how is that they said I'll give you an example if a person fell sick before Ramadan and he continued to be sick the whole month of Ramadan and on the day of reed he died what to do scholars say nothing should I fast on his behalf nope should I feed on his behalf nope why because it was not mandatory upon him too fast it is mandatory but it is not obliged to make it up because he did not get well and therefore Allah would not hold him accountable another example a man got sick and then recovered and was able to make up for these days for a whole month or two but he didn't and then died afterwards should I make up for him the answer is yes why because he was able to make up and he did not and therefore it is recommended for me to make up for these days a third scenario a man who is true many and chronically ill there is no way that he would ever recover and he died do I fast on his behalf the answer is no do I feed the answer is yes because feeding on behalf of a terminally ill person is mandatory this is mentioned in the Quran voir le Dina UT Punahou Vidya this is specifically on people who are terminally ill what does that mean that the doctors say that you will never ever recover some people have problems with for example they're diabetic and doctors say that this illness you have is nowhere to be cured and you cannot fast any day of Ramadan you have to eat something every three or four hours so the doctor say that you will never be cured from that what does this person do or another person who is in his 80s he's healthy he's fit but because he's 80 or 70 he's unable to fast he can't he's not ill but he's too weak so scholars say that they have to feed a poor person for every day they miss how is that done either after sunset you feed someone for the day that has gone you cannot fit someone in advance or you wait until the end of Ramadan the first day of read or the second day of rate cook a sufficient amount for 30 people and vitality people let them eat this does the job so or these are the scenarios of people who you may offer or you may fast on behalf and the cases you may pass on behalf and you watch and find out from this that the Prophet is giving the analogy he's telling you if you at that two people would you pay it that says yes then in this case paid to Allah because Allah debts are more worthy of being paid question if my father died and he had not been able to fast 30 days of the past Ramadan and we want to fast it can I split it with my siblings can I take two days and my brother takes five and my sister takes four and my mother takes the answer is yes you can split it so if he has ten days and we had ten brothers and sisters each one of us fast one day the same day that does the job question 2 if he has an expiration of fasting two consecutive months can we split it scholars say no you cannot because this has to be done by an individual you cannot fast a week then your brother takes the following week and then no it has to be done by one particular individual I think that this is all the issues regarding to making up for the fasting however is it okay if I fast voluntary fasting on behalf of the dead it's an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic is that you cannot offer voluntary fasting on behalf of the dead what you can offer to the disease is what the sooner has brought us in there is supplication seeking Allah's forgiveness asking Allah to expand his grave etc hatch and also Umbra falls under the same category charity because the Prophet approved a little giving charity on behalf of the disease other than that it is not recommended or permissible such as offering prayers such as offering or reciting the Quran on behalf of someone who's dead this is not permissible any form of charity is permissible so you want to build a message it you want to build a school you wanna dig water well all of this is in sha allah accepted and permissible do you have any questions yes brother there shake as you have mentioned that an air can make up for the deeds of the disease so for example can he seek forgiveness on his behalf for example if the disease might have back but in a person can he seek forgiveness from that person on behalf of the deceased seeking forgiveness yes you can definitely because it is ongoing it will be ongoing as long as the other person did not forgive him and that is why the prophet said assam whenever one of you transgresses against his brother he should seek His forgiveness before the day of judgment because there are no DNR's order hums there are only the good deeds and the bad deeds so the Prophet said you must seek His forgiveness ask him to pardon you and if this is not possible and the person dies then his son or his brother goes to him or his friend and asks him to do this inshallah we have a short break assalamu alaikum and welcome back do we have any questions yes brother there slowly come shake tell em shake can you tell a timing before without listening to the odds-on or without watching a watch seen the time the perfect time to break the fast is it that the people stay while the sky should be orange in color and some say should be dark none of the two is correct the time to break your fast is when the Sun disappears so whether the Sun is orange whether it's red where it's purple depending on what you're doing and depending on the severity of your hunger and thirst you may see colors but if the Sun disappears if the Sun sets that's it whether the event is called or not this is very important allah azzawajal did not order me too fast or break my fast and according to the adhan I'm instructed to fast when I can distinguish the thread of the day from the night so if I am in the desert and I see in the direction of the east the true fechar the Troodon immediately I have to refrain and I pray and likewise if I'm at the seaside and I can see the Sun the minute the Sun disappears even if the event does not call I break my fast and I pray because this is something between me and Allah and I can see the Sun it disappeared The Sun has set Hamas for me this is the time to pray and to break my fast likewise if I'm on the ground and I take off and I can see the Sun and as I'm taking off The Sun has completely disappeared so I break my fast regardless whether the people on the ground broke their fast or not but most likely they did but even if they didn't I could care less in one aditi said that the little things go and who go back and one was the disease now in contrast you said this forgiveness supplication everything also is you know helping the disease so if you could elaborate on this the prophet alayhi salatu salam said when a person goes to his grave three things go with him to the cemetery one stays and to return the one that stays are his own deeds and the one that goes back are his wealth and his family however we all know that the Prophet told us erase errata salam that the supplication of the people to the deceased benefit him and that is why we offer what prayer funeral prayer what is the reason of us offering funeral prayer is to intercede and to ask Allah so jeal for forgiveness for him and that is why they say that this reaches him without any problem likewise the other hadith when a man said o prophet of Allah my mother died and I feel that if she didn't she would have given this garden this farm for the cause of Allah so shall I do that and he's the prophesied yes so this means that this reaches it also those who asked the Prophet arrest a lot of salam about performing Hajj on behalf of her mother or her father who died and did not perform Hajj and the Prophet said yes so all of these indicate to us that the deeds of the individual will all cease and stop but that does not mean that he cannot be benefited by others the Prophet says if the son of Adam dies all of his deeds are interrupted they are cut off except three a continuous charity ongoing charity or beneficial knowledge that people benefit from and I pray to Allah that Allah makes this part of the beneficial knowledge and thirdly a righteous offspring that supplicates and seeks forgiveness for Allah for him this is your own doing but there are other means where people grant you and give to you that would benefit you in your grave and on the hereafter as a prophet said alayhi s-salatu a Salaam yes brother soundly khushi sampla kenna old person for some days of Ramzan and feed the people for the rest of the days yes if a person is in between in the sense that he is pardoned for not fasting due to his old age yet sometimes he finds himself having the ability to fast in this case when he is able to fast he should fast and when he is not able to fast he may feed poor people providing that this is ongoing not that he felt this Ramadan that he's unable to do it so he fasted 15 days and the 15 days he gave for the poor but next year is okay no I'm talking about someone who is really old and unable to week too fragile to fast in this case he may feed for every day one poor person and whenever he feels fit and he decides to fast this is acceptable in sha Allah yes brother there shake as you have mentioned that an air can make up for the deeds of the disease so for example can he seek forgiveness on his behalf for example if the disease might have back between a person can he seek forgiveness from that person on behalf of the deceased seeking forgiveness yes you can definitely because it is ongoing it will be ongoing as long as the other person did not forgive him and that is why the Prophet said has some whenever one of you transgresses against his brother he should seek His forgiveness before the day of judgement because there are no DNR's or hums there are only the good deeds and the bad deeds so the Prophet said you must seek His forgiveness ask him to pardon you and if this is not possible and the person dies then his son or his brother goes to him or his friend and asks him to do this inshallah yes brother Salam aleikum Sheikh sanam suppose a person is on his dead bit and he knows that he will soon die after one or two days and on his deathbed he says because it's a habit and nowadays that we sometimes suppose you are buying or we are selling something so we don't have a money so we can give it later on I'll take it later on so if i tell him that i will give you later on and many times it happens but most of the people tend to forget so on the dead better when i say if i am in death of anyone so i will pay to you so please come and the person does not come so will i be responsible for that well this depends if you did not have the intention not to pay and the person himself failed to come forward or said it's only a small amount I don't want to come then no you will not be responsible for that but even if you die it is the responsibility of everyone who has yet to come forward and say to the hell listen your father owes me so and so these are the documents or you say this is my word for it I have witnesses and they must give him the loan or the debt before distributing the inheritance because the last thing you do is you distribute the inheritance there are three things you do before that and it is combined in the word tattoome in Arabic TD oh oh wow m when a person dies for things must be done first of all from his money to take the money to prepare for his funeral first thing this is studies the tea then you have to look at his debts this is the dull you have to look for the debts and pay all of us that's even this means that you pay all of his inheritance if he left only a hundred thousand is this our 200,000 pay off the hundred thousand third thing if there is enough money left look for the wha what see ya if he had left any will so if gave one third of my money to share ha seems like a la hey I'm more than pleased to take that so this is the third thing last thing is the inheritance and this is an Arabic doom 2 g's Dane will see you and me life these are the four letters in this word this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi avocado"
