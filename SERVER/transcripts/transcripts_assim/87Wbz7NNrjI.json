  "title": "What are the things that break your fast? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] can you please list all the factors which break a person's fast does vomiting and bleeding inside one's mouth cause one's fast to be broken well this question is extremely important for each and every Muslim because this is related to our own forms of worship knowledge is divided into two types knowledge that is mandatory upon every individual to learn and this is known as far buying and knowledge that is fortifier communal obligation if I know it the rest of the community are exempted from learning it if none of us learn it we're all sinful so the religion that is accepted at the side of Allah this is an information that we must know fasting Ramadan is in few days time am I obliged to fast of course I have to know the rulings of fasting it is not permissible for me to say oh I didn't know that drinking soft drinks nullifies your fasting your ignorance is unjustifiable you live in the lands of Muslims and the information is available to you it's an obligation upon you to know it zakat of livestock camels cows and sheep is it an obligatory upon me to know the portions of zakat and how to give it out in every 40 sheep there is one sheep in every five camels there is one sheep in every thirty to forty cows there is this and that is it mandated for me to know but this depends do you have livestock No I don't even know the difference in a camel in a cow there is someone in this case it's not an obligation upon you you're not a lesser Muslim if you don't know because it's not obliged Allah will not ask on the day of judgment how many sheep should we give zakat over a 40 until 120 I'll not ask you about this because you don't have them so knowing what brakes are fasting is an obligatory act upon each and every one of us because this is an obligation upon all Muslims that is too fast so what breaks my fast there are seven things that usually scholars mention when they talk about things that nullify fasting the greatest of them all is intercourse of course with the spouse not talking about zina fornication adultery I'm talking about legitimate relationship between a man√≠s wife this is totally prohibited on the daytime of Ramadan for a person who is residing and if he does or if she does that then first of all the day is void but they must maintain fasting though it's void they have to make up for that day they have to give expiation each and the expiration is to free a slave or to fast two consecutive months or to feed sixty poor person not to choose of these three but to take them gradually if you don't have a slave you have to fast two consecutive months if you're sick or unable to continue or complete these two consecutive months then you have to feed 60 per person if I'm totally broke and I cannot feed any person there's nothing for you to do so this is number one number two what takes the ruling of intercourse what is that it's known as masturbation intentionally ejaculated now having said that one would say what about nocturnal emission known as wet dreams wet dreams are not within your control when you're sleep you don't have the option or the choice whether to do this or to do that it happens so it has no impact on your fasting but to purposely ejaculate whether by masturbating by watching something that provokes you to ejaculate intentionally in this case this nullifies your fasting do I have to pay the expiration of freeing a slave fasting you can say get a month's or feeding sixty four people know you don't but it's a sinful thing and this was mentioned in Surat in marriage well the Dina homely foraging him half alone Allah when he praised the righteous people by saying that they preserve their own chastity they do not abuse their private parts in illicit and illegal sexual intercourse and then Allah says except having this with their spouses and their right hand possession and whoever transgresses and has this desire fulfilled other than that the spouses in the right hand possession then there are transgressors but Allah a Kahuna a dune so it's sinful its transgression it breaks the fasting as the majority of scholars stated so the third thing after intercourse ejaculation is eating and drinking but before we go into the issue of eating and drinking I might have to be a little bit French so people would understand that what is meant by intercourse is the actual penetration and I will not explain more than that but ejaculation is not intercourse so if a man has intimacy with his wife without penetration and he or she ejaculates this does not fall under the category of intercourse this falls under the category of masturbation if penetration takes place without ejaculating this is intercourse so they have to be careful to know the difference between the two thirdly eating and drinking so anything that a person consumes that goes into his stomach would invalidate his fasting if he does this intentionally and if he does this remembering and knowing the ruling of it even if he swallows a pill or he swallows a stone this would invalidate his fasting fourthly what takes the ruling of eating and drinking and we spoke earlier about this and this refers to anything that is nourishing your body such as glucose and the IV that people take and they can live on that for a number of days fifthly intentional vomiting and why do we say intentional vomiting because the prophet sallallahu sallam said who ever is overwhelmed and vomits unintentionally his fast is intact but whoever intentionally and deliberately vomits then he has broken his fast so for example someone fills up his stomach and all of a sudden without him intending it he has to throw out he goes and rushes to the toilet he throws out his fast is intact someone who is feeling uneasy he ate too much and he doesn't feel good he inserts his finger in his throat and he throws up his fasting is invalid because he did that intentionally whether by inserting his finger by smelling something repulsive that makes him throw up the same ruling so these this is the fifth and the sixth thing that nullify is fasting is also unintentional which is menstruation and postnatal bleeding this is something that happens to women and it's not by their choice it's something that are larger they'll decreed upon them once it happens the fast is void and they cannot fast and finally an issue of dispute which is cupping in Arabic known as pajama this is done by slashing the bottom of the neck or the back and sucking out rotten blood and this is a prophetic means of healing it is perfect for high blood pressure and for migraines those who suffer from migraines once they do this they are relieved for like five six months from their migraines and the prophet salaallah alayhi salam instructed us to do this cupping or he JAMA and he himself did it salario Salaam the scholars differ that this breaks fasting or not I'm inclined that it does not break your fasting or affected but we mention it because a great number of scholars say it does but if a person has to do the random check of diabetes or he has to take a sample of blood for lab tests does this fall under hajimete answer's no there is no problem in doing that what about blood donation well if you gotta give a pint or two of blood this takes the same ruling as hey JAMA because it would make you feel weak and weary to those who say that he JAMA breaks your fasting those who say it doesn't as long as you're still fit and able to be active and to function well then this has no impact you [Applause]"
