  "title": "What to do if Imam makes a mistake, should I follow？ assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Now, if you're praying behind an imam, and the imam stands up for an additional rak'ah that was not intended, it is not permissible for you to follow him. So for example, in Taraweeh, many times the imam prays two rak'ahs, and instead of offering the sitting position and tashahhud and the salutation upon the Prophet ﷺ, he stands up for the third rak'ah. So the followers don't know what to do. No, you should remain seated and say Subhanallah, Subhanallah repeatedly so that you would notify him of his mistakes so that he can come back and sit down. You must not follow the imam. If he shortens the prayer or prolongs the prayer, instead of praying Asr for rak'ahs, he sat on the third rak'ah, you should say Subhanallah. If he doesn't listen, you stand up and pray on your own."
