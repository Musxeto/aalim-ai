  "transcript": "khad from Morocco um so last time you told me that a half an hour ride doesn't require a when I did my researches again I found that uh the place that I want to go to is not actually uh it's a bit far it's um between 40 and 50 minutes and not just half an hour so I would like to know if it's still permissible or not it Al it all depends on what the people say if the people of tanir say that going to XY Z in Morocco is traveling because it's 50 minutes or 40 minutes then it's traveling if they say no we work and commute every day and go two three times a day without any problem then it's not traveling and Allah knows best"
