  "title": "Can I keep my deceased father's belongings even though I'm not his only heir? #allah assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sh my father suddenly passed away over 3 years ago on his bed and since then I have kept his furniture and belongings in his room exactly as they were recently we added more furniture to the house and due to limited space we need to rearrange the existing furner including his room however she I feel deeply attached to the current setup of his room and the thought of changing makes me heartbroken due to many emotional reasons so she is it permissible to hold on to such emotions and avoid rearranging his room only for this reason are you the only heir of your father or there other heirs I have one younger sister and mother yes so your mom your mom is entitled to 1/8 of whatever is in that room and your sister is entitled to onethird of the remaining after her mom's portion is taken you cannot restrict them from taking what is their right it's their inheritance if they give it to you as a gift then it is your right to keep it to sell it or to give it as a gift to those who are poor and needy and if you ask my opinion your father would use the Good Deeds if you were to sell it or if you were to give it to someone in need because that would benefit him more in his grave than merely sentimental feelings you get when you see his his furniture and stuff this is not going to benefit him rather it's always going to remind you of him and stir the sorrows and the pain in your heart which is not very normal or logical"
