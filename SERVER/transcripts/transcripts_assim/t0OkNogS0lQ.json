  "transcript": "I mean salli wa sallim ala nabina muhammad wada he was average rain dear brothers and sisters today I Mollie Kuramoto lie over here too and welcome back to a new episode of contemporary issues we have this again today in studio our special guest she hasn't been Hakeem she has a welcome Zach Miller here and thank you for having me Barak la vie comme si Hassan was one of the known well-known callers and diet was travelled extensively across the globe giving Dawa and lectures to both Muslims and non-muslims alike she has some in the last few episodes we've been talking about the issue of beautification Islam and you briefly mentioned the issue of cosmetic surgery we talked about how beautification is a form of a bada in many cases but in some cases it can be a form of disfigurement and changing the creation of Allah what about cases of surgical cause cosmetic surgery where someone has actually beautifying themselves through surgical procedures or for example someone who has a tattoo where they have a part of their skin cut deep at an ink filled in which permanently stays with them reminder hey memory little bit I mean of some lotion Obata kind of do so I mean the being a wada a do sorry a Jemaine there are two different types surgical procedures and tattooing which is considered to be a surgical procedure in a sense and if you look at the definition of tattoos its puncturing the skin and as you said filling it with ink or with special paint under the skin that lies there and becomes permanent I think it's what they call the dermis which is a layer of the skin and this act was cursed by the Prophet that I saw so that's a lesson there for is forbidden in our religion for a person to take this permanent tattoo even if even in smaller and a form it's forbidden it is forbidden because changing the color of the skin can be permissible if it is temporary it's for like a week or so like in the case in dyeing your beard or your hair and using henna to decorate a woman's hand or body this lasts for a week maximum two weeks and then it fades away but like these temporary tattoos that they have in the West where you buy some bubble gum and you get like a little sticker that you put on yeah this is okay because the duration is very minimal but there are other types of tattoos that are not permanent but they would take like six to nine months before they fade away and they take the same ruling of the forbidden tattoos and in most cases are also harmful now most likely they are harmful but even if they are not harmful we have the ruling from the Quran and from the Sunnah that forbids us from doing this the funny thing is that if you look and analyze why do people do this why do people you know alter the creation of Allah why do people impulsively do things and then they regret it so you come like 20 years later when someone is 40 or 45 years old and he looks at Sponge Bob Bob for example says oh well it was the trend those days not anymore and they would have tattoos of the girlfriends and the loved ones who lived apart a week or two afterwards and they're stuck with this all of this is forbidden in Islam the funny thing is that Muslims now are picking it up which was cursed at the time of the Prophet Alice or Sam so the lesson and they're picking it up nowadays because they're influenced by the media by the pop stars by the rappers by the movies the the soap Oprah's people in the West are doing it and they tend to feel that this is a sign of beauty as we mentioned before it's not a condition for something to be completely forbidden or completely obligatory that it has to come in the Quran so if the promise I send was brought with something allah ordered us to obey him so when the process I sent him forbids something even if it's in the Sun knife is found in hadith it's still forbidden for Muslims the funny thing is that a woman from if I'm if I recall it correctly from Benny asset came to our beloved Mossad and she said that how dare you curse and forbid women from extending their hair from doing tattoos from plucking their eyebrows and he said why shouldn't I curse those whom Allah has cursed she said I've read the whole Quran from cover to cover and I have never find found anything like this said it's in the Quran she said where he coated the ayah where Allah soldier says when whatever the Prophet Alice Islam brings to you you should follow and whatever he forbids you from doing you should abstain and refrain from doing that and he said and the Prophet area salatu salams was said that these women are cursed so the woman looked at after longest-running since she said and she doubted it because like a lot of the people do nowadays maybe your wife does this and you're saying that the Prophet cursed women who do this well maybe your wife does this he told her go and check my wife so the woman went into his house and checked his wife and came back and she said by Allah she's not doing anything of the forbidden things that you've mentioned in the hadith and I'm the lover so it said by Allah if she if she hadn't or if she had done these things that the Prophet had cursed Ali sauce on a person she wouldn't have been my wife so we see a common trend even from the time of the Sahaba of the unknown male lovely pleased with them that people take the actions of the majority as the norm they say well everybody does it so how could it be forbidden and this is a false way of thinking isn't it it is now we as Muslims have a responsibility to follow the Quran and the Sunnah not to follow the mass of the people not to follow the majority we follow the Quran and the Sunnah because Allah will ask us on the day of judgment about this and these tattoos are considered to be changing the creation of Allah and they are cursed by the authentic hadith through the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam in life and there's no reason for us to do this and I've seen people who have small tattoos on their hands some of them have their tattoos on their cheeks or on their chins and when asked they replied that this is a sign of the Welli we follow so it's even worse than tattooing it's and it's like branding this human being to be the follower of XYZ and usually it includes a lot of associating others with Allah like grave worshiping etc so it adds bad things to worse things as in the case of tattooing as the Shaitaan misleads people in small steps yes and this is why the allah mentioned that it is do not follow the steps of the Shaitaan because a step is short it's not a long lengthy thing so by following small steps of the Shaitaan this this would lead us to things that are major and more forbidden than these small steps that's how I reckon particle commercial if we can get onto the issue then of cosmetic surgery some humans or some people they use different parts whether it be of their own human body or parts of other human bodies or even some cases parts of animals for corrective means where they have a defect is this forbidden one of the types of cosmetic surgeries essentially speaking you have to always refer back to the two criterias mentioned earlier that is we should not change the creation of Allah for the purpose of beautification this is not permissible in Islam unless it is to restore what was there originally and to remove a defect so for example if we have someone that was born with a defect abnormality can we change this someone who has a something in his lip some children are born the doctor explained that in his report but I don't keep his terminologies by heart so if the child is born with a lip that is not normal can we corrected this surgically the answer is yes if someone has something that needs to be fixed a hip deformity something in the legs finger an extra finger or extra finger that you you have to remove this if you have a missing finger and you would like to transplant something like that this would be also permissible so such correctional procedures are permissible in Islam because they are not altering the creation of Allah but rather restoring a las creation and making things normal if someone has is born without a nose and we give him yeah that means the transplant or give him a nose yes and and make him look normal this is permissible in Islam radical aviacode like the issue of I believe there was a woman who was mauled by a chimpanzee in the States recently and her it left her face deformed so she had some corrective surgery to make her look more normal again so in that case of that word happened to a Muslim it would also be permissible if I'm not mistaken the woman was in France and who was a pit bull that might have been no no there's another case that had probably well this yes that and and and they it was like about nine months ago or a year ago they had to transplant a whole face they did not correct it see restructuring is different they had to transplant a whole face to that woman so that she could look normal again in such cases definitely it is permissible because it be considered desirable even it is because it would restore the confidence to a person's self and secondly it would make him look normal again and help them to continue interaction on a social level in a normal way and this goes and cascades to all accidents that a person is his misfortune leads him to and causes him to suffer injury or he needs maybe a facial structure restructuring so that he would look normal again not a cliche cliche Allah will continue but just after the break was Sarah wanna come what allahi wa barakato you amazing stories in this program we get to know about people of the past whose stories were mentioned in the Islamic tradition and related by the Prophet peace be upon him that verily us meaning Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala we tell you about the best of the stories we tell you about the best of the stories when we narrate a story when we read a story when we try to benefit from a story what we are trying to do in reality is to go back through the steps through the different parts and sections of the story until the story is actually completed and that we can take the actual benefit directly from the story sheikh lotfi will narrate these stories in his program amazing stories a lost panel Ouattara ordered one of the lenss to come closer the destination a mosque panel that ordered one whole city to come closer to move closer to this dead person amazing stories in ramadan on jota TV Oh assalamualaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh and welcome back sir Hasan we were just discussing the issue of cosmetic surgery and replacing limbs that have been lost or removing limbs that it might be extra in some cases or some deformities does do these procedures have an origin in the Quran and Sunnah that would point to their permissibility well actually it falls under the general guidelines of correcting what is wrong and there's also a hadith where a man fought with the Prophet that I saw Salaam in one of the battles and his nose was chopped off so in order to correct this the Prophet Allah saw Salam allowed him to take a nose made of silver and attach it to his face so that he would look normal and the man did so but after a while as you know silver once in touch or in contact with fluid it becomes rotten it gives it gets green and it has a bad smell to it so the man complained to the Prophet of Islam and the Prophet allowed him to take a golden nose and so he did this hadith is the basis for correcting what's need to be corrected even by attaching artificial limbs as in the case of this companion of the Prophet Allah says Allah so would this extend to the limbs of animals or humans can people use limbs from other dead individuals or from animals now that the issue of organ transplant is a wide issue but to address the first question which is can a person use organs from animals for example the majority of scholars say that if the animal is permissible for us to consume and to eat if it was properly slaughtered it's halal then yes we can use this because if we can consume it we can use it not like a pork or some or generally speaking but if it is necessary to use shut such an organ for example I've read a research stating that some valves of the heart the most suitable valves to be changed or to transplant is from taking from porks so if this is true and actual and there's no other animal that can substitute or be as good and efficient as the the valves or the arteries taking from the pork then it becomes permissible to use because of the necessity not a closed vehicle we'd like to go on further in this issue but perhaps at a later date if all our permits we mentioned you mentioned the the verse about how a lot of people slitting their ears as was mentioned in the Quran but nowadays when we'll see people slitting their ears but rather piercing them day they cut a hole through the ear and then they stick in a earring likewise they do so for their nose and other body parts what is the Islamic view on this issue some scholars said that this is not permissible because it is altering the creation of Allah and it's torturing an individual without any legitimate purpose but the majority of scholars say that it is permissible for a woman to pierce her ears and the evidence backing this up is the hadith where the profit that is salatu salam after giving the hot butt of eight he went with bilal to the women because they were far away from men they didn't have any loudspeakers and he gave them a hook before their own and he encouraged them to give money for charity and the hadith goes on that they started taking their bracelets and their earrings and throwing it to the Prophet Allah so some as form of charity which meant that this was a trend of women at the time and this is the general thing worldwide women pierce their ears for beautification so if it was present to the time of the said him and he didn't specifically forbid it like he did about the plucking of the eyebrows or extensions of the hair or tattoos then it's permissible definitely true because this is where we take our religion from from the teachings of the prophet alayhi salatu salam versus having said that about piercing the ears some would say okay is it permissible to have two earrings in one ear so pierce it twice per three times the answer would be nothing prevents it unless it is imitating the disbelievers the non-muslims but are not specific to them yes but if not it's a form of beautification it's permissible going back to your question unfortunately now a days people are extending this a bit further so their peers their noses as in the case of India and the subcontinent and they considered this to be forms of beautification or their lips even in some cases well now if you go to Europe on end and to the States you'd find horrific things you'd find people loosing their lips you find people pushing their tongues people cursing their nipples and the private parts and places you'd never imagine and there's no reason for doing this so all of such mutilations are considered to be forbidden because it's harmful it is baseless and it's not form of beautification it's form of standing in the out that's it's a form of being unique for them yes and this is forbidden in Islam because being unique means that you would do things others don't do just for the fame just for the heck of it and this is unacceptable in Islam it's forbidden to stand out in the crowd so if someone decides if I come tomorrow and I'm wearing this pink Lutra on my head and this is what you I'd like to be unique this is forbidden Islam it's called thuggish aura it's that's the fame the dress of fame so that people would know that you are standing out of the crown like what a certain woman who choose to wear certain clothes to stand out I remember reading once a question and a fatwa regarding a woman who lives in Morocco and wished to wear the niqab and the estelle as they wear it in the garage or as they were in Egypt for example and they said no you should wear it as the women of your country wear as long as you're fulfilling the obligations of the hijab because the object of the habits I have people look away from you not to look at you and if she's the only one wearing it she's gonna stand out more than anything else this is true providing that she is completely covered from head to toe and there is no fitna the conditions are yes for the harem you mentioned regarding one of the essential elements of corrective cosmetic surgery that if it's done to correct a defect that's not natural but some people also have cosmetic surgery applied in cases where they have natural what they refer to as defects such as aging or wrinkles which in effect are not defects whatsoever but what about women who want to remain beautiful and pleasing for their husbands what about having these face lips and nip/tuck and all these different terms that they use to basically correct their wrinkles and their age well scholars say that having a facelift or injecting the face or parts of the body with chemicals that would remove the wrinkles like Botox or whatever no chemicals they have this is all forbidden because this is changing the creation of Allah as the suitable creation of Allah for such an age to have these wrinkles and you cannot fight this forever I've seen so many actors and actresses who are like 70 like 80 years old with continuous facelift operations they look like dolls they are even worse than dolls and to the extent that you may find some of them having their belly buttons in their necks because of the facelift that's been lifting so far and so so they look ugly yet what are they fighting this is not this is how Allah created us and they should value each phase and stage of their lives when they were kids they would not want to be old and when there are young they don't want to be kids again so they should value each and every stage of their lives having said that it is permissible in one case to have a facelifts for example and that is when a person who's 20 years old has these wrinkles which is not natural for a person in his age as you mentioned before anything that's a defect anything as out of the normal can be restored yes but if someone comes and says like I can dyeing the hair for example someone who's 40 or 50 years old and you would like to dye his hair because it's becoming white no sir this is the normal thing you may not do this if an 18 years old wants to dye his hair because his hair is becoming white for one reason or the other this becomes permissible does Allah had a measure so what about like using creams though I know the topics on cosmetic surgery but what about some creams that kind of hide away or take away wrinkles through through through chemicals or through natural fruit and plants again this is natural and it's something that you apply it's not a surgical procedure you're not changing the creation you're not changing it the creation because usually it has a very short effect and it's softened I don't think of any chemicals that would remove the wrinkles either it it will it's like a paint that hides the wrinkles and giving it a different color and this is not permissible generally speaking if it's a makeup that a woman puts and applies this is a different story if they put cucumbers and Kiwis so that they would make it softer and more mud and something like that this is okay because this is natural it's different than having a facelift taking care of the of the skin is permissible a woman that wants to bathe in milk for example or put applies milk on her body so that it gets it it gives it a softer and more natural look this is permissible as long as it's not being too extravagant about a claw fee from your share it's always a pleasure to have you on the show unfortunately we're just about out of time thank you very much for joining us a bear claw vehicle and we hope to see you again next week what ceremony comb warahmatullahi wabarakatuh
