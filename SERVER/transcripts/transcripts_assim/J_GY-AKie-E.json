  "transcript": "ibraim from guine ibim hope that you are doing well alhamdulillah Allah bless you and your family and yours as well yesterday I was basically the driver for my father and uh we were in the car and I was driving he was with two of his other friends in inside their conversations well there were some backbiting happening and uh basically I want to know if I'm involved in that sin even though like I'm kind of minding my business yes a passive person who is listening to people backbiting is part of that sin unless they are random people that you don't know about but if it's your father and his friend you diplomatically and politely change the conversation tell them did you see the match yesterday between Brazil and Zimbabwe or tell them about what has happened last night or what do you expect to happen in the coming future in regards of this or that so change the topic politely rather than stay passive and listen to them back bite"
