  "title": "When do I stop praying : when my water breaks or when labor starts? #islam #islamic assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I am pregnant my question is when my L starts and my water breaks should I stop praying salad then or should I stop when the Blood starts flowing the scholars say that as long as the blood did not come out and the labor did not start then you're obliged to pray sometimes the labor takes uh 6 hours may Allah make it easy for you and through these 6 hours there's no blood coming out yes the water broke out but you don't have any bleeding so you're obliged to pray after 6 hours once you give birth and you finish your uh postnatal bleeding period and you're pure you have to make up for that missed prayer or prayers but if you start to see the bleeding whether the water broke down broke out or I don't know what's the proper word to say it uh or not but but the bleeding is for the postnatal bleeding it's accompanied by the uh labor contractions and and the likes in this case this is postnatal bleeding and you're Exempted from any prayer afterwards and Allah Knows Best"
