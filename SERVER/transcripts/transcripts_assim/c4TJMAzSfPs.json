  "transcript": "CD from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. How are you Sheikh? I'm doing great Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Sheikh, is teaching and learning Aqeedah more important than Fiqh? This is not a clear cut question because Aqeedah is so vast and big and Fiqh is so vast and big. And in both sciences there are essentials that are extremely important for your Islam and there are elements that are communal obligation. It's not mandatory for you to learn. So the parts that are part of your Iman and Islam that is a must in Aqeedah, you have to learn this. You have to learn what are the six pillars of Iman, to believe in Allah, the Day of Judgment, the angels, the messengers, the books or scriptures, and the divine decree whether good or bad. This is essential for the essence of your Iman to be a Muslim. This is the minimal requirement. What's beyond that is a communal obligation. If you don't know it, you're okay, you're still a Muslim. If I go to the jungles of Africa or to the mountains of Siberia or to the Amazons and I see Muslims, they may not know the details of Aqeedah that we know. This doesn't impact their Islam. How many gods do you have? One, La ilaha illallah. Is there life after death? Yes. Is there heaven and hell? Of course. Is there torment in the grave? 100%. Do you believe in the straight path over hellfire? Yes. They know all of this. So they're Muslims. Now when we come to fiqh, they have to know the essentials, the five pillars of Islam. But they may not need to know hajj, how is it performed, the technicalities, what is a pillar, what is mandatory and what is sunnah. But when it comes to prayer, they have to know what are the five prayers, how to perform wudu, how to pray, what nullifies and breaks their wudu, what to do when you make a mistake, memorizing one surah or fatiha as a must, what to say in ruku and sujood. These are essentials. So you can't say which is more and more important because these are essentials for your Islam. So I hope this makes sense and Allah knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And by Allah's will, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
