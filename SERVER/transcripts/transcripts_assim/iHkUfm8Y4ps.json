  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (10) - Things that worried him - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "as a perfect human being the prophet Allah was like every one of us a person who had things that occupied his thinking that worried him and each individual has things that worries him some of us may worry about the future and what it may carry some is worried about what to have for iftar today or what to have for sure all what they care about is their stomach how good or how bad the food is some worry about gaining money regardless whether from Halal or Haram and they spend hours plotting and strategizing and trying to collect and hoard money even if they have to deal in riba or accept and give bribes or cheat people no problem these are their worries others worry about womenizing or partying or drinking intoxicants or doing drugs and this is all what occupies their minds a lot of the Muslims are addicted to social media they worry when is the next time I'm going to be on Tick Tock or YouTube and watch endlessly filth and Haram things this is what they worry about what you worry about defines you it tells people who you really are and the prophet Allah worries we're not close to these things at all they were not overworldly matters rather they were about what pleases Allah azzawajal the most thing that preoccupied the prophets thinking and worried him a lot is how to get people into Islam Allah says in the Quran then perhaps you would kill yourself through grief over them o Muhammad if they do not believe in this message and out of Sorrow this would cause you harm because it engaged him physically and mentally sallallahu alaihi wasallam Imam may Allah have mercy on his soul said that the prophet salallahu was so Keen on Guiding people to Islam that he did all what he was capable of doing he who used to be happy and jubilant when people are guided and he used to become sad and filled with sorrow over those who reject his call out of pity over them out of Mercy for them and this is why Allah ordered him not to preoccupy himself feeling sorry over them to that extent the prophet Allah was worried a lot for people not to enter Hellfire and this is why he wanted to guide them he cried his level best to save everyone his uncle Abu Talib whom he lived with for decades did all what he could so that no harm would reach him but he could not accept Islam until it was his dying moment on his Deathbed the prophet kept on going to him saying to him o prophet of Allah say foreign testify that there's no God worthy of being worshiped except Allah a word a phrase I would testify in front of Allah for you and for you in your favor just say it and next to his bed is they kept on discouraging him and saying to him would you abandon the religion of your father Abdullah and your ancestors so he was hesitant between the prophet salallahu encouragement and the discouragement of these two disbelievers until he said and that was his final words that he is following the religion of Abdul muttalib meaning that he's unwilling to say the shahada the prophet said by Allah I will keep on asking Allah to forgive you until Allah prohibits that and denies me that so Allah revealed the verse in Surat a tawba that it is not permissible for the prophet and those believing to ask forgiveness for Idol worshipers even if they were related to them after it was obvious that they are among the hell dwellers in another incident it shows you how the prophet was carrying this worry for the whole entire ummah the prophet visited a Jew boy who used to sometimes do some errands for the prophet he used to serve the prophet though he was a Jew so he felt sick and the prophet went to visit him and he sat next to his head worried that this boy might die and Enter Hell so he called him to Islam and said to him accept Islam the boy looked at his father and the Jew father said to him obey Abel qasim obey the prophet so the boy said accepted Islam and he died the prophet came out of the house with his face lit out of joy and happiness and said Grace be and praise be to Allah azzawajal who saved the boy from Hell Fire because of me the prophet also Allah carried the heavy weight on his chest worried for his ummah what will happen to them personally I care only for myself I don't care about my family about my children all what I care is that I'm good I'm healthy I'm wealthy I am having a full stomach this is the attitude of a selfish person he cared for the whole entire ummah once he was reading few verses of the Quran a verse from the Quran that Ibrahim said and another one that Risa peace be upon him said talking about Allah's forgiveness to those who disobey him and how merciful he is so the prophet could not hold back himself and he started weeping and tears came from his eyes raising his hands saying oh Lord my ummah my um this is what he was worried about so Allah asked jibril to go and Allah knows ask Muhammad what is happening why is he weeping so when the prophet told jibril that he was concerned of the future of his ummah and jibril told Allah azzawajal Allah told jibril to go back to the prophet and say to him o Muhammad we will please you with your ummah and never disappoint you so don't worry this is a promise from Allah azzawaja people nowadays in Ramadan care a lot for their Children's School they tend to wake them up quick there is only 5-10 minutes for the Assembly of the school you have to go and catch your school do this do that they care about worldly matters if you ask them about Fajr prayer they didn't pray okay when you woke them up for school did you order them to pray no they will pray inshallah when they come after Allah maybe after also if they have not Allah is most forgiving most merciful the prophets greatest worries or one of them was the prayer um reports that uncles of his from the among the ansar told him that once the prophet was sort of engaged in worries and deep thinking and you can see it on his face so when the companions asked what is worrying you a prophet of Allah he said it's a prayer I would like a way to assemble people and to notify them and this was before the Adan was prescribed so some of them said why not take a horn like the Jews and he did not like that and some say why don't you take the Bell like the Christians others say what about lighting fire like the fire worshipers to bring it to the people's attention the prophet did not like any of those companion went home and he was also worried for the prophet's worry it was occupying his mind and he lay on his bed half asleep half awake when he saw the vision telling him about the Azan so he went to the prophet Allah and told him I saw this vision and the man said to me to say Allahu Akbar Allahu Akbar and he told him exactly the format of the Adan and the prophet Allah was pleased with it and acknowledged that this was from Allah and he ordered Abdullah to say it and teach it to Bilal so that Bilal would call the Advan the prayer was on the prophet's mind even on his Deathbed when he would sometimes faint and when he wakes up and asks the first thing did the people pray and they say no they're waiting for you o prophet of Allah so he orders them to bring him lots of water to take a bath that would strengthen him and as he is attempting to stand up he faints again then he wakes and asks about a prayer and he asks for water again and takes a bath and goes on and on because he's concerned about the prayer to the extent that according to Ali may Allah be pleased with him says that the last words that the prophet sallallahu gave to us the last instructions was be careful and observe the prayers observe the prayers and take care of the slaves you have under your control be kind to them be dutiful to them feed them and clothe them these are the two things that the prophet saws last instructions or commands to the ummah and the prophet saws was also careful to unite the ummah not on nationalism not on tribalism rather until hate and this is the strength of the Muslim ummah don't look at these divided Nations that we have today each one of them is keen on their own power and sovereignty not on Islam while the prophet Allah focused on uniting the holum under the flagship of the Heat and this is why on his Deathbed when he woke up after suffering from the Pains of death he says May the curse of Allah fall upon the Jews and the Christians why they took the graves of their prophets as places of worship and this is why they worship their prophets they take them as gods they consider them as Saints and they swear by them and they have statues of them so the prophet Allah is cursing the Jews and the Christians in front of the Muslims so that they do not follow suit and whoever does will have the curse of the Prophet sallallahu falling upon him and this is why his grave was not made as a shrine he was buried underneath his bed in Aisha's house not in the Masjid not anywhere else whatever he died he was battered and this is why mother Aisha says it was not taken as a shrine or would be made above the Earth it was a normal grave the prophet salallahu also feared and he was worried that is ummah would fight over Dunya and he said to them by Allah it's not poverty that I fear for you rather I fear that Allah opens this Dunya and gives you from its adornment wealth and health as was done with the Nations before you and this would lead you to compete over it like they've competed before you and it would destroy you as it had destroyed those before you among the people that the prophet salallahu was worried from and he relayed this worry to his ummah warning them are those imams who misguide people the prophet said Allah the most I fear and this worries him the most thing I fear for my ummah is the misguiding imams there are imams may have knowledge may be articulate but they are misguiding the ummah whether they do this for money or for authority or to please those in authority so they don't care about what pleases Allah azzawajal rather they bend the rules if not break them in order to serve their hidden agendas and this is what the prophet Assam was worried about also the prophet salallahu used to care a lot for his companions and among the Those whom he was always worried for the people who had nothing and I mean nothing they slept lived in the Masjid they had nothing except the clothes they were wearing so such people the prophet would always tend to give them whatever is extra whether it's food as in the Hadith please with them when he was starving and he fell on his face out of starvation when the prophet met him and he helped him to get up and asked him to follow him went to one of his houses and found that there is a glass of milk that's only food in all the prophets houses so Abu hurairah was happy thinking that finally I'll have something to put into my stomach it was this bad so the prophet told him go to the Masjid and call the people of sufa and they were about 70 or 80 men said he goes lunch and they came and Bismillah they all drank from the same glass and it was still full and then he handed it to Abu hurairah and Abu hurairah drank his fill and then said wallahi there is no place for anything else o prophet of Allah it shows you that the prophet worried immensely about these poor Companions of his and sometimes he cared for individuals like said in the battle of uhud when the battle ended or was about to end and the prophet sent one of his companions to check on sad where is sad I don't see him I don't hear his voice and he found him giving his last breaths and he asked him the prophet is saying to you how are you and he said read salaam upon the prophet Allah give him my Salam and say to him I'm finding the scent of Jannah I'm so close so prophet of Allah I can feel I can smell the perfume of Jannah and this shows you that even on the battlefield the prophet Islam was worried for his companions and the prophet Allah always worried for all of his companions you know you remember we talked about the 70 ansar who were ambushed and killed in how he remained for a whole month making Dua against the tribes that ambushed them and killed them because of his worry for them finally made lots and lots of Dua to Allah azzawajal which we should also follow suit and among what he used to make in a long Dua he used to say [Music] oh Allah do not make this Dunya the greatest of our worries and we have to analyze what is it that worries us in this life seriously sit alone with yourself and just calculate check do you worry about the car that needs to be repaired or about the bills that need to be paid or about your children how to guide them back to Islam or whether they're not doing well in school or not do you worry about your spouse or your parents do you worry about paying the rent do you worry about building a house or buying a new car all of these are natural worries but where is Your Bucket List that is related to the hereafter to what pleases Allah to what draws you closer to Jannah to what fills your grave which soon we will be inhabiting fills our Graves with favors and blessings from Allah nobody cares about this rarely you will find people even considering this in their wish list or bucket list this shows you that we are so far away from the way of the Prophet who is our role model"
