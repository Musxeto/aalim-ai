  "title": "Is marriage invalid if bride's father (wali) didn't propose to groom during nikah? How to fix this?",
  "transcript": "if my father consented and was present in my marriage however i don't recall that he verbalized or proposed to the groom is the nikah valid this is a frequently asked question so let us dissect the problem instead of giving you a fish every day let's teach you how to fish what is the format of the marriage it is a pillar of marriage to have a job and abul which is proposal from the guardian of the girl or whomever he appoints or authorizes and acceptance from the groom or whomever he authorizes to be uh um in his place so it is a must according to the four schools of thought that there is hijab and there is kabul the issue is or the difference of opinion is whether it has to be done by the guardian or not the vast majority of scholars and schools of thought say it has to be done by the guardian himself only the halafi school of thought say that it can be done by the girl herself and not necessarily the guardian but what this questioner is asking about is a different story altogether the guardian the bride the groom his father they go to the registrar or to whom we call the one who's responsible in writing the contract he does not authorize the man or the clerk he's just present and the clerk goes and addresses the girl and he says do you give yourself in marriage to this uh man and she says yes i do and he goes to the boy and says do you accept marrying this girl he says yes i do or the other way around he proposes on behalf of the girl to the boy and says do you accept her whatever her name is to be your wife he says i do and he asks the girl and she says yes i do. and they sign the papers sometimes they don't even say this format they just have a form where the father writes his name the bride writes her name the groom writes his name and they sign with the two witnesses now this according to the vast majority of scholars and schools of thought is invalid the vast vast majority why because marriage is not a game there has to be a format for it and the the guardian must utter it must say i give you my daughter aisha in marriage and the boy says i accept marrying aisha for myself whether to use an specifically this is not uh essential whatever people understand would do but he has to initiate the proposal and the groom has to accept it now we come to the one million dollar well one million kuwaiti dinar question what about the marriages that took place in the millions in the subcontinent in pakistan in bangladesh where they followed the hanafi medha do we go to them and say all of your marriages are incorrect nobody ever said that well you've just said that i didn't say that these specific marriages are invalid i said the technical and the scholarly opinion over such marriages if we go to these countries we have a different ruling why islam is one true but according to their beliefs as layman according to their following of the school of the hanafi and their belief that this is a prominent and the most authentic and they follow their own scholars and what they say we say your marriages are valid no issues in that once a person gets out of that loop and he says no i'd like to know what is the most authentic according to quran and sunnah not according to him i want to know what pleases allah in this case we say to him well you have to rectify the marriage so it would fall into place then he says oh sheikh what about my children i have six of them they're all born out of wedlock said no no no no don't mix apples with oranges the marriage when conducted was valid according to your belief so your children are legit according to your belief now that you know they're still your children and they're still born out of a legitimate marriage but you need to rectify the marriage contract in a very easy way no need to go to the court or to the municipality or here or there ask who's the girl's guardian today her father is that her grandfather is alive paternal or her brother or whoever is closer to her just through skype make a phone call with two witnesses your brother her brother any relatives any friends to be present and say uncle or grandfather or a brother uh we would like to uh renew our vows we would like to go on a second honeymoon and we would like to have a new marriage contract so say to me the following words i give you my sister in marriage and you say i accept boom that's it no need to renew the contract everything is kosher and legit so i hope this removes the confusion that so many people have about this issue"
