  "transcript": "there is a person sometimes he finds that things are becoming really difficult for him so he thinks his mind that perhaps because i'm so sinful and allah hates me that's why things are becoming difficult for me and when things become easy for him he thinks that perhaps my iman is low that's why allah is done testing me and now he's just making things easy for me so is this thinking negative about bulla first of all tests people according to what may avail their true nature so when allah azza wajal tests an individual with poverty this does not mean that allah hates him and when allah tests an individual with wealth or health it doesn't at all mean that allah loves him this is merely a test and if you look at surat al-fajr you will find this clearly mentioned that when a man is given wealth he would say allah is honoring me and when he is deprived from such wealth he says allah is insulting me no this is not the case to think whatever calamity falls upon you is due to your sins that's a good sign because it would encourage you to do good deeds to repent to allah and to quit these sins so that's a good positive feeling however when allah grants you wealth and health to think that allah is pulling your legs and that allah is doing this to punish you that's thinking negatively of allah whatever your blessed with it's a gift from allah yes if you're sinful and allah is giving it to you and the more sinful you are the more allah is giving it to you then you should be afraid but if you're praying on time you're fasting you're doing your level best to be a good muslim and allah is giving you these blessings you should be grateful thankful to allah and do whatever you can without thinking negatively of him as zawajal"
