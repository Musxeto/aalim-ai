  "title": "Is it Halal to pay taxes & custom fees for transporting goods from one country to another?",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Holland I would like to thank you for your videos because \nthey've really benefited me - Alhamdulillah So I have a question I have a company, and I'm \ntrying to export goods from Europe to Vietnam,   and at the border of Vietnam they charge \nme a customs fee around 300 per box,   if I do not pay the fee maybe they \nwill seize the goods or make the   import difficult for me so should I pay \nthe customer fee and is my business Halal? Okay so first of all, Islamically it is not \npermissible to charge taxes and custom fees   because this is my money, if \nI import a car, if I import   furniture and I bought a thousand dollars for \nthis, who gives you the right to charge me ten   percent, fifteen percent, call it whatever you \nwant to call it, this is my god-given right,   this is my hard-earned money and this \ngoes for everyone Muslims and non-Muslims,   now I won't go into details or talk about \nthings that are way above my pay grade,   some say that if these foreign countries \ntake tariffs we should treat them as well,   I would not go into this, I'll go to our level as \npoor people, so if I am a merchant and I produce   or manufacture pens, and I ship it to another \ncountry, in order for me to clear it from the   customs I have to pay taxes, or I have to \npay custom fees and this is for everyone,   therefore for me as a normal person there's \nno problem in that because I am obliged to   do it by law, you can pay this amount of money \nand this is totally Halal for you In Sha Allah."
