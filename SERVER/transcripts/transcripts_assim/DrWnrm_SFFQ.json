hakuna matata team beta were cooled a bit the heightened ba-da-da-da were cool Nevada that until now allah azza wajal has praised his messengers and prophets peace be upon them in the quran and has described them with certain characteristics that we as muslims are encouraged to have them in us to implement them in our lives Allah Azza WA JAL says in the Quran verily they used to hastened on to do good deeds and they used to call on us with hope and fear and used to humble themselves before us one of the prominent characters characteristics of the messages of Allah and of the believers is the fear of Allah Azza WA JAL and usually a person falls in this in the state of fear either because he has committed something that he may be punished for or he abandoned abandoned something that is man the cherry which eventually will lead to his torment and Punishment but also there is another cause of fear and that is the greatness of the one you fear and when it comes to allah azza wajal all these types of fear are found so we fear our shortcomings and sense we fear our failure in doing what Allah has commanded us to do but mostly we fear allah azza wajal because he is worthy of being feared and fearing allah azza wajal is a sign of knowledge those who fear Allah are most knowledgeable of him allah azza wajal says it is only those who have knowledge among his slaves that fear allah in the ayaats of la moneda Hindu Dharma and this is what our prophet alaihi s-salatu wa sallam used we iterate over and over again whenever an incident happens he tells them by Allah I am the most knowledgeable of you all and I'm the most fearful of him because knowledge and fear go side by side and this is why only ignorance would fall into sin time after time even if they hold the highest academic degrees in Islamic studies so if a person has a PhD or more from Medina University from an s hub from jamia to Imam yet he's simple he's daring to abandon what Allah has ordered him to do he falls into sin without any shame in his face then let it be known that he is ignorant fearing Allah Azza WA JAL is something that each and every one of us must have otherwise he will not enter Jenna there are those who claim that they fear allah azza wajal yet they display their ignorance through falling into sin and unfortunately allah has see their hearts so even if they are giving advice they would not adhere and they will think that Allah is talking to someone else not to me the advice befits others but not me Allah Azza WA JAL has told us about the benefits of fearing him and among the highest of these benefits is entering Jenna those who fear allah with enter Jenna and this is a million dollar question that each of us must ask himself why are you still living on earth what is your purpose what is your mission and vision statement is it to become rich is it to have a house is it to get married is it to be come prominent in your position or your career then you have it or you've got it all wrong your meal and so objective is to enter paradise and everything comes as a consequence everything comes as a bonus but your main objective is to enter general otherwise you have failed miserably Allah tells us about this beautiful benefit when he says but as for him who feared standing before his Lord and restrained himself from impure evil desires and lusts verily paradise will be his a dog may Allah make paradise mine and your adults as well among the benefits of feeling upon as the agenda is that the fear of Allah burns away all your desire and lusts that go against a laws will because you fear that you will be punished if you fall into them what restrains me and you from doing something harm because there is punishment it is like and we are in a hospital it is like when someone gives you honey but inserts into it poison the taste is beautiful but the effect and the consequence is horrific would anyone attempt to consume this honey with poison in it definitely not and likewise our desires and lusts that are prohibited we have the attempt to do it but when we remember al juez wrath and torment we refrain from that among the benefits of fearing allah azza wajal in this dunya is that when you fear allah truly and sincerely allah azza wajal will cast upon you his light allah who cast upon you this respect where everything on earth would fear you as well as a result so when you fear Allah everything else respects you and feeds you while if it is the opposite and the other way around those who do not have full telecoil on allah azzawajal they do not trust Allah so they fear their bosses they fear their spouses they fear their neighbors they fear everyone else to the extent that they may fall into sin not creating a Mazda budget in this case Allah would make them afraid of everything on earth that is why those who fear allah azza wajal always have a heart that is content that is pleased because they only feel a lot the almighty so what effort ever happens on earth it's okay because they are okay with allah azza wajal not the other way around and when it comes to fear muslims treat and deal with fear differently there are those who went into extreme in fearing allah azza wajal to the extent that their fear became crippling and this is negative fear they reach a level they were so afraid to the extent that they have fallen into despair in arabic it's known as el yes so they despair this is no matter what we do Allah would admit us to Hellfire and as a consequence they will leave worshipping Allah they will consume more and more sins because what's the use if even if we pray even if we fast above throw us in hell so might as well enjoy life this kind of despair or negative fear is prohibited a masses and the and and who despairs of the mercy of Allah and who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except those who are astray so whoever despairs has gone astray and will end up in Hell fire they are on the up other side those who do not fear Allah truly so it's they are completely the opposite they claim and pretend to feel allah azza wajal but actually they are sinful they are indulging in what displeases Allah Azza WA JAL we see so many of the Muslims after taraweeh prayer for example they come to pray taraweeh and during salat they weep they cry and they come out of taraweeh prayer and they start smoking outside the masjid and when you speak to one of them is that now I have to go there is a movie I have to catch and then listen to music and their cars and their women are not properly covered and they don't have any problem with free mixing yet they claim they fear allah azza wajal and this is why this kind of cold fear is not beneficial when you see a Muslim indulging in dealing with RIBA interest money when you see a Muslim falling into sin after sin when you find the Muslim bribing or taking money unlawfully from his company when you see a Muslim or a muslima a female there are not way the proper Islamic clothes that Allah has ordered them to do in this case you know and acknowledge that these people are not true fearful of allah as diligently this is why the scholars of old times used to say a person who cries and wipes his eyes is not someone who's fearful a true fearful person is the one who leaves away the things that Allah would punish him for so if you cry and wipe her eyes and you continue to sin you're not fearful a true fearful person even if he does not cry is the one who withholds himself the strings himself in falling into sin or from not doing what Allah Azza WA JAL has mandated upon him this is what is known as the positive fear the one that drives you to Jenna the prophet said Elizabeth wa sallam whoever is afraid will travel at night the Arabs used to travel at night because it's colder the weather is cool and they can escape any enemy from detecting them while if you travel at the daytime the enemy can see you and at the same time it's hard so the Prophet says whoever wants to escape who it was ever fearful he will travel at night and whoever travels at night will reach his destination let it be known that a large merchandise is expensive and a large merchandise is Jenna so in order to each Jenna you have to strive you have to work hard and you have to do your level best to fear not to be deprived from entering it I say what you hear and I ask and pray to Allah Allah to forgive my sins and as well so ask allah for forgiveness al hamdulillah have a banana me wahoo - Eddie Keller wash Edwin Managua rasullullah sallallahu aleyhi wa d he was a big woman today we had yet Western a vicinity de l'homme ET roberta ma as mentioned earlier fear can be crippling and negative but the fear that Allah is ordering us to have is the positive one it is the fear that drives us to Jannah and it is the fear that makes us progressive and productive in our lives so the fear that we're supposed to have is not the one that would make us stay home network not learn not be active this is not positive the positive fear is that makes you progressive and productive that makes you mix with the people and cotan to allah azzawajal it is the fear that makes you draw a line so that you would never cross because you know that crossing this line makes you transgressive makes you committing a sin fearing allah azzawajal is what the enemies of islam could be them and blaming Islam for they say your religion is all on fear and this is a big lie our religion is based on two wings the wing of fear and the wing of hope you hope in Abbas mercy you are filmed with loving allah azzawajal but at the same time you're fearful of him and anything on earth you are afraid of you run the opposite direction when you see a lion you run away from it everything you fear on earth you run away from it except allah azza wajal when you fear him you run to him allah azza wajal says so flee to Allah verily I am a plain Warner to you from him fulfil rule in Allah you need a common word a deal will be the only thing you run to when you're afraid is of God Almighty because you know that he has the comfort of your heart he has the provision the sustenance of you and your family on this earth there is no escape for you from allah azza wajal so the only option you have is to fear him to love him and to hope for the best from him and unfortunately the majority of Muslims are not fulfilling this we are not doing this in our lives due to our ignorance if you ask the Muslims about elections about riots about politics about economy about arts and movies you'll always find an answer but when you ask them about the beautiful names of allah azza wajal what do you know about the one who you are worshipping how many names of Allah can you memorize can understand the meaning this is a big problem when you travel to a foreign country you take all the information needed about it how is it possible that we face Allah five times a day at least in prayer and we do not know Allah as the agenda this is why we fail to fear Allah as he ordained and as he commanded us to do therefore I conclude my hope by praying to allah azza wajal that he guides me and you to the right way of feeding him whether in public or in secret because usually fearing allah in public is easy the biggest problem is when you fear allah azza wajal behind black behind closed doors the biggest problem is that when you fear allah in a foreign country when no one sees you except allah if you truly adhere and fear him and hope for the best from him then let it be acknowledged that you are a true fearful person Imam al-fulani come now well I see that I work for and now what I would learn a billion idea take over that arena I'm reading these drugs in Arabic because it's difficult for
