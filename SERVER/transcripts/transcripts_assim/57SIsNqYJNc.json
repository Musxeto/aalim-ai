  "transcript": "Nazli from Azerbaijan Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh, I saw on the internet that if a woman during menstruation makes the intention not to perform Salah because if she does it, it would be as a sin, then she receives a reward from this. Is it permissible or not? Again, please. If a woman prays while in her menses? Like, I saw on the internet that if a woman during menstruation makes the intention not to perform Salah because if she does it, it would be as a sin, then she receives a reward from this. Is it permissible? No, this is not permissible. She is refraining because her prayer is invalid. If she prays, she's sinful. So she's not praying because it's haram. It's defying sharia to pray while in the state of menses. So I don't have to go to that extent, which is, I'm intending not to pray so that I'm rewarded. Rather, I just stop praying because Allah told me not to pray. As simple as that. But to go to the extreme of making intentions and then breaking your intention, and this confuses people. My intention is, I don't pray because Allah ordered me not to pray. Full stop, and you will be rewarded for that."
