  "title": "Is playing PUBG Kufr /blasphemous? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "ramla's third question is about a fatwa from one scholar who said that playing pubg p ubg it has a long name to it is kufur and blasphemous and to my knowledge i haven't played this game i haven't seen it before but i think that this scholar is referring to an update to the game where they have or where they inserted a certain idol that you have to go to as a player and bow to and offer sacrifice in order for him to give you special powers or for it to allow you to go to the second or the following stage if i'm not mistaken and this caused a lot of uh problems in the muslim world and lots of the scholars have complained about it and to my knowledge that those who designed it removed it if i'm not mistaken maybe it's another game so if the sheikh was referring to this yes this is kufur but playing it is not kufur it's a major sin see we cannot and this is a very important issue we cannot say to everything that we see that this is kufur and implemented on individuals there is general kuffar whoever prostrates to an idol is a kafir there's no problem in that but to see tom or ahmed or john prostrating to an idol and condemn them as kufur we have to be a bit patient and taking it slow and verify what they are doing maybe they would say that we were not prostrating we dropped our sunglasses and we're looking at it and you thought that we were um prostrating maybe they think that this is not an idol and they're praying to the direction of mecca and there are so many reasons so there are conditions to be fulfilled there are obstacles to make sure that they do not exist before we give the label of takfir so people who play such games are definitely sinful if they disbelieve in such idols or in such powers that they're being given but they just played for the fun of it it's a major sin but if they believe that this idol does give life after death or does give benefits or does do things other than allah azzawajal this is shirk but nobody does this so we have to be a bit careful before jumping to conclusions and allah knows best you"
