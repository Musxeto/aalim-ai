  "transcript": "people saw a high rpm I mean tomorrow I will send my dad your son is naive all the praises to Allah I can be at peace and facing the opponent as rapid mohammed salameh ha video 7 and office latest brothers it's really a great pleasure for us tonight for us as a team to learn from him something each other our religion this is a really under there is the physical form a graduate and we all here to greet each other winner from each other each other with our best to have this lecture monthly each other of course your presence will make it if you don't tell we will cancel our core activities so we have to be here to support each other each other we have to seek the knowledge and numbers will be taken from the ulema and the back bar on the feet so I'm very happy to have as many with us tonight and we will speak each other for a while they will have to give an air to aims will leave before each other before that but make sure you have any questions to write it down from now prepare the machine also an answer it was Chancellor victory for maybe another subject related to this issue what the heroes you do what compulsion as an [Music] LeVar Burton Delaney nabina muhammad aha moment weekend he was television Natalie Villa did a mother the topic of town heat is very important and this is a cliche that we hear in our lectures so whenever I want to talk about the importance of buying a car through lease-to-own I would begin by saying to know the rules and regulations of this to all is very important and if you want comfortable marital issues its were the most important issues but seriously when it comes to no heat it is the most serious topic and issue a Muslim can discuss can learn can try to contemplate upon why because now he is what makes it or breaks it you cannot enter gender unless you have beauty we eat and this is a fact don't be delusional if you're a teeter is shaky and if you breach that they we eat the Covenant that is between you and Allah soldier you end up in hell forever no matter how nice you are no matter how kind and loving and generous you are you end up in hell so before we go into the topic now Sheikh Abu Hamza says that we will finish it in Shaba before and on with the questions and answers and I got and that is maybe laughing gamma bomb two hours after mother this topic is very important the topic of therapy and we can spend the whole night literally just introducing it why first of all though heat comes on is stemmed from the verb what happened so when we say ba meaning one a hat the only so though he is a terminology that is first of all originating from the hadith of the Prophet release of Abu Salam when he addressed Murat in the German when he sent him to Yemen and he told him and if they make the heat for in Wagga boo if they devote their worship to imagine alone so it was used initially by the Prophet is awesome however nowadays we find that there is serious offense against the word to heat against the world Ikeda against the word is Sunnah wherever you go there are people bombarding whoever uses these terminologies with extremism it is pathetic he is what happy is this is that why because if I tarnish your reputation people will not listen to you if someone tarnish is like reputations and says share Hassan is stinky maybe I am but yeah that's an example people would not listen to me if they if one says Jim Rossum is abusive he uses profanity he does this he which is why no one would listen to me so this is the way they tarnish the reputation of Islam so we have to address these issues we have to identify those who attack Islam unfortunately nowadays even some of the prominent door at the attack is to him this is not in the Quran Subhan Allah Quran is the word of a man's origin it is the book of Tony any person who gets the book of the hate Bashar have them do have and I think they distributed him for free if you read it from cover to cover you will find nothing except verses of the Quran hadith of the Prophet Elias tonsure that's it and he says no it's not in the Quran is the judge mentioned in the Quran and it's the greatest and most horrific calamity and fitna and tribulation ever to face mankind is it mention the Quran so does it have to be in the Quran so that you embrace it what are the sooner so this shows you that conduct a tilde of so many people now in order for us to be among those who are with the Prophet Allah so Allah we must understand what though he is it is not an ambiguous ambiguous word that we just throw right left and center though he is something defined there are three types of the heel toe heel toe heel toe heel rubia the window a small zipper and these are mentioned combined in what I Amazo Mattel says blogposts Emirati all of the other Bahama firewood who was probably repetitive had Darla's muda muda heeyah the three types are to hit a mentioned here Lord of the heavens and the earth this is the hidden Raghuveer and all that is between them so worship Him alone and this is the heat and glue here and be constant and patient in his worship do you know of any who is similar to him who has his names this is the bleep and asthma was deeper so in a brief introduction that is Ascension that we always refresh our memories with you should know this by heart now insha'Allah but we have to always keep on refreshing it what is the leader who will be in short worshipping allah azzawajal by unless actions what do you mean this is something that all humanity and be upon with the exception of atheists but atheists are not part of humanity so we exclude them so we talk about the rest of the world if you ask them who created the heavens and the earth yasai love God who gives us Rey who provides for us they were they would have no issues even the Christians would not tell me say Jesus created us because they know that he only came 2,000 years ago before him where was he they would not give you the answer but this is not our debate so the rhythm of OVF is to acknowledge that Allah is the creator the giver of life the taker of life Allah has provided a much the sustainer Allah Azza WA JAL who gives us fake itself this is boo-boo beer but unless actions Allah says in the Quran say Oh Haman who provides for you from the sky and from the earth or who owns hearing and sight and who brings out the living from the dead and brings out the dead from the living and who disposes the affairs they will say among the pagans the idol worshipers they admit we know that it is Alonzo Bodden number two the Hebrew here now this is known okay the video movie is known as the we need of Lord the heat of lordship the video here is the heat of worship I am identifying a lot as a virgin and devoting that heat through my own actions so it's the opposite now meaning that I will do not devote any form of worship except for Allah nostalgia whether by rhetoric or by belief or by actions so allah azzawajal says and your Lord has decreed what Allah says oh and your Lord has decreed that you not worship except him so this is final you cannot go against this this would be the cardinal sin you could go to hell forever if you devote a single form of worship other than number two other Manama as diversion then you associated others and with him and this is what allah says for a little bar worship allah i do not associate others with him . it is difficult to us it's very easy it's common sense but when you go to the people Asian when you go to the people of dargahs we devote to the people of sinks and piers they reject this listen no I believe that in defeat of lordship worship no how can i everything I do is this and this type of Turkey is where the dispute took place between the prophets and messengers and their people and to heat up lordship we have no problem they all agree but when you say to them do not prostrate to the Bible do not rub your graves and ask them for intercession sorry this is not possible and Allah Azza WA JAL told us that we did not send any messenger before you O Muhammad alayhi salatu salam but we inspired him saying la ilaha illa Ana none has the right to be worshipped but I Allah so worship me alone and none else exists in the messenger since Adam this statement was given to them so there is no ambiguity it's crystal clear you cannot worship anyone other than Allah as the water so whoever believes that their Allah is the lord of the universe Allah is the creator Allah is the sustainer and provider but he devotes some of his worship to other than him will he ever enter gender never ever sure but he is a Christian he's kind he's loving he has a good wife and a beautiful the punching Jesus he's so and so and so but he's a Christmas he knows about this time he heard about the Prophet Isis Salam dances yesterday tough luck he will not be admitted to gender because he is a character as explained to us in the Quran in so many verses coming now back to the third Pataca which is a snap was sit back so if we come to Islam was the fact we find that it is that we need to acknowledge our associate by his beautiful names and attributes and you cannot believe in this unless you learn it from the source meaning I have very big knowledgeable share and mushroom is traveled all over the world and he introduced to me a new name of Allah as devotion would that be accepted he said I want to the subcontinent and everybody cause of footer that's why they call good Hafiz so can we call him put up no way this is what because Allah Azza WA JAL has described himself by certain names and we cannot describe Allah except by the names and attributes he mister himself or his messenger by yourself that is it otherwise we will be doing a serious offenses against this part and division of the heap and you have to believe in what Allah has described yourself so if Allah describes himself by the living you cannot say no no no living is only for people people didn't die Allah did not live why because he cannot die this is pathetic a mark says that he is the living and hey that you appreciate no no no he cannot live that you are falsifying and using advice lying to you and you can scape this to all the attributes of Allah a soldier and you feel comfortable because this is the way of the Prophet that is awesome we believe in what Allah described himself without any Distortion what is the meaning of Distortion okay man and that are syste so Allah as it is upon his throne basic Arabic someone comes and he distorts the world is it Estela means Estela to conquer so why are you doing this my friend Allah says Estela to conquer Alaska has conquered the throne and everything else allah awj everything else oh he is distorting it also without any twisting or misinterpreting so you don't miss interpret anything hat Allah does not have hands Japan eternal I will just have hands yes but they look like our hands because lasagna is unlike anything we know so we confirm the attribute because Allah told us you do body abiding and he told police why did you not prostrate to what I have my two hands so they distort they they misinterpret Cynthia in Arabic it can mean my power so my hand is my power or my favor but this is misinterpreting and twisting the meaning and so on also you believe in it without any denying of its reality well how do we deny the reality like the jamia they said Allah is all-hearing but he doesn't he how is that but I saw seeing but he doesn't see so this kind of making it uneffective yeah believing in the attribute but taking its meaning from allah nazil and this is what made the seller consider this to be Kupferman do believe in this is this belief because you are actually worshiping nothing vacuum and the fourth type is you do not ask how so when we say allah has a hand you say how you are allowed to ask such a question because we believe like the seller the prophet's generation and the Companions RA sosa the traveling and the tablet every none of them ask questions none of them twisted or misinterpreted none of them denied the reality and none of them distorted the meaning they believe as it is so in essence there are more issues to it but Rishi's approaching this is the heat in a nutshell you don't know this right then what is your problem why are we suffering as Muslims on the food chain who's at the bottom of the food chain Muslims before we were predators we were the kings of the world with justice people love the when we came to them nowadays we feel growing the beat the women feel waiting then our little Danica why is that because we don't have to heal from our share well how dare you say our hearts it's filled our hearts are filled with the P we have to hit everything we do we say that in Fechter 100 times and we say in the evening as well we are the biggest oh he is around no unfortunately this is not the truth when push comes comes to shove we only talk the awesome is good in talking I'd like to see him walk the talk and how do I do this you come and scrutinize my life not that I have a good idea of the collision officer so I know how to camouflage things come and check with my wife with my kids come and check with my neighbors I will check with those who I beat them in table tennis and squash then I make them suffer and suffocate out of defeat come and see how I deal with people when I buy and said come and ask my drivers about how I deal with them if you see that okay the guy is sounds ok then you know that the head is ok now let us cascade this on the majority of Saudis everybody's darling where is the heat this is not something racial we're not discriminating I can go to Egypt and ask you to do the same I can go to Kuwait I can go to Georgia I think I can go to Palestine I will go to Syria I think we don't have to eat properly why because we just talk we don't have the implementation of the game in our hearts we don't know allah azzawajal as we supposed to do and if you take a look a quick look at the muslim world from China to Morocco even Europe now is becoming Muslim America is becoming Muslim but that Islam is a little bit unique 3.0 version and you find women leading trail of men canola comes that comes this is 3.0 version but unfortunately it has been jail jail broken this is not legal 3.0 it doesn't allow you to and it will definitely do something back who you're a man so let's take a quick look because time is is catching Swaney other than among the dark world will never be shocked I was happy bill Amana so many things all of this is chic or not do we have it like fruitcake seeking intercession through the death and appeal going to darkest journey I think Saudi Arabia baby is the only country until now shall by any means like this that does not have darkness you go to sit down equal to each Indian in Sudan there are so many honto here but among every three shrines there are two shrines in the middle there's so many you have sure you just name one and make one of your own even Morocco and he is in Jordan and Syria neva all of these dollars were stopped in the people of the reader very little and very few and you have in so many tribes as we do here we have legislation to the tribe leaders I hear sometimes in the news that in Pakistan in X Y Z country the elders decided and ruled that a 16 year old girl would be raped by free men because her brother dragged their system this innocent woman this isn't girl and we read about this a lot this is Cooper they're legislating other than almost no and Hamas is fixed so what kind of the hate are we talking about when you come to a giving offers and sacrifice and you go for mother today's for the underline and you slaughter sheep and you give them sacrifice you light candles you give some purposeful although this is considered to be when you go and look at the Muslims nowadays you can't know and when you look at them is this a Muslim or not because they're imitating the disbelievers and among our brethren when I go to him and I say Marcia or mother if I see a teenager wearing trousers and a Jersey and a cap to the side Marcia I thought for the first instance that you were Justin Bieber he's happy this is an insult but he's happy with it why because though he has been extracted it's vacuum inside thing we don't have to eat any form of sewer can pour down into it and fill it to the rim also we find that the people in times of calamity their true identity is revealed and minima does not expose us neither a mystery island after the ship masha'Allah talking about though he talking about the talking about being kind but whatever economic strikes and my income is affected my salary is gone my job is lost then I have to bend the rules rules are meant to be broken I will bend it so I cheat my brother I bring two three caffee and I said the word work and I eat their money I do this I break the law i bribe what are you doing it's a necessity in necessity committed us to eat pork and the meat and this is unfortunately seen everywhere when we start to bend the rules because of calamities we don't have trust in Allah don't you believe our eyes danezaa yes but you enter a grocery store mashallah everything who sells what you says again it's the constant cigarettes customers who spoke your provider XTC talking about Oh provides for you just Allah okay yeah yeah but still I have to sell cigarettes because customers will not come but okay and if you look around you you will find that there are many sorcerers there are many fortune tellers I know a family in ginger southeast and they come to my in-laws and they tell them listen next week we are having a two day to worship of this Mary McDonald we have coming from Morocco anything you want the wife to be divorced a wife to her husband you want the business to flourish you want to enemies to Miami I swear he didn't and then this guy goes to this for this family to things for that family and he makes phineas and go I'm in the wrong business so when I stopped it and then you find this fortune teller telling there is an app I was told today about the question about an app when it tells you what will you do what will happen five minutes and people are logging into it if you open the magazines and newspapers at the end there are the zodiacs so he scorpion his mule his this boy says this will happen and everybody looks in the medicine yes what would have a big forehead the I need to taking me to tell me whoever is born in that particular month they won't have big forehead but it's nonsense but people believe in it people believe in bad omens I haven't interviewed this morning sha Allah bismillah heaven I never him don't enter on a lot I get out of my home I find the dead cat call it off solar can come why the cat this is the opposite this is is it there or not when you see a ladder do you go underneath underneath it the majority vs is no this is by God what is this I've been to so many countries in the world when you go up a building in a hotel floor number 12 floor number 14 what is the teacher know this is not the thing - and Muslims are adapting it in Dubai when in some places they are adopting this concept it shows you that there is no tell he and unfortunately if you look at our media and the Muslim world you find them mocking Islam accusing Muslims of being terrorists fanatics extremist talking ill about the job talking ill about our beer talking it about anything about religion and all of this shows you that there is no heat so there are so many things but the time is not sufficient but you get the idea then why isn't the people coming to Islam because we are failing to give them the truth the people the truth of it can be Illustrated when you find that those who pray with us in the Masjid those who pass worse and rubberband and next era we are walking the talk but when we only limit our relationship to religion into our five daily prayers fasting are not doing and that's it we didn't Reba witchy we invested our wives and take that money if they're working we take their gold and sell it or keep it with the in-laws a woman says to me I happen akiko and a half my soul of gold is a humanity let's see do they demanded a kid on the half she did never laid a hand on it why her mother and father keeping it for safekeeping maternal safety they were along had to use it this is the heat so if we fail to walk the talk and be good to our neighbors and be honest in what we say in having clean hearts and trying our level best to bring our children in the way that pleases allah azzawajal without cheating without flying without backbiting without simply our attention then we have walked the talk and although he is correct now there are many impacts on our life if we implement them that the truth of he and these effects literally can go to future but it's not logical yeah any page of the Koran open it read it and I'll give you 10 20 benefits of the heat from one page the whole book is the book of the hill for worshipping Allah Oh acknowledging a man's devotion okey what you pray you have to feel that they're a music of Bob the people usually sizing this is a person with no a man in his heart when he finishes saw a lady disobey it is very funny and that was young he performed the saliva too long the second drug I finished it people are critical they just criticize and such people have movies map when you say Allah Akbar Allah is greater than what then anything that can cross your mind how many times do we defeat Allah but in the day fifty times between the Advanta famine imagine and then about 60 by 12 by 5:30 Obama we do it 20 this is 50 times how many times do you knew the man how many times you see so have 100 left a lot of work but then he three times at the end of each stop how many times you say before we sleep and yeah and you can go on and do the math of work but but do we feel that Allah is related that my wife's nagging Allah is greater than my boss was depriving me from my minute increase and from my promotion is Allah who truly greater than my cancer for my illness or my gossip my loved one if I have proper to eat what my you would be the happiest manner because you feel the tranquility you feel the calm listen you have heart because you know who Allah is and you know who you truly are so Allah Azza WA JAL created us for a sole purpose and that is don't worship me do you have any objection unfortunately the youth nowadays with all the trash they watch they have an issue with that and we fail to sit with our children and talk to them we sit with our children and show them but as a former teacher there are four skills that is speaking and listening no we're good in making them listen but we don't listen to them and we don't know what goes in their minds and the doubts that have been casted upon them from all different sorts of media so what are we supposed to do we have to install this concept that you are not free why are you doing this I'm free no you're not you're asleep you are a slave of Allah Azza WA JAL Allah created you only to worship Him so you want me to sit in the message 24/7 with the Long Beach and doing Omaha mama I used to have a 1994 tips GMC Suburban and it used to make remind me of a large diversion the minute I start is now because of chips but I have to sell everything comes to an end so do you want me to sit in the message to do this no regarder can be in playing sports with your friends Ramada can be in reading a beneficial book if I can even be in drinking a cup of tea if you want to play night prayer you would like to refresh yourself so it will be even having intimacy with your spouse you have charity take a ferragamo crap there are many ways of refreshing this this is a form of rubato you haven't seen my wife but this is not the topic that's it is everybody go for it the food the morsel you put in your wife's mouth another thing yeah don't be negative there are so many means of making it either one of the beautiful things and I see that in summer the birds are so thirsting there is no water people are putting small cups of water and birds are coming to drink of it imagine what this will do for you on the day of judgment this is a bad day of being kind to a dog you take time to attack you beep the kind to a bird for the sake of Allah not for people's praising you and doing this so it is we who are in need of Allah a soldier not the awesome Allah says in the Quran o mankind you are those in need and dhul fiqar you are the poor in need of Allah what Allah is the free of me the praiseworthy animal and so any form of Ranade whether it's hatch fasting zakat being kind to people if it does not have to heat it is no it is void Amazo that says and we will regard what they have done of deeds and make them as dust dispersed so all what the mushriks those who do not have to hate pray taraweeh through the center but here is a defect there is no footer hate Allah would make it like dust it would not benefit them on the day of judgment what the benefit of the people is Allah he raises sins with the heat in the honey mama says also have Adam were you to come to me with since nearly as great as the earth and will you then to face me ascribing no partner to me I would bring you forgiveness nearly as lame as it to Panama the whole earth you come with sense but you have they'll heat as prescribed Allah will forgive all of that the first thing you will be asked about your breath is not when you're a Popeye's expired the first question the Prophet Zarathustra told us that he would be asked about his Lord this is the first question what is that ok you are possessing and only those upon Toki with be steadfast and will be able to answer Allah says Allah keeps firm those who believe will make me a new firm in degree Allah keeps firm those who believe with the firm word the weak in worldly life and in the Hereafter and Allah sends astray the wrongdoers and Allah does what He wills this ayah is talking about determine of the grave as the majority of Rufus City and discuss this now everyone can enter general but you need a key and the key needs teeth because if you get the key without teeth it will not open and if you don't get the key to begin with then there is no way for you to enter what is the key Dohee allah says indeed he who associate others with allah allah has forbidden impalas house end of story no way that a mushrik would enter general no way this is what allah has taken to us and the prophet had said is officer whoever dies not associating others with allah with antigen pus you believe in a large solution and this is the key but the key has to have teeth you believe in Allah if you don't pray and for nothing what's today prophet told us this so you have to look at it from a holistic point of view don't listen to this kadhi you can say believe in Allah let's have party listening booze let's hang out tonight with women and do good listen they will put you in hell yeah but I believe in Allah if you believe in Allah truly would not have done decent so these things would decrease your turkey until you make each level you nullify other people together and this is a problematic among the better cuts of the heat that it would make you happy in this life and the hereafter we know we have no problem in the hereafter definitely with the heat we are in paradise how how happy more can you be but in general dunya can we be happy with the way listen to a homogeneous and if only the people of the cities had believed and feared the block is stupid we would have opened upon them blessings from the heaven and earth but they denied the messengers so we seized them for what they were earning civilizations flourishing and finding the fruit of your work in disturbia comes only with Turkey but if you why do we find the Europeans and the Americans flourishing and finding the fruit of good this is a test and life is a cycle the cycle may take 100 to 150 years of time look at each other a via 70 years ago eight years ago we used to live on the donation the charity that the Egyptians the Indians and the Moroccans used to give us in Makkah and the elders our unconsciousness they say that we used to live from has to hatch until the end is come there was no external time they come and they give us gold and they build schools and make it work as a solitaire is done by them and the Egyptians used to come they have gold and their money but today it's a different story it's a cycle and allah azzawajal it does not pay for anyone you remain on though he a logical would make you dominate the whole world you give away to hate you see what we are suffering from at the moment though he is the cause of guidance in this life and in the hereafter because with the heat you will find the tranquility of your heart the comfort of your soul you will find that life is as it is a test from Allah a surgeon and no matter how tight it becomes soon it will expand - Allah so many times look at your past how many times you don't you deaths or problems with your caffeine or problems with your wife with your mother-in-law problems with children problems with illnesses what's happened to that all of that it's gone why I was smart I was strong I had influence I knew someone know Allah Allah made it easy for you so when you have that they'll heat in your heart and you undergo a similar calamity you're always considered that a lot so that would make it happen a myself it will make it easy for you and you have this VD this is why Allah says they who believe and do not mix their belief with injustice leadership those will have security and they are rightly guided this can only be to those who do not have ship those who are upon the toe heel and any the essence of the e is that we have one to worship if you go to that this believers the non-muslims in other word they worship Allah some of them only on Sundays and the rest of the week they worship Berkeley back this is how things are confused with them Muslims they only worship Allah as a virgin whether in their homes whether in their life whether in their death Allah so Allah says say indeed my prayer my rites of sacrifice my living and my dying are for Allah everything we do is for a larger we believe that so when someone comes to you and says nothing why don't you write in your will that you donate your organs after you die some scholars say this is permissible some scholars say no this is not permissible because this is not your body you cannot say terminate me he made me burn me or give me to the dogs this is not your body this is Anana so some scholars say no you cannot do anything after your death you have to be preserved as you are valid as you are because this is part of uttering the disease so everything that we do and we live in and we try to achieve is for the sole sake of Allah this is why we get this comfort and tranquility if there were two birds we would be in confusion AMA says had that been within the heavens and the earth gods decidable they both would have been ruined the heavens and earth would be ruined and devastated and this comfort is what a lot of the people cannot find especially the youth Gumpy the youth I remember when I was young really this was in the last century that shows you how all their I used to watch movies when I was in I'm talking about 30 40 easily and whenever I finish a movie I go talk to my mother and say a word I'm fed up in advocacy of shine and mom says is it a table my forehead whenever you see me you say this so I watch another movie and come for two hours and then after the movie is finished so this is temporary tranquility it's like drugs you get high for a period of time but then you get the hangover when it's it's gone you get all the trouble doubled and tripled on your head now when it comes to a man you don't have this is permanent and this is why Sheikh al-islam and take me and other of the scholars said by Allah if the kings and the sons of the kings they are all royalty if they were about the comfort that we are enjoying Mumbai they will fight us with the sword to take it from us but they can't it's not something bacteria that you can give her or take it is something that a lot of expose in your heart when you have proper the heat and they also say there is a paradise in union whoever is prevented from entering it will not enter the paradise Empire what paradise after they are we talking about the paradox of knowing Allah when you know that everything has been created by Allah decreed fifty thousand years before he created the creation you feel comfort from us a car accident took place I'm saddened but we come to them it's been written by Allah so yet my my house is on fire I have tried my level best to protect it but Allah decreed it handy I'm happy and this is why when Ibraheem the son of Prophet Muhammad a sister who was a year and a half or two years old and the Prophet was in his mid-50s or late fifties in has no son do you know the feeling of not having sons when you go with those who have grown-up sons no do not know the feeling but when you have shopping groceries and you take them up to the third floor over three or four times because you don't have any points this is one aspect there's so many the Prophet when his son died when he what did he say but go yessum what are you dead man well in Daraa erotica yeah you know what Allah my Allah the heart is silent the eyes are weeping and we upon departing you rahim are saddened but you do not say except for allah is pleased now his son is dead but he says this why because he knows that this heart is filled with comfort and would love and smooth though heat you get to go on last ocean and most you know about everything vanishes in front of you what do you mean oh is this a Sufi aspect no no no no don't think of that but you know Allah all the worries disappear how you have confidence in a lot you know that otherwise your provider and this is why the best of charity is that the one you give when you are poor the best of charity now why would I give charity on a boat because I am trusting a manager the seller tells us about Yanni stories that are so weird when it comes to knowing about his origin a man asks another do you know someone who advances his there WA why I want I have something I need to go to the brother because he's righteous he makes Naraku me and the other says no but I know someone who answers the time so don't go to people go speak to a halogen when you go for us to stop will you go for the prayer for rain we have the sprained right trusting a logic is the when you take an umbrella because I'm going to pray I know about the spot and rain would come so I'm taking umbrella we don't even know that when they pray this prayer huh every few months we hear in the news that on Monday Shawn solati versus car nobody goes nobody knows where it is because we have lack of see story and so on yeah in a nutshell the heat is not something theoretical if something of great importance to practice this is the essence of Islam without it you have no Islam but it is very fragile though he is like a white sheet if you have a white sheet the smallest of flying that lays on it you will see it the smallest crash the smallest wrinkle this is what you eat can be undermined by a word Masha Allah who worshiped one of them sent to the prophets and whatever Allah wills it and you to who to build up you may be partner to say whatever Allah wills that's it when we say things and a builder public I'm depending on a lot of you this is and so on so this clean sheet of the heat must be preserved must be monitored must be audited you have to audit your children your wife your heart to see that if we are able to reach this level of the appeal may allah azzawajal grant us all the pewte of england and mixes straight to general reckoning without accountability mammograms a centipede that makes us see things as they are in reality and help us raise our children upon the men hatch and a way that pleases Allah has no agenda and loves Hannah who knows best so promotion them about Hannah you"
