  "title": "Can I use copyright books as long as they are available for free on the internet - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "for my final year of high school I have to submit What's called the graduation paper where I write about a topic I choose and then submit it at the end of the year I want to choose books from the internet that I've copyright and that I myself don't physically own because it's very hard to find books for my topic specifically in my language so I've decided on using English literature instead is it okay to use these scientific literature books as long as I cite them at the end of my work there is nothing wrong in using such copyrighted books from the internet if they are available for free without hacking them because it's as if you're going to a public library and reading it and quoting from these books there's nothing wrong in it insha Allah at all"
