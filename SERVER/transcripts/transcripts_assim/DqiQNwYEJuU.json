  "title": "Is forcing a girl or a woman to marry against her will permissible in Islam? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "forcing a woman to marry against her will is totally prohibited in islam whether you're the father or the grandfather a woman came to the prophet is your son and said my father married me against my will to his nephew so that he would protect his honor so he claims and not be shamed by me so the prophet says this is not permissible your marriage is void if you don't want it which means that he gave her the will either to cancel such an invalid marriage or to go through it so the woman said no i accepted the prophet of allah but i wanted you to clarify to the women that have a right to reject such marriages how many women are forced are blackmailed are pressured by their parents to marry someone they don't like and in the 90 of the cases i see it ends up in divorce but only after having two or three children so what did the family gain by that destroying the life of this girl having two or three kids being divorced in their house wouldn't it have been better to give her the freedom of choice and to marry someone she accepts rather than being forced"
