  "title": "Signs of the Last Day (Day Of Judgement) Part 3 - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "La Jolla mobile can have the evil soul eleven nabina muhammad hero sabe for many today we had he were standing significant within a module assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh in continuation to yesterday's part one of the signs of the day of judgment we stopped at wishing death and the more you see people wishing to die this is a sign of the approaching of the Day of Judgment why because the Prophet told us allah√≠s alot was aa that our would not be called until a man passes by a grave of a dead person and wishes that he was in his place of course this happens due to trials Wars calamities and so many times I hear this personally from people wishing to have been dead and they wished to die and this by itself is not permissible in Islam the Prophet said irresolution laa taman ayun hadouken and not a little rain masa one must not wish for death because he is tested by Allah with hardship yet if you were to wish for death you have to have it conditional what do you mean by conditional you say o Allah if death is good for me make it happen and if life is good for me make me live longer so this is conditional you're not just simply asking for death but you are putting a condition that allah azzawajal has told us about also part of the signs of the Day of Judgment is the spreading of murders and killing and nowadays we see this a lot the prophet alayhi salatu salam was addressing his companions once and said ahead of the hour is the spreading of killing so the companion said more than we do now we kill approximately 70,000 meaning of the Kofun and again like we've mentioned before 70,000 is an expression of a lot exaggeration but it is not exact figure so the Prophet said are a solution told them no it is not killing of the idol worshippers it is killing one another just like a lot of faylene so the Companions objected we kill one another do we have our brains in our head and the Prophet said no the brains of the people of that era would be taken out meaning that they would not have minds they would not have intellect and all what would remain are the scum of the people and they believe that they are on the right track but they are not if you look at this hadith at what we are seeing nowadays you find that it fits like a glove explain to me the killings that we find in Shia mosques when you blow off a million or a mosque killing hundreds and thousands of Shia but they're innocent children women worshipers though they are deviant and wrong sect on Balala maybe in Hellfire no one justifies killing them explain to me the killing that happens in places like Syria battles of explosive throw and people dying in discriminating we believe if there is a mistake here or there Jannik maybe it can be tolerated but when you target women and children and innocent people like in a rock like in Afghanistan I can leave here like in Yemen like here and there where is this lap so this and the sad thing is that it happens without any remorse push of a button voila we killed today 500 people that's all la shala tomorrow we will try to increase the number and the killing happens for your wallet for your watch maybe people kill one another because of road rage he passed me and he looked at me and I stopped him we fight I stop him he dies this happens in Saudi about not a lot but it happens what causes this to happen the approach of the Day of Judgment the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam o ma te o matin ma human my ummah is a blessed Ummah Allah will have mercy upon them there will not be torment and punishment for my Ummah on the day of judgement their torment and punishment is in this dunya through trials fitten earthquakes and killing this is the punishment of Omar Mohamed is the spread of killing earthquakes and fittin the Prophet Elias or Salaam warned us that will rise before the day of judgement so now we are comfortable that we are Muslims and Islam is widely being spread I get sms's and I get on the mobile phone in the whatsapp post saying that Islam in Canada is so-and-so in Europe in UK in Germany and by 2030 or 2050 Islam will dominate and people are happy with this when the Prophet said Ali is a lot worse enough that the day of judgement would not come until [Music] groups of my Ummah will follow the idol worshippers and will worship the idols themselves booberella said the Prophet said al Asad Abu Salam that our would not be called until the women of those it's a tribe in Arabia one of the most prominent members of this tribe of those is a warrior himself and it's now called as very Saran so if you hear someone know by the name of as Suhani he's from those it's a it's a big tribe the Prophet said that the hour would not be called until women go round the idol of del Hassan it's an idea that used to be worshipped in jahiliya time it would be revived and people from that tribe from Arabia 300 kilometers away from Makkah will worship it now when you look at this four of worshiping idols nowadays you will not find this so visible but you will find people turning to other idols no one puts Buddha and starts the worship or Krishna or whatever idols they have but you will find people worshipping among the Muslims their desires and whims we find among the youth few numbers of atheists people i sat with many of them and I speak to them dr. Zakir Naik went to Indonesia two years ago when he came back I was talking to him he said it was very successful visit and I have never seen a fests in my life like I've seen them I was shocked 250 million Muslims the largest country in the world with Muslim population and this is what you say these things yes most of the youth I meet their parents are doctors engineers professors the people their sons or daughters they come and say masha'Allah doctor your lecture was fabulous but I'd like to tell you that I am NOT a Muslim my father is Muslim my mother is Muslim Muslim but I am a free thinker he says I spent with them two to five minutes and the man says the Shahada and accepts Islam he said that I didn't know that Islam was like this what is a free thinker there is nothing as a free thing there is a hypocrite who hates Islam so when you feel find people like this nowadays these are part of the idol worshippers that the Prophet told us that the groups of his Ummah would follow that but they either they're worshipping is their own selves their desires and when there isn't anything as atheism in Islam people want to destroy his lab so they pretend to be free thinkers the people of nature etc just to undermine Islam part of the science of the day of judgment which the Prophet told us about her a sorcerer is the existence of oba sanity and vulgar talk and vulgar actions as well also bad neighbouring these are all mentioned in an authentic hadith and nowadays this is obvious in tons of jahiliya in the early times of Islam people's talk were clean you don't find people swearing or using obscene words and language nowadays due to the media due to rap music due to movies all what people do is curse and most of those who are polite they would say he used the f-word what do you want and they said s word when he was cursing something to say about someone who's black he used the n-word where is this the initials of it but this is what's happening among the Muslims when they drop something they say the f-word when they say something the S word until their death comes and they're prevented from saying la ilaha illallah their tongues are not moist with the current law so if you driving and then that there comes a car an 18-wheeler that's going to crash you and crush you definitely you're dying what are you gonna say Lila this is what happens because this is what we say now I'm shocked in some Muslim household you find that the father is cursing his son by saying may Allah curse your father Allah in Arabic who's his father and his father their usages of dog donkey monkey this is normal the twin siblings in my house this is totally prohibited and I don't remember saying this to any of my children for maybe three or four decades because we bring up ourselves cleanse our hearts cleanse our Mouse's from speaking such foul language let alone any sexual implications or any words here or there now it is this is not possible because this is what you see this is what you heal this is what everyone around you uses and this is why the Prophet warned us from that bad a neighboring look at your neighbors when was the last time you visited them you greeted them I remember 20 30 years ago whenever in the neighborhood one of the neighbors would his wife would give birth the full community would organize dinner and lunch dinner and lunch so today lunch is on my family they cook food and we take it to them they eat the moment doesn't work there is a bond nowadays we live in cement houses maybe in the same building you don't know who your neighbors are they move in they move out I don't know that this is problematic and what is even worse is when you your neighbor this is a catastrophe well why helium in well luckily Oakman well I helium in the Prophet said three times by Allah he is not a believer who is that the Prophet said I am the one whose neighbor is not safe from his harm if I throw my garbage in front of his house if I take his parking spot if I raise the volume of TV or music that annoys him if I do things that would not be considered as the actions of a good neighbor then we have a problem among the signs mentioned in an authentic hadith the Prophet says at the appearance of landslides and transformations or transmutations and stones from the heaven this will come landslides happen every time these are my inner signs because there will be three major line slides we will talk about this as part of the ten major signs of the Day of Judgment the famous landslides that took place mentioned in the Quran wash is said to have been a cousin of Musa nothing authentic but he was a contemporary of Musa and he was not like Haman Haman was the Minister of Pharaoh but kuru was a businessman yet he was so filthy rich that he overlooked the famous and blessings of allah azzawajal and as mentioned into the chapter of al-assad he was walking happy proud of what he had allah azza wajal made the earth cave and he there was a landslide and it swallowed him we see landslides in Europe in UK in America and we see houses being swallowed but on a very small scale we will see a lot of this coming in the future and one of them one of the prominent ones other than the three mentioned would be an army coming to invade the cabinet and it has to be known that no one invades the Kaabah except the Muslims the last of them were who Oh wash Abraha from Abyssinia this is when the Prophet was born at insalata Russa Allah protected the house he sent by Iran a deal as you know the story but later on all those who invade or try to invade the Kappa are Muslims whether real Muslims or pretending to be the Muslims as we have so many of them so the Prophet says if you hear of an army that allah azza wajal makes a landslide and swallows the whole army then anticipate the hour meaning that this is a clear sign of it's coming so there will be such a thing and also the Prophet told us that to anticipate this happening when there are musical instruments being played everywhere concerts and specifically women singing and women singers are everywhere and literally everywhere so this is a very bad sign that it is happening the prophet alayhi salat wa salam even warned Anacin Malak and this is a prophecy from himalayas salat-u-salam and he said anis soon the people will divide empty lands and awarded to others you know when you have a big land and you chop it into blocks and and plots and you sell it so he tells him or Anna's people will soon do this in a place called al Basra where is the Basra in era and this happened at the time of Rama so this prophecy was seen by Anna's so the Prophet says Alice or so if you ever pass by it or enter it avoid its Saba a Samaha is the land filled with salt no no so salty land you cannot have crops there that we have this year a lot in Kuwait we have this in the map in this area which is close to the sea or where the sea has gone away from it so avoid sabaha what killer aha kill aha is the docking places where the rivers or the sea and avoid its markets and where the princes and governors live and you have to go to the suburbs a bahia is a place which is high you leave these places the prophets specifically telling leave these places of Basra and go and live there why the Prophet says because there will be landslides there will be stoning from the heavens and there will be trembles shaking earthquakes and there will be people going to bed as humans waking up to be transmuted dated into monkeys and pigs we haven't seen that but we believe in it and it will happen and this should be a very big eye-opener to people when they say humans turning into Apes and swine but still the kafir would be a Katherine the believer will increase his belief among the science that the Prophet told the solid solution is the existence and the name of Allah Barney and papa Babu Python is a big tribe in Arabia and they are part of the oldest tribes of Arabia and the name of a Pawnee I think you have a lot of it here this man will reign and will ruin and would move the people as the prophet described him with his stick some say that his abusive others say no his discipline people and making them follow orders and this is why a lot of the scholars believe that he is a righteous caliph who would reign and rule and would what what shall dress for and yeah this is this was not mentioned in the signs of the Day of Judgment but I'm afraid of the cameras and the wiring so this this person Popeye is other than the Jaffa that the Prophet told us who would come and attack and would rule this one is part of the slave and he is not the Abyssinian who would come and demolish the Kaaba stone by stone this would come really at the end of time this is a righteous ruler who we are and he will may be here in our lifetime maybe not part of the sad signs of the day of judgment is when the Kaaba itself is being invaded the Prophet told us about our Assam an invasion where there will be a landslide everyone will die in it women children servants and the soldiers and the companion said ok what is the fault of the women and the soldiers the women and the children what did they do or prophet of Allah they were forced to come the Prophet said they will be resurrected according to their Nia so there is no fault on Domitian another army would come and invade the Kaaba and it would succeed so the Prophet said Ali his salat WA Salam there will come a time when people would give the pledge of allegiance to a man maybe he is the company maybe not between the local aliamanu and the maqam of the guy him in the Karma which we just something good then he said that no one will invade and disrespect the bait the house the Ka'bah except its people the Muslims and once they disrespect and invade the Kaaba do not ask about the destruction of the Arabs meaning that that time haleh's Arabs are no longer existing or doing their job then the Prophet says then afterwards the Abyssinians the people of Habashi will come and they will destroy the camp in a way that it would never ever be rebuilt again which means that this is at the very last thing before the destruction of this dunya the Abyssinians will be the ones taking the treasures of the car and the Prophet told us and described to us this Abyssinian leader being short being with crooked feet and that he is black and that he is destroying it dismantling it brick by brick now one would maybe argue didn't Allah promised to make this place safe Allah says have they not seen that we have made madcap essentially secure and that men are being snatched away from all around them scholars said here yes this is ayah it is correct but it didn't say that this would last forever and this is why the Prophet said that no one would disrespect and invade the Kaaba except people from the Muslims themselves and we have so many incidents for example we have the incident of the Quran baba who came from the eastern part bahrain some say bahrain refers to al-assad you know what katifaq not this bad brain this is a small island that is nothing compared to the eastern province itself it used to be called barren this is what the army thought came from and I think they did 321 history they came in the season of Hajj like we are now couple of weeks earlier they went and invaded the ham one of the pilgrims were making toe-off slaughtering everyone in their way throwing their dead bodies in the well of Zamzam and one of them the leader would come up on the top of karma and he says where are her pyrrol ever been and he's mocking the Quran Allah sent the bird when Abraha came with the elephant and the birds through these small stones from sin gene he's saying well a lot a top Idol a bourbon and another one said I execute and annihilate the people I give them life and they took down the drain drainage on the Kaaba and they dug out the black stone hazard as well and they took it with them too and I sir listen remaining with them for 20 years the Muslims making power of making sorry making ramen are making Hajj for 20 years and they don't have the black stone it's empty and they tried so many times to fight them to get it back after 21 plus years they agreed to bring it and it was restored where it is now so the camera was invaded the Kaaba was invaded earlier at the time of receipt David mahalia when I'm the liveness Joubert may Allah be pleased with an animal well his father took power of Mecca Medina almost everywhere except Syria and people gave the pledge of allegiance to him as a Ameer al-mumineen but then hypocrites in the field and then powers change shifted they sent an army with the leadership of a head judge they've been used photography who stole the Kaaba and demolished parts of it until he killed of the lion is a big so Mecca was invaded so many times and it will be invaded later on as the Prophet had said alayhi salatu salam yet generally speaking the security and the sanctuary is still ongoing from that time till the end of time when the Abyssinian man comes and demolishes it totally now part of the greatest signs of the Day of Judgment is the appearance of pitten pitten is a plural of fitna and fitna in Arabic means testing so you test the gold by burning it and it can be testing in your wealth in your health in your offspring testing through waging Wars testing through casting doubts about your religion or testing with desires like Fame wealth power and women so there are so many types of fittin trials tests exams that you have to look into it's not only torture torture is also fitna in Aladeen F atomic mini no Illuminati from Bellamy to those who tested tried and burnt the people of the trench is called testing so this torture is testing it has so many different manifestations and ways the Prophet warned us Alesso Salam from all of this he said in an authentic hadith there was no prophet before me but it was his duty to tell his Ummah of the best of what he knew was good for them warned them about the worst of what he knew was bad for them the Prophecy's is awesome the time of peace and security for this Ummah has been made in its first era which era the prophets Ararat the Companions this is the time of peace that was given peace and security the Prophet says and it is last error and its last error will be afflicted with trials and things that you will be confused about this is written and this is what we are suffering now he says a fitna morphing fitna will come and the believer will say this is going to cause my destruction my doom then when it ends another fitna will come and the believer will say this is the one the prophecies are some whoever would like to be delivered from hell and enter paradise let him die believing in Allah and the last day and let him treat people as he would like to be treated and whoever gives the pledge of allegiance to his ruler and he shakes hands with them and give that gives him the fruit of his heart he must obey Him and if another one comes trying to claim to be a ruler then you have to kill the other one and in another hadith the Prophet said a dissolution I'm ahead of the Day of Judgment there will be fittin trials as dark as night so dark so to be at night you're confused you can see the Prophet says a man wakes up a believer when night falls returns to a kafir and a man at nightfall he's a believer and when he wakes up he wakes up as a kafir at this time of fittin the one who's sitting is better than the one who's standing the one who's standing is calling others to follow him in fitna the one who sits is better and the one standing is better than the one walking and the one walking is better than the one who's brisk walking what to do the Prophet says answer sir therefore at such times break your bows cut the strings of your bows so not only break the wood also cut the string and hit your swords by the rocks to break them so if someone enters at you wanting to kill you be like the best of the two sons of Adam don't defend yourself die rather than participate in such fitna and leading others to it now we will not go into discussion of the different types of fitten because this would take a full workshop so many of them and we surrounded of them allah azza wajal mentioned that our wealth and our offspring are fitna in the memoir tokuma radical fitna so the concept of fitness so why we will not go into that but the Prophet told us alayhi salatu was-salam that the fitna will come from here and he pointed towards the east and this is where the horns of shaytan now in order to understand this you have to look at the whole picture why do you say this ship because a lot of the haters would say that gnashed as mentioned in the hadith is where the hordes of Sheba is and this is where all the fit and come so nowadays gnashed as we know it is Riyadh and the areas around it so use how these are the cause of all fit and the Prophet said national now I could defend this but still have a Saudi so you say I can't accept your defense let us be objective show me the number of fittin that came from Riyadh I will surrender and say maybe one or two throw out of time maybe three okay let's look at the other side of the coin you say National Assembly up a sake can we see other scholars when we look at the scholars five six seven centuries ago who explained this hadith who did not have anything affiliated with the Saudi government a man was asked in an interview what was the nationality of the prophet alayhi salaatu such a saudi of course it shows you the ignorance of people the nationality of the Prophet was what Saudi what imbecile would say such a thing so six seven centuries there was no sodium what did the scholars say they said gnashed to the people of in Arabic gnash means a high place so with an Arabic record huh baba Oritel or a small mountain in any place that is high it's called gnashed so to the people of Makkah Yemen nest for them is real but for the people of madinah all scholars say that nashville met the people of medina israel now compare the amount of fittin that came from Arad and from Iran and you will find that there are so many of them let's start with a few Kufa where is it in Allah from Kufa and the surroundings we get the lava shear and we get the Hawaiian nicest and abide and all the whole nine yards but from an early age and all of them the how a ridge and the lava are extreme in Ali one claim him to be a god or a prophet or someone out of this world and other consider him to be a kafir who deserves to be killed and they sent a black man Ben Mullen and he assassinated him how are you this is what they do the killer of Roman kebab was an ahjussi v de obras man and his assassination started from Allah then went to Egypt and then it happened the incident of the camel mark littell Jamel took place in Arab Ali may Allah be pleased with him was assassinated in his biggest city which is a cool Adie thought mahalia and Safina and it was an Arab from it came the deviant sex of algebra gibreel who claim that everything we do we're forced to do it so the a man of abu jahal is equivalent to the Eman of Abu Bakr because both of them are doing what Allah predestined upon them and Allah Daria came from there and other years of opposite they said Allah does not create what we do Allah does not know what we do until we do it our language so compare Apple to Apple would you still say that it is from Saudi Arabia where was the judge'll come from from that area from the east not from South Arabia from horizon-- from bulk from Meru from Iran northeast of Iran the prophet's analysis lab there will come people from the east now is medina his East is a lot they will recite the Quran and it would not pass their collar bones or their throats and they will exit from the deal as the arrow exits the prey these are what who are they Hawaii where are they coming from from Allah so I hope this Gani roughly answers it but if you still insist it's from Saudi it's your choice is not mine this is up to you we move on to the major signs to handle the house the little minor signs will through now we are left with 10 major signs the Prophet cetera so Abu Salah in the idea of who they were - eight he said the Prophet looked at us while we were in a circle discussing arguing discussing in the Masjid and the Prophet would check on them are they playing cards are they talking about the latest entertainment movies etc this is what I'm rugby does this is what the teacher does when you see your students doing something not spying but redirecting you have to your children you don't spy on them you have to bring matters to their attention maybe you will benefit them with with something better so the Prophet said what are you doing they said we're studying we are trying to research and contemplate it's brainstorming or prophet of Allah so he said on what he they said we're brainstorming about the hour so the Prophet gave the Marisa immediately the answer he said it will not be called the hour will not count until you see ten signs and he mentioned the smoke a Dohan add the judge and the appearance or the rising of the Sun from the West the dissension that the dissenters of al maseeh recently Maryam peace be upon him Gog and Magog yeah George Omar judge three lines right one of the east one in the West and one in the Arabian Peninsula then I think I missed one today and Taba yes number three sorry and adapt by the Beast and finally a fire that comes at the end of time from Yemen and pushing the people to their Masha where is the Raja in a sham in Syria these are the ten now some of these ten signs we have extense information about and some we have only one line so again this is not storytelling this is fact-finding so we have to mention what is mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah and if not anything mentioned do you have to just believe in it and move on now some of these things happen in sequence so that the gel a Sapna Maryam your jutsu managers they offer happen one after the other and the last would be the fire that takes people from their homes into Syria where the landslides will happen when the landslides would happen this is in Allah's knowledge we do not know of that and about that last things of course is the rising of the Sun from the West so why are these 10 so significant we've mentioned maybe like 40 50 signs before yesterday and today but why then this 10 so significant the Prophet tells us Alex also saw that these last 10 signs are like beads in a prayer beads miss BAM once you cut the string everything falls and not 1 or 2 everything falls and this is how the last 10 signs would take place one after the other and things that Hamas and once you see the first you know that it's about to end now I rearranged it not according to time but rather according to the mentioning of it and listing of the profit that is salat-u-salam so according to the hadith I have just mentioned to you hadith rhodesia hypnose a delivery may Allah be pleased with them the first sign is jihad now what is this sign Allah says in the Quran what translates to then weight you for the day when the sky will bring forth a visible smoke covering the people this is a painful torment now the scholars are split into two opinions one of them led by abdullah al masud may allah be pleased with him say that this sign has already happened when Abdullah Thomas wrote says this was at the time when the when the Prophet was in Bukhari salat-u-salam or at the time when he made dua in Medina that Allah Azza WA JAL would make it drought dry and famine so the people of Mecca used to come out of their homes so hungry so thirsty so weary and tired they would look at the sky because of the hunger they would see as if there is a cloud covering the sky and it's like smoke you know when you travel in the desert you see mirage and there's no water it's something like this it's an illusion so i'm the lovely miss road may allah be pleased with and used to swear that this is a sign that took place at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the vast majority of companions and scholars say no this is not possible because allah says visible smoke and what these people saw was an illusion is something imagined by them due to their hunger and a thirst this is the opinion of auditor Batali baby numbers even Roma that this has not come yet what information do we have we only have the hadith where the Prophet says when the when the Dohan when the smoke comes it will take believers as if it's the flu while the disbelievers would make them blow up and grow in size and it will come from all exits and entrances in their body so it would be something of an epidemic to them the believers would not suffer from it except as it is a flu any more information we can't of course if you go into the books of the seed you will find and they say tales and stories but these are not authentic so we cannot base our conviction and belief or something that is not authentic now the second sign is the coming of the dead gern who is the de judge he is al maseeh at the judge and embassy can be used with receptor Maryam and it can be used with the Antichrist or the imposter Christ what is meant by Messi Messi from to wipe so Issa was known to wipe over the blind Leopard and the Deaf and the ill and they would be what cured by the grace of Allah and that child Antichrist the imposter is non massif one because he wipes the whole earth except Mecca and Medina in forty days so this guy is supersonic and this is something that is too difficult to to imagine and see another interpretation is that his eye is wiped out so we know that one of his eyes he cannot see normal and one of the other eyes is coming out and it's green and it's like marble and we will come to the description later on a Sharma and shall they would not have to see it the grace of allah azza wajal now before the coming out of the Dajjal there will be the appearance of an maggie and who is an ID and Maddie is one of the descendants of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam his name is like the prophets name helmet his father's name is like the prophet's father's name abdullah so his name is muhammad abdullah the prophet tells us that he is not a righteous person that he was not a good muslim maybe a playboy maybe rich maybe not observing salah over night in one night allah azzawajal flips him and he becomes righteous practicing knowledgable to the extent that people follow him and to the extent that he becomes a fixer so he fixes the communities and the muslims and he calls them to his lab and people follow him and he will fill the world with justice and fairness as it was filled with injustice and oppression this is the description by the Prophet Edison he's a son of Fatima which means that he is of the offspring of Adi because the Prophet had four daughters right and he had offspring from three of them so we have Xena had two other sons of man had Abdullah from one of the daughters so there are other descendants but the most prominent is that of Fatima may Allah be pleased with her the Prophet told us that he has a clear forehead and that his nose is any Roman like you know standing and there's a small bent in the middle and that he will reign seven years he will be a ruler for seven years of course this has no relation to the matter of who of the Shia the Shia claimed that they have 12 Imam beginning from Holly onwards and this is why they are called and known as an ethnic Sharia Jeff area or Amamiya Imams and they claim that number 12 he was six months old when he crawled into a tunnel and a cave about like maybe 12 centuries ago and is still there 12 and 1,200 years and they claim that they write to him letters ayatollah Lana Tala they have and and he responds and they give birth dates with OMA you have to attack Iraq you have to attack Yemen you have to attend - it's not me this is a menu and they are they claim that he has a river of milk river of honey in his thriving on that of course we know that all of this is nonsense now we come to the added job of his description there are so many hadith authentic but to list them would take a lot of time so we will just highlight as much as possible so that we can finish a sha Allah this workshop tonight first of all it is the biggest most toughest fitna scene by mankind imagine the Prophet said an Islam that since the time of Noah every Messenger of Allah war these people from his feet which means that this is not easy guys this is serious stuff and the Prophet re was salam also told us that he will come claims to be God and when people do not believe him he will go a little bit lower this says ok I'm a Messenger of Allah Georgian and people don't believe him the Prophet told us that he is one-eyed and he said be careful your Lord is not one-eyed allah azza wajal does not have one eye which means that the scholars obtained from this hadith and Allah has two eyes and this is the feature that we agree but how the eye is we don't go into how or why or interpret it we just say that believe in it as the Prophet described during salat wa salam on his forehead is written cafe or kapha allah every movement male and female the moment they look at him he would they would see it printed on his forehead the disbelievers will be blinded they will not be able to read it or to know it [Music] description he is short bulky redhead his hair is is red or his entire body complexion is red so his white reddish but his hair is rough curly may be but it is not soft it is rough hair his eye is one sighted one of his right eye is normal but he cannot see with it his left eye this is the one that is so big and wide that it is really weird and it's green as if it's made of glass or marble he has a lot of hair he is infertile he does not have any offspring I don't think he has a time where is he at the moment the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us in a very long hadith and this hadith was a story that the Prophet told the companions about the Dajjal and then Tamim a daddy a companion who was late in islam came to Medina and told the Prophet about what he had seen a day's loss may Allah be pleased with him in a journey at sea and the Prophet was so happy that he went into the pulpit called the people to come and told them I told you before but now I'm gonna tell it to you again the story of Tammi Medina so the companions of the scholars of hadith say that this is the only hadith that the Prophet narrated of a companion usually it is the Companions narrating hadith from the Prophet this is only incident that the Prophet and some himself said to me but daddy told me one two three four five and short what did to me my daddy says he said before Islam I was with 30 men on a boat and we were lost in sea for a whole month and then it capsized we took a life raft and means of survival and we went into an island and the moment we said sure there came a beast Harry we don't know what's the front and what's the back we can't figure out it's even worse than a gorilla so we were terrified and they this beast called itself LJ's Sassa and the moment that beast saw us it told us to go to that monastery because there's a man waiting and dying to hear from you so they went and they found this great person chained from neck downwards in change and chains so this was really scary again so they said what are you he said I'll tell you who I am I'm not going anywhere but you tell me and started asking them questions about the Prophet Elisha about the lake of Perea in Palestine about an area with palm trees etc and then he told them about himself that he will come at the end of time when he's permitted he will roam the earth in forty days entering every country every city except Mecca and Medina and the prophet alayhi salatu salam addressed the companions wasn't this what I told you before the companion said yes so prophet this is exactly what you had told us before then the Prophet said he is in the Sea of Syria of sham the Mediterranean no he is in the Sea of Yemen the Indian Ocean or the what they call it Arabic God Arabian Sea I think huh then the prophecy no he is at the east he is at the east he is at the east meaning that he is coming from that area why was the Prophet as I'm hesitant because the way he did not come but in the final stage when he confirmed this is when Allah told him that he will come from the east before the coming from of the Dajjal a large audience ends signs and tests to the people there will come three years of extreme drought and famine for the whole world in the first year Allah tells us that the heavens to hold one-third of the rain and for the earth to hold one-third of the plants in the cross the second Allah orders it to hold 2/3 2/3 in the third year Allah orders the heavens and the earth not to produce anything now what do we feed on either plants or animals what do we drink water so if we don't have this what are the means of survival this is exactly what the companions asked the prophet of Allah they said o prophet of Allah in the last year when there is no water no cattle no grass to graze on no plants how would the people feed how will they live and the Prophet said RA salatu salam by saying la ilaha illallah allahu akbar wa hamdulillah this suffice 'as them from actual physical food Allah Akbar look at the power of thicker at the end of the time so when you hear people say the world is overpopulated we have to reduce reproductivity we have to reduce the number of children we have so that the natural resources would suffice we would tell them that this is alive who is the result Allah a soldier so even if there is no food and there is no water your vicar suffices for that also before that the jail comes one of the landmarks of the era would be the great battle between the Muslims and the Christians and well Hama al-kubra it is called and there it will take place where in Syria and this is what made a lot of the Muslims nowadays say it's happening but this is not possible you cannot interpret current situations with what with hadith of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam that this will happen because you can only interpret it after it happens but to claim that this is what the Prophet said before it ends this is not true so this is what will happen the Prophet said first of all you will have a covenant you have truce between the Muslims and the Christians and then you will combine forces and attack a mutual enemy Prophet is telling but not approve now when the Prophet tells you a prophecy does this mean it's okay when he tells us that that the jail is coming does it they see a proof of it some people come to the hadith of the prophet ala stop saying that there will be security in the future until a woman travels alone from Sun Hat to HUD remote so people comes in oh this is an indication that it is permissible for a woman to travel with a tomorrow what did you bring this from this is the Prophet said the Prophet is telling you about a prophecy something will happen in the future he told you in another hadith that this is how I'm for a woman to travel to that Omaha what are you doing so likewise here the Prophet is telling us that the Muslims and the Christians would combine forces to attack a mutual enemy now you do the math is this enemy the Mafia Shia are they the Chinese are they the whatever power is there among this is not our job then you of course there are a number of versions of the hadith you will be victorious and safe until you set your camp in a place of grazing with sand or the likes one of your allies the Christians would raise the cross and say to everyone we have been victorious because of the cross a Muslim hot blooded Muslim stands and breaks it the Christians kill him and the Muslims stand up to avenge their brother and this is when the betrayal from the Christians happen and they gather their thousands and hundreds of thousands of soldiers to attack there are so many hadith about this battle that people call Armageddon we don't have this a name in our traditions we have alma Hannah which is the greatest battle of all there is a description how such killings would take place and in the hadith that a beloved West Road narrate he said the hour would not be called until wealth is not divided between the Ayres and Warr booties people are not happy with people usually unhappy with war booties because when someone tells you that this is a Porsche 911 GTS for a gift what would you do we happy it's gift is its booty but there will come a time where people will not be happy and then started to explain how the fight between the Muslims and the Christians will take place how that amount of killing among the Muslims would take place until the family start to count the number of siblings and cousins and they would find only one out of a hundred so they ample officer said so what kind of wealth they will be happy to distribute for the heirs and what kind of war booties that would come and we spoke yesterday about the Christians being the majority of the people on earth at that moment now that the judge would come after the Muslims are victorious and they win the battle against the Christians this was difficult it was not one without losses a lot of the Muslims died but eventually they will prevail and they will win as they are just about to rest what will happen the shape on calls that the judge is attacking your families your women folk and your children the Prophet said RA savasana they sent the Muslims ten riders on horseback the prophets analysis Allah I know their names the names of their fathers the color of their horses and this is one of the evidences that some scholars say indicate that at the end of the time everything would go back to old days horse riding swords bows and arrows and Spears and the only logical explanation would be either there was an atomic bomb nuclear attack worldwide or there is no oil anymore because oil runs the electricity the plastics the industries once it's gone everything goes back to square one there's no wheel there's no fossil fuel there's nothing except how it used to be seven eight nine hundred years ago and this is how it looks heading to the oil is diminishing and inevitably the other sources of fuel is not that efficient in fulfilling our needs okay let's talk about the Dajjal again why would people be confused with him the answer is he's a cause of fitna what is this fitna we know everything about him knowledge is not one the Prophet told us that he would [Music] commute from one place to the other in enormous speed the Prophet cetera salat-u-salam that he will remain for only 40 days but not a single country or town or city that he would not come and enter so his fitna is everywhere he would have agenda and nod he would have heaven or paradise and Hellfire with him so wherever he goes you will see a river of fire and a river of cold water and he will tell you dip yourself in it the Prophet says alayhi salaatu wa salaam i know what the giant would come with he will come with two rivers accompanying him one of them is white water you see that visibly and the other one is raging fire if anyone should see that you must close your eyes go to the raging fire and drink from it because it is called water now you know this hadith is narrated by reported by my Muslim you believe in it yes when the tough gets going the going gets tough when the gel comes with these two rivers and he travels like crazy and he has so many miracles coming to support him this is when we start to shake up yeah maybe he's right it look the guy tells I will talk to some of the things that he is given by Allah as a test he will use the devil's and how would he use the devil's he would go to the nomads the Bedouin he says follow me I'm your Lord so what you doing ha ha hey Lala I'm Muslim no heat up either takbir am i walkable this is what he thinks then he says okay if I bring back to life your father and mother would you believe me I love my father I love my mother I haven't seen them for so many years so all of a sudden two Devils come in front of him looking like his father and mother and they say all my son follow him he is your Lord he is a lot look at this fitna now you're hungry you're thirsty you haven't eaten you're tired and this thing comes to you with everything you want what kind of a man do you require to stay steadfast he comes to people he asks him to believe in him so they do they follow him and believe in him what does he do he orders this the heavens to Ray it range he orders the earth to grow glad it grows in front of their eyes and their cattle grazes and becomes fat milk meat and then he goes to another village and they refuse to follow him so he orders the heavens and the earth and drought prevails and they have nothing in their hands except hunger he passes by an area and he tells us that area to get all of your fortunes and treasures out the Prophet tells us is awesome that he goes and all the treasures from the ground comes out following him and people are watching those who follow him take whatever you want gold silver take [Music] he gives life to the dead but this is an single incident when he comes to Medina there are angels carrying swords protecting it he cannot enter it so he comes outside of it a man young man comes out from Medina the guards hold him up where are you going I said I'm going to see this impostor dead jack so they start beating him you're calling our Lord that John impostor but then they say to one another listen listen don't kill him our Lord said do not do anything without consulting me so they bring him to the dead junk and that the judge tells him do you believe in me and he says I believe that you are the impostor that the Prophet told you told us about and that you are a liar so the Prophet is so that the gel orders him to be tormented and flogged so they flog him and do this and that again he asks him do you believe now in me since I am a believer that you are the liar impostor that job so he brings a song and he puts it on his head and he starts showing him until he cuts him into two halves and he walks between the two halves of his body with all the blood with all the guts with everything and people are watching and seeing this then he says to the two halves stand up and all of a sudden in front of everybody else he becomes a human being standing up nothing wrong with him so he says to him now do you believe in me and they are my says by Allah now I am more aware of the truth of the Prophet aza that you are the imposter leave who had warned us off so he takes him to slaughter him like a cattle Allah turns his neck into copper and he cannot kill him he cannot harm him and he would not harm anyone else after that young man and he is from Medina so he takes his hands and legs and throw him into his river of fire people think that he's dying the Prophet said Hassan he is going straight to Jenna and he's the greatest martyr at the side of Allah at that time where will he come from the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said in a hadith narrated by abu bakr the Dajjal will come out from a land in the east called horison this is north east of iran close to afghanistan mum and bala where the moguls are with the faces like the Hamid shield how long he will stay forty days one day is as long as a year another day is as long as a month a third day is as long as a week the remaining are what 37 days and these days you have to calculate it to come up with some certain figure the day which is as long as a year it is an actual year but instead of the Sun coming in 24 hours it takes so long that a duration of a whole year the Companions asked a prophet of Allah in this day that is equivalent to a year should we pray five frames of a day so no you have to estimate meaning that you have to pray the prayer of 360 days throughout that day which the Sun would set in a full year and likewise with a month and likewise with a week and this is why the fatwa of the people in Sweden and Norway who have six months of daytime and six months of complete nighttime how would they pray because madam is not due yet so six months that happened Allah there is no poverty we wait until the Sun sets no you have to look to the closest country that has a break of dawn and sunset and pray according to their timetable according to their five prayers who will follow the day job I think we have 5 minutes more ok so who are the followers of the dead Jack the Prophet told the Sally salatu salam that the vast majority of the followers of the Dajjal are one the Jews to the none Arabs because they have problems through the language you have to learn Arabic to become an Arab and be a Muni Sharma and those own own as a cook so the moguls the people from the Soviet states who will follow them the Bedouins because even though there were errors but they have zero knowledge of the religion and women the Prophet said are a sort of Salam the Jews 70,000 of them with a special type of cloth called pyah pyah lisa will follow the dead jack and as for the women the prophet told the Sallisaw - Salam that when the dead approaches Medina and cannot enter it comes outside of it the vast majority of women would come out of Medina to follow him and believe in him the Prophet says are associated to the extent that a man would go to his women folk change them to the house so that they do not leave he would change his mother his daughter his sister his aunt so that they would not come out and believe in the de jure authenticated by a massacre may Allah have mercy on his soul so this is scale and there is no discrimination the sisters would say why why us well there there are Turks there are moguls there are the Bedouins there are the Jews there are the non Arabs also they are men but women in general are weak by nature and this is a fact they can be easily manipulated with soft words and a good husband is the one who knows how to speak to his wife he could win her heart with a rose with a bottle of perfume with a dinner and a nice restaurant and he can lose her forever by saying harsh words or bad comments they and this is the beauty of women you know imagine yourself marrying a man it's really boring so yeah this is the nature men are from Venus or women are from Venus and and men are from Mars so they have to understand but this vulnerability this weakness is something that is natural that is why they have to be careful about this so I think we will stop here in sha Allah and prepare for the salat wa llahu our laboratory minister was all alone on balcony now"
