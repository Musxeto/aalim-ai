  "title": "Ruling on buying & using fire crackers. Can we let our kids watch Fireworks on New Year's Assimalhak",
  "transcript": "is from faisa she says can i let my kids enjoy watching fireworks which will happen on new year we don't celebrate such events though new year is gone so to answer this question is for the benefit of the muslims insha allah for future times what is a ruling on buying and using fireworks the most authentic opinion is that this is prohibited due to the fact that it is a huge waste of wealth and money secondly that there is harm to others who are frightened by the sounds thirdly it is haram due to the harm it may cause every few weeks or months we hear about the destruction of neighborhoods in china in bangladesh in such countries due to an explosion in a firework warehouse or a factory etc also in some events this may take place that before the launch of such fireworks an explosion or an accident could take place and the benefits gained from it are not sufficient to justify such a haram thing now this is when it comes to one plus one equals two but usually we have to go beyond that and read between the lines now if i live in a non-muslim country that celebrates such events with fireworks and unfortunately even some muslim countries have done exactly what the prophet warned us from allah the prophet said in an authentic hadith you shall follow the way of those before you inch by inch even if they were to enter a desert lizards hole you will follow them even a hand span even a foot even an inch no matter what they do you're gonna mimic them so the companion said are you referring to the jews and the christians and the prophet said as um who else yes this is what i was referring to so now a lot of the muslims have done that exactly and they celebrate christmas the new year and they claim to be muslims and they spend millions of dollars on such celebrations so the concept when you read between the lines it's not just watching fireworks and enjoying the scene it what entails it's what is embedded when our children muslim children the grandsons of khalid waleed the grandsons of great uh companions of the prophet allah lose their faith in their own religion and see how beautiful other religions are they're celebrating they're enjoying new year or christmas they're partying music liquor good time wearing their best they look beautiful this causes an inferiority complex in the minds of the children let alone the adults there are adults who are brainwashed i'm talking about the children when they grow up they think that these are good celebrations they have santa claus we muslims don't have anything like that why is that we don't have anyone to bring us gifts like sarah so this causes them to grow in a way that would make them a prodigy a good fertile land to be conquered and to infest it with western and kafir ideologies and this is what we see today so in a short in a nutshell faisa no you should prevent your children from watching such fireworks preserve their identity and their religion and try your level best to give them something that substitutes them with rather than this haram celebrations"
