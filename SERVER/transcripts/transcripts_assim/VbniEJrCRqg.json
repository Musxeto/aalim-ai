  "title": "Is dying without taking Pledge (Bait vs Bayyah) Kufr?  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh kalthum from india uh so some scholars in sub continent says that the one who dies without taking back means pledge dies on kofuru is this true okay come question was about baya or pledge and the hadith of the prophet islam whoever dies without a pledge to an imam then he will die the death of al-jahiliyah of free islamic era not to die on the kuffer this is not meant here now what is this pledge uh meant by the pledge is not like what you guys in the subcontinent think that i have to go to a sheikh or to appear um usually the sufis do it and give him my pledge that he will control my life as the man who's washing a deceased corpse controls it no this is not true the pledge that is meant in the hadith is to have the allegiance to a muslim ruler so now in india you don't have such a muslim ruler so what to do you have to look for a muslim ruler that you give even if not personally the pledge of a allegiance to so you consider for example the ruler of this country or the muslim imam of this country a ruler with a country with an army with with power to be your imam and whatever he says you follow and this is what is meant by it and allah knows best"
