  "transcript": "Halima from France Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Yes Sir, sorry Sir, I think sometimes when I get the wiswas and people get this also so some people, I think some people are judging me because of it like have these thoughts that people listening to my wiswas and they do judge me for it and they do believe what the satan is telling them about me so how can I go about this sometimes even sometimes people don't does not they don't ask me they just jump into conclusion and judge and believe it. I mean yeah Halima we've said this so many times don't care about what others people say because these people they apply the rule of damn if you do damn if you don't so no matter what you do you're always accused and confronted if you keep on caring about what people say about you you will spend your life wasting it on on trying to defend yourself explain your point of view life is too short you do whatever you want to do as long as you're pleasing Allah Azza wa Jal and don't care about what people say and whatever they say who cares the dogs will always continue to bark we can't stop for such things and Allah knows best"
