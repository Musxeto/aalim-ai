  "transcript": "alhamdulillah after praising almighty allah i thank all of you for coming over for the program and it's our pleasure and honor to introduce your distinguished guest sheikh asim lokman al-hakim sheikh asim lahman al-hakim he's from saudi arabia and he has done his ba linguistics and higher diploma in islamic studies from umalkara university and he's been a khatib in a masjid in jeddah for not less than 19 years and he's been giving does there in the masjid alhamdulillah and he is coming in all major islamic television satellite televisions like peace tv and his program especially on youth is quite famous and sheikh is also hr manager in sami rocks alhamdulillah now sheikh will deliver lecture on the topic iman believing is for living so i call upon our distinct guest sheikh to take over him foreign allah the almighty has revealed a surah so great that an imam shafer may allah have mercy on his soul said if allah only revealed this surah to the people it would have sufficed it would have been enough for them this surah is suratul allah says bismillah it would take us lectures after lectures only to describe these three ayahs and to talk about the benefits we can get from them allah the almighty is swearing by al-assar which can translate into time it can also translate to the prayer itself we pray salat al-assar and the thing that allah swears upon is that all humans are in loss all mankind is in loss and on the day of judgment you have only those who are successful and those who are losers so the successful would go to paradise may allah make me and you among them and the losers would go to hell so all mankind is losers with the exception of a group and this group has characteristics four of them actually the first one is those who believe the second who offer righteous deeds the third who recommend to one another to act and believe in truth and who recommend to one another to be patient we will talk about iman which is we what we are doing to elevate in ourselves so that we would be among this group that will be salvaged that will be saved from going into hell if you look into the hadith of the the prophet sallallahu alaihi he tells us that his ummah will be divided into 73 sects the jews before us divided into 71 all in hell except one the christians divided into 72 all in hell except one and the prophet is telling us that we the muslims will be divided into 73 sects all in hell except one and to be among this one we have to know what are the characteristics and they are the same as mentioned in the ayah al-adhina amanua the sect that will be saved is the one that would follow my footsteps and my companions therefore it is essential that we learn what was the prophet salaam creed what was his what was his belief and to act upon it because otherwise we would not be following his footsteps hence we would not go to paradise if you understand the importance of aqira and you scrutinize the 73 sects though the prophet did not mention them but we can analyze this when we look at the different sects in our ummah they differ with the methodology of the prophet alaihis they differ with him in the belief in allah's attributes if we give a test to the brothers and sisters about allah's attributes we would find great failure those who claim to be muslims when you stand five times a day before allah azza praying do you know who you're praying to he says yes so okay here's the name or paper right what you know probably two three lines and that's it what are the attributes of allah write what you know maybe 20 30 attributes you know by heart what about the rest you do not know who you are worshiping and that is why we have a lack of power in our iman because the knowledge is not there and that's why we have 73 sects may allah have mercy on his soul wrote three big volumes on what a book he called madame he is only talking about the verse what are the levels in it more than 1200 pages on one verse of al-fatiha do we know allah azzawajal no we don't i have to unfortunately say this therefore if you know allah azzawajal if you know his attributes if you know what the other sects said about the quran they say that it is something that is created if you know about allah where is allah and i was talking this morning with some of the brother brothers or last night i don't recall where is allah a lot of the people say allah is everywhere everywhere with his knowledge or everywhere with himself they don't know and some of them said yes himself and this is kufur this is blasphemy is on his throne subhanallah on the heavens subhanallah and he is with us with his knowledge with his power he hears and sees whatever happens if you look in the definition of iman you would find that a lot of the muslim sects left islam because of this or they're about to leave islam they are about to nullify their islam how is that people have different opinion when it comes to iman and the definition of iman as muslims we believe that iman is a belief in the heart something that we say with our tongues and actions that we do with our bodies in arabic it's very eloquently said these are three things you have to believe in your heart you have to say it and you have to act upon it if you look at the far extremes of the muslim sects we have al-khawarijj and we have al-murjiya you all know what al-murjiya is now even the people in america know about it because all terrorists are khawa hawari so even then they have the word khawarij but are the majority of muslims unfortunately in a sense what is the common denominator between both of them is there anything common khawaris say if you make a major sin you are kafir murji i say whatever you do as long as you believe you are the greatest believer on earth you are even greatest greater than abu bakr and your iman is like them so is there anything coming between them this man says if you lie it's a major sin you're kafir you're in hell this man says whatever you do you have carte blanche do it because you have the belief in your heart is there any common denominator between them yes what is it they're extreme okay fair enough no but there is in iman they all share the concept in their definition of iman how is that they believe that iman is one entity either you have it all or you lose it all so al hawari say if you make a major sin it's gone it cannot be repossessed khalas the murji essay whatever you do it will never affect your iman because it's a whole it's something an entity that cannot be reduced so they share the same concept though they are extreme right and left this is our belief the belief of all schools of thought in islam the belief of hanafi madhhab shafiri and maliki al-hambeli and all the scholars of islam they believe that iman increases and decreases mercy on his soul says the consensus of all the companions of the prophet ali and all those who followed them from the from the taberean that a man is a belief an intention and something that you say in something that you do and you cannot believe in one of them or do one of them and leave the other you have to take the three as a whole otherwise your iman is not accepted and therefore it is common sense that whoever believes claims to believe in allah and his existence but he doesn't act upon it at all then he's like pharaoh and he's like iblis do you have more knowledge than iblis iblis was with the jinn he's he's from the jinn and he was with the angels and allah instructed the angels and instructed the iblis to prostrate to adam so he saw the whole thing he was there yet he refused can anyone say that iblis is a believer no he's not a believer why though he has the intention he has the belief in his heart but his acts did not rectify his belief that is why he is a kafir and the opposite anyone who acts like a believer he prays he fast he does all good deeds but in his heart he doesn't have this what is he what do we call him a hypocrite he is that is why they used to pray this is extremely awkward in surat and nisa allah azzawajal mentioned this and in other surahs that they used to pray with the prophet which means that they pray but they're lazy they are the hypocrites how many muslims do you know that they don't even pray no lazy and no otherwise they don't pray at all yet they claim to be the biggest believers and muslims they know so all of this falls into the fact that you cannot have belief without actually doing it so when you come to the interpretation or the definition of belief linguistically it is iman is belief iman linguistically is belief prayer linguistically is very good every every word in islam has a linguistic meaning the arabic meaning and it has a sharing meaning a meaning that is related to islam when we say zakat meaning purification and increase when we see umrah linguistically meaning visit umrah in in arabic means to visit and that is why the people in mecca when they want to make umrah what did what do they do they go out to masjid aisha to they make haram and they come back why because if they make their haram from inside who are they visiting they are in their home they have to go out and this is what is the definition of umrah etc now if you look at the quran you will seldom find that allah azzawajal is addressing the believers without joining those who do righteous deeds it's always combined it is there isn't it's rarely found that you say it doesn't mention anything afterwards that is related to righteous deeds allah almighty says at the end of surat al-kaff verily those who believe and do righteous righteous deeds shall have the guardians of al-fardoz for their entertainment in the latina therefore what a lot of the muslims believe in that it's enough that i say i'm a muslim i don't have to pray i don't have to do good deeds this is not true and a lot of the muslims who are sinful who have bad deeds who are not doing what allah mandated upon them it is wrong when they think that we are believers and that is why the prophet sallallahu alaihi who said them once addressed the muslims and said o you who believe by your tongues and iman did not enter your hearts yet this means that there are believers in the surface but iman did not enter their hearts yes what did he say oh you believe by your tongues and a man did not enter your hearts yet do not backbite the muslims he's telling them because what you're doing is against your claim of believing do not backbite muslims and do not follow their shortcomings because whoever follow a muslims shortcomings allah will follow his shortcomings and whomever allah follows his shortcomings allah will make it public to everyone even if he was in the middle of his own home likewise the prophet salallahu once defined the muslim and the min and he said the muslim is a person who the muslims are safe from his tongue rhetoric and from his hand actions now before we go on to defining are we like this are people safe are muslims safe from our actions most of us say yes we don't get like to get into fights usually we always on the end at losing end people now no aikido jiu jitsu karate taekwondo kung fu and we see small people like this you know we want to fight with them in five seconds later you're on the ground in your blood it's it's better to be safe than sorry what about our tongues our rhetoric are muslims safe from our tongues i know people that cannot go to bed unless they sit with their friends and chit-chat about everyone they know he's short he's fat he's dark he's white he's uh he does this he takes money he's poor he's rich and they just gossip long ago with all the respect with sisters to the sisters we used to consider gossiping a feature of women and when we see two men talking and gossiping say don't be like women nowadays men are even worse than this and it might be later on that women would say gossiping is a feature of men they work in in their workplace gossiping and chit-chatting and backbiting muslims and all of this is a sign that iman is not in their hearts now a lot of the muslims ask the common question how can i elevate my iman how can i increase my iman all agree on one concept that iman is increased by offering good deeds and staying away from sin and iman decreases by not offering good deeds and by committing sin the minute you commit a sin no matter how small it is you will find the stress in your heart you'll find this depression you would find a black cloud covering your heart your belief and your face and i know people allah subhanallah not that i am a saint i i know people and you know people you see some people sometimes you see people who say mashallah your face is glowing he says yes i have electricity 110. it doesn't have to do with electricity you can see the traces of ibaadah of iman it's innovating and it shows in his face and sometimes you see righteous people practicing people but you see a cloud on their face and you say what is it is is there anything wrong and i i've seen this i speak to people said he said no i'm good okay why he looks strange anyhow it's just a thought and then he breaks down and says and confesses i did something wrong he tells me this this is not going first of all it is not advisable to confess about your sins because you have allah once you confess and tell people about your sins then allah will not forgive it for you unless you're asking for a solution you go for a a scholar and you tell him allah i did this and that and i want to know how to repent or how can i conceal this or how can i make it up but we don't have like the christians do a confession box and uh forgive me father for i have sinned and you tell him the whole lesson the father says okay can i have the numbers please okay what's the address of this place in that place and then go and do whatever you wish you have been forgiven no alhamdulillah islam we don't have this at all so iman increases and decreases what is the evidence it's overwhelming in the quran and in the sunnah but i'll recite one ayah in surat if i recall correctly allah says and whenever there comes down a surah some of them that is from the hypocrites some of them say which of you has had his faith increased by it we have surahs after surah nothing changes so which one this surah added value to him allah says as for those who believe it has increased their faith and they rejoice so it does increase the faith and then allah says but for as for those in whose hearts is a disease it will add suspicion and doubt to their suspicion disbelief and doubt and they did while they are disbelievers and they die while they are disbelievers so iman increases and here also kuffer and disbelief and doubt increases as well so all of these things it knowing it is not enough you have to act upon it you have to check yourself am i on the right track am i increasing my iman you have to have a gauge and always audit your life every single day how am i doing am i progressing am i getting closer to allah or am i getting further from allah am i diverting from the straight path or am i walking on the straight path the prophet when he talked about iman he talked it about it generally and he talked about it specifically when he talked about it generally he mentioned that there are pillars of iman how many six questions okay six pillars of iman the people are awake still up till now and these are general but when he spoke about it specifically in details he did not mention them to us but he said that iman is a number in 60 or a number and 70 branches and he did not mention them to us he mentioned only three the top is this is something you say and you believe and the least is removing uh obstacles or or something that is harmful from the people's way and this is action and then he mentioned alhaya which is bashfulness he said bashfulness is a branch of iman and bashfulness is something that you actually believe in so la ilaha is said removing obstacles is done and bashfulness is what you believe in what you act upon as well also in other hadiths the prophet told us that prayer fasting zakat pilgrimage which all are pillars of islam they are also part of the branches of iman and a lot of us say and believe that iman is only in the heart and we're always faced with the same statement whenever we see someone doing something wrong we say brother this is haram the prophet said so-and-so brother allah said so so you cannot do this what is the typical response allah is most forgiving a man is in the heart whenever you approach a sister who's beautiful dressed up with makeup exposing herself you don't the sisters do but whenever a sister approaches another sister telling her sister you have to cover you cannot expose yourself like this you are exposing yourself like cheap meat and all the dogs outside are waiting for a bite you have to cover yourself respect yourself this is for all your own good and for the good of the other men she says a man is in the heart what would the veil covering my head do add value what would address add value to my belief in allah azzawajal this is crooked understanding and and and not a correct way of looking at things well allah and the prophet also corrected this way of thinking when he said allah the almighty does not look at your pictures at your physique nor at your wealth meaning allah doesn't look at your bank account alhamdulillah otherwise we would be in trouble so allah azzawajal doesn't look at how rich you are or how poor you are he doesn't look how you look if you're tall if you're short if you are healthy if you are sick it doesn't matter allah only looks at your hearts and your deeds the all the people say are these as well i thought only hearts why is this is this an authentic hadith this hadith is muslim how more authentic can you go allah only looks at your hearts and deeds so when someone says to you i don't have to pray fajr because i'm a believer when someone tells you i don't have to wear this because i have enough iman to cover my aura now work walk naked if you have strong man just walk like this don't need to wear any clothes what is this no you have to"
