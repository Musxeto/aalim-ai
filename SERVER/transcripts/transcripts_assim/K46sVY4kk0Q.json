  "title": "Reward of reciting 10, 100, 1000 ayahs in night prayers, is Fatiha included? #Assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um there is a Hadith about reading 100 verses at night so my question is in Isa prayer we recite Surah fa six times in six ra so will it count as seven verses or 42 verses in the 100 Ayah as we recited the F six times this Hadith is an authentic Hadith where the Prophet saidat whoever recites at night prayer with 10 verses he will not be registered as the negligent and whoever recites a 100 verses at night prayer he would be among the those who prolong their prayers and uh uh um make Kun and stand up in in in recitation of the Quran so this is not related to ISA prayer rather it's related to what comes after of night prayer is the fa considered to be part of it or not it's an issue of dispute I personally believe and I'm inclined to say that this is not part of the fat the fat is not part of the 100 so that it would be a pillar of the prayer that your prayer is invalid with so the 100 ay should be other than the fat some Scholars may consider it to be part of the 100 ayas but it's best to be safe rather than S story and Allah Knows Best"
