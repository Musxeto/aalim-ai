  "transcript": "Adeeb from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh, is it permissible to make a donation to a mixed gender school in Bangladesh considering that most educational centers and workplaces in the country have a mixed environment? Especially Sheikh, I am talking about a school where students are 5 to 12 years of age and take each of their class in a mixed classroom. Jazakallah. Wa Jazakum. First of all, the donation itself is not targeting the mixing of the genders. And the mixing of the gender is a by-product of the original purpose. The donation is to help and escalate the educational process, which no one disputes that it is a necessity, especially in our developing countries. Therefore, if there is a school that is segregated and they're following the shari'a, it is the best to focus and to direct all of your donations to it or to them. But if there aren't such schools and this is the best available, in this case, inshallah, your donations would be accepted because, as I said earlier, it's not directed to the free mixing. Rather, it is directed to the educational process and Allah knows best."
