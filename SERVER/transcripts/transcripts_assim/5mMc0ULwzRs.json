  "transcript": "he says what is the ruling on people who read the quran out loud while sitting in the masjid when i try to read quietly i get distracted am i in the wrong the prophet salallahu salaam ordered the muslims in an authentic hadith not to raise their voices with the quran competing with one another whose voice is louder and this is not only for the quran it's also for the dikkar and it's also for the dua whenever you're on your own and you're not harming anyone or annoying anyone you can raise your voice you can recite it silently it's up to your preference the best is to be in a moderate way so you don't raise your voice as if you're shouting and if you do not read it silently so no one would hear it and this came in a hadith when the prophet hassam once passed by abu bakr reciting the quran silently at night time and he passed by romar reciting loudly at night time so he asked abu bakr why are you reciting it so silently he said oh prophet of allah the one i'm communicating with and that is allah has heard me so why would i raise my voice and umar said may allah be pleased with him i raise my voice so that i would wake up the one who is asleep and ward off the shaytan so by raising my voice those who are asleep would wake up and follow suit and pray night prayer so the prophet isam said to abu bakr raise your voice a little bit and said to umar lower your voice a little bit but when a person is within others or in the vicinity of others if me reciting the quran would distract them this becomes prohibited upon me because i should not be happy or boastful of my voice or even to the to um how do you say to keep my concentration focused i must not raise my voice just to please myself or to keep my concentration focused while harming others yes if i recite in a moderate voice so the one next to me cannot differentiate the words or the i as i'm reciting he doesn't know whether i'm reciting surat al-qaf or all what he's hears is so this type i hope they don't make a meme out of that in this type of recitation is adequate but when you start pronouncing the words loudly audibly and the people get distracted because they're focusing in a different place this becomes haram and allah knows best"
