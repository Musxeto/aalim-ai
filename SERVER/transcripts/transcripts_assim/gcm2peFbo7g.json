  "title": "Do we need to pay zakah for gold which we have saved for our children marriage",
  "transcript": "Nim sends us three questions the first one is if I have bought gold for the purpose of getting my children married in the future do I need to pay zat on it so this is one scenario the second scenario that you yourself want to get married and you're saving money do I have to pay zakat for it the third scenario I'm saving money to build a house or to do this or to have an operation a medical operation may Allah protect us all or I want to buy a car and I'm saving money do I have to pay zakat the answer to all these questions is yes whenever you save money and you have the money in your possession and it reaches theab which is the limit that whatever is below it there is no zaka and whatever is above it is zaka and the nisab is 595 gr of silver the equivalent of that and if you have one year that passes over this amount of money in your possession after one lunar year you have to give 2.5% of it for zakat any money that you save you have to give 2.5 after one year for zakat except if the money is not yours or if the money does not belong to anyone and how could that be for example we want to build a a mosque so this brother gives 10,000 the other one gives 100,000 and the third one gives 5,000 and we're saving the money and a whole year passes and the money is not enough to build a mosque do I give zakat the answer is no why is that because the money does not belong to a particular individual likewise a a group of a thousand people friends in a company they say we would like to open a wallet or a pot where we put our donations in so one puts 100 another puts 500s and so on and they collect a lump sum of money this money does not belong to any one of them no one is has the right to take back anything that he had given but they agreed on spending this money for the needs of any of the Thousand who participated once they have a problem so if they have for example um an accident one of them has an accident his house gets on fire may Allah protect us all they agreed initially before they gave this money or donated this money that whoever needs the the money to solve a Calamity or a problem he can take from it and it's his so this is collaborating on virtue this is contribution on good things therefore there isn't an owner for that money so even if a year or two or more passes we don't give zakat over this money because it does not belong to anyone"
