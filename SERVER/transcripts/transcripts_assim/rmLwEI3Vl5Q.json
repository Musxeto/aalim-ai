  "transcript": "and welcome to this new program dedicated to studying a beautiful and Noble science known as as what is is an Arabic word it's plural ofal and it is a science related to studying the characteristics of the Prophet sallallah alaihi Al wasallam whether related to him physically how he looks how uh um he appears his height his color his hair the way he walks or related to his ethics and moral conduct and behavior which is related also to how he trusted Allah how he had hope in Allah his content and his behavior with his wives with his children with his companions with the non-muslims and with the Muslims and his transactions whether it is commercial or social and also how he used to behave in the sense of his sleeping patterns what he ate what he uh uh loved to dress in and also anything connected to him such as his rides the animals he used to use his utensils his bed his household Etc some of the scholars even included the things he used to do as forms of worship related to his prayer to the way he fasted to how he performed Hajj Etc now one may ask a question what is the benefit of studying such a science when it's related to S so what's the difference between and the well is a holistic form of Science in the sense that it talks about everything that happened and took place in the life of the Prophet Alat so things are scattered in the it's exactly like for example of the Quran you get to learn everything related to all over the place but when it comes to the reason of revelation of a particular Ayah you'll find it scattered if you collect it in a book then you have the signs ofb likewise the S is a whole broad topic but when you collect from the the scattered information about how the prophet used to sleep and then put it in a chapter this becomes and S as well has many aspects so it includes the prophet's battles the incidents that took place and it includes a lot about the companions where the sh Deals Only and specifically about the prophet and the as stated earlier speaks a lot about everything while speaks specifically about the Miracles in his life the things that should be collected and focused upon rather than speaking in a generic uh uh way what is the importance of studying such a science first of all we know that the three questions in your grave that each and every individual of us will be asked upon are who's your lord what is your religion and who's this man who was sent to you so it's part of your religion to know almost everything about your Prophet Alat wasam Allah says in the Quran don't they know the messenger that was sent to them or are they denying him so the knowledge of the prophet Alam is extremely important as Allah always selects the best of people to send as Messengers and this is why all the time Allah tells us that he sent to ad their Brethren Hood to their Brethren someone they know his lineage his uh um upbringing his eths his honesty his integrity so in order for us to increase our IM to the prophet alai we requ we required to study such a science also the more you study this science the more your love is increased to the prophet Alat wasam because if you don't love the prophet Alat wasam you're not a Believer let's not beat around the bush there are some ignorant imbeciles among the Muslims who say I follow the prophet I believe in him but I don't love him well you're not a Muslim you will not complete your Islam and become a full-fledged mmin until he becomes more beloved to you than your parents than your wife than your children than your own self than your own soul this is how important our love to the prophet Alat it is part of the religion and there's nothing to him he's not going to gain any wealth from us loving him but this is part of the religion then we increase once we know this science we increase in followship of him so the more you know the prophet wasallam the more you comply and follow him sallallahu alaihi wasallam which would lead you faster and easier to Jen and finally the knowledge we get from this science makes us steadfast on Islam which is something we highly re need and is highly required in this era of fitna where everything around us is snatching the Believers from their Iman and the enemies of Islam are plotting against our belief so when you know the science of a and how he behaved Alat this makes you steadfast in fighting these doubts and misconceptions that the enemies of Islam try to infiltrate our belief with so I hope by studying this science that we will get closer to Allah and that we will increase in our love to the prophet Alat wasam and this book we attempt to study is the authentic version of which was originally compiled by the IM Muhammad may Allah have mercy on his soul filtered the book and selected to us what is the most authentic of it and this is what we will attempt to study so I pray to Allah that it is a beneficial study and that we get closer to the love of our Prophet through it [Music] mamed"
