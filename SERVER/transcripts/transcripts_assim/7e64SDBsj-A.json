  "transcript": "yes I hope you're doing very well sir yes like um I read that if we don't lose anything until we start to lose our religion and Allah says that it will test us with something of fear so we should fear him so recently I noticed that um my fery is now most of the time after Sunrise so my as my Isa is about 15 to 20 minutes midnight so my my prayer is the rest of my prayer have manageable and um I've been struggling to learn Arabic language since at least 2022 so I keep getting discouraged and forgetting and most of it um I've been brainwashed like if you should tell me something today in the next 15 minutes I've forgotten so how can can you please help me in this kind of situation and is the Dua that says oh Allah help me to remember you to worship you and to thank give thanks to you in the best manner do it suffice in this kind in this kind of situation sir this Dua is narrated by mu jab may Allah be pleased with him and he instructed he was instructed by the prophet to say this Dua at the end of every Salat so we say it before we conclude our Salat and we say it after Salat we always say it all the time your problem with memory is done through or is solved through practice practice makes perfect so if you fail to memorize few things repeating them 10 times 50 times 100 times would cement it in your memory and this is what a lot of the of the Quran do when they want to cement their memorization they repeat the same Ayah 100 times and this would make it fixed in their memory for a quite a long time in Allah so you give it a shot and a try"
