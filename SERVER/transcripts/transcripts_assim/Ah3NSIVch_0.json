  "transcript": "Sadiq from India. He says he doesn't have \nscholars around to talk to. So how can he learn?  Well, unfortunately, when you live in \na place where there are no scholars,   it's like living in the Desert. \nBecause you need scholars.  I need scholars, to talk to, to \ncommunicate with, to seek their advice,   and to gain from their wisdom.\nIf you don't have this   then you have to improvise. And Alhamdulillah with \ntoday's technology there is always the internet,   there is always YouTube. So in the internet, you \nhave one of the best, if not THE best, islamic   website today is - www.islamqa.info\nThis is the best islamic site you   can learn a lot from. And Alhamdulillah \nYouTube channel you have so many shuyūkh,   so many students of knowledge that have their \nmaterial there. A lot of materials of Sheikh   bin Baz, ibn Uthaymeen and imam al-Albani is \nthere in arabic and also translated in subtitles   underneath in English and different languages. So \nyou can learn from that with the grace of Allah."
