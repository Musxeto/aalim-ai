  "transcript": "foreign and then it is sunset when we break our fast we drink we eat and then we praise Allah the Almighty by saying a supplication that the prophet Allah used to say we say Allah which translates to The Thirst has gone and the veins are moistened and the reward is certain with the will of Allah Almighty whenever I go through this Hadith it summarizes our life on this Earth so many things that we do to please Allah azzawajal are difficult we don't find our desire in them so many things that we abstain and refrain from doing for the sake of Allah the Almighty we find our desires pushing us to do them but what prevents us from doing that is this Hadith when someone cuts over you while driving you have the urge to express your rage and anger what stops you not the fear that he might hit me back it is the fear that Allah would not be pleased with me so I I suppress and repress my anger wanting the reward that Allah azzawajal has promised and I say The Thirst is gone when my wife is disobedient or she is hyper nagging and not very respectful sometimes I can as a man express my manhood by shouting by spanking by doing something but I don't because I remember that my Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had never done such a thing and I always recall and remember The Thirst has gone so if we apply this in our lives we will perfect the work that we're supposed to do we will perfect the subjects that we are supposed to study we will excel in the quality of our work we would be out of our way an excellent character with others Muslims and non-muslims this doesn't mean that it is easy this doesn't mean that I love to do this I'm doing it for the sake of Allah because I know that all this hardship that I'm going through in repressing my anger and compelling myself to Excel and to do good things that Allah would be pleased with when I do this and I see the fruit being reaped I just sit back and say The Thirst is gone and the veins are moistened and the reward is certain with the grace of Allah and if Allah Wills this this is life and we are merely on this world on this Earth to be tested we will find the results of our test on the day of judgment and there will only be two parties one in heaven and one in hell therefore if you wish to be among those who are blessed and favored by Allah to go to paradise to accompany the prophet you have to always keep in mind this Hadith if you want to go to bed if you want to enjoy sleeping the whole night remember that if you wake up in the middle of the night if you pray supplicate result Quran and seek Allah's forgiveness then Allah would reward you the paradise but if you continue to sleep as you do every single day if you continue not to fast voluntary fasts such as fasting Monday and Thursdays the white days Ashura arafah Etc if you continue to watch your bank account rise rise and increase and you fail to give money to charity to your local Masjid to your Islamic Center to feeding the poor to helping the needy if you keep on being arrogant and not willing to learn and not willing to be modest and humble to others then you would not be entitled to go to paradise because you did not suffer the thirst of fasting and this is the difference between a person who eats all day drinks all day and when the sun sets look at him and a person who was fasting did not consume any food or drinks until it was sunset and now he's breaking his fast what's the difference between them the first one says I I enjoy the beautiful meal at lunch I had a very big and fat breakfast and then what nothing but this man the second righteous person who was fasting the whole day after breaking his fast ask him were you hungry no it's all gone I don't recall anything of the difficulties of The Hunger of The Thirst because now it's all gone the veins are moistened The Thirst is gone the stomach is full and the reward is certain with the grace of Allah the old mighty foreign This Is The Life that we all should be looking for the life that Allah is pleased with and the life that the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam used to lead we make a mistake when we think that we are on Earth forever or to stay look around you how many of those whom you know have passed away how many have died and start to analyze by yourself there are people among those who've passed away that I'm so happy for them I believe that Allah would admit them to Paradise because they had excellent character because they used to offer a lot of good deeds yet there are others whom I'm afraid and I pray to Allah that my doubts are not correct because they did not used to worship Allah as he instructed they were evil they were bad in character they were stingy they used to lie they used to break their promises they were bad with their wives and children so if this life deceives people you and I should not be among those who are deceived this life is so beautiful So Glamorous so tempting but if you read the Quran if you read the Sunnah you will find that we are instructed not to be deceived whenever I come to the UK the brothers may Allah reward them invite me to a restaurant here and there and I answer most of the times their invitation though I'm not very fond of eating outside and whenever they serve something and it's expensive I tend to tell them this is not the right way of doing it I always remember the Hadith of the Prophet Allah and when he said that Allah gave us an example of this Dunya with the food that the humans consume look at the meal the prophet says if you decorate it if you put spices and salt on it it becomes beautiful but look after you eat it what would be the result if you eat a hundred pound worth of a meal the result would be the same as if you eat a one pound meal so open your eyes don't be seated with the Dunya hasten to do things that Allah loves and then on the day of judgment you will sit back and relax and say insha Allah and the reward is certain with the grace of Allah"
