  "title": "Wudu is not required for Tawaf & Saee, so how to perform prayers after that? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "lean says since it is not obligatory to be in the states of Purity during tawaf and PSY then how are we going to perform prayers when the Adan is called simply you can go and perform your question with all the respect does not make sense if I prayed Russia and I'm making tawaf and say and we know that you do not have to be in the state of wudu I have no problem but if I prayed Maghrib and I'm making my tawaf and say and I'm not in the state of voodoo and the other of Asia is called how can I pray there's nothing contradicting between the issue of making tawaf inside without being in the seat of voodoo and between making World of War prayer these are two separate things and Allah Knows Best"
