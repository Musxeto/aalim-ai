  "transcript": "yes mean from sweden my question is can i take selfies or like pictures in my phone and keep it as a memory okay i will answer inshallah it's me from sweden she asks a frequently asked question is it permissible for a sister a woman to take selfies of herself or pictures and keep it away from people's eyes generally speaking this shouldn't be a problem when it comes to halal and haram as long as no one sees it actually this is not a problem the problem is that we have to prevent the means that may cause to a problem so for example if i see a beautiful woman a supermodel and i look at her looking at her is haram nobody says that's halal but if i don't do anything after that why would it be haram i'm just looking as if i'm looking at a wall what's the problem ah this look would lead to consequences corrupting the soul corrupting the heart provoking your desire maybe it would lead to haram so this is blocking the means and likewise when a woman takes a selfie and it's her in her mobile nobody is watching nobody is looking it's not even uploaded to the cloud so that we could say that some super powers would invade your privacy and would hack your account and take a look it's totally uh kosher as they say generally speaking this is okay but as part of blocking the means islam recommends we recommend that you do not do this and we i'm inclined to it being more haram than permissible why is that because i know and people who have knowledge and technology know that if i take a picture with my mobile phone or with my pda or i save it in my computer even if i format it even if it's broken even if it's not functional still experts can retrieve the data and i have a personal friend of mine who bought a second-hand laptop and the laptop was fully uh uh formatted and everything on it was erased complete nothing he gave it to a friend of his to store and to put some software word microsoft office etc and the man retrieved everything that was formatted and my friend was telling me i was shocked i didn't ask for this but i saw so many personal photographs of families of from this country and it was all personal but they thought that formatting the hard disk would it is everything on it which is not true therefore a muslim a practicing sister woman who wears the nikab who wears the hijab who doesn't want anyone to look at a single centimeter of her aura of her body because she fears allah having her selfies defies this purpose when there is a possibility of the mobile being stolen being hacked people watching it and a lot of jojo knows best"
