  "title": "Fear on The Day Of Judgment even for those who answer the 3 questions in the grave? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so U my question is uh regarding the day of judgment so from what I understand after um we're placed in the grave and we're asked the three questions independent on if we answer correctly or incorrectly we'll know our destination so my question is what's the um why is there nervousness on the day of judgment if if everybody knows where they're going because this nervousness is caused by the horrific day even if you have confirmation that you will be inshallah in Jenna this confirmation is not an assurance that you will not go to hell now you remember there are three questions who's your lord what is your religion and who's this man who was sent to you you answer it correctly you will be resting in your grave now this doesn't mean that if you don't if you had done certain sins such as backbiting not cleaning yourself well after urinating or answering the call of nature Etc that you won't be punished in your grave you will be this does not mean that when you go on the day of judgment and held accountable for your sins that you'll go straight ahead to Jenna you will be punished for your sins Maybe maybe you will be admitted for Hellfire for a year for a thousand for a million until Allah wills it and you're purified from your sins then you'll be admitted to Paradise either way with all such assurances you're still terrified because you don't know what your fate is going to be unlike those who will be among the 70,000 may Allah make me and you among them and our viewers as well who will not be held accountable and what would not be tormented they will be in the shade of Allah on the day of judgment they have no fear they will go and be admitted to paradise and all their sins would be erased and forgiven that's a different story the vast majority of the public of the people would be questioned in their graves and regardless of how positive well if it's a negative answer the stress is logical what what do they expect other than being thrown into hell they have to be scared like crazy but those who are giving yeah the green pass that inshallah they are in Paradise they're still intimidated by the fact of their sins and of the horrific scenes of the day of judgment and Allah Knows Best"
