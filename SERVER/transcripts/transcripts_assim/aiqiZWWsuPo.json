  "transcript": "sh if my dad who's not a Muslim died before me who how does the inheritance work so who is not who's who's not Muslim yeah di uh my my father if your father is non-muslim okay how does the inheritance work or can I attend his funeral and stuff it is not permissible for a Muslim to attend the funeral of non Muslims whether their parents their siblings their loved ones it is not permissible because this or these rituals are related to another religion as for the inheritance the vast majority of Muslims say that it is not permissible for a non-muslim to inherit a Muslim and it's not permissible for a Muslim to inherit a cafir and this is the majority of Scholars some Scholars among some companions say like mu Abu sufyan uh and may Allah be peace with him and his father and others among the Companions and great Scholars like IB Tamia say that the Muslims May inherit their cfir parents but not the opposite and they justify this by saying that the money would have gone somewhere else instead of the Muslims and Islam benefiting from it and they say that we're allowed to marry their women but their men are not allowed to marry are women so the non-muslims men cannot marry Muslim women but the opposite is valid and this is an issue of dispute and Allah Knows Best"
