  "title": "20 Years in Jail if we get caught not praying the Hanafi way, what to do",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing uh amin from tajikistan i mean from tajikistan yes sir uh  my question is about i live in a country where the uh hanafi must have most people are blindly and blindly followers of uh if you bring them a thousand of hadith and they will reject them in the masjid uh we cannot uh pray according to the sunnah uh because from the government there are police who pray in the masjid with a normal uniform like normal people if you pray according to the sunnah and they will catch you and you you will be in the freezer for 20 years wow my question is should i pray in the masjid according to how they play or first of all i very much doubt that such severe punishment is inflicted upon people who would simply raise their hands put their hands on the chest not below their navel and say i mean after the recitation of because most likely this is the difference that is visible to people and they say oh he's not following the hanafi madhab and to say that they will put you in jail for 20 years for doing that i find it a little bit too hard to accept this but hypothetically speaking you are accountable to allah azzawajal to what you're saying and i'm only answering what you are saying you're asking about if this is the case then raising the hands in record and rising from the raku putting it on the chest and saying i mean are all sunnahs if you deliberately without any legitimate reason if you just skip them you don't want to do them your prayer is valid and it's 100 correct you're missing the reward but there is no haram in abandoning it rather it is mandatory if there is harm going to be inflicted upon you for following the sunnah so therefore pray like they pray while resenting it and hoping to pray like the sunnah when you're alone you"
