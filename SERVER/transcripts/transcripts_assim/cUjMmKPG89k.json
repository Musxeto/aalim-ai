  "transcript": "Laura says I married my husband and changed my last name to his when I was a non-muslim after 13 years of marriage we just came across the hadith about this prohibition a few days ago is this an excusable action since it was done out of ignorance no excusable in the sense that are you sinful for doing it no you're not first of all because you did not know the ruling but now you must rectify this so you have to go and change your passport your ID cards into your original name sometimes this is as easy as going to the park and in some countries it is a nightmare and sometimes it is impossible so if there is true and real hardship and you you have done all what you can to solve this problem and rectify it and failed then there's no sin on you but everyone around you should know that your name is Natalia Rodriguez so it's not Natalia Hahn anymore they call you by your father name and your family name your husband name is not included so they should know this an address you like this officially it's something that is beyond your capability to to change if you are able to do this and will take some time then you should do it just to avoid a being sinful"
