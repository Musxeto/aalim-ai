  "transcript": "so uh I really love animals and I want to keep um exotic species as my pets for example like tarantulas so the question is are there animals that are prohibited to keep as pets what basically keeping pets in Islam is permissible and the Hadith of ANB Malik in theah where he says I had a young sibling who had a bird in a cage and he used to take care of it until the bird died so he was saddened and depressed and the prophet used to come and joyfully ask my younger brother nicknaming him by and asking him about the small bird what did the bird do from this the scholars stemmed that it is permissible to keep pets in the house as long as you provide for them and feed them the exception would be in pets that we not allowed to keep such as mice we're ordered to kill mice in Islam because they're harm harmful and bad snakes scorpions and the likes that are harmful so I've seen people taking pets with snakes anacondas or or a small python I don't know if you can get a small python or not but depends or a tantula I think it's called the tantula it's a a big hairy U um spider that is poisonous or scorpions and the likes some even May pet alligators all of this is Haram and prohibited there are other exotic pets or animals or uh the likes that have no value so basically speaking if you pet a cat this is per ible if you pet a parrot a bird if you have a fish tank and you put exotic nice fish in it there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
