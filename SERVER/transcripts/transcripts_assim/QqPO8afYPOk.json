  "title": "Games require entry fee of virtual currency, Permissible to play or is it gambling? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I play a cricket game on my phone when I play alone I have to give an entry fee of virtual coins to play the match suppose I spent 50 in the game coins and after winning a match I receive a hundred coins is this gambling since I'm playing alone and it's virtual currency I don't like commenting on games simply because it involves a lot of Haram and people are so involved in it if this game is virtual meaning these 50 coins I did not pay anything to actually get them and they require an entry fee which in real life such an entry fee would be gambling and I may lose my 50 coins which will be definitely regenerated in the following game by itself and I may not lose it but rather win a hundred coins if I win the game this is not gambling because actually there is no real loss here gambling like lottery ticket you buy a ticket for a dollar and you may hit the jackpot of a million and you may lose your dollar there is a physical loss of a dollar but here this is virtual I didn't pay anything the 50 coins that I paid to enter this competition will be regenerated once I lose and I will get it again so it seems to me that this is permissible Knows Best"
