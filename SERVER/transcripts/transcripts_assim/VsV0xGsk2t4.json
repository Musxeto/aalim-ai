  "title": "Islamophobia & Freedom of Speech? | Official Lecture in Indonesia 2023 NEW | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "As Mawlana said, I just came from Saudi Arabia, so if I do not speak clearly because I haven't slept for about 20 hours. So listen to what I say and don't pay attention. We are here inshallah for the coffee, for the food. Have a good time and then go. Alhamdulillah. But the good news is Allah will put barakah in this gathering. We come here to get reward from Allah. The angels will bring dhikr to us, sakinah would descend to us, so alhamdulillah we're winners. Yes, sir. Okay. No, no, they can hear me very well. I know, I know my voice is very distinctive. People recognize me from my voice, unfortunately. Yes, alhamdulillah. So, what is the topic? So I get different topics, unfortunately. So Islam in a globalized world, Islam versus Islamophobia, the burning of the Quran. So I wrote something. I don't know if it's something that is beneficial or not, but we will see, inshallah. If it's not, sue me. What can you do? I'm already here. They paid for the ticket. Alhamdulillah. I'll have a good two weeks time inshallah and go back home without a problem. So I will speak about the Islamophobe. Now, when you say phobia, this is the fear of something. So there are people who have phobia from the dark, from closed places, from meeting people. So when we say Islamophobe, what is scaring them? What is making them frightened of Islam? Something they don't like. I can agree with that. I have no problem if people fear something in Islam and they don't like. I have no problem with that. Must everybody like Islam? No. You don't like Islam? No problem. But when you act aggressively, when you attack, this is not Islamaphobe. There is a big difference. So when someone speaks ill about Muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, excuse me, I'm an old man. Some of the brothers here, the youngsters, drink with their left hand. What's the ruling? Halal, haram? Haram. The Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam If you drink, drink with your right. If you eat, eat with your right. If you give, give with your right. If you take, take with your right. Because shaitan eats, drinks, gives, and takes with his left. So, while talking I see people drinking with their left. I cannot stop them and say, Sheikh, please don't. And it's embarrassing. So this is a general reminder. Never raise your hand, the left, to the mouth. It's a sin. And the Prophet saw someone drinking and eating with his left hand. So he said to him, eat with your right hand. The man out of arrogance said, I can't. So the Prophet said, may Allah make you never can. So the man's hand was paralyzed. Very dangerous. I don't know why they're laughing. This is serious. When you become paralyzed, this is serious. The Prophet made dua against you. So never raise your left hand to your mouth. Now I'm wasting time so that one hour is finished. The topic can be easily finished in five minutes, but just to accommodate time. So, when they started to speak ill about the Prophet, alayhis salatu was salam, depicting pictures, Charlie Hebdo in France, in Sweden, in Holland, writing things about the Prophet. This is not Islamophobe. This is hatred. This is aggression. When they started burning the Quran and disrespecting it. And this started in 2005 in Guantanamo Bay. when the American soldiers wanted to torture the Muslim prisoners. And the Muslim prisoners did not do anything. So they did not know what to do. So they started to take the Quran, tear it up, throw it in the toilet. And the Muslims were outraged. This is what they did. And they started to try to disrespect the Quran in Bangladesh, in Afghanistan, in Europe, in Germany. in Sweden, in many many different countries. Then they started to attack the hijab. First they started to attack the niqab of women. Okay, we take the niqab off. They started attacking the hijab, the head covering. No problem, we take it off. they started attacking modesty. So even if a girl goes to the school wearing decent clothes, no, no, you have to wear bikini, go to the swimming pool with other boys. This is serious. They're forcing girls and boys in Sweden, in Norway, in Denmark to have physical education mixed. How can I take my daughter there? How can I take my son? When my son is a teenager and he sees his classmate with him, we say we're Muslims. He said, no, this is not good. So I said, OK, we want homeschooling. No, we will put you in prison and we will take your children and give them to Christian families. This is what they're doing in Sweden, by the way. All immigrants, Syrian, Iraqis, Afghanis who go there, Few months, they take the children. Why? Physical abuse, child abuse, you're not good parents. And they give it to Christian families. And this is democracy? This is Islamophobe. No, it's not Islamophobe. It's hatred against Islam. So, when you look at this continuous attack against Islam, why? What did we do to them? In Indonesia, how many Muslims, mashallah? 300 million? 240? I am not very good in math. So, let's make it an even number. 300 million. 300 million Muslims, mashallah. What did you do to them? Why do they hate you? If we wanted to be aggressive and we wanted to fight and hate them, if we spit on them, they will drown. If you just Muslims, they will drown. The whole country will drown. So many Muslims. So why do they hate Islam? Now, they hate Islam because they are bullies. They came 100 and 150 years ago. They took our lands. They took our wealth. they enslaved us in India, in here, Holland, in all Muslim countries were conquered by these disbelievers. Now we're becoming, alhamdulillah, a strong power. We're becoming independent. They don't want this. They want us to be their slaves. So they are bullying us. Now what? does a bully want? When someone bullies you, what does he want? When your boss at work bullies you. When your husband... I'm talking to the sisters, not to the... the gents. He knows, he knows. No, I'm not talking to you. So, when your husband bullies you, what does he want? When your mother-in-law bullies you, what does she want? Every bully wants a negative reaction from you. He wants you to be depressed, to be sad, to be intimidated. So this is what a bully usually wants. So if we react like they want, they win, we lose. So what to do when some people start bullying us about our religion, we have one or two solutions. Number one, do what they want. So they start to curse the Prophet a.s. What should we do? Yallah, Bismillah, let's go demonstrations. A hundred thousand, five hundred thousand protests, demonstrations, carrying banners, everyone, their political agenda. So banner for this organization. Banner for that organization. And they go, mashallah, hundreds and thousands of people. In the process, we burn some shops. We break cars. We attack the police. The police are Muslims. They're relatives. No, no, no problem. We love the Quran. Allahu Akbar. Takbir. What are you doing? He said, no, no, we are avenging the Qur'an's burning. They're burning it in Sweden, not here. He said, no, no, we have to show them. So what will happen? They will win, we will lose. Look at those who are protesting. MashaAllah. Why are you protesting? Because I love the Qur'an. How much do you memorize from the Qur'an? Nothing. Okay. Do you know sunnah? Do you pray? He said, yes, every Eid. Alhamdulillah. I pray Eid prayer. So when you look at the people, it's their enthusiasm. It's their love to Islam. But this is not Islam. The Prophet did not tell you, Alayhis Salaam, do this. So this is reaction number one. When somebody bullies you, you do this. Now, some Muslims, reaction number two, they don't do anything. Why? The vast majority of Muslims don't care. Why? Because it doesn't concern them. Akhi, they're burning the Quran. So, this is the word of Allah. Okay. So what are you gonna do? I don't know. Why? Because they don't know the Qur'an. They have no connection with the Qur'an. And the vast majority of Muslims today, if I say, Which surah is this ayah in? See, little, little people are laughing. The vast majority are saying, Google search, yes, Siri. What ayah is this? This is not an ayah, this is a hadith. Ha, ha, ha, good, good. Shaykh, wallah, you're very funny. I wasn't joking. This is a hadith. And the sad thing is, 99% people don't know. and this is the most famous hadith in islam the most famous hadith in islam imam shafi says islam revolves on three hadith one of them hadith omar the second one hadith aisha the third one etc so this is a hadith but the vast majority Don't know. So if I tell them this is an ayah, they don't know the difference between ayah and hadith. Are you Muslim? Where? Show me. So this is reaction two. Reaction one, let's burn property, let's break cars, let's attack the police. Reaction number two, nothing. So what is it that we're supposed to do? Now, Islam is a civilized religion. Because if they burn the Quran, we bring the Bible and burn it. Have you seen any Muslim burn the Bible? Subhanallah. Why? Because we're civilized. We're Muslims. We agree that this Bible is not the correct Torah and the correct Injeel. It has been altered. It has been changed. But we do not insult your religion. I don't agree with your religion. But I don't insult your religion. Why? Because Allah told me not to do so in the Quran. Allah says, This is ayah by the way. This is Quran. What does it translate to? Allah says, and do not insult those they invoke other than Allah. The idols they worship, don't insult it. It's idols, shirk, kufr. Allah says, don't insult their idols. Why? Lest they insult Allah in enmity without knowledge. When you insult, My idols, I will insult what you worship, which is Allah. No, stop, don't. So Islam is a very, very high civilized religion, not like them. They don't believe in religion. They don't believe in Christianity. They don't believe in anything. They believe in their corrupt ideology. So how and what is the best way to deal with such, I wouldn't say Islamophobes, I would say how to deal with such aggression, hatred, and enmity against Islam. We have to turn the table on their heads. And this is what I tell people that bully you. When people bully you, you should turn the table on their heads. How? By not reacting as they anticipate. Sometimes, I communicate with people of ignorance, and they don't like my approach. They don't like the way I speak, like a lot of Muslims. Alhamdulillah. They don't like what Sheikh Asim says because he's very aggressive. He puts it in your face. He doesn't, you know, he's not diplomatic. He's not soft. He puts it in your face and leaves. I don't care. So they don't like what I say. So after arguing with them, some of them may become a little bit aggressive. And he said, Wallahi Sheikh, you don't make any sense. You're an ass. I said, yes, this is my nickname. Ass I am. So my students come and say, Sheikh, they're insulting you. No, no, this is my nickname. This is how my name is spelled. A-S-S-I-M. This is my name. So they said, no, no, no, no, Sheikh, they are insulting you. I said, listen, when someone comes to me and says, hey, ass, am I going to grow two ears and a tail? Do I care what people say about me? No. I know myself. When you say, oh, Sheikh, you are the best Sheikh. Am I going to, you know, become like a balloon? And when you come to me and say, Shaykh, you're the worst Shaykh, am I going to be sad and start crying and weeping? I know myself. I don't need you to evaluate me. Likewise, when they attack Islam, when they are aggressive against the Qur'an or the Prophet ﷺ, I will not go to their level and do what they want me to do. I will react positively. Someone comes to you and says, you're like this, you're this, you did that. Don't defend yourself because he will continue to argue with you. Don't go into debates. Just give a big smile and take your mobile and check your WhatsApp messages. Let him speak, speak, speak, speak, speak. After one hour, he will look around. He will feel ashamed. Because you're not reacting. So any bully that comes to you and says, look at you. Your dress is not nice. Look at you, Sheikh. You're wearing a dress like women. And you're wearing hijab. A big smile. Okay. Then what? Nothing. I'm not going to answer you. So this is number one. We have to ignore them. We have to not give them any attention. Rather, We have to be proactive. How? Number one, they insult the Qur'an. What should we do? Glorify the Qur'an. How to glorify the Qur'an? Okay, you're insulting the Qur'an in Sweden. Today, inshallah, every day I will study the Qur'an for one hour. I will read the Qur'an. I will memorize one page. I will learn the tafsir. And next week, I will come with five, six brothers, and we will meet in the masjid. in Tanweer Masjid. Okay, they will come here. I'm bullying Abuna Anwar Abbas, that's why he's checking his WhatsApp message. So, we come to the masjid, we study the Qur'an, and we start sending SMS and WhatsApp messages about this beautiful ayah. We spread the beauty of the Qur'an, and we memorize it, and we spread it between the people. One of the most beautiful reactions I have seen in the world for this burning of the Qur'an, what Kuwait did. Beautiful! Kuwait is a very tiny, Suburb of Jakarta. All Kuwaitis, maybe 200,000. So, what did they do? They printed 100,000 copies of the Quran in Swedish. And they will go and give it to the Swedes. So you burn it? No problem. We will distribute it to 100,000. Now, some of the Swedish people, they say, what is the Quran? I don't know. Google it. I don't know what the Quran. When they get a copy, let me read. And maybe Allah will guide them to Islam. So see, this is proactive. This is positive thinking. Also, if you look at the Western world, America, Europe, Canada, they all collaborate they are good strong friends when it comes to attacking islam this is in the quran this is an ayah and never will the jews and the christians approve of you until you follow their religion so they will never be happy with you and I until we follow the religion. Take off your hijab. I took it off. Shave your beard. This is for the men. I shaved it. Okay, now eat pork. I don't like pork. No, you have to. Drink wine. Do this, do that. So you end up leaving your religion. Only when you leave your religion, they give you asylum, they give you residency, they accept you. But if you're abiding by your religion, they will never be happy with you. And this shows you how hypocrites they are. Every nation, they say, we are having freedom of speech. We have democracy. Our people are independent. We have no control over them. Now, who approved this attack against the Qur'an? The courts. They went to the court and they said, we would like to have permission to burn the Qur'an in front of the large masjid, of the big masjid, on the day of Eid. Look at the timing, and look at the permission. The court looked into it, said, Quran? Okay, no problem. Bismillah. This is me, Bismillah. They approved it. So why would you approve such a thing? Oh, Sheikh, because we have freedom of speech. We're not like you. You have freedom of speech, huh? Last week, the Muslim countries in the United Nations gave a resolution to make attacking and insulting religious figures like Qur'an, the Prophet Muhammad, to be a crime. The majority approved. Who disagreed? Belgium, Finland, France, as usual, Germany, Luxembourg, Britain, and America. Subhanallah. These are our favorite countries. I like Hollywood. I like Taylor Swift. Why are they doing this to me? I love these people. Ah, because they say we have freedom of speech. Okay. You have freedom of speech? I agree. This is your right. Can I speak about Holocaust? The burning of the Jews at the time of Hitler. Can I say 6 million? I think this is a little bit too much. Maybe 6,000. If I say this, immediately they will put me in jail. I will not be able to do anything. It's a crime all over America and Europe. Why? No freedom of speech here. Okay. Can I speak about LGBTQ plus 1, 2, 3, 4? We don't have any alphabet. Alphabets are all gone. They took it. So can I speak? He said, no, this is hatred, Shaykh. I didn't hate anything. I'm just saying that this is against Islam. He said, no. This is why we will ban you in UK. We will ban you in Australia. We will ban you in New Zealand. We will ban you in America. We will ban you in Europe. What did I say? I just said it is prohibited in Islam and in Christianity and in Judaism. This is what's in the book. I didn't say kill. I didn't say throw. Don't fall. I didn't say throw anything from a building or stone. No, no, nothing. I just said that this is a mental illness. No, this is. What is freedom of speech? So why is freedom of speech only limited to attacking Islam and the Muslims and the likes? Therefore, When we look at their independence, the people are independent. We have no control of them. Yes, in Arabia, you control the people. In the Middle East, you control the people. But in the Western world, no, no, they are free to say whatever they want to do. Okay. In this case, we have to speak to them in their own language. What is their own language? We will not attack. We will not kill. We will not burn, we will not break, we will not destroy anything. What is the language they understand? Who elected the officials? The people. Who elected the judges? The people. The people, what do you say about burning the Quran? Freedom of speech. Okay, Alhamdulillah, you agree. In this case, I will speak to you with the language you understand. 240 million, let's assume. Muslims in Indonesia boycott Swedish products. Don't buy anything Swedish. Oh, no, this is crime. Why are you doing this? You are hurting our economy. Freedom of speech. I'm just telling the people, don't buy Volvo. I don't know, Volvo is a Swedish? Not anymore. I think Tata owns it. It's Indian. Ikea. Oh, Ikea. I don't want to get into politics, maybe the owner of Ikea here. Generally speaking, if we boycott these countries that are insulting our religion, Alhamdulillah, we have many other alternatives, substitutes. Why insist on buying this? If we do this, they will feel the burn. They will feel the pain. And we will honor our religion. And also, We have to support the aqeedah of al-wala wal-baraa. This is an essential part of our religion. What is al-wala wal-baraa? Al-wala is loyalty. So he's my Muslim brother, I'm loyal to him. But he's from a different country. And he doesn't speak Arabic. No problem. He's Muslim. He's my brother. And this one, he's Christian, but he's an Arab. and he's neighbor to me. No, he's not my brother. My brotherhood with you is ash-hadu an la ilaha illallah wa ash-hadu an muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh and our allegiance to the Quran, to Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu wasalam. This is our brotherhood. So we have to revive this loyalty and to also disavow those who do not relate to our aqeedah and show them that we have This brotherhood in Islam, Allah Azzawajal says in the Qur'an, there has already been for you an excellent pattern in Ibrahim Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam and those with him. When they said to their people, indeed. Now their people is what? It's mushrik, kuffar. So they said to their own people, Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you worship other than Allah. We have denied you and there has appeared between us and you animosity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone. This is what we have to have in our religion. You're a Muslim, you are my dear brother. I don't like you. But you're my brother. I will support you. I will help you. I will stand next to you in Salah, toe to toe, shoulder to shoulder. And we will eat from the same food. I will help you. But if you are not a Muslim, or if you are a openly sinner, I cannot have this friendship and closeness with you. Among the ways, and the best ways, to counter this aggression against islam is to give dawah and muhammadiyah gives dawah this is the role of muhammadiyah is to give how to give dawah sheikh i'm not a good speaker or a loud speaker i'm not very good in giving speech I'm not very good in writing articles. How to give da'wah? Akhi, who said da'wah is only giving khutbah? Da'wah is being a Muslim. That's all. If you do not lie, if you do not cheat, if you do not say bad words, everybody recognizes you as a good Muslim. This is Islam. This is the best da'wah. When you come on time, 9 o'clock, and you leave on time, 5 o'clock. But when you come 10.30, and you spend half an hour eating breakfast, and one hour before Adhan Zuhur, you go make wudu, and mashallah, go to the masjid, pray 10 or 15 or 20 rakaat. and then pray Zuhur and then pray another 500 Raka'a and you go to the office at 3.30 then have lunch and read the newspaper and leave 4.30 telling your friend to sign on your behalf. What is this? You're not a real Muslim. So to be a real Muslim and to give A good da'wah is what Allah says in the Qur'an. And who is better in speech than one who invites to Allah and does righteousness and says, indeed I am of the Muslims. This is the best form of da'wah. If people see me In Siberia, in Alaska, in Europe, in Saudi, I'm the same. Maybe I will be wearing jeans and t-shirts, but I'll be the same. I will not change. The clothes don't make a difference. My behavior, my attitude, my smile. I don't smile a lot, but... Drink with your right hand and not your left hand. So we do our level best to give da'wa all the time, because I'm a proud Muslim. And I'd like everyone to become as proud as I am. Finally. Good? Good. Okay. Finally, don't fear for the Qur'an. Because Allah Azzawajal says, Indeed it is we who sent down the message, that is the Qur'an, and indeed we will be its guardian. It's protected by Allah. Imagine, this is the beauty of the Qur'an. If we bring all copies of the Qur'an in the world, and we burn it today. All. Not a single copy is kept. Tomorrow, we will write an exact copy of the Qur'an in no time. Why? Because we have at least 100 million hafidh knowing the Qur'an by heart. Every single letter in my masjid, I pray, lead the prayer, and I make a mistake in one ayah. Nine-year-old child behind me corrects me. After I finish the salah, I hold him from his neck? Do I? No! I say, mashallah, tabarakallah, I rub on his head and I say, may Allah make you imam of the muslimin in haram. And I congratulate because he is preserving the Qur'an. So don't be more Roman than the Romans. In the sense that the Qur'an, they burn it, I am sad, but I will not react like they want me to do. When we have an old copy of the Qur'an in the house, torn or maybe some soup or some soft drink was spilled on it, what do we do with it? To protect it, what do we do with it? We burn it. We burn the Qur'an because we want to preserve it. We burn the Qur'an to honor it, not to humiliate it. So, they do it to humiliate it, but we do it to honor it. So, at the end of the day, Allah will preserve and protect his religion, his book, and the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. Thank you, Sheikh Hashim. Actually, you still have more time."
