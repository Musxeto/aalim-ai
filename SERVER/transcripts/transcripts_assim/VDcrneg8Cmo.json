  "title": "Father abandoned me & never cared if I lived or died, can I text instead of call him to stay intouch",
  "transcript": "Ibrahim from Guinea Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I have a question about my relationship with my father actually. Just to give some context, my father kind of abandoned us since we were children. Basically it's my mother who took care of everything. Basically, just to give an example, recently I was in Turkey, I was studying there. You know that there was an earthquake there and a lot of people died. He didn't even message me to know if I was all right. Basically, I don't know even if he checked if I was alive. Though, well, since I'm a servant of Allah, I don't want to anger Allah from time to time. I text him Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu and so on. I want to know because basically we don't go far. I want to know if I can limit myself to messages or is it obligatory on me to actually call him? Okay, first of all, he's your father. Which means that you are obliged to do his rights as prescribed in the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Being dutiful, being respectful, being obedient. And if he needs financial assistance and you have what's extra, you have to help him. Now, if he does not reciprocate, if he does not give you your rights, or he had not given you any of your rights since childbirth, and he neglected you and your siblings and he was an awful person and he was evil, Allah will hold him accountable on the Day of Judgment and maybe throw him in hell. This is in Allah's hands. This does not justify you not giving him his rights. Because if you do and you fail in giving him his rights, Allah will hold you also accountable on the Day of Judgment and throw you in hell. It's not a justification to say that he didn't take care of us when we were young. No, he will be held accountable for that. This does not make you exempted from not doing his rights and Allah knows best."
