narrated by jab Sam may Allah be pleased with him I prayed with the prophet sallallah wasam the two reads not only once or twice without Anan or an okay the tws Muhammad we have two eids in Islam yes what are they is when Abu Malik right after Ramadan right after Ramadan the beginning of the month of sha the fasting month we fast the whole month and then we have the festival the which is and brother mustaf is Al and when is it uh it's on the 10th day of H the 10th day of the month of the uh now jabber may Allah be pleased with him said that I have prayed with the prophet Alam the eats the prayer of eids not once nor twice a lot of times and he never called for the aan for the eids so this reiterates what we've mentioned before that thean is only for what fat excuse me I'll excuse you read the aan is only for what oh only for the five obligat prayers so anything else we don't perform aan now one would argue and say okay we hear in some mosques they say something they say two sentence what do they say say usually Mustafa in mosques in they would say which means that prayer calls all you all have to come to the congregation so is this permissible or not it's some issue of dispute among Scholars first because it's not an aan so those who say it's okay as a form of notification those who say no it's not okay because the prophet didn't do itam so the most authentic thing is not to call for it during the Eid then what would we do everybody knows where to pray and every knows everybody knows what the time is would be for the prayer so they would gather without anybody telling them to come and once the Imam is there he would say look around you try to form a good line uh uh make the rose uh uh in order and then he would start the prayer so there's no need to notify them or to call for the prayer now there's a another issue which is done in Al Haram in the Holy Mosque of Mecca and Medina and that is when they pray on the funeral when a person dies and they bring his body to be prayed on and for the Muslims to make their supplication to this dead P person that Allah May forgive his sins now inam also it's not the Sunnah to call for prayer by saying or this is not a Sunnah to call people notify them that come to pray but Scholars say it's okay to do it in meca or medina why do you think F uh first of all because the for each H for each good deed in Mecca is 100,000 times more and 1,000 times in Medina you didn't get my my my question my question was why do Scholars say it's okay to call for the prayer of funeral by saying because the the benefits of it if they come pray and because to get a lot of people there it wasn't on the time of the of the Prophet Mustafa because that they can notify as many people as possible okay I was going to say that to let people know actually the holy Mosque of Mecca and Medina are so big that if the Imam starts the Salah without notifying them lots of people will not be able to pray because they were not notified in especially in Mecca it is so huge and big it's it's far stretched that is why the uh the people must be notified that this is we we're doing this as form of uh uh praying on the funeral so that they would not mix it up with obligatory prayer they would not mix it up with the eclipse prayer of eclipse or so on they have to be notified and they Scholars say it is okay in this uh uh particular category soid there are no uh aan for Eid as narrated by may Allah be pleased with him the following Hadith Hadith number 150 narrated by Abu in a long had about their sleeping late past the time of Salat then B proclaimed the Adan and the prophet Sall wasallam offered the prayer while leading the campions as he used to do every day while leading the companions while leading the companions companions as he used to do every day now this Hadith has a very long version as mentioned and the story or the origin of this Hadith comes from uh and it's reported by Imam Muslim abuat tells us that the companions of the Prophet Alam were on a long journey and remember that traveling is not a fun thing to do it it's difficult it's hard and there is a Hadith where the Prophet says Alam that traveling is a piece of torture those who travel are being tortured maybe nowadays people think it's fun no it's not it's tiring it's a time consuming and it makes your life mixed up so in that and and now we travel by planes and and and cars at the time of the messenger of Allah sallallahu alai wasallam they didn't have cars they didn't have buses trains airplanes they didn't have anything except their feet and maybe if they were lucky they had camels to ride on so in one Journey abuat tells us that they put their Saddles down for camping and they were beat they were really really tired and the custom was that one should stay awake to guard the camp and also to notify the companions to notify the prophet of Salat time of f time so B volunteered and said oh prophet of Allah I'll be the one to guard the camp and I'll uh um wake you all up for f prayer so the prophet told him take care B don't we don't have any alarm uh clocks or watches so you'll be our uh uh alarm clock so he said okay and they all went to sleep bil was awake and as the night went by he felt a little bit tired of standing so he just sat down and leaned back a little bit on the camel and bang he was history he woke up when the sun was in the sky and the prophet s wasallam woke up and the companion woke up the the heat of the sun woke them up and the prophet looked at B and said bil what's wrong what happened so B said oh prophet of Allah by God the thing that made you sleep made me sleep and and this is something that you don't have any control of and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam uh uh went and changed their position they moved on a bit and they prayed uh uh the fer as they do every day and this is making up for fer they're making up for f uh F did the prophet sleep Alam I suppose yeah now didn't we mention a while ago oh yes I remember what he he's he he sleeps but his heart is awake okay and that is why mother AA may Allah be pleased with her with her you know objected to the prophet Alam when she saw him sleep and he started to snore and after he woke up he went to prayer without performing ation she was so she asked him and you slept how do you do this so he told her that my heart sleeps my my eyes sleep but my heart does not sleep which means that he was aware of himself okay now why did this happen then if his heart does not sleep how did this happen to him do we have any answer to that F so so could be a ruling in the so it's going to be permissible in the future if someone sleeps then as an excuse he can commit the prayer he missed you agree with this does this sound logical it does sound logical to me now the prophet's heart does not sleep in the sense that he's aware of himself except in that in incident Allah deliberately made him sleep so that we know the ruling what we should do if somebody sleeps over fuder prayer and wakes up when the the sun has come up what to do and what did the prophet Alam do one makeup no he did not make up first he moved as in some hadiths tell us he moved from the same place that he was in why there was an explanation do you have do you know the explanation Malik yes because the scholar say that a place that anything that you is uh how expain that's against the religion anything that's near sins or what or what not or place that has been committed in it Bad Deeds that the Devils start joining up in that area so The Scholar say never stay in the place that a bad deed was committed in although this was not Comm considered as a bad deed but it was it's a different it's a different story what you're saying is correct when it comes to sins so that it does not remind you of the sin again in this case the prophet s wasallam declared it to us that this is a place where Shan was present and that that is why we overslept so he asked them to move away and and this gives us an idea that if you are sleeping and you skip F prayer because you overslept then when you make up for the prayer don't make it in your room go to the living room go to some other room so that you won't please shatan and you would follow this Sunnah so the thing first thing that the prophet didam was to move and then he prayed as they pray every day a question what should we do in if we were in the same position should we pray Sunnah or should we start immediately with the F with the obligatory prayer answer Mustafa well don't don't answer I'll ask you the question again just after the break so stay tuned back to the prophet join shikh ahar in the program back to the prophet wherein he teaches us practical lessons from the prophet's life and how this can help us to overcome our challenges in the present we talk about the life example of the Prophet Muhammad peace and blessings be upon Him seeking guidance for ourselves in the early days after the revelation of the Holy Quran the Muslims were greatly persecuted so much so that quite a few Muslims had to leave Arabia and migrate to Africa to live among Christian people who follow the gospel of christum and welcome back just before the break we had a question uh to brother Mustafa go ahead I think you should pray the for first and then pray the is okay what do you guys think what should we do Malik I think you should only pray the fart we should only pray the fart um we all agree on this F I think we should pray the the F first and then just the sunah but not as just doing it also so it's the same thing Mustafa yeah has the priority and if you usually pray Sunnah then I think you should pray the as as well after or before after okay Muhammad yes I beg to differ see the Sunnah always comes before and now the sun has already risen so what prevents you from following the same sequence of praying than praying F nothing prevents you from doing this providing that you did not do you did not sin you didn't do anything wrong you slept and sleeping Allah will not punish us on sleeping because the three things that uh uh people are not accounted for as the prophet says that how many three what are they f in in Arabic in English that is I was going to translate the the person who's asleep until he wakes up so whoever is asleep until he wakes up whatever he does during the Sleep he's not accounted for because he Allah only uh question us on the things that we do in our sound Minds okay the second thing must okay sleep until he wakes up someone who's was angry no muhamad M till he recovers mad person until he recover a person who is insane until he becomes sane Malik the child until he h comes to puberty uh the child until he reaches the age of puberty before that he is not being uh uh questioned for whatever actions he does Allah will not hold him responsible for these actions so uh if a person sleeps Allah will not hold him responsible for what he has slept over or skipped the prayer because this is not something with uh within your control except with a big underlining under except if you intentionally skip Salah while sleeping by not taking the measures and means necessary to wake up such as setting your alarm clock if you deliberately say well fud is at 4:00 and I'm not going to set the alarm uh except until 7:30 because then I have to go to work or I have to go to school then you are sinful and you will be punished for that also Allah will not punish you or question you for the times that you have slept but he will question you on the times that you were awake as in the Hadith that Allah there is no there's no nothing wrong in sleeping the wrong thing is in waking up what have you done while you were awake so if a person sleeps like 10:00 a.m. that is 10 p.m. or 11 p.m. he goes to bed and fails to wake up for f prayer though he had set the alarm clock he couldn't he failed to wake up will he be sinful no he will not Allah will not hold him accountable for that but if a person goes to bed at 4 a.m. and sets 10 alarm clocks and the time for prayer is is 4:30 and he fails to wake up he is sinful because he spent his time doing something that is not recommendable what would a person do staying awake until 4:00 a.m. one would say pray tud others say read and and study knowledge Quran and Sunnah is this permissible is this legitimate reason to skip fer prayer the answer would be no because if you want to get closer to Allah Asel the only or and the best way to get closer to Allah by doing the obligatory thing not by doing the recommended or preferable things only the recommend the the the obligatory things which you are requested four so I think that brother Muhammad will read the uh Hadith again for us in a long Hadith about their sleeping late late past the time of Salat the Bal proclaimed the Adan and the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam offered the prayer while leading the the companions as he used to do every day okay one one other question is that in this Hadith we learn that even if the time of the prayer has passed though we did not call for the prayer it is Sunnah to make the aan is that right F uh even if we miss the prayer we perform aan yes no we don't why not because aan is supposed to be at certain certain time at a certain place not like can you read the Hadith from the very beginning please narrated by Abu may Allah him in a long Hadith about their meaning the sahabah sleeping late past the time of Salat prayer the B proclaimed thean and the prophet offered the prayer while leading the companions as he used to every day what do you understand from proclaim the aan oh that he did do it so this means that it is the sunah now uh I I don't see your hand is this your hand Mustafa yes please but this is perhaps because they all missed the prayer and they were going to pray in congregation but suppose I missed it while I'm at home and staying alone do I have to do anything event what do you think Mustafa I don't know Abu Malik well I assume that meaning that then here that they did because sometimes they mention and they mean by and what about his question mustafa's question if you miss prayer home what do you do now it's a different story Mustafa because they were traveling and if you recall what is the verdict on making aan it is which means that if some do it then the whole Community is in the safe but if they all don't do it they're all sinful so if you are in a city and you skip F prayer and you wake up you don't have to make aan and you don't have to make because other mosques have done it so the burden is has been lifted in the case of bal's and ab's Hadith they had to make aan because they were all in the wilderness and they had to call for to make the call for prayer now and to make the so that it would be announced among all now if you're in a city and is recommendable it's not obligatory because other mosques have done it when you are in the wilderness it becomes obligatory because then you have to announce the aan as B has done uh we go back to Muhammad to finish the other uh versions Muslim also reported from ja the prophet sallallah alaih wasallam came to alif and offered at it both in the in the m and is prayers with one aan and two Muslim also reported from the prophet sallallah alaih wasallam combined the m and is prayer with one Abu da added the words for each prayers and in another narration he reported thean was not announ for any one of them okay now the Hadith of jabber he tells us about how the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam prayed M and is inif with onean and two now uh has anybody of you performed Hajj before okay only Mustafa you guys have a problem you have to perform Haj if you can afford it because this is not a thing that one delays you should as soon as possible perform Hajj it's it's one of the pillars of Islam so I don't have to you know emphasize on this point that you should do it that's it you should do it period now mif when do Muslims go to mifa on Haj which day okay do you know the sequence of Hajj well that's a silly question are we studying Hajj no we're studying prayer so uh just to give you a a reminder maybe this makes you feel a little bit uh interested in going for Hajj on the day of people go from Mina this is the ninth day of Haj to they spend the whole day there they pray and at once on the time of and they stay supplicating worshiping Allah until the sun sets usually when the Sun sets what do we do PR pray this is the logic thing except on the day of we do not pray we go from to which is about uh uh 30 to 45 minutes walking distance and we stay there until the sun the the break of dawn now once we reach M we pray and together this is called jam and and and we call uh uh it m Jam we make and pray it at the time of the Prophet did thisat but he did this with one aan because you're notifying the same people so it's one aan and he made twoam the first for what prayer F and the second prayer was and they did it there sallallahu alai wasallam when he reached mifa now is it okay if a person prays it in a uh is it okay if if you pray and in first no the sunah is to wait until you reach mifa and this is what the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam uh did the second uh addition he said here that the prophet did not make any aan and the scholars say that that there is a dispute among them in this particular version because the aan is essential when no one else has called for the aan but if there are people that call for thean this suffice and you don't have to make the aan again we come to what we have learned in today's program one if you skip a prayer try to change the room you're in if you skip because of sleep because Satan was there so change the room try to pray the the first then pray the obligatory prayer and if no one called for the aan call for thean your yourself uh I am afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time a oh"
