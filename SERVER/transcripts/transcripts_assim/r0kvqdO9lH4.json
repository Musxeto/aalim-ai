  "title": "Using miswak increases reward 70,000 times? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "actor or Akbar asks is it sooner to do miswak before you do does it increase the reward by 70 times doing miswak before would oh this is a miswak it's a tooth brush that all Muslims almost use before going to prayer and dentists I think they don't like it because it is bad for business it's very good for your teeth for your gum for your hygiene for everything but regardless of all the benefits coming from it it is sufficient for us as Muslims to know that the Prophet RS of Salaam had highly recommended it and he said alayhi salat WA Salam had I not feared that I would burden my Ummah my nation my followers I would have ordered them to perform or to use the Seebeck whenever they wanted to pray so the only reason that the Prophet did not give us such a clear cut instruction and order was that he would not burden us so is what Appa is saying true that there is 70 times more reward with the miswak the answer is no this is fabricated it is not true but this does not mean that using the miswak has no great reward we're ordered in hadith authentic to perform miswak when performing wudu ablution and we are ordered to use miswak when we want to pray so with the ablution and then with or before just before the prayer and before entering the home once you wake up at night so there are many places you can use this and the Prophet used to use it so many times beyond beyond count the companion is said that I saw the Prophet as I am using them back even while fasting countless of times and therefore we don't need fabricated hadith to state that it is 70 times reward double more than the prayer without him swag etcetera all of these are not authentic"
