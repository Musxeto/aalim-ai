  "transcript": "splatter of manova him at hamdulillahi rabbil aalameen why shadow la ilaha illallah wahdahu la sharika lah a shadow and muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh samehada he was early he was happy he ajma'in a man dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to this new episode of women around the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam today we will attempt to talk about two great women one is the last of his wives and the other is the first of his daughters so may muna Bentall hadith even her husband the mother of the believer and the wife of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam her mother is hint bint house and it was known among the arabs that she that is Hindman house was among the most honorable in-laws a woman could have she had nine daughters from different husbands which is by itself normal in arabia a woman can be widowed divorced and continued to marry and to live a life unlike what we think of women today if a woman is divorced then she's expired if a woman is a widow nobody looks at her eye which is totally against Islamic values and against logic women can marry and Mary and Mary without any problem this is the cycle of life Hindman have had nine daughters among those who married her daughters were two uncles of the prophet alayhi salatu salam ala bass and hamza hamza marrying Salma been too amazed al-abbas marrying lou baba al-kubra the grand new baba why were there a minor lou baba yes there was lou Babis Oradell two sisters labelled kübra was married to alabaster the uncle of the Prophet as Salam she was also known by all muddled and Luba basura was married to Al Waleed of numenera one of the first enemies of Islam who was killed and died as a kafir but his son was the sword of allah azzawajal harlot Abner will eat so the prophetess son was married to Hal its aunt and also two of the prophets cousins were married to her daughter's so Jaffa and ABI talib and I leave nabi Talib they both married as map into a mace Jaffer was martyred in the Battle of Mota then afterwards she got married to Abu Bakr Siddiq and after Abu Bakr died I didna batali married her and the prophet alayhi salatu salam himself married to of hand bent house daughters the first one we talked about was the mother of the believers they have been to Hosea may Allah be pleased with her and then he married my Munna built al-harith may Allah be with her the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam the believing sisters are maemunah the wife of the Prophet her sister of Malph adult mental health and her sister Salma been tell her if the wife of Hamza and this man been to amaze their sister from their mother's side so if I made them a second earlier saying that Salma been to amaze well this hadith indicates that she was Selma bent al-harith despite some of the books of history that calls her Salma been to amaze as well now when the Prophet married my Munna Ali his salat wa salam he married her about three years and a half before his death and he married her because of the advice of his uncle al abbas who told him to marry his wife's younger sister she was married first then she married another man and he died when she became a widow al abbas advised the Prophet herself to marry her and the Prophet took this advice and married my Munna her name was Birla and again he changed her name into maemunah because bara is self praising by saying my name is righteous pious person so he changed it into my Munna which means blessed and by marrying her her tribe came into Islam [Music] in groups because now the Prophet is Mary Dallas awesome to one of their people and they came Benny Hill Al came into Islam and supported Islam greatly my mother may Allah be pleased with her was married to the Prophet Allah saw some in surf and she died 40-plus years later in the same spot she married the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam and was buried there and she was 80 years of age that was in the 51st year of hijra so after 40 years of the death of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam lived with the Prophet only for three years and a half yet gained the honour of this life and the hereafter by being the mother of the believers that no one would ever mention her name without saying may allah azzawajal be pleased with her and she's also the wife of a prophet alehissallaam engine Rodie Allah and ha ha and now we move to the first daughter of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam a woman known for her wisdom known for her excellent lineage no one can surpass her when it comes to honor and lineage she's the daughter of Muhammad ibn Abdullah sallallahu alaihi wa sallam the prophet and messenger of allah azzawajal her mother is Hadiya Ben - who a lit the one we know a lot about she was the eldest of the prophets four daughters may Allah be pleased with them all and she was the first one among them to get married she was born ten years before the revelation came to the Prophet Allah saw - Salam which means that she was about ten years old when the Prophet a son became a prophet and a messenger now having said that when she was at the age of 10 all the dignitaries of Quraysh set eyes on her to be a potential wife to one of them and the luckiest who would win it who would win her heart at the age of 10 it was her cousin a bellossom near a beer he's the son of Hal have been to Hawaii it the sister of Khadijah mother of the believers may Allah be pleased with them and he won her heart proposed and the Prophet gave his daughter Zeynep to him in marriage she was 10 years of age and she gave her husband Ali and oh mama now everybody knows only the grandsons of the Prophet I assumed to be Al Hasan and Husayn the sons of Ali and Fatima not knowing that there were others so idea and oh mama where the children of Zeynep and a bilasa already died when he was young in the hadith where the Prophet carried his grandson as he was dying in the start started to weep sallallahu alaihi wa sallam and the Companions told him how is this possible you are weeping and the Prophet said to them that this is mercy from allah azza wajal this is I li the one who died in the hands of the Prophet alehissallaam as for oh mama she grew and later on was married to Ali bin Abi Talib on the advice and instruction of his late wife fatima who was her aunt but she told him if I die marry oh mama now Zeynep was among the first to accept Islam with her mother and other sisters and when the Prophet migrated to Medina sallallaahu are you are you seldom she stayed with her husband I will ask and uh Balazs was a very decent man though he was not a Muslim at the time the way zeyneb treated him he fell in love from head to toe and he could not think of leaving her because what was the school Zegna were taught in Xena were taught in the school of Muhammad alayhi salatu salam and Khadija the toilet what do you expect their offspring to be so she was loyal to him faithful kind loving caring when she accepted Islam and I will ask remained on the religion of Quraysh the people of Koresh came to him and said to him yet you are among the most trusted men to us we deposit our wealth and money and we entrust you with our trade so we are the dignitaries of Mecca and we are requesting that you divorce Muhammad's daughter and choose any woman from Quraysh and we will give her to you an offer people may usually not be able to refuse but not about us he said no by Allah where would I find a wife like Zeynep I would never do such a thing and I would never depart or leave or separate my beloved wife so they left him on the second year of hijra the Battle of Badr took place and I will ask was with the army of the disbelievers but he did not fight he just accompanied his people without fighting without participation and this is why he was taking as a prisoner of war when the Prophet as some ask for ransom we know the story where Zainab sent her brother-in-law with money and with the necklace that mother Hadiya gave it to her on her wedding night to hablas the Prophet SAW this felt soft and he asked the people if they were to let her prisoner go and return his ransom then this is kind of them and they immediately comply then they sent him away back to Mecca the Prophet then asked him a lease awesome to send his wife there is his daughter the prophets daughter Zeynep to Medina and I will ask agreed when he went to Medina he told his beloved wife filled with sorrow that your father wants you beside him so he sent her with his brother Cain Anna even Revere now when Cain Anna took Zena to take her to Medina two of the people of Quraysh Jabara analyst wet and NAFA Eve know I'm army these two people at the time were so evil that they started attacking the camel that was carrying Zeynep with their Spears and you know what happens to a big animal when being poked with a spear it started jumping and moving violently Xena was pregnant at the time such violent moves made her miscarriage and she bled and she was taken back to Quraysh left with the family of Banu umeå to specific with hand winter atiba the wife of Abu sofyan and the prophet alayhi salatu salam heard of this he sent one of his companions to extract her and bring her to medina which he did the prophet elisha was so angry with these two men huh Barton as would whenever Abdullah more to the extent that when it was the conquest of Mecca before that he used to send expeditions and tell them if you meet these two men burn them alive for what they had done to my daughter zina and then the revelation comes from allah azza wajal correcting the Prophet Isis Salam and telling him that it is not permissible to burn a living creature and torturing it with fire because this is only to Allah so the Prophet corrected his command and said do not burn them rather kill them and then herb are later on accepted Islam and came to the Prophet al-islam in migration and showing his repentance what would you do if someone attacks your daughter causes her to miscarriage the man I wouldn't say with the golden heart because even this would not suffice to describe his heart so lala haria Selim the moment the man accepted Islam the Prophet forgave him as if nothing had had been done and it shows you that the heart of the Prophet SM was filled with forgiveness with love with compassion forgiving such a person after what he had done now in the second year of hijra and better Battle of Badr I will ask was captured for the first time four years later on the sixth year of hijra was captured again this time he was in a caravan going to trade with Syria when he and his wealth they were abducted by the soldiers of Allah when he came to Medina he managed to seek refuge in his ex-wife because they were separated for four years due to difference of religion and she heard that zina and after fajar prayer she announced in the Masjid my name is Zainab the daughter of Muhammad and I give refuge to a bellossom near a beer so the Prophet asaram was shocked and he said to the people by Allah this is the first time I know of this I have no knowledge of it at all so if you see it fit to send him with what he came with that's up to you as for seeking refuge the minimum of the Muslims can give protection and refuge to anyone so it was a first where a woman comes and gives protection to a non-muslim and Muslims all abide by this pledge of protection given by a woman so the Prophet SM gave him his trade and and money nothing was missing and he dispatched him to maqam once he reached Mecca he gave everybody their money and their wealth and the trade and he took all that was deposited with him and gave it back to the people and then he said to them have I missed anyone and they said no may Allah reward you you have given us everything that we have entrusted you with then he said if this is the case then I bear witness that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah and that Muhammad sallallaahu it is his messenger and servant I did not want to embrace Islam for this time so that you wouldn't say that I kept something for myself or I did not return the money to you as of now I am a Muslim and he went back to Medina migrating to the prophet alayhi salatu salam when the prophet saw him solo assalam he was happy and he gave him his wife back without a new contract without a new dowry and this is a ruling in fact which is when two couple when a couple who were non-muslims one of them usually the wife accepts Islam and she is obliged to leave her husband she cannot live with a kafir with a non-muslim but if she left him for a year for a five for ten years without getting married and after that he became a Muslim and they wanted to go back again in marriage they can without any marriage contract according to this story the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam honored zeyneb a lot she was his eldest daughter he had so much love for her he gave her to her husband when she was 10 years of age she believed in him alongside with her sisters and mother they were the first to accept Islam and then when she was attacked by her bar and his accomplice and she miscarries she kept on suffering from that and she got sick more frequent because of that until she died on the 8th year of hijra you can imagine the feelings of the Prophet are in salat wa salam after so many losses in his life so many tragedies from the death of his father while his mother was pregnant with him from the death of his mother when he was six years of age from the death of his grandfather who took care of him when he was eight from the death of his wife khadija and the death of his uncle Abu Talib and being forced to leave the most beloved country to his heart and migrated to Medina from the treacherous treatment and the betrayals of the Jews continuously and the undermining of the hypocrites for the attempts of spreading Islam and for Dawa and for his personal and own tragedies and calamities yet he remained standing on his feet he trusted allah azza wajal he believed in allah azza wajal he sought his strength only from allah subhana wa ta'ala and this is why he remained steadfast till the day he died that was zina the daughter of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam may allah azzawajal be pleased with her how dare Allahu Alem when his betrayal merely he Aslam was allah wa sallim wa barik ala nabiyyina muhammad why he was happy he remain assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today I'm gonna talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader prophet muhammad sallallahu alayhi wa sallam reminded us through his guidance and example that islam is complete submission to the will of allah for one who submits a mere declaration or display of belief will not be taken for success but his or her heart and soul will certainly be put to test a lot did the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam severely in order that he sallallahu alayhi wasallam becomes an example for his companions to follow similarly he tests the believer to see whether he lives a righteous life in accordance with the instructions and commands set by Allah all lives according to what his desires dictate whether the faith he displays is firmly rooted in his heart or is it merely on the surface he will be tested to see whether he will continue to have faith and love of Allah when in a calamity as he does when in comfort whether he will continue to remember and worship Him if given bounties and comforts of life as he does when he lives a modest life Allah will undoubtedly test him to see if his faith trust and love of him is unconditional or is it conditioned upon good health and a comfortable life free from stress and anxiety the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam showed us through his own example that for a righteous Muslim this life is a testing ground where he will continue to be tested until he meets Allah for him tests will be conducted on earth while he lives are not after he dies he knows that as soon as death arrives and he steps into the next world his tests are over there he only receives the result of his tests and enjoys the fruits of the deeds that he committed during a short span of time called life I said I wanna come walking with Allah and welcome back Ahmed says when a person stays in the Masjid after fajar to pray ashrak must he sit in the same spot or can he change his spot and go from one place to another in the Masjid it's an issue of dispute some scholars say that he must remain in the same as in the same spot he doesn't move but the most authentic opinion is that as long as he is within the parameters of the Masjid it is permissible for him to stand up and go and lean back on a pillar to rest his back or to go to somewhere where there is more light or more seclusion for him to make dhikr there is no problem in that insha'Allah Amin says is it permissible to invest in so cook bonds in Islamic bank what is so cook bonds so cook bonds is the Islamic alternative for normal bonds where the price bonds or normal bonds what are bonds bonds our document that is given for you in exchange for a money that you hand in to them and after a year or so it matures with a percentage that is RIBA based so they give you seven percent extra this or that and this is Haram so Coke is the Islamic alternative providing it is practice correctly so it is your party participation in a project where they determine the capital of the project and by buying a percentage of it you own a percentage of that project for a fixed number of years so it's not open or unlimited so the agreement is that this 100 million euros project you're buying 1 million you have 1% so cook for 3 years after 3 years because of your due diligence and you've studied the project you believe that after 3 years it would have flourished and made profit so after three years they really wait the whole project and they say now it's 150 million euros so your share is 1.5 you get 1 1 million euro and 500,000 this is permissible providing that this is a true Islamic bank governed by a true reliable Islamic sharia board and not those who just sign stamp and get delivered know it they have to be real scholars who fear allah and are known to give sound islamic fact words and allah knows best Rayanne from the US salam aliekum sample ah yes oh no one is a kind of odd question were there dinosaurs at the time of prophet Adam Ali Salam okay number two is how do we stop sinning like regular sinning okay number three is um is bismillah he were on abetik Attila the correct off before eating bismillah I like a deal okay and the last question is why were is why were why were the parents a problem Hamas or Salam inhale like because at that time there was no Islam okay okay just luckily Monica Murphy so brother Ryan from the US has four questions and some of the questions require a lecture but in a nutshell at Adams times were there dinosaurs I wasn't there at the time I am old but not that old secondly we can't say yes or no without evidence from the Quran and Sunnah so we cannot confirm or deny because this is something we have no knowledge of now yes archaeologists can come and say either we're Tyrannosaurus dinosaurs or whatever names they just put from Latin and they claim that they looked like this and they this is their science but they can't prove that to us because they don't know when Adam was peace and blessing be upon him as most of them think that there was no Adam to begin with that we are all the the descendants of apes and we have evolved from apes to this which is nonsense so we can't take the word for it but at the same time we cannot deny or confirm that there were any such things as dinosaurs at that time number two how do we stop sinning this is an issue that depends entirely on the amount of Eman in your heart so this again needs a lecture but in a nutshell first of all learn more about the beautiful names and attributes of Allah soldier learn more about the heat we are doing hamd Allah every Friday and Saturday a live session on Halawa tell a soul which is in Acadia which shows you opens your eyes to who Allah is what is Islam what is who is the Prophet eyes are Salaam this strengthens the man in your heart thirdly you have to surround yourself with righteous practicing Muslims twenty-four seven hours 24 hours seven days a week always be with the Muslims in the Masjid or in the Islamic Center engage yourself with robada with the congregation this weakens the desire for sins and finally add as many as you can to your schedule reciting the Quran making dhikr and individual forms of worship night prayer fasting Mondays and Thursdays and the white days engaging in watching beneficial lectures because this uplifts your Eman and reduces your desire to sin and Allah knows best we have Faison from India I have a few questions yes sir number one it's a Rashid a name of Allah okay number two so I'm writing a book online so I have three questions related to it so my first question is is compliments lying in three cases so lying in all of the rest of the cases is a major sin or a minor sin in other other cases or in this one in other cases nothing these three cases the other cases okay the next question is lying jokingly is also a major sin or a minor sin okay then the last question is what is the punishment for lying as in sahih al-bukhari the book of funerals the Prophet SAW Allah Allah sternum said I had seen a dream that I saw a person sitting another standing with her I didn't hook in his hand I got your question I will answer you shot Baraka laughing so we have the remand from Nigeria Abdul Rahman okay we lost some drive man now we have from Saudi hello yes Navy huh are they you come aside Allah Allah kata I'm from Saudi Arabia does just have one question yes it is important to read surah most every night okay any more questions I would answer in sha allah pipe Rayanne's third question is it authentic to say bismillah wada barakat Allah before we eat answers know the authentic hadith is just to say bismillah and the scholars differed whether we can say bismillah alrahman alraheem or just restrict ourselves to bismillah and the most authentic opinion is that you have to limit yourself to bismillah as this is what was reported from the prophetess of Salaam his fourth question is why are the parents of the Prophet is awesome in hell this question you do not ask me about this question is something that the Prophet himself are they his salat wa sallam told us about and the hadith is inside Halima Muslim his father a man came to him and said o prophet of Allah where's my father so the Prophet said Isis am your father is in hell how did the Prophet know allahumma salli wa sallim a day because allah told him so the man did not feel well about the answer the Prophet said to him your father and my father are in hell and another hadith the Prophet wept one day al-assad so they asked him why are you weeping he said I sought permission from Allah to seek forgiveness from my mother and he denied me from seeking forgiveness for her which means that in accordance to the ayah in Surat October that the Prophet and the believers are not permitted to seek forgiveness for those who died on idol-worshipping even if they were next of kin end of story now this was the prophet's fatwa during his salat wa salam not mine not share XYZ it was from the Prophet himself as son and it's not in a dubious book it's in sorry an imam muslim the most authentic book alongside with the Bihari after the Koran so why this is not our issue or problem because this is from Allah so Asian it's a revelation you can say that maybe because the people of Mecca had the religion of Ibraheem this is why they were performing Hajj they were doing Tawaf and they had the original religion of ibrahim of worshipping Allah unto he and his son Ismael was their forefather and there was the religion of Judaism and Christianity which they had could have adopted anyone so these religion of monotheism were there but they failed to choose it so those who fail to choose it would end up in hell this might be a reason I don't know what I know is what the Prophet said to us I racism we have to believe and comply and Allah knows best about that man from Nigeria something la I have a number of geometry yes the first question on behalf of one of my friends he asked me about 2011 about why is it to our 11:11 milk yes yes so the question is is this just applicable to yoga or it applies to I mean Holly I don't know so I don't know I will show so I said okay and then the second question is we have this practice in Nigeria during Ramadan top government officials sent Ramadan packages and give to some other government officials which is like from their own sort of encompasses not from the government so is this something that allows and if it's not allowed if they allowed for the family members to to consume from the like I mean the probably the item is allowed for the family members of that official who okay yes I think I'm Sam okay that's fine Hollis Faison from India says is a Rashid one of a laws name and to my knowledge at the moment I don't think it is one of Allah's names but if I recollect correctly and if I remember correctly that this is an issue of dispute if I recall correctly that this is not one of Allah's names because it's not authenticated in the Quran or in the Sunnah and we cannot use a name to describe allah azza wajal for example al-hadi or morrison these names are dispute upon some scholars call it names of allah others say we need an authentic Delisle from the Quran are from the sinner to prove it so to my recollection I'm not confirming this I have to go back to my books and sources my memory is not as accurate as it used to be to find the answer so I would appreciate it if you can post this question on my website and I will give you the answer for sure inshallah we have Raja all Huk from the UK South Allah alhamdulillah how are you I'm from I'm fine it yeah he what can I do for you I just want to ask you a question regarding Eid prayer yes the hood bar after the Salah is that mandatory or the Sunnah okay any more questions no it's no more I will I will answer you in sha Allah okay la la vie a Ya Allah sofie's ons second question is lying a major sin he says we know that we are allowed to lie in three cases but other than these cases would lying be a major sin the answer is it depends it can be major sin and it can be a minor sin and among the minor sins is when you lie jokingly and this is his third question this is not permissible and some say it is not recommended but the most authentic opinion is lying jokingly is not permissible unless they know for sure that you're joking in this case it becomes not recommended but even if they did not know as long as you're joking and it's not something of seriousness it's not a major sin it's a minor sin as for the punishment for lying he recalls a hadith that the prophet saw in one of the visions a man standing behind another one sitting down incoming with a piece of iron and putting it in his mouth and tearing it to the back of his neck and then he does the same with the other side and when he does this the other one heals and he keeps on doing this until the day of judgment this is in the grave so the Prophet asked who is this and why is this being done to him and they tell him the angels with him that this is from a person who lies and his lie spreads all over the globe so this fits like a glove the people of the media who spread fake news as they say the people on what's app the people on social media where people take whatever they say and publish it and relay it this falls in that category but this is only for such mass lies other lies they depend on their gravity and Allah knows best Rayanne Salaam walekum Salam I one more questions here okay my grandmother she says of the last two I am through the baqara I've never solo after every prayer and I just want to ask is this a Buddha and innovation okay any more questions no it is a cool whoa Jessa okay so Benny huh from Saudi Arabia she says is it authentic to recite surat al-mulk Tabarrok Allah DBA the hill mulk wa huwa ala kulli shayin Qadir 30 verses of it every single night the answer is yes the prophet alayhi salat and told us about 30 verses a chapter of 30 verses that protects the one who memorized it from hell and it protects the person who recites it every night from the torment of the grave and from the fat tan as he said that is awesome so definitely it is a confirmed Sunnah and I don't know of Muslim who goes to bed every night without reciting it from the beginning to the end a drama about drama from Nigeria he says the word Leben what does it mean actually in Arabia Leben is milk the normal milk we know nowadays we have yogurt we have sour milk and in Arabic we call this leaven and the other one we call it a leap so milk now is not referred to as 11 when you go to the market in Arabia nowadays you say give me a bottle of lemon he'll give you sour milk which has salt in it but this is not the Arabic real meaning of it lemon means Holub means milk the one that you get straight from the animal without treating his second question is that in Ramadan there's a practice in his country where people give officials gifts and this gift is given either through other government officials but from their own pocket money so what's the ruling on that well it depends if before assuming these positions they used to give one another gifts during the month of ramadhan ordering and eat some food some clothes some gifts of any sort of there's no problem in that but now because this particular person is an official whatever you give to him is dubious we look at it with suspicion why did you give this official not give me I'm the share give me something so the welfare you're not in a position to help me or to scratch my back so that I can scratch yours ah then you're giving this official because you intend something like when I go and visit an official in a company and I buy him a set of expensive pens why am i giving it to him I don't know him am i giving it to him because his eyes are black or blue no I'm giving it to him because of the position someday one day I'll utilize this gift in some form of service or favor he can return to me ah this is a bribe but if this gift is normal and natural before he assumed that position you every single Ramadhan you used to give it to him there's no problem in that what about if it is a bribe and he took it and brought it home his family can eat from it because it's totally halal for them it's Haram only on the one who took it and earned it and Allah soldier knows best we have okay Raja will hug from the UK says the the read prayer we usually pray 2 rakaats of read and afterwards the imam gives one hope as according to the Sunnah some places they give too hot bus so is these this hot ba or are these two hot bus considered to be mandatory or Sunnah no these hot bazaar mandatory for the imam to give because this is part of the ritual but it is not mandatory for the worshipers to sit and listen so you created two rakahs the amount starts to give the hot but you can leave if you wish of course this is not recommended because this is once in a lifetime in a year that you hear this grand sermon but if you want to leave your prayer is done your obligation is done and you're not sinful for that Ryan's last question was his relative recites the last two eyes of Surat al-baqarah a man Arasu to be materially hemoglobin well McMillan so is this an innovation or a Sunnah no definitely this is an innovation it is not to be recited after any fault prayer it is to be recited before you go to bed the Prophet said Alice's room who ever recites to last two ayahs of Surat al-baqarah at night it will suffice him one group of scholars said it would suffice him meaning from night prayer he doesn't have to pray or offer night prayer because this is as good as praying night prayer and the other most authentic opinion is that it would suffice him from any contact with Shaitaan he would not be able to harm him because he said these two ayats as a protection and Allah surgeon knows best I said the law from Canada assalamu alaikum warahmatu loyal worker to Sheikh how are you surround club laka - Hey Ya Allah hey what can I do for you Sheikh I have just one question yes sir my question is I'm confused about these modern-day Western scholars especially here in Canada where I'm from and it's like some some of them are contradicting each other in the way you have to follow certain rulings so I want to go back to the original real scholars in Islam and the only ones I know are shippin buzz shaky banal Feynman and Shivani I was wondering if you could give a list of a few other scholars as well because these are the only three trusted scholars that I know of and possibly recommend some books in English for for people like me who don't understand that's all barakallahu fake brother I said the law question is very delicate and unfortunately some I won't say all some of the dies the students of knowledge whether in Canada or in the u.s. due to the media social media due to the internet due to the publicity and due to the thirst of the people to some form of knowledge they have been inflated way above their actual size and this is not a problem people inflate us more than our actual actual size the problem is when it gets into your head and you actually think that whoa I have grown out of salafiyyah I can say things I'm not obliged to listen to scholar source or Imam so so I am a Rambo this is totally wrong and unfortunately the people in the in in northern america and in some parts of europe are misguided by such people there soon as of knowledge they're not scholars in so many of them you would not miss a single lecture without finding a list of wrong things they're saying so what you're doing i said the law is the right thing go back to the real scholars the scholars who had passed away who died so that you are certain that they won't be influenced with money with power or intimidated to say something haram go with the scholars who are consistent don't go to people who come a flage and change colors so 20 years ago they used to say tomatoes and now they say tomatoes and they keep on changing their positions according to the highest bidder stick with those who are consistent to the Quran to the Sunnah with understanding of the favorite three generation so shekel bimba's shake even earth I mean Cheryl Bernie these were the top three that the Ummah were guided by in contemporary times you have solid foods and you have share of the criminal air you have shared abdominal Barack you have so many of shoes here and there that you can not only inside Arabia there are so many chooks in Egypt in and Kuwait in Jordan elsewhere that you can follow but you have to always have in the back of your mind that no one is sacred we respect them we love them they know much more than we do but we have to filter whatever anyone says in accordance with the Quran and the Sunna and the majority of the scholars who follow the Quran Sunnah would point out and say that this is right if someone says one opinion that does not relate to the others and it doesn't sound logical and it's not complying with the Quran Sunnah definitely you respect that person who is from the great scholars but this opinion of his we do not follow analyze original knows best this is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow same time I leave you fear Manila was Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
