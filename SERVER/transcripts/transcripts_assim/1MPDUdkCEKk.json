  "title": "Women gathering in a house and praying taraweeh behind an imam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "under which says in our country there's a practice that behind-the-curtain a boy will lead the congregation of ladies in taraweeh mostly in someone's house bar part by participating in such a congregation will one be able to get the reward of praying the whole night behind the imam or praying alone at home is better please advise first of all the hadith where the Prophet said Alice a lot Salam he who prays with his Imam until he is through or until he's over from his prayers then he will be rewarded as if he had prayed the whole night this hadith is regarding a person who prays in the message it because this is what Imam refers to otherwise each one of us would have a congregation in the house and would not pray taraweeh and this is why it's an issue of dispute among scholars whether praying taraweeh in the Masjid is best or praying it home which one some say know without doubt praying it in the message is the best it's the ultimate because of the congregation because it's easier for you will you pray it in the Masjid because it's a Sunnah that was taught to us by the prophet alayhi salatu salam himself others say no praying it alone in the house is better providing you do not fear that missing the prayer in congregation would impact negatively the congregation because if each one of us prayed home and nobody offered the taraweeh and the message we would have abandoned a sunnah so they say it's conditional depending on the situation however the most authentic opinion is that praying it in the Masjid with the congregation like the Prophet had done not in his salat WA Salam for three or four nights in the beginning this is more rewarding and more recommended now for women to gather in a house leave their homes and go to a house it's the same thing as going to a Masjid so what is best no pray in your home but if there are a lot of women in the same house and they bring a curry someone who memorizes the Quran and has a good voice so that he would lead them this is permissible because it was reported that some of the female companions used to do this and used to instruct her slave to lead them in prayer and hence this is a permissible insha'Allah"
