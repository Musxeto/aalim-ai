  "transcript": "Allah the Almighty says in the Quran and Allah Allah is the one who created you in the state of weakness then gave you strength after weakness then after strength gave you weakness and gray hair he creates what He wills servants of Allah this beautiful ayah allah azza wajal summarizes our lives on earth this life that we at times seem to consider and think that it is endless however it is not and this is the inevitable fact you are born you live and you will die no one escapes this fate not even our beloved prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam yet Allah gives us signs after signs so that we would be aware of what awaits us if you look at this magnificent sign of allah azza wajal you would find that life is in stages we are born weak vulnerable fragile ignorant unable to do anything but look at us now Allah says in the Quran and Allah has brought you out of your mother wombs knowing nothing every one of us was born in such a phase and state and it is allah azza wajal who gave us what we are having at the moment the young becomes or grows old the weak becomes strong the ignorant starts to learn and all of this is from allah azza wajal however this stage of puberty this stage of youth is prolonged until we are deceived by it so we think that it is going to last forever and we live life to the fullest we enjoy life to the max we take everything that we can lay our hands on whether it is halal or Haram so we drink from the cup of this dunya until we are intoxicated once we are addicted to this once we have it running in our bloodstream then the warners of Allah start coming in and the first Warner to us is reaching the age of 40 Allah says in the Quran till when he attains full strength and reaches 40 years this means that you will reach your max you will reach your climax in health in physical and mental abilities when you reach 40 and if you reach the peak there's nowhere else for you to go except downwards now this is the first Warner but who pays attention to it then we find that a number of Warner's keep on coming to us from Allah warning us beware of what is happening to you beware of where you are going to we find that we're getting fatigued we're becoming tired we forget things we're not as strong and as good as we used to be not only that we find that grayness is invading our hair and our heads like Zechariah said as Allah mentioned in the Quran my lord indeed my bones have grown weak and feeble and gray hair has spread on my head so these are a number of Warner's from 40 until you reach the age of 60 yet another Warner comes to you which is attaining the age of 60 the Prophet says erase a lot of them the average age of my followers of my Ummah is between 60 and 70 and seldom you will find people who would pass that so if you reach the age of 60 what should I do keep on doing what you've been doing for the past 60 years in New Jersey may Allah have mercy on his soul says once you reach the of sixty then you must start to pack your bags because you've reached your destination or you're almost there and every single day that the Sun rises over you this is a new gift this is a new blessing from allah azza wajal this is borrowed time it is for you to utilize it and allah azzawajal will hold you accountable to it and the more you become weak the more you become weaker the more you should strive in pleasing Allah and offering as many good deeds as you can because you never know when it will be over servants of Allah if you reach the age of sixty onwards you can feel a lot of things fighting inside of you and Shaitaan utilizes this Shaitaan plays well on this because when you reach this age you feel depressed you are a bit cynical you are not as positive as you used to be and that is why shape on tries his level best to get you at that moment why because after you die he has no power over you but while you're still living while you're still breathing he is waiting for the right moment for you to flip and once you do this is what he wants a true believer is not like that a true believer is a real Vantage the older he gets the better he is and the prophet sallallaahu REO Selim gave you the glad tiding and he told us that the best among you are those who live long and do good deeds and the worst among you are those who live long and do bad deeds may allah azzawajal protect us also everyone among us who has reached the age he's in he should be grateful to allah azza wajal that he made him reach that age whether young or old and older you become you should monitor your behavior the way you treat others the way you deal with others so if you are improving and doing good deeds know that Allah social loves you and do not think of getting old as a burden or as a trial from Allah because Allah doesn't love you on the contrary the more you live the more good deeds you do the more Allah loves you in soon and even magic Paul hah ignore obeyed Allah you all know him may Allah be pleased with him one of the ten heaven bound companion of the Prophet RA salatu salam one of the most beloved companions to the Prophet Allah Salih tosser he says that I saw in a vision I slept and I saw in a dream and before he saw that dream and he told us about that dream he is telling us that two men from a region up east came and diverted to Islam they accepted Islam so they were brothers one of them was much better than his brother in worship so he prays a lot of nights and he fasts a lot of days and he does a lot of good things gives in charity and this particular person the one who does good deeds went to battle and was martyred in the sight of Allah a soldier so he's a cheat so what more do you want he's a companion he does a lot of good deeds and he died as a Shahid one year later his brother died normally naturally so he said I went to bed one night and I saw in a dream that I and these two men were outside of paradise waiting for the gates to open so the gates of paradise were opened and they summoned they called the one who died a year after his brother the one who did not do a lot of good deeds the one who was not martyred and it was closed and after a while the doors were open again and the other person the martyr was admitted all he says I wanted to go in and the Angels told me it's not your time yet and I woke up so I spoke about my dream to everyone around me and people were shocked and astonished how is it a person who dies as a martyr and he did so many good deeds he was much much more enthusiastic than his brother yet his brother is admitted to paradise before him there's something wrong and this dream reached the Prophet Allah saw awesome and he heard what the people were talking about so he called him and he said what are you wondering about they said o prophet of Allah he dies a year after this martyr and he didn't do as many good deeds as he did yet he is admitted to Paradise first so the Prophet said Allah so son how long did he live after him and they said one year said did he fast Ramadan this is yes how many days did he fast how many prayers did he offer how many prostrations did he give more than the man who was martyred a year ago by Allah what's between them is like what's between the heavens and the earth one year of living does the difference between a normal person and a martyr which indicates that you should value every single minute that you live and consider it as a gift a blessing and a favor from Allah I say what you hear and I seek Allah's forgiveness so ask Allah social to forgive me and you as well but of us when we grow older we become cynical we become depressed we become easily agitated we become too sensitive we become grumpy to those who are around us and unfortunately this is a trial from allah azzawajal to both ends to the recipients and to the elders however Islam as usual is the religion of allah azza wajal and you have to be proud of that Islam excels as usual in all fields of life it does not address a particular field of life it addresses life itself in Islam excels in asking us as Muslims and teaching us as believers how to deal with such a segment of our society unlike the disbelieving west or east could treat them and consider them as insects that should be stepped on the elders have no reason to live they've consumed all of their choices so why are we treating them this well why are we doing this and that for them they should leave they brought us up it's their duty now they should not ask anything of us we should not do anything for them this is not how we do in Islam Islam honors Islam values this age where this elder has reached and the more he lives the more honor we give to him not necessarily being a parent not necessarily being someone we know Islam orders us to respect and honor the elders whether they are locals or expatriates and we have a big problem with this and this is not definitely the time nor the language to address this issue but we bring our children up in a way that makes them behave as they do Islam tells you this is not the way you as a Muslim it's your duty to respect any elder even if he's a kafir and if he's a Muslim it becomes a must whether he speaks your language or not whether he's from your ethnicity or not whether he is from you where you live or not the Prophet says are a solution he is not from us who does not honor and respect the editor he's not from us he's not from among us is not a proper Muslim so this is what Islam tells you it is a sign in Islam that you respect and honor the elder it's the sign of how you were brought up why do you say to the janitor who cleans your office as a general manager what do you call him uncle because this is how you were brought up you had good family you had good Muslims as parents good practicing Muslims but when you do the opposite this shows the lack of Eman in your heart and it shows the lack of discipline in bringing you up we hear a lot of bitter complaints from the elders we see how people misbehave in our countries in our localities with their elders and this shows you that there is something wrong there is an error in our upbringing it's good for you to pray in the first row it is unacceptable for you to treat an elder in a bad way by allah azza wajal it's even worse when this elder is a father or a brother or an uncle and there are cases you know of of how people feel the elders in their family and is not a proper Muslim who does this and you should doubt your Eman if you have this in you but this has a two-way streaming so as youngsters we have to respect the elders but what about the elders themself the elders themselves must eat have mercy on the youngsters and they should also not burden those who are around them so being grumpy being depressed being agitated all the time is not a positive thing this means that you as an elder lack the full trust dependence and reliance on Allah sodium you don't have to work good and that is why in ideal societies in our homes you find the elders being a beacon of wisdom and experience the youngsters go to seek knowledge and to seek guidance and the elders give that willingly and happily and this is where you have the bond between the Muslims in the Muslim societies and families the older you get always remember that Allah loves you and that's why he's prolonging your age so try your level best to offer as much as you can of good deeds I give you the glad tidings to those who are old and become old in Islam I give you like that glad tidings of Allah forgiveness and of Allah's pleasure because you have worshipped all these years seeking his forgiveness and seeking his pleasure and you have to remember that deeds are judged by their conclusion by their endings so it is a shame living 60 years 70 years and then you do sins and you die doing them so what's past is past try your level best to do well to worship Allah to be 24/7 giving charity worship Allah making Vicker offering prayer on time being kind to your spouse's your son's and grant children being kind to your neighbors be a true practicing Muslim so when death comes it would come while you are in the perfect state for receiving death"
