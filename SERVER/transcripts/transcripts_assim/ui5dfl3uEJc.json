  "transcript": "he says whenever i wake up in the morning sometimes i feel that i have a heart of stone that my heart is so stiff and dry how to counter that well this unfortunately requires a full lecture to talk about how to soften our hearts where did we go wrong which led us to have such hearts of stone but basically speaking one you have to revise your relationship with the quran how many pages do you read every single day you have to analyze your relationship with the prayer with zikr with staying away from sins all of these add a lot to stiffening our hearts and may allah make it easy for all of us"
