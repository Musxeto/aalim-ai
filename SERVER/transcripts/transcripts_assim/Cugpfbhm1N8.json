  "transcript": "alhamdulillah uh I want to ask about again about my country uh like there two years military is mandatory so like we have to do that and like we how how can I say like it's we cannot pray anything or like fast or something during that time so and actually people also if they can afford but it's uh bit uh illegally afford they they want to pay but still um like it's hard to uh do that so during that time for two years most of people are just um leaving Salah or like even fasting during Ramadan so what what shall we do in this case yeah like it's Haram I mean like we we cannot do that as a Muslim you're obliged to obey Allah so either if your ruler or your country Force you if they force you to disobey Allah by skipping Salat or skipping fasting Ramadan or even shaving your beard you must oppose this and fight it it to the best of your ability you must not obey them because there is no obedience to anyone no matter how big that person is in disobeying Allah so if you're forced by law to do these heinous acts to do these two years of compulsory military service and they would force you not to pray you have to skip this by any means even if you have to bribe you have to lie you have to forge documents to skip it there's no problem in that because your religion comes first and it's like being in the desert and you're stranded and there is nothing for you to eat nothing keeping you from dying except a dead dog or a dead donkey that you are forced to eat one or two morsels to s stain your life in this case every scholar say you are permitted to do so so this is something that does not require a rocket scientist now if you're unable to do any of this and you're forced to do such service and Skip prayer then you have to pray on time even if this leads you to be beaten up or thrown in jail so be it but you have to pray on time if you can pray in hiding or combin and due to necessity and still pray on time that is mandatory and Allah say says in the Quran fear Allah to the best of your ability and it would be advisable to try and migrate from such an evil country that does not uh uh allow you to practice your own Islamic commitment and Islamic religion this is pathetic what kind of a country does such evil acts abandon them and ditch them and go and migrate to any other country that would give you their citizenship"
