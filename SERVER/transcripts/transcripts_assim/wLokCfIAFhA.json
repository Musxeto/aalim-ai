  "transcript": "Iman from Qatar Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I have a friend that does not wear hijab and uses swear words a lot From time to time she backbites and gossips I'm like shy to encourage good and forbid evil But once I did advise her and she was happy and listened to my advice I also made a stikhaara and I'm pretty sure My response to the stikhaara was like a few YouTube videos being recommended to me About like if friends if your friends are not righteous You will be enemies with that friends on the day of judgment and videos like that But I got your video recommended to me where you were answering a question about someone who asked you If it's okay to cut off contacts from Muslim friends after they started practicing and you said that we should Give dawah to a friend who are who are not practicing but care about you and love you and we can get rewards for that So now I'm confused about this. So my question is So based on all this should I continue being friends with her? This is not a one-size-that-fits-all It depends on the circumstances The end result and it depends on your own heart and how Positively or negatively affected you are meaning if you Mix with this girl Trying to give her dawah While she's still insisting not to wear the hijab. She curses a lot. She backs bite she slanders others and she uses a lot of swear words that are Sticking in your ears and heart and you're thinking of them all the time. This is bad news You're like a candle giving light to the others while burning itself. Who cares if she's guided or not as Long as you're negatively affected like that. No you have to run Boycott her and leave her alone But if you see that there is improvement with the grace of Allah Azza wa Jal and you are Steadfast and strong in your iman. You're not easily affected by her behavior and by what she's saying and she's Developing she's progressing alhamdulillah in this case. You stay with her and Allah knows best You"
