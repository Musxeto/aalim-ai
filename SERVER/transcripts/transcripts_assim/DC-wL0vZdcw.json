  "transcript": "we're going to begin our program and we have with us the two speakers who are going to debate this particular issue with the edate or the adab of alislam to my immediate left we have our brother from the Pioneers we have our brother Abu Amina bil Phillips and he is going to speak secondly and the first speaker is going to speak and he was our brother who also came all the way from Saudi Arabia and he was our guest here at our previous conference sheh andam he's going to speak first for 30 minutes he's going to put his issues across with their proofs and then after that our brother she AB bil is going to also speak for 30 minutes about the same Mell and then we'll go back to the first Speaker who have 10 minutes to make his rebuttal or to make whatever closing remarks that he wants to make in regards to the issue and then the second speaker will also be afforded the same opportunity so without any further Ado we'll begin this debate which is centered around a serious issue and that issue is the issue of of the one who abandons the Salah in Islam neither speaker has time to talk about the virtues of a Salah that the first thing that Allah is going to ask you about is your Salah the thing that the companions did not see the abandonment of anything other than it as being disbelief they don't have the time to deal with the virtues of it but that's the issue at hand what is the ruling concerning the individual who abandons the Salah out of lazy out of La laziness and as a result of being negligent does he go outside of the fold and the P of Al Islam or is he still considered to be a Muslim so we're going to have our brother is going to begin inshallah the issue of a person abandoning Salat whether he is a cafir or not is an issue that Scholars of Islam had disputed upon Al IM Ahmed ibal may Allah have mercy on his soul said that whoever abandons Salat is a cfir and he is to be asked to come back to Islam by performing prayer if he insists he is to be executed as a non-muslim and he would be treated as such IM Abu hanifah and IM Malik and an Imam shaf may Allah have mercy on them all said that he is not a cfir but as IM Malik and Imam sh said he should be asked to come to pray and if he doesn't he would be executed but not as a cafir as a Muslim and he would be treated as a sinful Muslim and they differed again and again and as Muslims whenever we have difference in opinion among Scholars we on the day of judgment are questioned by Allah in regard to our response to what the prophet Alat wasam had said not to the differences among Scholars and that is why Allah the almighty says and and if you differ in anything among yourselves refer it to Allah and his messenger sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam if you believe in Allah and in the last day therefore I'm going to put forward some of the evidences from the Quran and from the Sunnah regarding this topic I've Selected Few because the time limits me not to go in details so the first verse is in where Allah says but if they repent perform Salat and give zakat then they are your brethren in religion so Allah asael is talking about the pagans if they do these three things then they are our Brethren they are Muslims and that is they are to repent from shik from associating others with Allah and they are to pray and they are to perform zakat so if they repent they say but they don't perform prayer and they don't give zakat they are not Muslims they are not our brothers if they do two out of three which is they say and they pray but they don't give zaka it is supposed to be that again they are not Muslims but there is a Hadith in theah where the prophet of Allah tells us that those who do not give zakat it is up to Allah whether to forgive them or to put them in Hell forever it's up to Allah so this is or this does not fall under the criteria of being something that makes a person abandons Islam if he does not pay zaka so we remain with prayer if a person does not pray but he believes in Allah Asel in accordance to this verse of Toba he is not considered to be a brother of ours he's not considered to be a Muslim another verse inah where Allah tells us that the Believers in when they're in Paradise they ask those who were with them but they were thrown into hell and Allah Asel tells us what has caused you to enter hell they will say those are who are in hell we were not of those who use to offer their Salat this is the first reason and then they give three other reasons so the prime reason was they were not considered to be among those who prayed and if you go on to look at other verses of the Quran you will find that there were sins committed major sins yet the Quran described those committing these sins as brothers of ours as in the case in murdering a Muslim this is one of the worst major sins allaha tells us that whoever kills a Believer intentionally his recompense is hell to abide therein and the Wrath and curse of Allah are upon him and the great punishment is prepared for him him Those Who Kill a Muslim intentionally but at the same time Allah tells us about those who fight against each other and may kill one another after the killing has taken place Allah says as inah Al Bak but if the Killer Is Forgiven by his brother who is related to the person killed so Allah Asel described him to be his brother though he is the killer of an innocent person yet the relative of the deceased the relative of the person who was killed is described in the Quran by his brother so the Killer and the relatives are brothers so Allah Asel did not tell us that those who committed this major sin of killing is not your brothers anymore but regarding prayer Allah the almighty told us that if they repent perform prayer and give zakat then they are your brothers in religion as for the Sunnah jab abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father told us the Hadith the famous Hadith where the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam in different narrations said the difference between us and Them is Salat who is us and who is them we the Muslims and them are the non-muslims so the difference between us and Them is Salat whoever neglects it is a cafir and this was reported by IM Ahmed uh uh and others and in another the prophet saidat nothing stands between man and kufur and shik disbelief associating others with Allah nothing separates him nothing stands between him and that except prayer the prophet says whoever neglects it becomes a cfir and a musri and this is a commentary from those who translated but the prophet did not say thisat and this was reported by IM Muslim in theah now the prophet Alam drew the line and he said this is the line separating Muslims from non-muslims and this is the the vow or the oath between us and them so when you draw the line this means that who whoever crosses the line is not a Muslim and it is the only form of Deeds that the prophet called whoever does this is not a Muslim and he specifically said Al with the identification article Al he did not say kuur he said alur the thing that causes in another Hadith the prophet and I'm not going to go into details because of the time the prophet tells usam about rulers to come and they will rule the Muslims he's telling the Companions and he tells them sallallahu alaihi wasallam that you will know things and you will reject things you will know things that are in accordance to the Quran and the Sunnah but you will reject things that you think that they are not in accordance to Islam so the companions being hot blooded and being so strict to their belief and abiding by it said oh prophet of Allah shall we fight them if they do evil things if they commit sins and do things that we do not recognize to be from the Quran or Sunnah shouldn't we fight them so the prophet told them Alat no as long as they pray as long as they pray so the prophet gave them only one excuse he did not mention Salat uh sorry he did not mention zakat fasting Haj he did not mention anything else he just said as long as they are praying leave them you have to obey them you have to follow them you have to give them your Allegiance now in another Hadith also in Muslim the prophet called for the pledge of allegiance to the our rulers and that you have to obey them in good or bad in ease and difficulties in all your conditions so and you should not do anything to go out of their allegiance unless the prophet saysat wasam he said unless they made a blunt show of kufur and you have evidence from Allah that what they are doing is indeed kufur and this Hadith is agreed upon by bukari and Muslim so if you compare Apple to Apple you'll find that the prophet Alat wasam is telling us in the first Hadith you have to obey them as long as they pray in the other Hadith you cannot disagree with them or go out and uh uh uh make a m or fight with them unless you have and see a blunt a blatant it shows blatant is that blatant blatant show of kufur cheating is okay uh and you have evidence from Allah on it and this means that abandoning Salah is equal to kuur and that is why you obey your rulers unless they abandon Salah or commit something that is considered to be kufur and there is a Hadith which was regarded and authenticated by albani may Allah have mercy on his soul where the Prophet saysat wasam about prayer whoever preserves praying on time it will be light and evidence and means of uh uh uhat of being rescued on the day of judgment and whoever does not not observe it and maintain praying it will shall not be light for him and it shall not be an evidence for him and he will not be rescued on the day of judgment on the contrary he will be on the day of judgment with Pharaoh with ham withun and with the head of disbelief in this world and this proves that whoever does not observe Salah he will be with those cfir in hell and if you look in the Quran and Sunnah never you will ever find evidence stating that a person who does not pray will not is not a cafir a person who does not pray is a Believer all what you'll find is General evidences stating that whoever says purely from his heart will enter Paradise but it doesn't say what this Hadith implies because you could say ill and disbelief in something else or you can say ill and prostrate to a statue or to the grave of a dead person and this nullifies Islam even if he 100 times and the prophet saysat wasam also in a Hadith authenticated by Alani may Allah have mercy on his soul he's advising His companion he says do not associate others with Allah even if they chop you into pieces and they burn you alive and do not abandon a mandatory prayer intentionally because whoever abandons it intentionally he is not considered to be a Muslim and do not consume intoxicants because it's the key for every evil and we believe that this is the consensus of Scholars at the time of the prophet alisat wasam and onwards the companions of the Prophet alai am as reported by abdah they said that he said that the companions of the Prophet did not consider any Deeds being abandoned to be kufur with the exception of prayer so the companions thought that if you abandoned fasting this is a major sin and you are on great danger but you're still a Muslim if you abandoned pilgrimage if you abandoned paying zakat it's a major sin but as long as you believe in it you are still a Muslim but they thought and they believed that whoever abandoned prayer is committing kufur he is not a Muslim and this is a consensus of the companions of the Prophet Alat wasam and it was also reported that Omar may Allah be pleased with himd jabal abuur and many other of the companions such as abdah abdah AB they all considered those who abandon Salat intentionally to be non-muslims to be KU is may Allah have mercy on him one of the companions of Ahmed may Allah have mercy on him also said that the majority and he's talking about himself and the people at his time thought that whoever delays whoever postpones prayer and he does not pray it intentionally that until the following prayer is due he said that all the companions from the uh prophet's time sallallahu alaihi wasallam and the scholars up till date they consider him to be cfir there are so many evidences I still have 10 minutes I believe and uh I don't want to go into details technical details because then you tend to forget the main points but the difference is not that big and it's more of a theoretical difference because all Muslims without any exception believe that if a person abandons Salat thinking that it is not mandatory he is cfir if you don't believe in Salat you are cfir even if you pray five times a day and you perform excellent Evolution and you make the Sunnah before prayer and after prayer if you maintain praying five times a day but you don't believe that it is mandatory this person is cfir there's no difference among SCH in this if you believe that zakat is not mandatory he's a cafir a person believing that fasting is not Ramadan fasting Ramadan is not mandatory he is a cafir even if he performs it but the only pillar of Islam where we have the prophet Alat wasam not identifying this by saying whoever believes that prayer is not mandatory is a cafir he said whoever abandon he did not mention your belief he mentioned not actually praying the only Deeds or pillar of Islam is this prayer and that is why we always say that it's a technicality IB T says may Allah have mercy on his soul that if you bring someone and you tell him to pray and he refuses and you show him the evidences proving that if you don't pray you're not a Muslim he says well I believe prayer is mandatory and I believe in the verses of the Quran and the Hadith of the Prophet but I'm not going to pray and if he is brought in front the Muslim ruler and the ruler who has the authority not you and I we have no Authority on anyone at all this is to be done by the Muslim ruler and the ruler tells him you have to pray or will chop your head off he says I'm I completely agree with you I believe in Salah I'm not going to pray we leave him for three days and nights we threatening him putting him on on on a a big plasma you know executions and beheading and people dying and graveyards every morning we come and say do you want to pray nope you have 10 hours left 1 hour left we show him the sword we're going to behead you now now says I believe it's mandatory I'm not going to pray T says once you chop his head off he is not a Muslim because after all of this and he's brought with the evidence and he is asked to pray and he refuses then he is rejecting the concept otherwise he would have done it therefore I end my talk by saying we have to look at how to apply this verdict because it's being misused among the Muslims I get almost four or five calls every week from sisters saying yeah my husband is abusing me he does this he does that he married twice Thrice four times and he's doing that he's not supporting me and he doesn't pray because when she says this you have to be patient you have to be Toler you have to do this and when she sees that it's coming to a dead end she says he doesn't pray so so she's then he's not my husband then I can go and get remarry again it is a very serious thing to tell your brother that he's a cfir it's it's it's a serious thing the prophet tells us whoever tells his brother yeah it will go up and and look if he is truly cfir it will fit him if he is not it will bounce back on the person who said that therefore it is not to us to label people as cfir never ever go into that swamp of labeling people classifying people he's a cfir no he sfir I think couple of weeks he'll be a cafir or so no it's not your duty we're talking about a technical thing that can be only ruled by judges by rulers by Scholars of Islam so you don't label someone because you don't see him pray that he's a cfir I've never seen him pray maybe he prays in his bedroom maybe he prays when you're away maybe he prays when you're in the Masjid no Sheik I never go to the Masjid I'm always with him so you're not praying as well maybe he prays When you pray so don't go into that swamp but you have to know that if a person abandons prayer intentionally he's not a Muslim and this is as far as the companions of the Prophet Alat thought and the Scholars of uh the Hadith and this is what I believe and let's hear inshallah what the other side of the story is for what he put forth"
