  "title": "Can we use Sayyidina for all Messengers",
  "transcript": "Ubayy from Tunisia Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah May Allah bless you Sheikh Anhibkum Barshah and you as well Is it permissible to say Sayyiduna to all the prophets and messengers? There is no problem in using the word Sayyiduna with all prophets and messengers and sometimes with individuals as well however the restriction is to use the word Sayyid or Sayyiduna with hypocrites with well-known enemies of Islam because the Prophet ﷺ said do not say to the hypocrite Sayyiduna because if he is then you've angered your Allah how could such a hypocrite infidel be your master or your Sayyid and the Prophet himself ﷺ used the word with Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath may Allah be pleased with him who was the head of the Aus Bani Abdul Ash'hal when he was injured in the battle of the trench and he kept on bleeding for a month and he was weary and tired because of this and when the Prophet wanted to rule ﷺ and judge the fate of the Jewish tribe of Bani Qurayza they said we accept the arbitration of Sa'd Ibn Mu'ath may Allah be pleased with him so he came when he felt that he's a little bit healthier and when he came to the gatherings and the Prophet saw him he said to his companions go and stand and help and assist Sayyidikum your master your tribesman he's a leader so the word Sayyiduna is permissible inshallah as long as it is not used with hypocrites and Allah knows"
