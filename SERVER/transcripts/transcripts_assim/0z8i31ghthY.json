  "transcript": "my question is about uh delivery uh when women do give delivery uh via C-section and not the normal delivery are they still uh do they still stop praying up until 40 days or can they pray as usual so brother Salim is asking about the period of nefas nefas is a postnatal bleeding so if a woman gives birth she's obliged to observe herself the period of 40 days and this is where she is not allowed to pray fast or be intimate with her husband in a sense of intercourse until she sees her Purity performs her this might be a full 40 days it might be L but it cannot exceed 40 days so his question is if a woman does not have natural birth rather she has a C-section cerian operation so does the ruling continues and remains and the answer is yes the ruling is the same she has to observe herself for 40 days some women May bleed for three or four days and the blood stops and she sees the white thread like discharge she performs and she prays fast and if her husband is interested be my guest but if the bleeding returns within the 40 days of her birth or delivery she has to refrain and consider that to be post-natal bleeding nefas and it goes on frequently so she may perform russle two three times four times within this period of 40 days and Allah Knows Best"
