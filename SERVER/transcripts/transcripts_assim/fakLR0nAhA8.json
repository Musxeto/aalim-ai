  "transcript": "a sister says asking on behalf of a friend she's 28 years old her parents are not getting her married father is not interested and not even a bit bothered about her future and has no plans for her mother is worried that but she says it's not in her hand and how would she do it all alone girl is earning and maybe can afford her marriage expenses in the situation what is the girl's responsibility and what should she do this question has a number of areas intermingled together first of all the issue of finding the right shooter and from culture to culture this differs in India and Pakistan and elsewhere they that is the girl's family look for a potential shooter so they knock on people's doors telling them that your son is a graduate your son is an employee your son is a potential person for marriage so why don't you consider our daughter and they look into it and how it goes in in in normal cases this is not the case in Arabia and elsewhere a woman is honoured and she is sought after not the other way around it's not her parents that go look for a potential suitor it's the men that look for such a woman with such character and attributes but this is a cultural thing if we call people not to go and look maybe half of the women or more would not get married so this is issue number one if the father is not willing to look and the mother says that she's helpless and she cannot do it on her own you can't or your friend can ask relatives so she has female cousins and she has acquaintances so she spreads the words that listen I'm 28 years of age I have a job and I'm financially stable I'm looking for the right husband so my knight in shining armor I'm okay if he drives a Corolla Toyota no problem it doesn't have to be a white horse I'm okay if his income is below mid class I'm okay if he's not that handsome but he has to be at least practicing praying in Masjid etc and they look around and then he shot a lot things with escalate and develop there is nothing wrong in also registering your name without putting a photo or your direct number try to put your mom's number if you have one your brother your uncle even your father so that people would look into your profile and see so post this in Islamic matrimonial sites there was the site that mashallah I know the people working on it which is called my better half I think it's called my better half it's not my bitter half this is after marriage but before marriage your better half and I think they have matchmaking services worldwide so you might look into that and this is first portion second portion is if the guy comes but you don't have your father claims not to have the finance to marry you off in this case as long as you have saved some money you can utilize this for your marriage bearing in mind that Islamic marriages are supposed to be financially provided for totally by the groom so it's the man's responsibility to pay for the maja for the dowry to pay for the walima and if there's a wedding to pay for the wedding now the scale depends on is financing so if he comes and says ok mm I'm gonna slaughter a ram or two and invite 10 15 20 people max this is his right if he says I don't want to make a wedding in a hotel room or in a hotel hall or somewhere fancy this is his right if the girl's family say no we have like 150 guests from our side we will contribute or we will wake make our own wedding party there is nothing wrong in that insha Allah so basically speaking you have to try your level best and don't be negative don't put obstacles whenever there's a will with the grace of Allah they'll always be away so trust Allah make a lot of dua consult those around you and inshallah you will find a way out"
