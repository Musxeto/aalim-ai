  "title": "How to retain knowledge revise & review? Imam az Zuhri quote | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "foreign so this means whoever acquires the whole of the knowledge the knowledge all of it will go away yeah yes this is this is a saying this is not Quran this is not Hadith this is not a saying by a renowned companion of the Prophet Allah so it's just it's the same in a sense this is logical if you go and try to collect everything about knowledge or science a particular science in a heartbeat or in a very short period of time what comes easy goes easy everybody knows this some people have the ability to memorize one page of the Quran in five minutes but if you come after a couple of hours and tell them to recite it it's gone because it came easy and it went easy that's why we have to keep on revising our memorization of the Quran reviewing it all the time so that it stays firm so this quotation of Imam Zori is a quotation it should not deter us from acquiring knowledge but it should open our eyes that we should be systematic we should not rush things because what comes easy goes easy and that we have to be consistent most people start in a very strong high level only to deteriorate little by little until they stop completely and you find this every single deed has a peak and every Peak has a down uh fall or a bottom to it so the prophet is telling us to moderate our actions to be in accordance to the Sunnah if your Peak deteriorates and goes down there is a limit to it where this is the Sunnah you will never mess up with someone gets his peak in night prayer so he prays four hours recites seven Jews of the Quran for four hours wow that's great man then he deteriorates two three hours two hours one hour five minutes then he skips Fajr prayer he doesn't pray Fajr on time okay now this guy has gone astray but someone who maintains dropping down in his Iman until he reaches a level that he doesn't exceed so he prays three of whichever before Fajr then he prays Fajr and tan him he goes to sleep he's okay so this is what is meant when you go you have to be consistent don't go for six hours attending six lectures and listening to uh podcasts and uh writing things and reading books and after a couple of months you completely leave everything and start playing PlayStation or or FIFA no this is not the right thing to do and Allah Knows Best foreign"
