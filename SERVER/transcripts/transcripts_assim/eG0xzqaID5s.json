  "transcript": "so my question is um if someone of the opposite gender is uh speaking to me for example a teacher explaining something or someone in a shop giving you a product and they're not lowering their gaze so they're looking at you can I look at them while they're talking are you wearing your NAD no okay in this case I would highly advise you to do so see when you're protected by Shar and you're wearing theab that only shows your eyes and people look at you you have no problem the problem is when you don't have the even if you believe that the face is not still the face contains 85% of the beauty of a woman so when men look at you you are a source of fitna to them yes they're sinful 100% I do totally agree but this does not exempt you from being a source of FNA though you don't believe it's mandatory still you are and as Allah said why and if you reach the level of Pi piety and try to preserve and and protect your uh Chastity more that is far greater and better for you so you can look at them because there is no sin in looking at men for you as a woman if there is no FNA but the FNA for them would increase when they speak to you and look to you and you look back and you can see that Hearts emojis and coming from their heads so it's best for you when you speak to them and they're having no shame in looking at you that you lower your gaze so that you don't give them any uh weird ideas and Allah Knows Best"
