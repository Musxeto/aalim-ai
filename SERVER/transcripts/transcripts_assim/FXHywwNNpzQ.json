  "transcript": "the jews for example talk about the staff of prophet musa peace be upon him and how it turned into a big python a big snake that swallowed all the sorcerer's tricks when they talk about splitting of the sea when they talk about other miracles that allah has given to musa an atheist would say show me they say no no this is found in the scriptures did you see it did you say no how can you believe something you did not see when the a christian says that jesus christ peace be upon him used to say that i cure the blind from birth and i cure the leper and i give life to the dead because at his time people excelled in medicine as at the time of moses people excelled in sorcery for example and magical tricks so their prophets were sent with medicals that suit their times so when a christian tells me all of these things and i say masha allah can you show me any of these miracles he said they do not exist today have you seen it yourself i said no but i was told about them i said okay and you go on and on to all prophets and messengers whom were sent to their people with similar miracles but these miracles were specifically given to their people and once the mission was accomplished there was no need for such miracles so we don't see any of these miracles unlike the time of the prophet the people of arabia excelled in their literature in how eloquent they used to use language how beautiful they structured it whether it's rhymes or poetry or uh um regular writing and speech so the prophet alaihis salatusam came to them with many miracles the splitting of the moon water gushing from his fingers you name it he had it yet allah has given him the ultimate miracle of all miracles and that is the word of allah the almighty which is unlike anything else and this miracle remained with us till date"
