  "title": "Best time to pray Witr after Isha or after Tahajjud? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "is it after praying asia or is it during the time so the question is crystal clear brother muhammad from the philippines says what's the best time to pray to witter the best time is in the last third of the night the prophet says let the conclusion of your night prayer be witter and he said that the best of the prayers are at the middle of the night or in the midst of the night and that is at the last third and the prophet islam used to pray in the beginning of the night and in the middle of the night and then it ended that he used to pray the vast majority of his nights at the last third of the night so if you wake up two to three hours before fajr and you offer to hajjud and you read the quran you make dua and you conclude your night prayer with 1 or three or five or seven or nine raka's of winter then you have followed the sunnah and you have attained the best of rewards and allah knows best you"
