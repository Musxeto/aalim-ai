  "title": "Is it permissible to eat suhoor while athan is going on, if you wake up late? - Sheikh Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Rilla says if a person has set to so many alarms but wakes up just 2 to 3 minutes before the time of the pre-dawn meal ends can he or she eat while the Adhan is going on as they are diabetic and can't fast until they take their medication and this is not on regular basis rather it's one of two either it is nighttime you can eat and drink or it is the time to break the dawn which you have to refrain from so if you are certain that they're more Advan the person calling the Adhan calls the Adhan four or five minutes before the due time if you are certain because this is something between you and Allah if you're certain then you can go ahead and eat and drink and take your medication if you're not then the more Advan is your best chance to know whether it is time to refrain or not and if he calls the van then you have to stick to his judgment because you trust him when it comes to prayer then you should trust them when it comes to refraining from eating and drinking and this there is nothing of a middle ground sleep early you can shala work walk up you can wake up on time"
