  "transcript": "sh my question is if a person performs Voodoo in the Masid and joins the conation and while praying the water droplets in the face reach the mouth and he swallows it either deliberately or accidentally does it affect the Salah where where does it fall uh it reaches the lips and maybe he swallows it either deliberately or accidentally no he should not swallow it if he does swallow it this is a form of drinking and it breaks his fasting and it breaks his Salat if he does that uh um unintentionally then there's nothing wrong in that and Allah Knows Best"
