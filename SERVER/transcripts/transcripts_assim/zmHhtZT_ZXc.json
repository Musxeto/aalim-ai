  "transcript": "okay he's saying that he was a sunni muslim and he converted into an ahmadi and he's saying that people say that ahmadis are not muslims well and he said that the the scholars of india and pakistan uh they're brainwashing the people i'm afraid that it's not the scholars of pakistan or india or saudi arabia or egypt or jordan or syria or iraq or iran or indonesia the whole of the muslim ummah consider the kadyanes the baha'is the ahmadis not to be part of the muslims you are we are not as muslim allowed to marry from you we are not allowed to eat from your slaughtering if you slaughter a sheep we can eat a sheep that was slaughtered by a christian or by the jew because they are mentioned in the quran because you have nullified your islam by uh falsifying things and claiming that it is part of the quran or if not the quran the majority of the ahmadis are non-arabs so they don't understand the quran if i tell them that 1 2 3 abc look at me is a verse of the quran nice let's rhyme and make it a song and dance to it they don't know what the quran is they have nothing to relate it to arabic so they are just following their shepherd unfortunately but anyone claiming that there is a prophet or a messenger coming after the prophet he's a kafir he's a an apostate and he's not a muslim the thing that he said that okay if jesus christ is coming at the end of time this means that there is a prophet after the prophet and this is not true jesus came before the prophet salallahu so when he descends at the end of time he would not be coming again with a new law he would not be coming again with a new religion he would not even lead the prayer when he descends because he would be wanting after the akama to lead the muslims in fajr prayer and when he sees jesus christ descending he retreats and he wants him to lead the prayer and jesus says no it was made for you the economy was made for you and you're the one who to lead and he leads jesus with the congregation and this shows you that he does not come with a new religion he's a follower of the prophet religion and that is why he breaks the cross he kills the swine and he does not anymore from the christians or the jews because he is there so this misconception unfortunately i know that i will not be able to change your mind because usually people are adamant at what they believe especially if it is something that deals with their uh arrogance so yes we took this on and even if it's wrong we're gonna keep on doing it until we die unfortunately you do not constitute one in a million of the muslim world and unfortunately you don't have the proper knowledge that arabs have from the quran from the sunnah and thirdly the issue could go on and on and it would take ages to uh probably explain okay abdul rahman i don't want to make this a debate because this is not the proper time uh we it's it's only for questions and answers but as long as the people in the control took your call yes sir 72 million six will invite towards jahannam only one will invite towards jannah true complete i can prove to you from the quran if you don't believe in a prophet not if you believe in and i'll give you the verse of the quran the most elevated of the prophet no prophet of the sharia will come after him my friend my 150 i know but the problem is with the my our uh how do we say colleagues or friends the hadith that he has quoted states that my ummah would be divided into 73 sects the prophet says all of them are in hell except one he didn't finish the the the hadith the companion said which one are they which one is it oh prophet of allah he said whoever follows what i and my companions follow and we tell those ahmadis where did you come from the prophet islam did not prophesize your coming he prophesized every single thing and he is about what is going to happen and he told us that will come after me 37 in one narration or almost 40 false prophets liars who claim to be prophets and they don't have anything and look at the miracles that these false prophets have gave us have given us nothing zero look at what they called they called their people to obey the kafir ruler who invaded their country they called the people to turn against those who abide by the quran the sunnah and to join forces with the kafir invaders who gave them uh their uh welfare he who gave them their citizenship and this is something that no muslim would accept and this was not the verdict of the wahabis they call us wahhabis not the verdict of al-azhar only not the verdict of the skull it is the consensus of all scholars of the muslim ummah you're talking about 1.6 or 1.7 billion who raise the flag and say the ahmadis the baha'is are kafir don't no matter what they do as long as they believe in their false beliefs and they do not believe in the prophet islam to be the seal of the prophet"
