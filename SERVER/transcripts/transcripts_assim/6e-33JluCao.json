  "transcript": "from india says are there any sunnah acts that if we do not do we will be sinful first of all you have to understand the terminology in order to judge things so when we say sunnah this has two meanings if you're referring to the meaning which juror uses when they use the juror uses a particular meaning for that which is if you do it you're rewarded if you don't do it you're not sinful so they're talking about the five um legislative rulings which is regarded or regarding the acts we do so we have wajib mandatory mustahab recommended permissible mubarak not recommended and we have prohibited which is muharram haram so the mustahab is also called sunnah meaning if you do it that's good if you don't do it there's no sin on you so if you're referring to this then let it be known the five daily prayers are the top of the ladder then we have the voluntary prayers witter night prayer all of these are highly recommended sunnah if i do them i'm rewarded if i don't there is no sin on me likewise makru things that are disliked if i do them i'm not sinful but if i abandon them then i am rewarded so they are in contrast so if you're asking about this then yes if you leave any act that is sunnah there is no sin on you but you will lose the reward and likewise if you if you miss praying with her or if you miss praying the rawati you're not sinful but you lose a great deal of reward"
