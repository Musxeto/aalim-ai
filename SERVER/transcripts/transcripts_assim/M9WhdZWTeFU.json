  "transcript": "Sufyan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh I am your big air conditioner. Masha Allah. May Allah Azza Wa Jal promote you to a central air conditioning In Sha Allah. Sheikh I have a question about Laylatul Qadr. We all know that Laylatul Qadr is a single night and that night is better than thousand months and that comes at the end of the Ramadan. But there is one day gap between India and Saudi Arabia. If Saudi Arabia has odd nights, India has even nights. Then how it is possible to get both countries Laylatul Qadr in a single odd night? First of all, Laylatul Qadr is not necessarily in odd nights. And this was proven by Sheikh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah. Because in some hadiths, the Prophet Sayyidina Alayhi Salatu Wasalam said, detect Laylatul Qadr for one or three or five or seven or nine nights remaining. And we don't know what's remaining until the month is over. So this means that Laylatul Qadr could be on odd number of nights, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, or it can be on even number of nights 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30 depending whether the month is 29 days or 30 days. So by this, Alhamdulillah, we have no confusion. Number two, don't worry about Laylatul Qadr because Allah the Almighty only knows it. So if you're in India or in Saudi Arabia or in Canada, as long as you're doing your level best in the last 10 nights, I guarantee you 100% that you will attain Laylatul Qadr without any doubt and Allah knows best. Alhamdulillah."
