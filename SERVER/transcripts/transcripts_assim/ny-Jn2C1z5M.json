  "title": "My brother lives with roommate, if I move there with mum she will mix with non mahram Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "after my agency exams i plan to go to the capitol to do some special classes which will help me to prepare for my university admissions exam inshallah i plan to go with my mom and stay at my brother's place but the issue is that my brother lives with his friend who is in non-maharam to my mother and also she wants one of her friends and her son to stay there with us and her son and i were both in the same raid but like his mother is not madam to me so i could do some preparation classes here or i could do that online too but those won't be as good as the one in the capital so i may fall behind in the other students so what should i do in this case this is something that you have to work around akhi meaning that if you're able to segregate yourself from the haram and be separated from it you don't free mix you don't look at non-mahrams you don't mix with them then you should do that whatever sins your mother or your brother is doing on their own you give them a reminder but you move on this is not your downfall what you care about is yourself so you have to be segregated from all sense and you can do your uh needed thing and go on your way"
