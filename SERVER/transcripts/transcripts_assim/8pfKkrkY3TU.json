  "title": "Why is it a sin to expose one's sins? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "soomi says can you kindly explain the hadith in which it's said not to expose one's sins and what is the repercussions of exposing or bragging about one's sins and what is the reason for not exposing our own sins in front of others I have heard that this is because the sins will become common in the society the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam addressed once his companions and he said and the hadith is and Asahi killuminati mawatha all of my followers of my Ummah they will they will be forgiven and he excluded except and Musa he'll one those who sin publicly so the Companions asked what is an mujahidin and the prophet alayhi salatu salam explained that it is part of a person committing a sin at night and no one is around no one knows about his sin so Allah conceals his sin and does it expose him to the public but once the day breaks this sinner goes to his friend his colleague and he says didn't you know yesterday last night I did so and so and so and he exposes what Allah has concealed this person Allah Allah will not forgive his sins and you can cascade this downwards so someone who plays music publicly in his car blasting his boosters with and loudspeakers with music an artist a singer a dancer someone who calls people publicly to sin and he joins them in that sin those people Allah will not forgive simply because they are calling others to follow their footsteps they're encouraging others to sin publicly and this is the route for destruction people by nature don't want to expose their bad side and their shortcomings there is an inner bashfulness in shyness in them so when a person normal person commits a sin between him and allah azzawajal he regrets it he feels remorseful he cries and weeps asking allah for forgiveness and he quits few days later he falls week and he commits it's again and he has the same amount of remorse and regret yet it's lesser than before and this becomes repetitive and he does it over and over again with each time losing an amount something of that sadness and regret is gone until remorse dies in his heart he goes on to stage two where he enjoys sinning he doesn't feel any regret or remorse in his heart not only that he looks forward for committing it takes him some time until he moves on to the third stage where he does this sin pobla CLE he has no bashfulness he's not embarrassed of people knowing that he commits that particular sin then he moves to the final and fourth stage and level where he actually not only does it publicly he calls people and invites people to commit such a heinous sin and this is the end of the road for him this is the route of destruction for anyone who falls into sin and follows the footsteps of Shaitan and this is why we usually tell people not to circulate through social media footage of sins being committed publicly so many times people bombard us whether one wants a poor Facebook or any of the other social media platforms they bombard us with footage clips videos of how are things being committed here and there it brings sadness or hearts not only that by seeing such footage day by day people tend to not think of it as evil and sinful they're accustomed to it and they would ask probably so when is the next concert of so-and-so randomly speaking as if it's okay well the other below this is an indication that the person's heart is totally gone and lost Ness Allah Allah fear"
