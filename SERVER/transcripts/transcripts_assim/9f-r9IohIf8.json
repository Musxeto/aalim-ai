  "transcript": "then it's okay to follow the opinion of the companions in that issue okay um got a question here from Sister Zab um she says um my question is about making Dua after prayer that's the supplication after the Salah she says some people say this supplication when you raise your hands straight after the Salah with the Imam this is something uh not not from Islam basically she with the IM after okay so the Imam is is making supplication after after okay so is this something from Isam is there evidence for this year okay a general rule mhm for every Muslim to follow and you'll feel much much comfortable when you apply this in any form of worship you are performing and that is whatever is introduced to you of worship let's say prayer supplication fasting whatever anybody introduces to you ask for the evidence from the Quran or from the Sunnah it's not the other way around it's not when I come and say this is an innovation it's not logical for a person to say give me the evidence because the prophet wasallam did not list a whole list of Innovations and you just cross uh examine them and say well this has been already uh um mentioned by the prophet Sall wasallam the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam gave us a general rule and that is whoever innovates in the religion that is not part of my teaching then this is rejected therefore anyone claiming that this is a form of worship he has to provide the evidence if he fails to do this then this is an innovation likewise the sister is ask asking about a practice that is found in a number of Islamic countries and that is after the Imam finishes or concludes his prayer he looks either at the people behind him or sometimes he as he is raises his hands after concluding the prayer and start to supplicate innovated supplications and some of it is part of the Sunnah but the prophet sallam had never done this before or after and the people praying behind him would say a mean aan a mean as he go goes on supplicating it was never reported throughout the the the the 10 years that the prophet wasam spent had spent in Medina mhm and he used to pray five prayers leading the five prayers uh leading it the congregation never ever was it reported that he had done this once neither did his four companions Abu Bakr Omar and Ali and neither any of uh uh uh the companions had ever done such a thing therefore we know we understand we can easily say without any hesitation that this is an innovation and even if someone claims and said well this is an something that is good it's good Innovation we we say that the prophet s wasallam himself told us that every Innovation is it's something that sets you astray and it it would take a person who innovates to Hellfire so he did not segregate and say well we have good Innovations and we have bad Innovations so what about the the other scenario the person actually just raises their hands by themselves after the Salah is this something which is from the Sunnah again the prophet am never did this and his companions had never done this and besides supplicating as she Islam may Allah have mercy on his soul he says that be during prayer before you conclude your prayer this is the time for supplicating and after you finish prayer this is time for Vick for remembering Allah and the evidence behind that is that the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam when he taught the companions how to to say the and how to pray and ask Allah to praise the prophet at the very end of the Salah he told them that after you finish this before you conclude your prayer before you offer the Salam you may supplicate as much as you want and you can ask Allah anything you wish so he told them and instructed them to make this uh uh period of prayer after the and before concluding the prayer to supplicate specific for supplication yes and after Salam he taught them how to make subh alhamdulillah three times reciting the ayat the verse of Kur and the last three chapters of the Quran and so on"
