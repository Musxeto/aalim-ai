  "title": "Abouth the hadith 'the Arabian peninsula can not hold two religions'",
  "transcript": "brother Haron was talking about the Hadith where the Prophet Alam said that the peninsula of the the Arabian Peninsula must not include two religions and in another Hadith the prophet saidat wasam ordered us to expel the Jews and the Christians and all that who are not Muslims in the Arabian Peninsula this these Hadith are authentic you cannot talk about whether they are acceptable or not but but you can understand them in different context and you can look at them from different angles and the most authentic opinion is that when you are able you should expel them if there is no need for them you should expel them and it's a long disputed issue among Scholars and why didn't the prophet Alam expel the people of kber for example the Jews from it and the explanation of Jaz the Arabian Peninsula is it meant the whole Arabian Peninsula which includes qar Emirates Bahrain Oman and Saudi Arabia or does it refer only to hij so basically speaking without going into a lot of details for you as a Muslim if you're able to not allow them in this is the best scenario ever but due to the fact that matters are not in your hands if you you're a CEO of a company yes you should only select Muslims and why is this considered to be discrimination not at all go to the Vatican do you see any mosques in the Vatican no likewise we're not allowed to have any churches or synagogues in the Arabian Peninsula because these lands Are Holy lands so for you as you live in the Emirates as I I believe those responsible for allowing the non-muslims in it is between them and Allah for you as a land owner or for a person who works in real estates renting selling Etc this is permissible for you to do because this goes with the laws of the country and you're not the one responsible for bringing bringing them in because if you Cascade this then you would say that I'm not allowed to sell them food I'm not allowed to take them in my cabin no one says this you don't know whether their presence there is legitimate or not because they might be doctors they might be Engineers they might be workers that this country needs it therefore I see that there is no harm in you working in a real estate office to uh work with them"
