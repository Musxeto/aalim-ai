  "transcript": "AB from Bangladesh alikum sh recently few months ago after uh there has been a food delivery app which is providing a monthly subscription plan the plan consists of discounts to many restaurants free delivery at certain price range Etc I know it's ironic that I want to purchase the plan based on discount but recently they gave me a very attract deal where I can save lots of money is this per what what is the deal what is the deal the deal is like uh they're giving a plan where if I purchase that then at some time they will give me some promos vouchers which I can use to at the checkup session they will give me a large amount of discounts every order that I make this is an issue of dispute and I'm inclin to say that this is not permissible because what the amount of money you're pay paying let's assume it is 500 TKA and with this 500 there is a possibility that you don't buy anything so it goes down the drain and there is a possibility that you will buy and Avail a huge amount of discounts of 5,000 10,000 TKA just because you remember and this is not proportional to the amount you have paid and whenever there is the risk of losing all or gaining something much more than what you've put in this is called and the majority of Scholars say that this is not permissible some say that if it's negligible and nothing of concern or or or something to be concerned about that it is permissible but I'm inclined to the first opinion and Allah Knows Best for"
