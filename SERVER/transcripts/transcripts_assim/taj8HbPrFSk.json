  "title": "How can an unmarried woman & a married woman be productive in Islam? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so how can a woman be protect productive when she's deprived of everything a woman is not deprived of everything that's a big lie and we have to stand up and say that this is a lie so a woman is either married or unmarried if she is unmarried may allah will make her married may allah sent a righteous practicing rich handsome knowledgeable kind husband to her as soon as possible but meanwhile her greatest responsibility is to take care of her parents so she is productive once she takes care of her parents and does her utmost ability to improve her society and community within what is accepted in sharia and in norms an unmarried woman can teach can preach can work in relief efforts can work in dawa providing that she does all of this away from men so she can teach her siblings her cousins her nephews and nieces her around the children around her or her woman folks the mother of the believers and all the mothers of the believers and the wives of the prophet did not teach men never had a halal in the masjid they limited the teachings and preachings to women and they managed to have a lot of women learn from them and convey this knowledge to their husbands and their mahrams etc nowadays unfortunately we see lots of women dies or scholars as they like to call them and the sister doesn't cover her face half of her arm is showing and she is addressing men and women on videos on youtube and sometimes sharing the same table and platform and stage with none men and i'm shocked when i see famous dairies sitting with a famous woman diary and they're talking about islamic issues wow that's great then what's next and they crack jokes and yeah allah is so brotherly and sisterly yeah i need masha allah masha allah what a beautiful religion hey what are you guys doing is this halal in your religion come on don't be extreme you're an old grandpa you don't understand we don't have these emotions oh ho castrated what do you mean by you don't have emotions you're a man and she's a woman and the worst thing is not that you're a man she's a woman the worst thing is that the people looking at you saying okay if so-and-so is okay with that then it's okay for me to sit with my female cousins and with my sisters-in-law and be like them and this is where dr jekyll mr hyde comes into reality a productive unmarried woman can be productive in her community i know sisters that have circles of the quran with 40 and 50 other women four or five times a week she has classes in apida exclusively for women not even recorded no one can hear it only those who attend they have classes in philip and some of them even call me i have students that i've never seen in my life they call me and for so many years i've been teaching them on the phone with strict adherence to the sharia not even how are you this is haram we we we don't do this i'm i explain she takes it and teaches it to others this is how the prophet used to do not what we see nowadays so an unmarried productive woman can do wonders providing she exclusively does this with those who are women like her as for the married woman her greatest role and job description is to take care of her her house her husband and her children and if she manages to do this alone she will get the highest levels in general imagine mother khadija how many hadiths she did she report none or maybe one or two mother khadija how many classes did she conducted to other women we don't know of any yet she is one of the four highest degree and uh levels of women of jannah she is the mistress of the women of jannah why very simple she took care of her husband and her children the prophet isaiah told us that gabriel gave her the glad tiding of a house in general made of a pearl that has no hardship and no loud noise this is what she gave the prophet in dunya whenever he came home he would not work at all and he would not hear noises and shouting and nagging and bickering at all it was a safe haven for him she raised his children four beautiful women and look at one of them who was fatima and fatima also is one of the four mistresses of jannah which shows you that if you take care of your husband and your family you'll be in their level on the day of judgment a woman who's married is not ordered to go and make jihad she's not ordered to go and uh uh in the markets and say things and do things the prophet said that if she praise her fast protects her chastity and obeys her husband she will enter the jannah from whatever gate she wants only four things we men we have so many things on our bucket list that we have to fulfill otherwise life is difficult and a married woman can do wonders in producing a generation it is the most difficult task and job we men think that you're sitting home doing nothing with the kids while i'm working and i'm suffering with my bosses and colleagues and people on the road break a cut cut on me while driving and we're shouting and fighting and the tenants not paying the rent and the landlord wants his rent people who i borrowed from are following me people are cheating me in the market you have nothing that's a big lie and a big mischievous representation of the truth i as a man cannot stay with one of my children for more than an hour or two and then i lose my sanity i cannot carry a child for more than 10 minutes and then my strong biceps get weary and tired she does this 14 hours a day but we don't seem to notice this if a woman dedicates her life to her house and children she will make a generation that would become unbeatable look what a shafi's mother did to him all great scholars of islam the sole person who brought them up islamically financed them took care of them was their mother most of them were orphans it's the mother that is the one who takes care of her children and she manages to to make them real practicing muslims or actors and singers and people of no use at all when she sits home with her children making them memorize al-fatiha teaching them the pillars of islam saying to them how to read surat al-mukh i know women who used to spend half an hour or an hour before bed every single night reciting to her children until they memorized it by her recitation they memorized ayat al-kursiy when they're three years of age you ask them what are the pillars of islam the child says at a very young age only a mother can do this and this is the most productive thing she can do in her life you"
