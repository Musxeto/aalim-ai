  "title": "What notes should I make from your Playlists so that I don't miss anything of Mandatory Knowledge?",
  "transcript": "team from Bangladesh see my question is I know what knowledge is mandatory for me and I have started gaining them seriously from your playlist but there are so many informations in the videos and I am confused what to memorize and what not so that I don't forget later on Sheikh can you please explain me regarding this issue a bit so that I can make notes from your videos properly and don't forget the knowledge later on we are all humans and we tend to forget a lot of the data that come to our way so it is only natural even if I watch a Friday sermon or a lecture though I know 95 of what is being said if not 100 if you ask me afterwards what did he say I'm I won't be able to repeat word for word maybe I'll give you the context and if you ask me a week later I would totally uh be oblivious I would I don't know I forget so the best way for a student of knowledge to try to firmly contain the knowledge he gets is writing it down so when you watch your playlist or a lecture have a pen and a paper you hear something you write it down and alhamdulillah with technology you even have an advantage by whoops I missed something you rewind it and you listen to it again and you write it down these notebooks that you write in would constitute a strong foundation for your knowledge because you can always go back to them it's your handwriting yes I remember when I wrote this down that the Sheikh said the following things which I did not write down because it remains in the back of your head and this is one of the best ways of doing it re reading it over and over again cements the knowledge in your head with the grace of Allah foreign"
