  "transcript": "friends question from Italy he said he read a Hadith in that whoever it is not permissible to fast two days in a row I personally have never heard of such a Hadith and I highly doubt the existence of this Hadith nevertheless there is a possibility and this happens a lot that the translator of the Hadith made such an error which led to your confusion and this happens a lot and this is why we always say people you have to learn Arabic if you want to understand your religion without outside interference in the sense that the prophet said in an authentic Hadith 7 are Martyrs in the cause of Allah other than a person who dies on the battlefield and he mentioned one of them to be the the the person who dies with the disease or the pandemic the plague now plague the person who dies with it is known in Arabic as mataron because the plague is the translator came to the word and understood it through another meaning of it which is a stabbed person with a knife pan so he thought that oh a person who dies while being stabbed with a knife is a martyr this is not true the Hadith is specifically talking about a person who dies by the plague so this is a mistake in Translation that may lead to someone being mugged to saying to the mother come come stab me I want to be a Shahid a martyr this is not right likewise when we come to the issue of a Hadith that a prophet Islam prohibited continuously and simultaneously fasting meaning that you must not fast continuously the whole year without a break or that you must not connect a day with another day and this is called meaning that today is Sunday Sunset comes I don't break my fast I continue to fast till Monday sunset so I joined two days in one fasting this is prohibited so maybe this is what the translator misunderstood and failed to explain to you I'm"
