  "transcript": "Dayan from the UAE. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. How are you? Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Sheikh, Jazak Allahu Khairan for the lecture. It was very beneficial. Barakallah Feek. So Sheikh, my question is regarding selling in Amazon. So there is actually a clause for advertising that says that it may charge some kind of like late payment fees or the legal maximum of the country, right? So if you're not sure if it's zero or not in a Muslim country, like what's the best thing to make? The norm is anything that includes late payment fee is haram. Even if you're sure that you're not going to pay it, it is haram because this is a riba clause that you're agreeing upon. So whether it's Amazon or any other company, you don't need to. There's no necessity. It's not like that I'm in the desert, I'm about to die due to starvation and there's only dog meat in front of me to eat in order to survive. This is not a necessity to deal with Amazon or with Google or any such company that stipulates a condition of late payment fee. So this is not permissible and Allah knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
