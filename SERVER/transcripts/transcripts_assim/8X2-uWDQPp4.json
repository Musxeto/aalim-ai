  "transcript": "second question um is regarding the N now he says I just want some clarification on actual The N he says nowadays we see people wear n very tight fitting sometimes lot of lot of styles is this part of the or does the actually have some uh some rules behind it the comes from the Arabic word word which means a whole and in the Quran Allah tells us tells the women to talk to men from Beyond a visor from Beyond a screen a hijab and hijab is a general word it's not only specifically to relate to covering the face but it's also a way of conduct a way of behavior so if a person if a lady covers from head to toe but speaks in a loud voice and in a very uh uh attractive way very feminine attractive way and she mixes up mixes with the opposite sex in the workplace and she treats them as if she's treating any other girl now this is not hij therefore nikab means to cover the face with a piece of cloth and to leave an opening for the eyes to see from having said that if a woman covers her face or wears this uh uh uh nikab on her face and she's completely covered this is what she is instructed to do if she follows fashion and she wears flashy colors and she wears tight um jackets or or skirts or whatever though she's covered on on on the outer skin but this is not considered to be hijab because one of the conditions that must be fulfilled in add dress so that it would qualify to be called an Islamic hijab is that it is not see-through and it does not uh show the limbs and and the body of a woman it should not be tight if this is followed then it is hijab"
