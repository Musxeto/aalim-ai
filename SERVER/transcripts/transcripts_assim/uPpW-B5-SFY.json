  "transcript": "so my question for today is uh during the first thing period all right if I were to have a blocked nose and I decided to use a little stick to to clear my nose blockage that is I have to administer it through my nostrils during the refrigerator will it be invalid will my first be invalidated so if a person has a blocked nose and he uses the nose stick to inhale something that may open it there is nothing wrong in this because it is not drops or any medication that enters it is only the smell or the vapor of it and this has no impact on your fasting even if you swallow and find The Taste the problem is when you have nasal drops because drops will go inside your stomach through the your nasal cavity and this would affect your fasting"
