  "transcript": "from bangladesh he says we know that the hanafi school of thought they delay the adhan of assar and in some countries even fajr so if the time of asar actually according to the three schools of thought according to the sunnah according to the uh um timetable is called at 3 30. while in the hanafi masjid they call the prayer at 4 30 about an hour late so if the time is due as a muslim can i pray at 3 30 home well if you're a female or if you are excused from praying in the masjid as a man or a child yes you can pray at 3 30 without any problem you don't have to wait for the masjid because the time is bound from allah azzawajal when it starts when it ends this was given in an authentic hadith where jibril peace be upon him taught the prophet isaiah the beginning and the end of times of prayers so you follow that you're in safe hands regardless it's a hanafi masjid or hamburi message or whatever as long as the time is due you can pray if i'm at outdoors and i see the sun is setting and it disappeared and the messenger did not call the adhan i break my fast i'll pray maghrib without waiting for the masjid because i saw it the time is due so there's no problem in that car"
