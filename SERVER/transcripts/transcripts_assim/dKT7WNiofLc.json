  "transcript": "Silverman raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen also Lovaas animo animo rahmatan lil alamin nabina muhammad nur add-in he was a beggar man today we had a Western nabeshin natty he la Medini I'm Bardo assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh and welcome to the 51st session of Islamic shock explanation book today we will talk about what is known as the idea the read it and this is maybe you well known as the waiting period and this refers to a specific period caused by divorce or by solution of the marriage whether through fuller or fatha and it also refers to the waiting period of a widow and these are the two main categories so Reda is either resulting from the death of the husband or through the dissolution and the dissolvent and the ending of a marriage there are a number of ayahs in the Quran referring to this and the hadith SAR also there to explain how this takes place but if we notice that the read the period varies it's not fixed so for a widow generally speaking and also for a woman who was divorced there it differs whether she's pregnant or not so a pregnant woman has had only de woman who is not pregnant has a different idea so let us take it step by step why is ADA obligated upon women the main reason yes to ensure that once a woman is separated from her husband whether through divorce or death that she is not pregnant because what comes after that day is her legibility to get married again and it would be a very big problem to do so while pregnant then the lineages would mix and this is Islam something that Islam totally prohibits and puts a very high barrier between the two so number one why is it mandated the answer would be clearly to ensure that the woman is not pregnant then we may come up with other excuses so one would say in the case of a widow here it is quite long four months and ten days and we know that one monthly cycle could ensure that she's not pregnant anymore so why is it this way this is something that we're not told in the Quran and the Sunnah so scholars had to improvise had to think of what might be a reasonable reason and they came up with the idea that this is to honor the deceased husband this is to show his importance in Islam to his wife and this is something that a lot of the women failed to understand the prophet alayhi salaatu wa sallam said if I were to order someone to prostrate to another I would have ordered a wife to prostrate to her husband imagine the magnitude of the role of husband in his wife's life this was this close for the Prophet to order women to prostrate to their husbands so in order to highlight this as in the hadith of um habiba may Allah be pleased with her she said that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam said it is not lawful for any one to mourn his deceased or their deceased more than three days so if my father dies if my brother dies if my son dies I can't mourn them for more than three days meaning that yes industry days I me may feel sad I would not wear perfume as a man I would not want to meet people I'd like to stay a bit depressed but for longer than three days after that but over you have to attend weddings you have to resume your normal life the Prophet said except for a woman when she mourns her husband for four months and ten days so this clearly highlights how important the husband is in the life of his wife and after his death as well and there is an idiot period for a woman who is divorced a revocable divorce as we've talked about the divorce in Islam few episode back we said that divorce is three divorces in a marriage if a man divorces his wife and he would like to revoke the divorce and we consult with her he is allowed to do this within the specific period of their end up so they're in there for a normal woman is three monthly cycles and why do we make it this long so that we would give the husband a chance to reconcile with his wife imagine if a man divorces his wife I divorce you and then ten minutes later he's sorry and I've seen this with my own eyes hundreds of times in the heat of the argument the woman says you're not a man divorced me divorced me if you're a man divorce me if you don't divorce me I'm gonna do this I'm going to do that and she nags for ten hours after that he the man is human he cannot tolerate anymore so he says okay you divorced she immediately falls into tears you don't fear Allah you divorce me after all these years and the guy says you asked for it for 10 hours and yes but you should not have divorced me and they both feel remorseful if Allah were to make this final life would be unbearable to a lot of the couples but allah azza wajal gave them a chance so the divorce took place today she is ordered to stay in her home with her husband if this is the first or the second divorce Allah says do not take them out of their houses meaning after divorce the man says sure I just divorced her how can I stay with her said well you have to stay with her the whole period of the ADA which is 3 monthly cycles but you don't have any intimacy with her she's still your wife and you are still her husband she can see you butt naked and you can do the same but no intimacy she cooks for you she sleeps on the same bed no intimacy you don't get close to her unless you want to reconcile with her any man and I mean any man within the period of 2 months if he is following the Sunnah and staying with his divorced wife in the same house sleeping on the same bed a couple of days and they will reconcile this is human nature they'll kiss and make up so Islam promotes this you do the same mistake and you divorce her later on a few years down the line the same procedures to be followed so this free monthly cycles period is for them to reconcile with one another the third divorce takes place that's it it's final and because it's final there is no point in prolonging their egg therefore three monthly cycles he's not going to be able to revoke the divorce and reconcile with her and there's no point of her staying waiting for two months or more because after with the first cycle we know for certain that she's not pregnant so she can have her freedom and leave afterwards so in general this is the general idea behind the different types of ADA now if we would like to go into it in details we find that allah says in surat al-baqara for example divorce women will Mutola art yet Erebus nabi unfortunate elisetta kuru and divorced women shall wait by themselves for three monthly cycles so this is a woman who's divorced for the first time or the second time and the man has a chance to reconcile within this period if she gets the third monthly cycle and she gets pure after six or seven days the moment she sees her purity of the third cycle that's it there are no longer husband and wife but before that within the reader period they are husband and wife with conditions that they don't have any intimacy unless they want to reconcile but if one of them dies within their eight-day period the other one inherits the living one inherits so if the husband dies immediately Herick that changes into four months and ten days and she inherits him as a wife if she dies the husband inherits his divorced wife because her ada was not over yet also Allah says and Soledad Palach and those who no longer expect menstruation among your women if you doubt then the period is three months and also for those who have no who have not menstruated and for those who are pregnant their term is until they give birth this ayah has a lot of rulings in it so the rulings as stated in the beginning the rulings are divided into two types whether the woman is pregnant or she's not pregnant let us look at if the woman is pregnant if a woman is pregnant Heather inda ends with the delivery chef's this is a lot so it can go up to nine months true and it can be few moments depending when she delivers true can you elaborate I will Allah says in surah italic and for those who are pregnant their term that is the red is until they give birth so in the case of a pregnant woman who is in her last days of pregnancy she has a fight with her husband and the husband says I divorce you that was at 5 o'clock in the afternoon five minutes later she is rushed to the hospital and she gives birth to a baby girl that was five let's say thirty five in the afternoon she can get married at five thirty six one minute later to a totally strange man her husband comes to the hospital happy that he is born that he has a daughter and he sees his wife whom he divorced half an hour earlier with another man this is what's this what's this she says meet my husband my father just gave me to him a couple of minutes ago this is outrageous how could this be well my friend you divorced your wife and had it there due to her pregnancy was to give labor to be to give birth once she gave birth and read this over in you not any longer her husband and she got married immediately afterwards same thing happened with Sameach Alice Lamia may allah be pleased with her Subbaiah as admissible mm aha Lama says that she was or she became a widow so her husband died a couple of days ago and she gave birth and men started proposing to her so it's only being a couple of days or three days from her husband's death so she was told that no you can't get married nobody can propose to you because you need to wait four months and ten days so when she went to the Prophet Isis um and complained he gave her permission to get married because her waiting period instead of being four months and ten days was overruled by the ayah which we've recited twice earlier stating that her term is over once she delivers so this is the shortest version of Edna a woman who's pregnant she goes into labor she's admitted to the delivery room while she's in the delivery room her husband gets a cart crashing dice and five ten minutes later she delivers she's a free woman she's not a widow anymore which means that though she just gave birth to a baby boy she's no longer in the waiting period because she gave birth few minutes after her husband's death however she cannot go and wash her husband corpse because he's a stranger to her now that it is over she's like any other woman if she was still pregnant she could have washed him she could have kissed him while he's dead because he's still her husband due to the fact that she gave birth the relationship is over between if she can get married the following day maybe the same day if she wants this is hypothetical but it shows you the ins and outs of the ADA let's go to scenarios were the pregnant woman's right there is for long so a man divorces his wife whether the first second or even the third time while she is in her first first month pregnancy so if it's the third and final divorce she cannot get married until she gives birth and he's not her husband any longer because the third divorce its final if it's the first or second divorce she has to remain in the house until she gives birth after eight months but no intimacy and if the husband died and she was not aware that she was pregnant he dies today four weeks later she discovers that she's not getting her period she makes the pregnancy test and the doctor tells her that she's pregnant she changes her ADA from four months and ten days till she gives birth so she has eight more months to stay in mourning not being perfumed not wearing makeup not wearing nice fancy clothes that call people to marry her not leave the house without any legitimate necessity or a reason etc all of this is part of the idea of a pregnant woman this is out of the way now if the woman is not pregnant then Herod usually speaking is three monthly cycles allah azza wajal says in the quran well mata la patrulla Talib boss wannabe who she hidden Arafat aku divorced women shall wait by themselves for three monthly cycles so this is from allah azzawajal divorce number one divorce number two what about if a woman cannot have monthly cycles this was also mentioned Allah says and those who are are those who no longer expect menstruation among your women why why don't they expect menstruation because they're over fifty five so a woman who's over usually 55 years of age she doesn't have any menses anymore so Allah says if you doubt then the appeal is three months due to the fact that she doesn't have cycles it turns into months only women who are old know Allah says and also for those who have not menstruated referring to what referring to girls who get married when they're young Oh chef are you talking about child marriage yeah I am talking about child marriage in the beginning this was normal among the Arabs and the in Islam came to say that this is something permissible nowadays laws and regulations may restrict that and this is according to the benefit and according to the judgment of the Muslim ruler so may he may delay the marriage age to a certain age according to what he thinks that is best for the community however there are women there are girls I know personally of one of my relatives who got her monthly cycle when she was just about to turn 18 she never had a monthly cycle in her life her parents were worried well is she a boy and the girl was a fine girl she was a normal female but subhanAllah she got her monthly cycle when she was like 17 just about to enter 18 so imagine if this girl got married at 15 and then got divorced what will we do we will treat her as old women who don't have monthly cycles and she would stay for three months in her waiting period so we have women who have monthly cycles three monthly cycles women who are too old or too young to have menses the waiting period is three months okay what about if it is the third divorce the monthly cycle is one or the AIDA period is one monthly cycle what about if the the judge himself dissolved the marriage or broke the marriage bond the husband is in jail doing life and he doesn't want to divorce and he doesn't want to accept hooda in this case the judge steps and enforces divorce or separation so the woman is to wait for one monthly cycle the woman applies for holer and the husband agrees she gives him the money the doubting how long she should she wait one monthly cycle this is her ada period a slave girl before being sold or once enslaved part of the Sharia is that she must observe one monthly cycle before her master is able to be intimate with her as a concubine and that if she were to be what to get pregnant would free her and make her a mother of a free boy or a free girl and that would be to her advantage and this as we have talked about a lot before was the norm in Christianity in Judaism in Buddhist everywhere in the world this was the norm when islam was revealed so there's no need to start talking negatively because this is found in the Bible this is found in the Quran so whether you accept these religions or not this is your problem but for the believers who are convinced that this is part of the religion with the fair and just conditions stated in the Quran and the Sunnah we could care less what people say yet this is not our topic for today so we spoke about when a person dies what is the waiting period of his wife of his widow four months and ten days and if she is pregnant until she gives birth and for a divorced woman normally speaking three monthly cycles and if she's pregnant until she gives birth if she does not have monthly cycles then she should wait for three months and if this was an irrevocable divorce which is a third divorce or if the marriage was broken due to her or forced separation by the judge or she was a concubine then it's only one monthly cycle and you have the evidence is in front of you where in sha Allah you will be able to understand this a little bit more further so we end up here and we go to the questions and in sha allah azzawajal hopefully with the grace of Allah on Saturday today's Thursday next Saturday two days from today we will meet you sha Allah for a whole session of answering your emails and questions with the grace of Allah so she'll be even allah subhanaw taala same time at 4:30 Mecca time so it would be for an hour and it is on Saturday with the grace of allah azza wajal so here is rashid saying a woman after taking holler has to retain the maha dowry back please enlighten just like allahu khairan weaves we talked about this in the class of holler and we said that the hadith of fatima bint pais who came i think i think it was for my face or someone else who came or actually she was someone else she is the wife of therapist who came to the Prophet s Sam and said to him I do not criticize habit in any moral conduct or religious commitment meaning that he is one of the best companions of the Prophet Isis Salam however I do not like cover after Islam meaning that she is afraid that if she continues in this marriage that she would commit kufur which is minor cover for not being able to give him his rights due to the resentment she has towards him not due to sins or to bad conduct it's simply there's no chemistry she cannot continue in this marriage so the Prophet said that is a lot to say would you give him back his dowry and his now he was a piece of land a farm so she said yes I would so the Prophet instructed habit by saying divorce her so this is hala hala is separation the sensual separation in exchange for financial compensation so the husband has to take something in return for his approval of challah and this is a condition if he does not take it then this becomes a divorce so if he says to her all right you want color I divorce you and he refuses to take any compensation this is counted as a divorce one of three but if he says ok I agree for color and I agreed to take an exchange this amount of money from your dowry this counts a scholar and the three divorces are still intact so they can get married later on without any problem now this is color once awarded and the condition which is a compensation financial position is received it's irrevocable the man cannot say are listen I changed my mind let's get back together no this is final you want to marry her you have to take the consent and approval of her father her father has to check with her whether she wants to return to him or not and then they would give a a dowry in the presence of two male witnesses so it's a it's a full new marriage unlike revocable divorce he divorces are the first time or the second time and she's still in the red the period then he comes to her cut after 3-4 weeks it says listen I reconciled with you near my wife again the woman shouts and screams no I don't want to go back to you I don't want to become your wife you can't force me the judge says yes he can you're still his wife it is his right to give divorce and it is his right to be consigned without your permission if you don't want to stay with them apply for color this is your god-given right so I hope this Rashid answers your question Sulaiman says is rudaba to accept the social distancing in congregation of this present world so basically it's only man's question is that is the issue of social distancing that we see in messages is this acceptable this is an issue of dispute among scholars there are a number of major scholars of Islam of contemporary times who looked at this present calamity you see this is not considered to be something of the past which means that it is not something that was present at the time of the Prophet and it's awesome the Companions the tab in the tablet of I mean we know that they were struck with the plague in some cities at some period of times of history yet we've never seen anyone elevating if we were to say the word or inventing let us make it a little bit softer the issue of social distancing so the scholars of contemporary times had to come up with an opinion based on their knowledge of Quran the Sunnah some of them said that as long as we can compromise prayer times by combining asserted lower Orisha to murder it when it's raining as long as we allow a worshipper to walk during his prayer to fill up a gap at the front there are a number of things that we can use to reach a compromise that is accepted by medical doctors so the doctors would say yeah this is okay to keep a gap of a metre and a half etc so some scholars say yes this is much better than boycotting the messages and closing the doors altogether other scholars said that well we made beg to differ because there was the plague at the time of the Companions and none of them abandoned the salat and we know that the plague is far worse and more dangerous than codecov in nineteen because the fatality in coffin 19 is five percent which is not that huge you're not talking about people dying like 50% of the population you're talking about 5% and this can happen due to old age chronic illnesses car accidents cancer you name it we've got it and this social distancing why is it only implemented in messages why isn't it implemented elsewhere as we see people go to the supermarket they go to the fish market they go to the gyms now hamdulillah they go to malls they traveling through airplanes and they're sitting one next to the other why is it subhanAllah when it comes to Salah the prayer you enforce this and some scholars say that no there is no real necessity in Islam to call for such social distancing insolent yes if it was the plague if it was smallpox if it was something that is fatal and really dangerous infectious to the extent that yes a lot would die then yeah maybe but some prefer to pray home rather than than to pray in this innovated fashion in the Masjid and they believe that when the Prophet says that Islam whoever eats garlic or onions must not attend our messages they said that okay if I don't want to attend such an innovative way of Prayer by default I mean more excused status than the one who ate garlic or onion so it's an issue of dispute that one is asked to look inside his own heart and come to a decision and allah azza wajal yan inshallah would accept if a person is afraid to infect others or to be infected or if a person is not comfortable with praying in such a way when he's isolated from other worshipers wearing a mask preying on his own prayer mat as if he's praying alone home doesn't feel like praying in the message so this is something that each one has to look into his his own self Allah knows best the Zeen access what about a husband's family who used all of the furniture and kitchen appliances of their daughter-in-law without her permission and husband says nothing whenever daughter-in-law goes to her parents house behind her her in-laws sleeping on her furniture using everything and taking her dowry kitchen appliances in the kitchen and when daughter-in-law and son moves to the US and whenever they both visit the father-in-law is using all the bedrooms set and they give other room for 15 days to their son and daughter-in-law so basically Zeenat is complaining of a scenario where it seems that they are living abroad in the US and they have a flat or a house of their own or maybe a suite in the family's house where before they migrated to the US her family gave her kitchen appliances furniture gifts maybe they gave her a dowry and the husband was a real man he refused to take the dowry so they changed it to her name and gave it to her so she used that in the house and when they left to the US her in-laws so that such appliances which was were used before by the whole family and she had no complains because she was living with them at the time they started or continued to use them as before and as for the suite or the bedroom or the section of the house that was theirs it they saw they thought that it was not appropriate to leave it for 3-4 years unattended and it's that they can use it when ever their second son comes with his family and he doesn't have a place in the home so she's complaining is this moral matters no however it is also unethical to have a part of their home reserved for you and your husband and your family and not to use anything without you telling them not to use it so out of courtesy usually people feel okay if people use their things especially if they were in the same house you should have told them that this is not to be used and locked the stuff in a storage room or a warehouse so that you ensure nobody uses it you could have easily sold it and benefited from it if you are so sensitive of such an issue which is not quite normal to tell you the truth because people usually are kind people are generous people take things easy they're not obsessive of their own things wanting to have it only for them and not to be shared with anyone you want this to happen this is your right don't leave your things lying around and tell people don't touch it I'll be coming after three years this is not logical maybe they are wrong and using it yes but you are also wrong in leaving your stuff behind unattended like this so if you want you can take all of your stuff when you go back next time sell it give it away as a gift burn it this is up to you but to cause tension between you and your husband over trivial things when allah has substituted you with so many greater gifts and favors and blessings this is a little bit yanny too extreme earth man says kindly elaborate on the issues of commission what is getting from being a middleman between a buyer and a seller if you are an independent person meaning that you're not working for a company involved in such a transaction so you know both parties a and B a wants to buy something B has that thing to sell and you managed to make a deal between them or to be a catalyst and making the deal come to reality so your commission is either taken from the seller or from the buyer or from both sides depending on what you agree with them as a middleman so a wants to buy it for a hundred thousand and you say to him okay I'll try to negotiate a price of a hundred thousand but you will give me 2.5% of the hundred thousand if I succeed he says done deal you go to be who wants to sell it for 95 and you tell him okay I'll sell it for 95 maybe I will manage to make it up to a hundred thousand would you give me 2.5% if I succeed in raising the price this much the guy says yeah sure thing so you arrange a meeting and they come and they sign both parties are happy you get your commission this totally kosher and legit and there's nothing wrong in that in Shaba why do I say that you don't work in a company because this would be a bribe so if you're the head of the procurement department that would be a bribe if you are the head of the sales department and somebody's giving you money to cut some of them some slack again this is a bribe and this is not permissible Serena says I try to pray regularly but I discontinue please advise how can I devote myself towards praying well like this is something that is extremely problematic Zarine the Prophet said erase Lhasa in an authentic hadith allah dhu lady banana who obey Nahum I saw that the pledge that is between us and them there is the disbelievers is salat is prayer in a narration ferment Arakawa Papa the kava whoever abandons it he has become a kafir a disbeliever and the Prophet says and I think the hadith is I am a Muslim by Nava Julie will cook free I wish silky Turkish alot between man and this belief or shirk is abandoning salat so this and among other evidences from the Quran the Sunnah called some scholars to say that whoever abandons once a lot deliberately without any justification or legitimate reason he has exited the fold of Islam and became a cafe and become a kafir and this is a serious sin to simply be a kafir among the fire dwellers Allah says in surah to MU death feb when the people of paradise look at the people of Hell massive attack on feyza ha why were you admitted to hellfire so the people of help justify this by four reasons the first of all they say our alumni common Elmo Saleem we were not among those who used to pray this is the first reason for them and telling Hellfire so this is not something to be taken lightly and you just say it casually well I am unable to discontinue I am to continue praying regularly so I leave it off and on give me advice what advice you're going to help if you continue doing this so you have to get your act up together you have to look for means and ways among the very most important means in ways is to associate yourself with righteous and practicing Muslims you have to be surrounded by righteous practicing Muslims 24 hours seven days a week they will ensure that you keep on praying on time and becoming a better Muslim may Allah guide you to the straight path Halifax says my question is there is nothing like bride-price in most of Western societies so how Muslim men can get married to them if you're getting married to another Muslim woman then this is understood that this is her right in Islam mentioned in the Quran mentioned in the authentication and every family accept this and they have no problem with that but if you're getting married to a Christian woman and maybe this is what you're referring to in this case you have to propose to her father you cannot marry her without her father proposing to you and saying I give you my daughter in marriage you may accept that marriage and you have to appoint a dowry what you call a bride prices is not to be sold this is a dowry in Mahara I saw Bob so you tell her father listen I'm giving her five thousand dollars and this is called dowry in Islam and this is her right there's no problem even if they don't know it or they're not accustomed to it Allah knows best Zaid Zubair says can a woman give in marriage her follow woman now I'm thinking well of sales bear I don't think he's meaning to marry of the same gender no this is unimaginable so I don't think he's mentioning or meaning this what I think he means is that can a woman give an act like a guardian to another woman so in many cases a mother wants to give her daughter and marriage to another man so so she says to the bride-to-be I give you my daughter in marriage and the man says I accept her marriage and the presence of two male Muslims men so is this marriage valid answer's no the Guardian can never be anyone except a male man Muslim if she's a Muslim woman but a woman can never be a guardian even if she was her mother grandmother sister neighbor even if the bride is a revered Muslim who has no relatives even her sister Muslim or a Muslim a friend cannot be her guardian this is totally out of the question and omar farooq says I'm from Bangladesh my question is do I have to pay or to pray the heat'll Masjid in a mosque where Juma salat is not prayed so what is our friends Farouk's question / øx question is regarding the issue of is the Masjid Asia or a normal machine what's the difference the scholars of FAC differentiate between a jama masjid where there is a Juma and a number of smaller messages where they never pray Fridays so some say that the smaller message you should not perform at the CAF in there because inevitably you have to leave and go to a message with a Friday to pray it and this would break your attica so both messages if you enter it you cannot sit down until you pray 2 rakaats and this is known among the jurors as the here - Masjid the greeting of the Masjid and there isn't any such thing from the prophet alayhi salatu salam stating that it should be called a thermistor any two Rakas so if you pray Sunnah tell Fechter the first time you enter the Masjid do I have to stand up and pray to hate and message no these two records of Senator Fletcher suffice and if you intend that this is also for my Torah has of woudl its offenses as well and if you intend it to be also HT Hara you can make the door of the Sahara afterwards by only praying to Records for all of these intentions but if brother Omar was referring to something else if mother Omar is referring to holes they don't have Joomla in them so can I sit down without trying to hated my dancer is yes why because a prayer hall or a prayer room is not considered islamically a Masjid if I go into a mall and I see a Masjid at prayer hall I go in and I sit down I don't pray 2 rakaats I don't have to people look at me what what are you doing go stand up and pray 2 rakats why this is because the Prophet Isis am said whenever one of you enter the Masjid he must not sit until he please two rakahs so the es when one of you enters a Masjid now think with me is this a message it and they say door gets written sorrow act masala Masjid of course the same as she said no this is a model today it's a message tomorrow the order of the message comes and says we decided to change this message it because it's a big area and we are going to transfer it somewhere else this area we would like to change it into a showroom for Montblanc you have no one to object because it is not a full-fledged Masjid unlike the message we have outside our house for example this was allocated this is a endowment to be a mass you it cannot be sold it cannot be gifted it cannot be inherited this is a message for life this is the Masjid that a woman and her message cannot enter a person in aitikaf can stay and a man cannot sit without praying two rakahs the heated machine as for the Masjid or the prayer hall or the masala in the mall or in my company or in anywhere a woman in her messes can easily enter without any problem you can enter and sit down without any problem you cannot pray a decaf in it or stay for a decaf in it because this is not a full-fledged Masjid and Allah social knows best so I think that we will stop and wrap it up here hopefully day after tomorrow that is Saturday at 4:30 we will have our session for Q&A so we have a great number of questions masha'Allah maybe three four pages the backlog but this would not inshallah prevent you from sending more questions and we will try to not elaborate on every single question as if it's a lecture rather just give a short answer to satisfy those who need an answer urgently and Allah sojanet knows best so until we meet Saturday day after tomorrow I leave Xiao Manila what ceremony kumarahoe to Allah he will bark at Oh"
