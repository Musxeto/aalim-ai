  "title": "Used to pray Fard prayers sitting down unaware that we must stand up, what to do now Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "question about something in the past he prayed sitting down and i'm assuming he's referring to farida because voluntary prayers you can pray sitting down without any problem but for followed prayers mandatory prayers you must stand up if you are capable of standing up whether you are in a car or in an airplane or riding the bus or elsewhere you have to stand up if you are unable if you are incapable of standing up up due to being in a plane or there's no place to stand up in this case yes you may sit down due to necessity so he's asking about what to do about the previous prayers which i have no recollection of how many in what were they well due to this ignorance of yours and due to the large and huge amount of prayers specifically that you don't know their count if they were like three or four or five i would have told you to make them up but you don't know them in this case what is gone is gone and allah is most forgiving most merciful"
