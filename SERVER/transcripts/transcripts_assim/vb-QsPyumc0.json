  "title": "Ruling on Iqamah and Athan for Women - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "sister Aisha from Zimbabwe says that 'what's the ruling on offering obama for every salat for fought salat for females for sisters the answer is this is not part of the sunnah a van and hama is to be performed by men and some scholars and i am inclined to this opinion recommend that if a woman is alone or in the presence of only women and they would like to pray for prayer it is permissible for them to do a comma because comma is for the prayer itself not to be announced while a van can only be done by men and even if she was in an area where no one had called a damn van she is not to do it because this would be an innovation so Obama is an issue dispute inshallah if you do it there is nothing wrong in that habit"
