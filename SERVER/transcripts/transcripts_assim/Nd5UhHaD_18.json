  "transcript": "Iman says if I cut my hand or any part of the body and it starts to bleed do I have to redo my Woodill and is it prohibited to pray with the stains of blood or pus on my clothes as these are impure it's an issue of dispute among scholars whether human blood that does not come from the private parts is considered to be pure or impure so they all agree that blood coming from the private parts is Naja's there's no difference of opinion among the majority of scholars on that they differ if I cut myself and I start to bleed some say if it's a lot then it breaks your volu and it's not just some say that whether a lot or little it does not impact your purity nor your voodoo and this is the most authentic opinion and this is the choice of a member high in his high that human blood is not nachas what his nudges is when you slaughter an animal saying bismillah Allahu Akbar and the blood gushes out the blood gushing out is not just from this animal and people in some cultures collect this blood and they cook it or they drink it this is totally prohibited in Islam and this is why the Prophet said that a sort of Salam two types of blood were made halal for us from the animal the liver and the spleen but running blood is haram human blood is holid not in the sense that to drink it that it is pure and this is why a Bihari may Allah have mercy on his soul mentioned in his hey that romanovna hot table may Allah be pleased with him when he was stabbed before he died in his in the attempt of assassinating him which succeeded unfortunately he prayed while his blood was gushing coming out from his wounds and also and Hasan al-basri as reported by lemon Buhari stated that the Muslims since the beginning of time of Islam used to pray in Jihad in their wars with their clothes filled with blood either from their wounds or from the disbelievers wounds and this did not prevent them from praying and they did not consider it to be impure and therefore blood and pus which comes out if you have a pimple and you squeeze it and it pops out this is all pure it does not impact your purity or your would look it is repulsive it doesn't look good and it's highly recommended that you wash it but if you have stains of it on your clothes your prayer is still legit and valid and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
