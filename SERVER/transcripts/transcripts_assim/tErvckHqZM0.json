  "transcript": "okay Allah a new center it is never was reported to praise Allah offer salutation upon the prophet Islam and then engage in Dua rather he says in the authentic Hadith the closest a servant of Allah is to Allah is when he is prostrating so make a lot of Dua for it is worthy of being answered and most of his duas Institute that were reported to us never mention not most let me rephrase that all of the duas reported to us in his sujood never included or had the mentioning of praising Allah and salutation upon the prophet Allah therefore we do not offer praising of Allah and salutation upon the prophet Allah Institute and we go straight to the Dua likewise in some general Dua so for example when we say foreign do I offer praising and salutation the answer is no Allah Etc I don't so prescribe duas that the prophet taught we do not offer praising of Allah and salutation upon the prophet Islam General Dua if I'm sitting on my own I would like to engage in Dua I raise my hands and praise Allah and offer salutation if I want to make Dua between I raise my hands and do the same process but otherwise in sujud no it was not prescribed upon us to praise Allah and to offer salutation upon the prophet and Allah Knows Best foreign"
