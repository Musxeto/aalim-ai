  "title": "Who are Al Mutafaihiqun & why did Prophet ﷺ‎ hate them? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so the prophet said that he does not like and those are a segment that usually when they speak they fill up their mouths with big words and expressions and even the way they talk they don't talk normally rather they speak in an exaggerated way in a way that you would abhor you don't think that this is natural it's all made up and such people usually do this to draw attention that we have knowledge that we speak especially when people speak in Arabic language and they speak in a certain fashion that is not natural this is not how they usually speak to one another but because they're giving a speech they tend to inflate themselves and this is different from perfecting your words and what you say in order to have a good impact on the listener that is totally different there's nothing wrong in that what's wrong is to show off and to try to flex your muscles through your oration and your speech where people would not feel comfortable when you do that"
