  "transcript": "peace of Allah and blessings of Allah beond mam peace of Allah and blessings of Allah Beyond a pro Beyond peace of Allah and blessings of Allah Beyond a prophet dear brothers and sisters in Islam the battle of the trench was a milestone it was was the turning point where the Prophet saidat wasam after it now we invade them and they do not invade us and Allah Asel has fulfilled that prophecy after the prophet alai wasam had dug that trench which blocks the enemy armies from penetrating the borders of Medina the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam and his companions took approximately 3 weeks to finish that trench and it was on the Northern end of Medina because the the southern end was naturally blocked so they had like trees farms and mountains blocking the armies from Marching In and this Siege of Medina took some time approximately a month and it was quite terrifying for the people of Medina it was terrifying because they did not know where it was coming to come from Allah described this blessing of his and described the error that the Muslims were in Allah says in chapter 33ah ver 9 10 and 11 oh you who have believed remember the favor of Allah upon you when armies came to attack you and we sent upon them a wind and armies of angels you did not see and ever is Allah of what you do seeing remember when they came at you from above you and From Below you and when eyes shifted in fear and hearts reached the throats and you assumed about Allah various assumptions there the Believers were tested and shaken with a severe shaking at that moment if you recall yesterday we said that the prophet Alam was ready creating positivity while he was hitting that big rock which intercepted the the companions from digging that trench and they could not do anything about it the prophet hit itam with three blows with each blow a great spark came out and he said Allah abbar Allah has given me the lands of Persia of bantia of Yemen I can see the White Castles and fortresses I can see the red palaces I can see this and that then the Hypocrites started to complain and to criticize and ridicule such a prophecy Allah tells us and remember when the Hypocrites and those in whose Hearts is disease said Allah and his messenger did not promise US except the L iion So This Is How They perceived what was going on because they were almost sure of being killed and they did not believe in the Hereafter they did not believe in the prophet and definitely they did not believe that Allah is capable of making them Victorious it's a very intimidating and frightening situation and for a whole month skirmishes were on and off but at times they had to stay at watch so that the enemies would not attack them all of a sudden which led at an incident that they delayed the Salat imagine the prophet Alat wasam was so occupied in fighting and monitoring their movement that in one authentic Hadith came to the prophet after Sunset and he said oh prophet of Allah I was so preoccupied with the army that I barely prayed Just Before Sunset the prophet saidat wasam may Allah fill their graves and their homes with fire that is the disbelievers by I did not even pray until the sun had set and then the prophet prayed Sall alai wasallam so it shows you the common feeling in Medina at the time the prayer that no one usually neglects intentionally of course but they were in a state of fear and anticipation that this had happened to the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam and those who were with him there are so many stories related to this battle the battle of the trench or however one story stands a little bit from all other stories and this story was reported by all the books of s there was a man by the name of n IB masud Al no one has heard of him most likely this man was from the tribe ofan and we know that the Army which besieged Medina was made of Banu Assad Banu the idol worshippers of qur and the tribe ofan so this man was one of that tribe and Subhan Allah the prophet was waiting for the victory of Allah but he did not know where this victory was going to come from came to the prophet when it was dark at night and embraced Islam he accepted Islam and he told the prophet Alam that no one of my people no one else on Earth knows of my Islam so instruct me command me and I shall do what I can the leader sallallah alaih Al wasallam the one who radiates positivity did not say to him there is nothing you can do he did not give him a sword and told him join the Army he knew people well and he knew how to utilize them well it is inappropriate to come to a person with abilities of a CEO and put him in quality control and at the same time it is inappropriate to bring a janitor just because he knows the owner and put him in the position of a CEO so the prophet knew how to judge character and he looked at and he said to him you are merely one person you're a man and you cannot do much to us meaning with the Army but try your level best to turn them away from us because he knew that he had high level of intellectual Powers so n sought permission from the prophet to say whatever he wants to say meaning that he was afraid of being liable in front of Allah for any lie he says so the prophet saidat his famous Hadith which means that war is based on tricking the other side fooling the other side managing to win over the other side so took this permission and he made a plot and Subhan Allah look what the effort of one person can do for the whole umah of course he is following the Quran and the sunah he's not shooting from the hip he took the permission from the prophet so he went to the Jews of Banu who collaborated withan with qur with all the other tribes and surrounded Medina were ready to attack at the right moment but the besiege took too long so he went to bani bani the Jews there knew him well because they had all the brothers the prostitution was there they usually run this up till today so all the white slavery all the uh um things that are immoral it's run by the Jews so before he embraced Islam he used to go there and spend a good time he used to party there so all the liquor all the booze all the women that he wanted and then he goes back to his tribe so when they saw him they welcomed him because he was an ally and a friend and they said offering to him the usual and he said no I come in business so they asked him what was it he said to them that I have heard information that was disturbing to me I heard that there is a possibility the tribe of gfan and qur would feel fed up after one month of besieging Medina they're spending so much money so much Manpower and without any result so they are getting impatient and there is a possibility that they will leave you andan will go to strip their people their wealth their families you on the other hand will stay here would go back to Mecca to their wealth to their families and to everything that they own while you will be stuck here with Muhammad sallallahu alaih wasallam so they thought to themselves okay then what is it that we can do gave them an advice and he said my advice to you that you take guarantees from these armies from qur and Froman so when they come to you ask them to give you 70 men of their dignitaries as guests to stay with you in your fortresses in your uh uh houses you feed them you give them drinks and they have a good time but they would be as a guarantee that they would not flee and leave them behind the Jews like the idea so he bid them farewell and went straight toan his own tribe and he was a man of Honor among his tribe so they welcomed him the leaders sat with him and all the other guys and he told them a similar story but Twisted it and he said A friend of mine came and told me that the Jews felt sorry for what they had done and for breaking their Covenant with the Muslims so they wanted to patch things up so they asked the prophet alisat wasam if it would make him happy if they were were to present him with 70 of qur dignitaries so that he could execute them and kill them and the prophet Alam gave them the green light so was telling the people ofan I'm just a person giving you advice and it's up to you so they acknowledged it thanked him and he left to qur he went to quray he met Abu sufyan har and the leaders of quray and told him that the same thing he told the following day they send their MERS to telling them that we have been here for so long and we've much it's time that we wage an attack against the Muslims so come down and let's let's prepare for war the Jews sent to them back saying that today is a Sabbath it is Saturday and we don't work in Saturday you know that and not only that we're not willing to go to battle with you until you give us guarantees that you would not flee and leave us alone and therefore we request that you send us 70 of your dignitaries to be hosted in our homes and we give them food and drink and give them a good time when the the the the people of quray and the tribe ofan heard of this they said aha this is what n was telling us about last night so they s to them no we will not send you any person to take as a hostage if you want to fight come down and let's fight Muhammad and the Muslims sallahu alaih wasallam the Jews talk talked to themselves and said ahuh this is what was telling us about yesterday so now they want to trap us and they want to leave us so they told them no we're not going to fight with you until you send us the men we requested at that time Allah asael had made their Coalition dissolved and not only that Allah the Almighty had sent to them the en the armies and the soldiers of Allah and no one knows the number of the soldiers of Allah so Allah sent against them the wind that blew their tents off and turned off their fire and uh turned over their pots they used to cook on vicious and strong wind that they could not sit and it was freezing cold so imagine them staying there camping for so long and then only to be met with such weather conditions so they decided to leave and they left and then we know of how the prophet besieged B and then the ruling of Allah descended and it was expressed by their allies who was the Ally of the Jews and after besieging them for too long they agreed to be judged and to whatever verdict s says about them so s gave the verdict of Allah that all of their men to be executed and the women and the children would be enslaved and this was the natural result for their treachery their deceit and their constant lying and breaking of covenants and Promises we remember what they did in and the prophet let them go in a year later we know what B did and they tried to personally assassinate the prophet am and the prophet forgave them and let them go now with B this is strike three you fool me once shame on me or actually you fool me once it's shame on you but if you fool me twice then it's shame on me because I allowed you to do this so that third time was the last strike and the prophet Alam had to make an example for for them and for others for breaking their treaties and Covenants with the prophet Alat wasam the moral of the story he was a single man but with the grace of Allah asael made a difference so that the whole umah of Islam was saved through his work each and every one of us can make a difference we Al we always hear from people pessimistic remarks saying that I'm just a person what can I do I cannot do anything I don't have the means I'm not a millionaire I'm not the king I'm not the president I'm not a scholar and they start pointing fingers at others so if someone tells them why don't you do this he said no look at the scholars they're not doing their job look at the rulers they're not doing their job allying with kufar look at the armies look at the police force look at this look at that I don't want to look at people I'm going to Li at you look at you what have you presented to Islam instead of whining and complaining what is your role he said no I'm just a single person what can I do we've seen what had done and there are thousands of similar stories in our history KH was was a a a one man but he managed to do things which qualified him to the medal that the prophet gave himam when he said that he's a sword of the swords of Allah so you can do wonders a bird as in theah a hoopi came back to Solomon peace be upon him the prophet of Allah and the king and he told him about siba or Sheba whatever they called him the kingdom of sa in Yemen and he was the reason and cause of the whole Kingdom to accepting Islam and he's just a bird so you have a lot of Potentials in you how to judge these potentials through the Quran and the Sunnah you can make a difference but you would make catastrophes if you act in a way against the Quran and the Sunnah you can make a difference regardless of your position if you're a teacher in a school or at a college you can make a difference by behaving like a Muslim and dealing with others in the moral conduct of Islam if you're a doctor every time you examine a patient you say bismah and when you see them again you say alhamdulillah and when you prescribe a medication you say that this is the cure with the grace of Allah who cures all illnesses if you're a lawyer and you are a lawyer in a cafir country we know that you can can notot legislate and you cannot go and Rule with man-made laws this is kufur however for you as a minority in a non-muslim country as a lawyer and as a barister you have the ability to to make a difference when the government decides to Rampage is Islamic schools and look into their syllabuses and curriculums and change them and enforce homosexuality in Muslim schools to be taught to be advocated this is your role as a lawyer to stand up and do your level best for the sake of Allah to stop this evil you can make a difference as a an Imam you can make a difference by showing the Muslims and teaching them that what these terrorists are doing has nothing to do with Islam the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam never burnt someone alive he never drowned someone alive he never killed a child he never killed a woman he never killed discriminately what you're doing is totally against his Sunnah do you know better than him or do you have a new religion as an Imam as a scholar as a d you have to stand firm and you don't have to be a scholar to stand firm against these terrorists who had tarnished the reputation of our religion what is your role on social media why are the millions of Muslims passive not commenting not joining hands and forces against these terrorists if you know of someone even if you are in the UK or in France or Germany if you know of someone who is plotting to do something evil or harmful report him even to the kufar report him because his evil is far greater than whatever you do to him so as individuals as millions and billions of Muslims we have to make a difference we have to purify our religion from these atrocities and these evil ways of of these terrorists and Fanatics who do not represent our religion and definitely who are not on the tracks of the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat wasam the prophet himself cursed them and said that they are the dogs of Hellfire so you can make a difference if you seek Allah's help the battle of the trench there were a number of Heroes we don't have the time to talk about it because this program as I said it's not a technical or an academic program this is just chitchatting this is storytelling but we learn from these stories because this is our heritage we could have talked about the heroism of aliali may Allah be pleased with him on that day it was proven that he was one of the greatest soldiers and Warriors of Islam when he singlehandedly killed AB who was one of if not the greatest Warrior of his time yet this young man managed to kill him in a duel singlehandedly so we have to look into these Beautiful Stories We have to try our level best to learn from them and Implement them in our lives you can make a difference made a difference may Allah be pleased with him when the prophet told him to go and spy and he told him do not provoke the people do not do anything that would notify them of your presence it was cold it was dark and the companions were around the Prophet Alat wasam three times he says who will go and get me information get me Intel about the people and may Allah make him with me in Jenna and nobody stood up he's saying Allah would make him with me in Jenna three times and no one stood up because they were so cold frightened and it was dark the prophet then appointed Hua and he said Huda stand up he said when he pointed me out I had no choice so he went and he brought the anel and the prophet prayed for him he said I was like in a Sona the minute I went and came back I could not feel any cold weather and no fear I had the ability to kill Abu sufyan but I remember that the prophet instructed me not to notify them or to do anything without his permission or or command all of this tells us that a single person following the Quran and sunah can make a difference and you can make a difference but you have to look into the Quran and to the Sunnah and be certain that you're following the footsteps of the Prophet Alam go back to Scholars and take their advice and wisdom and then you will inshallah be on the same footsteps of mas and the rest of the companions we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalam alaykum and welcome back the lines are open for you if you have any calls please call in if it's related to the topic then this is wonderful if not then I hope it is something related to the dean that would increase your Iman and get you closer to Allah try your level best to keep us away from politics this is not a talk show nor a political program we have a question from uh one of the brothers he says that if uh I use a faucet when waking up and make wood do I have to wash hands three times also my nose three times also can I wash hands three times and then do everything once but how about the nose first of all uh you have to wash your hands three times whether you are washing it from a faucet or you're entering your hands in the pot this is the instruction of the Prophet Alat wasam and blowing the nose washing it and blowing it three times with water because the devil has slept there over your nostrils this is part of the Sunnah if you want to do this before woodu and then make woodoo this is fine and great if you want to include this in your woodoo then this is also permissible as for the rest of the face the hands and the legs you can wash this once but the nose you have to do this three times Muhammad from the uh Emirates I wanted to know if this is true that your network has been paid by Saudi government again well give me a break my friend you want a job I'll send you a Visa and you can work here and you start loving Arabia this is not about Saudi Arabia this is about Islam if you have a question related to Islam go ahead and ask by the way one of the brothers about uh four days ago um called about a quiz show that Huda airs and it's called I think Huda quiz and he told me that there are G there is gambling and there's some s some sort of of Haram transactions and I said on the program that personally I don't know about the program but if the program is about calling and receiving a gift this is halal it's a gift from a donor it's a gift from uh a sponsor this is okay however if there are lines that you have to pay money for for instead of like half a real for a minute you pay 10 R where the Communication Company takes 20% 80% goes to the channel this is gambling it's not permissible but I did not know uh what was it uh yesterday I received a message from uh the channel may Allah bless them and they said we have cancelled all of uh paid lines and now they're only landlines which means that mashallah they acknowledged that it was a mistake done with good intention probably they did not know the reason uh uh or did not know why it was Haram so alhamdulillah it has gone inshallah and now it is totally Halal and this makes me think highly of Huda TV Huda TV does not pay me a single scent or a real or a dollar or a Euro and they I advocate this uh um blessed Channel because they try their level best to promote the of and they are a well balanced compared to other there are no women and there are no music and they try their level best maybe we all have shortcomings no one is perfect but alhamdulillah they listen I've tried this with so many channels they wouldn't listen they wouldn't adhere but these people alhamdulillah they proved to me that they are working inshallah and Allah knows them more than I do inshallah they're working for the sake of Allah and they're willing to change into the better um from Saudi Alum my question is about with prayer okay uh as in the normal days I used to pray with Salah after tud so uh now I I am attending the Tavi prayer so I have to continue according to the Imam or I can leave that one raat and continue with the tud prayer okay any more questions is that all yeah that's all Al's question we've answered it repeatedly now I'll answer it again we have a number of hadiths and we have to work with them all and not take one Hadith and neglect the others because this is the methodology of so those who innovate in Islam they would follow this practice so what are the uh ways to look into it one Hadith the prophet said make the last prayer of the night Witter Hadith number two there are no two Witter in the same night meaning you only can pray one Witter Hadith number three the prophet saidat whoever prays with the IM until he finishes meaning concludes his prayer with Witter then Allah would write to him a full night the reward of a full night so if you look at these hadiths you know that it is best for you to pray with the IM and he concludes if a person prays eight rakas with the Imam and the last Witter three Ras he leaves home he would not get the reward of a full night uh night prayer if he prays with the Imam and concludes with him the Witter and then prays later on at home this is totally permissible because the prophet used to pray with her and then used to pray two raas afterwards which means that it is not a must to make Witter the last thing you pray it's recommended but it's not a must thirdly which is an option that if you pray with the IM until he prays Witter and when he says Salam you stand up and make your Witter Sher so by this you have prayed 12 raas this entitles you to offer Witter when you go home because you've only offered one wi which is at the end of the tud however this is something though permissible I personally do not recommend why because usually if you stand up and everybody was sitting down and offering Salam Shan would come to you and say mashall everybody knows now I'm going to pray Witter and at my home when everyone else is not so this would make you a little bit boastful and inject some arrogance into your heart because of thean so therefore pray with the IM go home pray two two two as many as you wish and do not repeat the Witter we have Omar from Saudi hello I have two questions yes uh one is concerning the car MH uh we have a brother we want to give zaka because his children are going to get married but the thing is we know he's not a straightforward person and sometimes we had he drinks and choose C and all these things yeah I'm not sure about his Salah also okay is he qualified to be given zaka or not second question second question yesterday I heard from some Channel no need to to name names but uh they were saying that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam his parents are in Hellfire because they never accepted Islam but in my how many times I've had you people here saying that you and these parents died before the prophet was given to the to the to the Arabs at that time so and they gave some Hadith I'm not sure that the prophet Sall Al wasam passed through the uh the grave of his mother and he was crying I will answer you I will answer you I will answer you from bahin mean I have one question yes uh in my native place in India in this four months of Summer there is very acute shortage of water water and people have to buy water with money my question is there are so many poor people who don't can't afford to buy through money so in this case can I send this money to buy water for them from my zakat okay I will answer you inshallah had two questions the first question is that she has a brother and this brother is about to get get his children married but he cannot afford it and we know that zakat can be given to the poor and to those who are needy the poor who cannot find a thing the needy are a better off level but they can't find what is sufficient they find enough but not that which is suff sufficient so they live in a house they have a car and they have a mobile phone of course but they don't have enough money to send their children to school they don't have enough money to uh be operated upon so what's the ruling on giving them the zakat they they need to get their children married yes you can give them zakat without any problem inshallah but if that person is indulging chewing c which is an intoxicant or buying Li or doing something Haram in this case you cannot give him directly the money in his hand on the contrary you can tell him listen what is the hall you're going to hire for the wedding how much money do you need for the wedding dress or for the do you're going to pay I'll give it to you on that day so I'll pay the whole myself I'll pay for the dress myself but I would not give you money directly into your hand so that he would not abuse it and Allah knows best we have Abdullah from Saudi God bless you and may God increase you in knowledge amen I have two questions yes H number one is with regard to Friday prayers I come to the Masid and I have missed one ra how am I going to second question and then the second question is a brother of mine who is a ghanian and he drives um in a company is a driver he drive from Jah to R and then from R to Jah he spent three days in R SP three days in Judah how is he going to perform his PR years okay I will answer you inshallah uh Salman from the Emirates okay I think we lost Salman uh second question of Omar she says that she heard in a channel that the prophets parents are in hell and that this caused a confusion because she knows that Allah says in the qur so how would we combine between the two first of all the a is related to the general punishment which Allah annihilates a town or a village or a country or an umah because they did not accept the message of the messenger of that time so the people of the people of thud the the people of pharaoh Allah asael destroyed them with a punishment so this is in in to be specific secondly it is true that those who did not receive the message would not go to hell but rather would be tested on the day of judgment and they are known as however the people that Allah told us they are in hell we have to accept this and say that they are in hell because this is from Allah Asel now there is a possibility that these people of quray were not of the fatra because they had a messenger who was ibraim and then afterwards is and they were worshiping Allah and going around the Kaa and doing the rituals that Ibrahim used to do but they introduced to themselves these Idol worshipping but on the basics they were following of the ibraim religion so they had a religion but they were misguided second option would be that Allah knew that the father and the mother of the Prophet Alam would fail the test on the day of judgment so he told his messenger and both hadiths by the way are in IM Muslim the prophet Alam was asked by a man where is my father so the the prophet said your father is in hell and then the prophet wasam followed that with another statement he said your father and my father are in hell and also inth Muslim the prophet cried once and when they asked him why do you cry he said I requested Allah to seek forgiveness from my mother and Allah did not grant me the permission which means that she is not of the people of paradise and she is of the people of hell now do you think for a second that we say this and we like it or we love it we would give our own parents and our own children and wives so that the parents of the Prophet would enter Paradise for our love to our Prophet we would love to please our prophet am but this is Allah's Rule and we accept it without having anything to uh object to HUD from bahin um Salman from the Emirates yes Salman uh I have two questions shik yes the first one is regarding to zakath I just need to know how can you give us a guideline how is it calculated based on my income go or assets okay my second question is um I have this auto loan for next two years my question is can I apply for going for Hajj for this year okay I will answer you inshallah Sal thank you very much you're welcome Amin from bahin says that in India it is very difficult to get water to perform M and to wash so can I give my zakat money for buying water the answer is no buying water is a general thing now if you have poor people that you know of you can give them your zakat money and they do whatever they want they buy food they buy water to perform woodo and wash and drink from they pay their uh medical bills it's up to them but you do not buy them what they need unless there is a legitimate reason and this is a mistake that a lot of the Muslims do I have a thousand R of zakat so I go and I buy wheat oil um dates uh sugar and I go and give it to the poor this is not correct and this is not acceptable zakat I have to give them cash and they do whatever they want but if they were in a in a position that they would say listen we don't want cash can you buy us this and that and I do that for them this is uh uh permissible inshallah we have uh om sua from Tanzania uh actually I have two questions the first one is if I buy dollars then I sell when the selling price goes up the extra which I get is that terrible okay and my second question is is it the correct way to recite bmah at every or last whenever I start uh reciting in the morning or in the afternoon or in the evening okay I will answer you inshallah thank you so much you're welcome Abdullah from Saudi Arabia says that if a person misses one raak of J how would he make this up very easy it's like missing the of so once the IM gives Salam you stand up and you pray a full and you make your T and you offer your Salam the problem is not in missing one ra the problem is missing two raas so for example if I enter the Masjid and the IM is in the of the second second and he says and then I joined himar I've missed two so when he offer Salam I have to pray four R and these are the four Ras of but if you miss one ra then you can bring bring and pray another another raak and your J is valid his brother is a driver and he works for a company he drives from uh jeda to Riyad and stays three days in ryad and comes back as long as his base is in jida the minute he leaves the borders of jida which is for example so if he leaves R heading to mecah and then to T and then to riy the minute he leaves the borders of jeda he starts to shorten and combine his prayers whenever is uh necessary until he comes back whether he stays there for 3 Days whether he stays there for a week whether he stays there for two weeks as long as he is considered to be a traveler he may do that without any problem and likewise with fasting he can break his fasting if he wishes uh we have Amina from Saudi hello Alum Raise Your Voice Amina please yeahum sh yeah I have one question yes this is regarding my housing loan I bought a house and uh it is using a bank and it is about 5.5% that uh I believe is interest and I'm already bought the house for about 10 years and I have another like 10 15 years to pay off so uh it is a rebar if it is a rebar what shall I do uh I can't sell the house because this is my house and what should I do now is this uh interest based loan it is a bank loan bank loan okay I will answer you inshallah thank you Salman from the Emirates asked a very generic question okay we have Abdullah from Saud uh I have two questions yes sir yes my first question is uh what the ruling on women that plug their eyebrow okay the second question is uh if I borrow a money from Haram source and I do my business with it so did my money to become Haram or is halal for me can you explain what do you mean by borrowed your money from Haram sources yeah well uh I I borrow a uh a money from Yeah Yeah from somebody that I know I'm not too sure about the money if is Haram or Halal okay but I needed money so bad to establish my business with it and there's no any other way that I will get the money accept that place it's not interest based no it's not okay I will answer inallah okay thank you you're welcome we have four minutes and I don't know if we are able to answer the questions but I will try my level best Salman from the Emirates says that uh what what is zakat zakat is due on four items one gold silver or cash item two cattles meaning camels cows and sheep item three grains that are planted including dates and raisin so any type of grain that can be stored and that is weighed by size not by weight then this is a zable and lastly and fourthly anything that is made as a commodity to be sold and bought so the zakat is due when these four things reach a threshold known as nisab there is a particular number of or a particular weight or a particular level if it below that there is no zakat if it reaches it or more than the zakat is on the whole total and they differ from one to the other the zakat usually is 2.5 over gold silver or cash or over uh things that are made to be sold but the percentage differs when it is for cattle or for Animals because there's a specific number a table for that and also it differs when it is for uh crops or things that are grown up uh from the the uh uh from the land and they might be 5% if we do the irrigation or 10% if the irrigation comes from streams and rivers Etc this is in a nut shell you can get more explanation if you uh uh send your question specifically on on a specific thing uh to my website uh the the loan of a car if you have a loan for your car for two years and you want to go for Hajj if the installments are being paid periodically monthly without any effect if you go on Hajj then there's no problem that you can go to Hajj um Su from Tanzania she says what is the ruling on buying dollars and then waiting until the price goes up and sell it is this r no this is halal providing that when you buy you exchange the dollars and you give your own money simultaneously on the same spot so this is a th000 uh R give me $285 in exchange on the spot if he says okay come after 1 hour this is riba if he says okay keep it with me this is riba you cannot buy something without cashing it in and holding it with your own hands and then you can put it in your bank account Etc so if you do this and you leave it for 6 seven months and then you sell it this is totally permissible uh what is the ruling on saying when I recite the last three chapters of the Quran during the morning AAR or during R Etc this is part of the Sunnah if you don't recite it it's okay because it is not part of the Surah the Surah itself is is not part of it it's a divider between suras to inaugurate and to uh begin such a Surah but it is not part of it Amina from Saudi Arabia she says that she has a house uh bought a house on mortgage 10 years ago and she has to to pay another 15 years uh more so is this riba this is her house what can she do this is definitely riba but the issue here is in my opinion don't ask me ask Scholars but in my opinion there are two scenarios scenario one that when I bought the house the price was fixed so I bought it for a million do not an extra Cent more of course this includes the riba so I signed on only paying a million dollars and I've been paying that since 10 years and I have another 15 years in this case keep the house because the the harm has been already done if you pay it now if you sell the house again you have to pay the $1 million balance but the second scenario is the dubious one which I have my doubts and this is what I recommend if you signed the contract that it's a million dollar but it can go up according to uh inflation rates and the interest rates of the central bank so I signed for a million dollars but after 10 years now the end price is 12 uh million2 200,000 and next year maybe it increases why because it keeps on piling up in this case the riba is reoccurring and to my point of view that this is continuous involvement in riba the harm is not done it's being redone over and over again and I see that you have to sell the house or uh uh arrange to get a loan uh that is not interest base to pay off the rest with the grace of Allah we have uh two questions of Abdullah but my control room say that we have run out of time so I'll try to answer them first thing tomorrow inshallah and until then and blessings of Allah Beyond mam peace of Allah and blessings of Allah Beyond a prophet Beyond"
