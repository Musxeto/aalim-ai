  "transcript": "an IM in Aid immediately turns to the followers after the Friday prayer and reads the first five aat ofah bak and three then makes a silent Dua I'm not sure if this is an innovation so should we recite thear as prescribed by the Sunnah or listen to the IM while he reads the Quran was this ever done by the prophet Alat wasam yes or no Muhammad I'm I'm no it wasn't done as far as my knowledge goes okay so if it wasn't done by the prophet Alam or by any of his companions then definitely this Imam is deviant and committing an innovation definitely you have you must not follow him or wait for him or pay any attention to what he's doing because he's innovating in Islam"
