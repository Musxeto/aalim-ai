  "transcript": "some people come and tell me Quran says like there's no compulsion religion so why you have to do dawa again they're quoting out of context what they're quoting in the verse of the Quran of Bak chapter number 2 verse number 256 which does say there's no compulsion religion but they put a full stop and there's no full stop the verse continues there is no compulsion religion truth stands out clear from error and whoever has rejected the evil one has held the hand of Allah subhana wa ta'ala which is the strongest and the best that means there is no compulsion religion but through stands not clear from error you have to reject the evil and come to the truth of Allah you cannot force anyone at the point of the sword a point of the gun and ask him to accept Islam that's not allowed in Islam but you have to convey the message convey the message if they don't accept then you can say that doesn't mean they don't convey and say there are some Muslims who come and tell me brother Zak we first want to make the Muslims more practicing Muslims we want to make musl p musl you want to make Muslim more practicing Muslim after that we will talk to to the non-muslim that time will never come you cannot say to make all the Muslims 100% practicing Muslim and then I'll do dawa that's not what a prophet taught when you beat a Muslim if you have mistakes you correct him that's called ISL when you a non-muslim you da in the in the F pilgrimage in The Talk theba The Prophet asked the people did I deliver the message to you to the sahabas there were 124,000 sahabas and all of them said yes B you have delivered the message then he said all those who are present here deliver the message to those who are not present here and more than 80% of the sa B outside Arabia doing what making musl Pak musl they went to do dawa outside Arabia to deliver the message to the non-muslims it's the duty of every Muslim that he conveys the message to the non-muslim when he meets the Muslim and he finds some mistake okay do Islam correct him but when you be a non-muslim you do da which is more important Suppose there are two patient who come to a doctor one patient has a common cold the other had a heart attack who should he treat first the patient with the common cold or for a patient with a heart attack heart attack correct similarly when there are two people one is a Muslim and one is a non-muslim the Muslim will go to jna even if he's not fully practicing but the non-muslim will go to Jah first you have to geter to the non-muslim therefore in the question answer session we first give opportunity for the non-muslim to ask question first treat the patient with heart attack the person with common gold will not die but if you don't treat the patient with heart attack you die the first if you have to do both dawa and Islam speak to the Muslim and non-muslim both but if your time is limited first you speak to the non-muslim when we go to non-muslim and when we talk to them they see you Muslims you Muslims not following Islam therefore we cannot talk to non-muslim I said this is nonsense I don't agree with them do you know today the Christian Miss there are hundreds of thousands of Christian Muslim throughout the world they're knocking at the doors of the Muslim and do you know most of them they drink alcohol do you drink alcohol they drink alcohol who's better you are they we are better many of them do adultery do you do adultery no who is better you are them we are better with all the drawbacks drinking alcohol doing adultery doing flirting yet they are converting thousands of people to Christianity why are you afraid you only giving excuse for not doing the job you know why doing da to a non-muslim is more difficult to a Muslim even if he doesn't like it he won't retaliate the non-muslim retaliate so you want the easy way out only giving excuses"
