  "transcript": "Hamza from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, a lot of times when I make du'a, I get an example, if I ask Allah for good health, I get these thoughts saying that, oh may Allah make me have bad health, so this kind of makes me worried about my attention, if I'm like, I don't want like a bad du'a, so is it true that as long as I don't say the bad du'a, it won't be accepted? Akhi, if you're thinking negatively of Allah, this by itself is sinful. Allah says, I am as My servant thinks of Me, so if you think of Allah badly, or that some ignorants do, they say, tomorrow I have an interview, but I will not ask Allah Azza Wa Jal to make me pass the interview and get the job, why? They say, every time I ask Allah to do something for me, the opposite happens, so I'm not going to ask Allah. This is close to being kufr, because you are accusing Allah of doing the opposite of what you ask Him to do, and hence you're not willing to ask Him. A'udhu Billah. Who do you think you're dealing with? So, you my friend, have to fix this loose bolt in your head, when you say that, oh negative things happen, if I ask Allah to this, to have good health, I will have bad health, these are all whispers from shaytan. There's no one in this universe who could help you other than Allah. There's no one who could give you good health other than Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. If he wills it, you will have it. No one can force Allah Azza Wa Jal to give you good health or bad health, so think of Him as your Lord and not as a peer or a companion or any of this unbefitting things of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala, and always think positively of Him."
