  "transcript": "someone told him he should mention the beautiful names of Allah after prayer and this is wrong this is an innovation the Sunnah is to say three times a stop immediately after saying assalamu alaikum as-salaam alaikum o allah the prophet used to say immediately a stone fear Allah a stuff-your-stuff Allah Allah and to Salaam Amica Salam Tabarrok tell Ghirardelli chram then he turns and face the congregation this is a Sunnah what people do immediately after Salam by saying Allahu Akbar and then they say a start for Allah this is also wrong I've seen this in India a lot of the brothers there raised their voices with takbir and this is against the Sunnah and they caught a hadith ever been a batch that we used to know the end of the prayer by takbir in the Masjid and this is not referring to the immediate end of the prayer this is in in reference to subhanAllah hamdu lillah wal Allahu Akbar when you do that 33 times and they called all of this as takbir though it is the meed and at SB but they use one name for all so what your so-called scholar said is an innovation is strong his fourth question was about saying seven times Allah a journeyman anar he said after Isha and what is circulating among the people is in the morning in the evening which is after fajar and after a Muslim and the hadith itself is week saying it seven times is not authentic the authentic hadith is whoever seeks refuge in Allah from Hellfire three times Hellfire would say o Allah protect him from me and in this hadith likewise in Jenna Allah - a local Jenna three times I asked you Jenna this is what Jenna would say or Allah grant him admission to Jenna but also this hadith saying three times three times is not related to the morning and evening a scar it is indefinite so you can say it whenever you want however you want"
