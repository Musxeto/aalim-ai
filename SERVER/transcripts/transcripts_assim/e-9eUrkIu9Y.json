  "title": "Short Istikhara Dua for Quick Decisions Authentic? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Finally, Salman says, there is a short istikhara du'a, which says, Allahumma akhtarli wa khirli or khirli wa akhtarli, for making quick decisions in Sunan al-Tirmidhi. Is this authentic? I believe it is, or I believe in this because it has a good meaning. This is a du'a, and such du'as, if you want to do them regularly without believing that this is a confirmed sunnah, there's no problem in that. If we go to the scholars of hadith who graded this hadith, we will find that it is a weak hadith. If I recall correctly, Sheikh al-Albani and others graded it as weak. And the authentic hadith is the one where you have to pray two rak'ahs and then you say, Allahumma astakheeruka bi ilmika wa astakdeeruka bi qudratika wa asaluka min fadlika al-'azeem, the long du'a which you all know insha'Allah Azza Wa Jal. This is a confirmed sunnah. As for Allahumma khirli wa akhtarli, this is not an authentic hadith. Is there any problem in saying this in sujood or between adhan and niqamah because it's a beautiful du'a? There's no problem in saying it as a du'a, but not to believe in it as a hadith. And Allah knows best."
