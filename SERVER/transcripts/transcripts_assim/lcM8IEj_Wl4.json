  "transcript": "today we are going to talk about a major sin in islam that has a prescribed punishment to it and this is the sin of stealing or known as theft and the definition of theft varies from one school to the other so the definition we have in the book is to take something belonging to another person stealthly from where similar things are normally kept subject to certain conditions so this is one of the definitions to take something and this is not accurate because it should be to take wealth something of value and stealthy is a correct description because if it was done publicly as we will get to know inshallah and talk about that would not be considered to be stealing so when we talk for example about the definition in the hambury it says that stealing what is considered of value stealthily from the owner or who he deputizes and again this definition is not fulfilling the conditions though it is or it would be very long to take at uh to take a definition that would mean explaining rather than defining so when we talk about stealing it is prohibited in the quran it is prohibited in the sunnah and the consensus of muslims that it is a major sin allah says in the quran as for the thief male and female amputate their hands in recompense for what they committed as a deterrent or a punishment from allah and allah is exalted in might and wise also the prophet alaihis was in his lifetime amputated the hand of a woman known to be she's from the reputable and honorable tribe of bani mahzum and we all know that because of her tribe many people tried to intercede so that the prophet haslam would not implement such a punishment and they sent us aid whom was known to be the love of the prophet islam and the son of his love what is this it has nothing to do with what people may think because in the west when you say to another man i love you they take it negatively in a homosexual way and they say don't say that say i like you and as as muslims we don't have this nonsense we don't have with the grace of allah homosexuality or lgbt all of these things are prohibited in islam and the concept of love is a great concept in islam the prophet salallahu salaam told us about the virtues of loving your brother for the sake of allah and that among the seven who will be shaded in the shade of allah on the day of judgment where there is no shade other than his are two who met and loved one another for the sake of allah and departed on that and the prophet told us whenever you love someone tell them so if i find a brother whom is practicing in a good muslim and i love him for the sake of allah the sunnah is to go and notify him as the hadith of the prophet islam clearly states so this kind of love is a love that is endorsed in islam osama bin his father was he was a slave given to khadijah the mother of the believers the wife of the prophet by her nephew whom in turn she gave zade as a gift to the prophet the prophet loved zaid as a son so he freed him and he was announced to be zaid ibn muhammad and in the beginning adoption was permitted in islam and then allah azza revealed in verse 33 in in chapter 33 sword al-azab that adoption is prohibited so he kept zade with him as a freed slave he was a free man but he loved him as a son when zaid married zainab bin jash the honorable qurayshi woman who happens to be the cousin of the prophetess islam according to the advice of the prophet who i thought some adviser to accept him she could not live with him a peaceful marriage due to the fact that he was afraid slave and she was a woman from the dignitaries of quresh after a while he divorced her and then the prophet salaam chose for him a very old abyssinian woman by the name of um amen who was way older than him yet he found peace and love with her and she gave him shockingly his son usama nosade was white and usama was black and the prophet alaihi salsam loved busama like he loved al-hasan and hussain his own grandchildren so going back to our original story they that is the tribe of bani mahzum sent us to ask the prophet for leniency towards this woman who stole money and the prophet ordered her hand to be cut off when usama came to the prophet assam and talked to him about it the prophet was very angry and he made a statement for history he said by allah what destroyed the nations before you was that whenever an honorable man stole they let him go and whenever a poor person stole they implemented the prescribed punishment by allah if fatima the daughter of muhammad where to steal i would have amputated her hand as well and since then this was a benchmark for all muslims that the prescribed punishment once it reaches the imam the muslim ruler it has to be carried out there's no clemency or leniency in that because this is the rule of allah there are a number of conditions that must be fulfilled and these conditions are almost agreed upon scholars first of all the money must be taken stealthily which means that if a person takes money in broad daylight by force then we don't amputate this is wrong this is stealing but it does not fulfill the conditions that would make us implement the prescribed punishment and amputate the hand so it has to be done stealthily if a person takes goods from another person in broad daylight in front of everyone he could call others to protect him he could call the police but the problem is when it's done in secrecy and no one knows about it in the darkness of the night this is difficult to detect and most likely it would be go it would go unnoticed and this would cause a lot of hardship for the muslims for the community for the individuals who lose their property without being able to protect it the second condition is that the stolen property should be something of worth and in arabic they describe this to be mal mal means money but what does it mean to be something of worth meaning that if someone breaks into a house and steals only a box of cuban cigars or a bottle of 1986 wine some say whoa that's of great value it costs like three five hundred dollars whatever we say that this is not honorable wealth halal wealth if a person steals a guitar or some drugs these things are not halal to be sold they are not considered to be honor honored wealth so there is no amputation for that it's a crime it's a sin you'll be punished but not through the prescribed punishment and the third condition is that the value of the honored wealth must reach the threshold sheikh i thought that the nisab or the threshold was only for zakat this is one of the thresholds yes but the prophet allah also mentioned to us that there is no amputation for someone who steals something less than a quarter of a dinar in what is a quarter of a dinar a quarter of a dinar it is a quarter of myth al and this is means of measurement in the islamic and equals to 4 grams 0.25 of gold of pure 24 karat gold therefore a quarter of a methane which is a quarter of a dinar which is a threshold is one gram and a quarter of a quarter of a gram which it means one over sixteenth of a gram you do the math so if someone steals for example something that is worth a hundred reals no there is no amputation in here it's a sin it's a crime he's gonna be punished through a different ways but not through amputation it has to reach the value of one gram of gold and one over sixteenth gram of gold this is a threshold the fourth condition is that it has to be stolen from a place where it had been put away or secured and this is known in arabic as and what is his everything is protected in a specific place you do not keep your money your cash in a barn you do not keep your cattle your sheep in a bank you do not keep your jewelry in a glass box in the middle of the street so a proper place is known to everybody you keep cash in a special drawer and lock it you keep jewelry in a vault or a safe or a chest and lock it you keep cattle in a barn or in a special area where it's locked so that no wolves could come in and no thieves could barge in etc therefore if i see a rolex watch in a glass box in front of a shop at 11 o'clock at night and i open the box and i take the watch and i run if i'm caught red-handed they cannot amputate my hand because this was not preserved and kept in a special place where such valuable things are usually kept but if i were to break into a shop and break a vault or a draw a drawer that usually they keep keep such valuables in then that would be stealing and number five the theft itself has to be proven like every other crime so either a confession from the thief or two male witnesses testified that he had stolen the items and number six the person from whom the property was stolen has to ask for it back so i cannot be more roman than the pope i cannot be more roman than the romans and that can't be more catholic than the pope which means that if someone stole my salary from the drawer inside of a chest in my house with all these conditions it was stealthily done he stole halal money from a well-preserved place for saving it and it is above the threshold and he confessed of it however i didn't report him to the police somebody else did and the police caught the man tried him convicted him and they want to amputate his hand no deal i didn't complain i didn't file a complaint why are you doing this it's none of your business i could have forgiven him i and this is why in a narration that one of the companion i think he was sufficient was sleeping in the kaaba in around the kaaba area in the in the haram and was using his cloak which was quite expensive as a pillow someone came and stole it so he caught him and he took him to the prophet and the prophet ordered his hand to be amputated when suffering so that the man's limb would be taken away he said oh okay prophet no problem i give him the cloak and the prophet said assalam too late you should have pardoned him before it reached the authorities once it reaches the muslim ruler it's a done deal it's over it has to be carried out so this is similar if a person does not file a complaint then there is no case in addition to these six conditions there are other conditions for example the thief has to be an adult because if it's it's a child we don't amputate he has to be seen because if he was crazy or insane or mentally challenged as they called him then there is no amputation no prescribed punishment and so on stealing has to be from someone whose wealth is protected such as a muslim such as evin me and we spoke about these terminologies before ahead or mustafa but if someone stole from a herbie and if you remember ahabi is a person who we are at war with so if a muslim steals from an israeli jew who are occupying free muslim palestine unjustly and unfairly backed by all the tyrants in the west who claims to be democratic so stealing from such enemies of islam is ok because we don't have any peace agreement with them any treaties with them they are still classified as enemies of islam and the muslims and finally one of the conditions which were not mentioned here that the person who was robbed has no relationship with the thief so that there can be something dubious what does this mean if i steal from my father's wallet and i'm caught red-handed no one can amputate my hand if my father steals from my money stealthy with the conditions this is not one of the conditions that permit the law to amputate his hand because there is what is known as shubha what is shubha there is a slight reason for a person to take a money and would not be considered stealing a woman takes from her husband's wealth without him knowing in the same fashion of stealing this is shubha they say they there isn't any amputation uh in this case and allah azzawajal knows best there are reasons um and why does islam uh it's a good paragraph to read islam respects the rights of people to own their property and forbids any aggression against this right whether it is by theft embezzlement cheating bribery betrayal of trust or any other way of unlawfully taking other people's property a thief is a bad element in society and if he is unpunished his evil may spread and cause very serious consequences therefore islam prescribes this punishment so that it serves as a deterrent to others stopping them from committing this crime and to ensure the protection of the of people's property and rights it should be noted that such a punishment is only carried out for stealing stealthily as mentioned above in the conditions which means that if people steal through embezzlement if i'm a ceo and i put my hands on some of the assets of the company or i accept bribes or i take money from a contract awarded by the government as a middleman as a government official all of these are hideous crimes it might exceed the threshold of theft by millions and millions yet the prescribed punishment of amputating the hand does not apply because the conditions do not apply to that and allah azza knows best now we move on to another form of prescribed punishment which is actually not prescribed but the permission was there and it's called a tazir the discretionary punishment is according to the discretion of the ruler and it is identified or defined as punishment for any act of disobedience to allah which does not carry a mandatory punishment or require a particular recompense now we understand why every time we speak about a major sin such as fornication such as consuming intoxicants such as slandering and such as theft we say that there are conditions to be fulfilled so what happens if the conditions were not fulfilled in this case we if we we refer to atazir and this is a subject to the muslim rulers discretion give example i'll give you a fresh example if someone stole stealthily from a properly honored wealth without any shubha without any doubt he was adult he was saying etc but the amount he stole was worth half a dinar which means that it's not the required amount well actually it's not it's above it was less than quarter of a dinar so someone sold something worth 50 reals and the dinar or or or the less it should be something of um more than that so the dinar is four grams and a quarter the threshold of stealing is quarter of a dinar which means one gram and one over 16 gram of gold someone steals something worth 50 reals 100 reals because 1 gram is maybe 200 reals we take him to the muslim judge the muslim judge says there is no prescribed punishment of amputating his hand but due to the fact that he did a crime he did this something that was sinful we will punish him with tazir and this is this the sin that is falling short from a sin that requires a prescribed punishment it fell short from it if we caught a man red-handed with a woman who was in an mahram not his with his wife in a room for a whole day and then we caught them or they were both nude and sleeping together in the same bed but we did not see the actual thing that allows us to implement the major punishment of fornication or adultery in this case it is for the discretion of the judge to prescribe a punishment also other sins that may not be included in such since such as delaying the payment of a debt i gave someone money and he is postponing paying it back though he is wealthy though he has the ability but he doesn't want to pay back the prophet said delaying the repayment of a debt by a person able to repay it is an act of injustice that allows his punishment so we can punish him so a tazir is left to the discretion of the ruler and originally tazir means to prevent so this punishment is made to deter and to prevent and to reprimand someone for doing something which she had done why do we say it is prescribed and not prescribed see fornication 100 lashes prescribed slandering 80 lashes adultery stoning to death stealing amputation of the hand all of these are prescribed but when it comes to tazir it's up to the discretion of the muslim ruler and this differs from one place to the other as it says here at the end it can be physical punishment like flogging or sometimes death so in saudi arabia for example those convicted of dealing in drugs due to the size of their evil when someone consumes drugs is different to someone who deals it on a large scale so the major scholars committee said that such a heinous crime requires a severe punishment of the death penalty and this is to deter people from smuggling and dealing drugs and i think this is implemented in so many muslim countries such as malaysia where they have an indonesia maybe where they have the death penalty for anyone smuggling drugs to the country so this can be physical it can be related to property so confiscating someone's property for breaking the law for destroying other people's properties or tools and if he does this in this case he has to be reprimanded in the same fashion or more when mother is pleased with her broke the plate that contained food out of anger when the maid brought it from the house of safiyyah the prophet compensated safia may allah be pleased with her and with ayesha by taking one of aisha's own plates in exchange for what she had broken so this is no a form of tazir it can be a combination of physical and financial punishment it can be through imprisonment it can be through exiling people sending them out of the country it can be moral punishment by publicly rebuking him and announcing to the people that he did this or that so tazir is not a one size glove that fits all it depends on the time it depends on the place some people would be reprimanded when you simply rebuke him in front of his own people and that would be much much more difficult to him than being flogged 10 lashes or taking a portion of his money some people would be kicked out of his job and terminated some people would be taking some of his money and wealth some people you may need to incarcerate them put them in jail for some time so this is all part of the islamic punishment system and it falls under the jurisdiction of the muslim imam who according to his discretion knows how to deal and to choose the right and appropriate uh opinion of all it's an issue of dispute whether it can be more this this type of a punishment more than 10 lashes or must not uh um exceed 10 lashes and this is something that is an issue of dispute and it's for the muslim ruler to implement what he thinks best so with this we conclude our uh class for today inshallah and we have a lot of questions [Music] we have abnorah she says i would like to ask if is allowed to use makeup in wedding ceremony and the one who makes it is from the opposite gender is it okay or not any interaction between the opposite genders is totally prohibited it's totally prohibited unless there is a necessity that allows it such as in the case of a muslim doctor so if it is a muslim doctor and who we are unable to find a female doctor to take his place and we have a necessity there's no problem in consulting one but if it is for something of no necessity at all such such as a hairdresser or a makeup artist or a tailor to take measurements and prepare my wedding dress she says in this case any interaction is totally prohibited and sinful and the sin would be more if the wedding ceremony is freely mixed which means that not only this makeup artist would see you but also your in-laws your cousins the guests ghasts and this is darkness upon darkness may allah azzawajal save us all from such fitna yusuf says do i have to say ikama while i read salat at home alone first of all it is mandatory upon a man to pray in the masjid if the masjid is adjacent and there are no legitimate excuses or reasons to prevent him from doing that secondly all those praying alone or at home or with other small congregations it is highly recommended for them to call the ikarma and if you notice that calling the akama adds a lot of value to your prayer because it will not be like any volunteer prayer you just say hello but then do your actions and leave no you are preparing for it with a proper call for the salat and then you are ready to make the inauguration of the salah and you say the process itself increases in your so it's highly recommended but it is is it mandatory the answer is no it's not mandatory and your prayer is valid in sha allah asima says can i choose not to take anything from my parents property i'm presuming asima that this is inherited and the sunnah is when you inherit money from your parents or from your relatives after they die the sunnah is to accept it to take it to possess it and afterwards you can do with it whatever you wish so you cannot give it before acquiring it a friend says to me sheikh i heard you're getting married today so i'm giving you a new mobile phone as a gift five minutes later a brother comes and i say listen i'm giving you my mobile phone once i get it such a gift is not permissible i did not receive the gift i did not possess it how can i give something that i do not possess as a an heir for the deceased how can you not receive the property and say i'm giving it to my brothers i'm giving it to my sisters when you did not receive it no receive your share not necessarily physically but by saying that okay sis you have a a quarter i have a quarter as your sister and our brother has half of the property okay ready ready now this is your division this is your share after knowing my share and receiving it or at least acknowledging it then i say to my sister listen sister i don't need my quarter i have a lot of money i give my share to you so you have half and my brother has half this is permissible but is it recommended or not it can be recommended and sometimes it may not be the best thing to do especially when they are well off themselves you can take the money uh and give it to poor people who are in real dire need does a muslim matron divorced woman need her wali permission needs her guardian permission and this question is from does she need her guardian's permission for marriage the answer is yes the prophet when he said in an authentic hadith there is no marriage valid without the consent of a guardian and the presence of two male witnesses this was for all types of women and girls so no marriage is valid without such a consent allah azza knows best farah abdullah says if one has doubt between two opinions then which one should he follow the majority or the safe one well neither one again we reiterate this issue again and again you are either a student of knowledge or you're a layman if you are a student of knowledge and you are capable of tracing back a particular opinion to its evidences from the quran and from the sunnah and scrutinizing these evidences and weighing which is more authentic than the other to come up with a conclusion then yes this is a role that you must take and assume and you must follow the procedure whenever studying different evidences from different opinions but if you are a layman and you simply don't know the difference between a quran verse and a hadith from the sunnah you don't speak arabic you have zero knowledge of issues for you it is not an issue of following the majority or following the safest opinion because these are not means of determining what is right and what is wrong for you you should be accepting and taking one particular scholar who you believe to be knowledgeable to be righteous to be practicing and to be walking the talk such a scholar would be your imam and due to your deficiency and inability in knowing what is right and what is wrong he would be the person leading you throughout darkness and he would be responsible on the day of judgment to answer for whatever choices you made after following his advice ahmed fahem says what do you say regarding missile marriage missile marriage is something is a description that was given recently maybe in the past 20 to 30 years and messiah means that you sort of walk by a wife and not live with her 24 7. and this is usually done when there is a need to give concession from the wife's side whether to financially expenditure providing for the house or regarding the distribution of knights between the co-wives or all of the above so usually a person like me looks for a another wife but is unable to financially provide for her or to rent a house so he finds someone who is in need of marrying a man and is willing to compromise and to let go of some of her rights so she says i am a physician i'm a doctor at the hospital and i have my 80 year old mother living with me in the home and the maid and no one is to take care of her except me i can't get married and lead a normal life taking care of my husband and children and leaving my mom behind and i could not find any husband that would be willing to live with my mom so because i have a house i have money all what i need is my natural desires to be fulfilled and to be married to a man whom i can speak to occasionally and the man says whoa that's good for me i'm willing to go for such a marriage i can come like three days a week i can't sleep over and i cannot tell my wife about you because then she would cause problems and i have kids i don't want to risk my marriage and my family but i am in need of another wife because my first wife is not fulfilling my needs so to them this is a win-win situation what's the ruling the ruling is marriage is valid providing that she agrees to these conditions and the man acknowledging the fact that if she changes her mind in six months or a year and says no now i need to be a full wife like others that he's obliged to do this or divorce her then this is a win-win this is different from someone who is playing around he's a playboy but in an islamic way so he goes to this woman he marries her for a month divorces her and goes to another woman the manager for a couple of weeks divorces her and all of this is done out of necessity no this is haram but in some particular cases and this is judge case by case scenario missile managed can be an answer to many unsolved problems that men and women may uh face and suffering allah knows best kuri paolo says what's the ruling on shaving the mustache is it shaving the mustache is an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that this is not uh permissible imam malik to say that this is muthla this is mutilation because the hadith of the prophet salatu stated that we should grow the beards and trim the mustache not shave the mustache therefore the most authentic opinion is that shaving it is not permissible and allah knows best manding says it's a long question and basically manding did not know that you must not perform your russell to uplift your major ritual impurity after your menses is over that you should not perform muscle unless you see one of the two signs of purity either the white thread like discharge that is accompanied by no colored discharge or total dryness when you wipe or even insert something it comes clean no color discharges so she says that in the beginning of ramadan a few years ago she had her menses for six days so she skipped them and then she took russell and fasted and three days afterwards she saw these spots not the flow of blood so she broke her fast but then she saw a video of mine saying that such drops or discharge after the purity are nothing and you should continue fasting and praying and she has a confusion now because when she performed her hustle initially and fasted that day she did not see any purity sign she just did it from our own head so she says are these fasting days valid or not and should i make them up or not the answer would be if you were not certain that you were pure and you performed russell your prayer and your fasting is invalid because the default is that your menses is still going and always remember the default issue a woman is pure for 10 days 14 days 20 days no menses and then she sees colored discharges so she stops fasting and praying but she's doubtful whether this day it started or the other day we say the default is that your menses did not start because you were pure and hence the default is that you should be pure and we always tell you that color discharges before the beginning of menses is to be neglected and ignored you're still able to to pray and fast if the menses starts for six days seven days and you're doubtful whether the eighth day you were pure or not the default is that you were not pure because the six seven days continues and would not cease to stop until you see your purity if there is no certainty then the the default is that you're still on your menses and allah azzawajal knows best what to do you have to repeat these days that you were not sure whether you were pure or not whether you have performed the russell correctly or not but if you were certain that the second day and the third day you were definitely pure from your menses and you saw the sign of purity then your fasting is correct if you fasted them but your prayer is not because the hustle was not valid says i'm from bangladesh i study law my question is can i practice in a court as a woman wearing decent clothes with hijab in our country it is hard to accept appear in the court maintaining niqab i want to practice to give justice who to those who are unprivileged first of all the issue of studying law which is un-islamic is a very dangerous issue and a muslim must not study law man-made law french laws and english laws etc unless he is strongly founded in islamic arpeda and he acknowledges that all of this is kufur and not relating to islam and thirdly when practice he should not practice anything that goes against the ruling of islam and all his cases must be to help the unprivileged to ensure justice is being served but not to rule with man-made laws thirdly a woman must not compromise her nepab and as i can see from the question that you are a practicing woman wearing the kneecap it is not permissible for a woman to take off her niqab to stand in front of nan mahram men to prosecute or to defend and to speak publicly this is not permissible in islam why not take the podium and give a friday to the congregation as well wearing the hijab this is not acceptable in islam if you want to help the unprivileged you can do so from your office a lawyer as we all know cannot prosecute and defend without preparation without a lot of writing and reading without a lot of researching and studying all of this is done in the main office at the back of the stage where many lawyers study and write and compile what the lawyer in court is going to say and the approach he's going to take and allah azza knows best for hannah i mean says my daughter name is is it right if i use bint instead of binti this is not an islamic thing it's the word itself is bent so we have fatima been to muhammad see i said bintu muhammad if i were to pause i would say fatima bint muhammad and if i were to say let's assume khadija it depends on the grammatical position of the name whether i say bintu binti etc if i'm not going to connect it with the word or the name afterwards i just say bint so if you write the name to be uh bint no problem in that none whatsoever allah azza knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you with allah"
