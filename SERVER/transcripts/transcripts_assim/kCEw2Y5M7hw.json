  "title": "Is it permissible to sell on Amazon where they may charge a late payment fee? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is uh regarding selling in Amazon so there is actually a clause for advertising that says that it may charge some kind of like late payment piece or the legal maximum of the country right so if you're not sure if it's zero or not in a Muslim country like what's the best thing to to make the norm is anything that includes late payment fee is Haram even if you're sure that you're not going to pay it it is Haram because this is a riba clause that you're agreeing upon so whether it's Amazon or any other company you don't need to there's no necessity it's not like that I'm in the desert I'm about to die due to starvation and there's only dog meat in front of me to eat in order to survive this is not a necessity to deal with Amazon or with Google or any such company that stipulates a condition of late payment fee so this is not permissible in Allah knows best aroma"
