  "title": "Can women watch other women on youtube? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Fiser says can i watch other girls on YouTube who are not wearing hijab or proper Islamic clothings but the video topic is halal so FISA is asking about if it's permissible for her to watch other women on YouTube now for men to watch other women whether on you YouTube or elsewhere is prohibited but what about if a woman watches a woman who's not wearing the hijab she's not looking at the hour so for example a woman giving a talk motivational talk she's not wearing the hijab a woman who is showing us how to cook a meal steaks or whatever and she's not wearing the hijab her arms are exposed and she's cooking and talking for you FISA to look at her it's permissible women can look at women providing there is no hour exposed she's not in a bikini or something like that god forbid so this is okay but if there is other things that are Haram then you should refrain such as if there are music this is Haram you're not allowed to watch this if there is free mixing so she is coming and there are men with her chit-chatting like talk shows for example and they're casual they're cracking jokes and it's fun to watch but for you it's not permissible like it's for me it's not permissible because there is free mixing and this is how Shaitaan dilutes the prohibition of free mixing and making it acceptable in a sense so because they are doing something Haram and free mixing you're not allowed to watch them do that and allah azzawajal knows best"
