  "transcript": "[Music] can a person use injections while fasting this depends on the injections themselves and I think we have a question later on on the things that nullify your fasting so I'll just speak about the issue of injections injections can be nutritious what do you mean by nutritious it means that a person can use this to get red of water and food like the IV's the glucose that they put when a person is hospitalized he can live with this for four or five six days without eating and drinking so this takes the same ruling of food and drink this breaks your fasting there are other injections that do not have such impact which means that they do not affect your fasting such as voltaren injections someone with high fever so they give him a voltaren injection insulin which is a hormone for diabetes this that has no impact on your fasting vitamin b-complex or any type of vitamins injection antibiotics if taking taken as an injection and not through IV if it was through an bottle of IV then this also nullifies your fasting because this has glucose in it so any type of injection that is not nutritious doesn't give you or substitute for food and drink this has no impact on your fasting [Applause]"
