  "title": "THE RULING OF DRINKING DURING FRIDAY SERMON? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abdulla from canada he says is it permissible to drink while listening to the hotbar the hadith stated that it is not permissible to get distracted while listening to the jota even by playing with the pebbles you know in at the time of the Prophet I saw something that have carpets so they sat on sand and pebbles so while the Imam was giving the hot but maybe somebody would play with the pebbles or do this or do that you know different things that would distract you this is Haram this is love who it would distract you but scholars say that if a person does something that is not lengthy or that has a legitimate reason for example like our brother Abu earth man in the beginning he said that he sometimes does is during the hope of the Jamaat what to do if you start dozing you can change your spot stand up and move to somewhere else if this is not possible due to the Masjid is packed then take a miswak and start brushing your teeth what yeah but check this is action while the Imam is giving hot but I know this is not to be distracted rather this is to concentrate so you're doing this in order to kick away your feeling of sleepiness and be able to concentrate better now when it comes to drinking water this is an action that takes few seconds it seems to me that there is nothing wrong with it and allah azzawajal knows best"
