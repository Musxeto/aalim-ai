  "title": "Forgot to take Ghusl and prayed in the state of major sexual impurity - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother mom do says that if a person was in the state of sexual impurity major ritual impurity and he forgot and went to pray and then remembered afterwards is his prayer valid we know brother mom do that there are conditions for salat and every Muslim has to know this because your salat is not valid without knowing the conditions without knowing the pillars the obligatory acts and the Sunnah acts how would you pray so one of the most important conditions of salat that comes before salat is to be in the state of purity major and minor and this is the ritual purity because there is a physical purity which is on my body my clothes and the spot I'm praying in this is a different part of purity I'm talking about the ritual purity which is something that I cannot see so if you are in the state of major ritual purity whether because of nocturnal emission because of having ejaculation intercourse or if a woman is in her menses and got pure or in her postnatal bleeding you have to perform oasl otherwise your prayer is invalid whether deliberately acknowledge any knowingly or unintentionally the ruling is the same your prayer is invalid so what you have to do now is to perform muscle and to pray all the previous prayers that you had prayed in the state of major ritual impurity"
