  "transcript": "Rafat says if a lady gets her full body massage daily is she allowed to do the same in Ramadan please advise first of all what is the ruling on having a full body massage if your husband is the one doing it to you having it done in Ramadan and other Indian Ramadan is something permissible you have the green light but if it's someone else and presumably or logically it should be another woman then this is not permissible unless it is for medical reasons someone to get a full-body massage every single day this is extravagance this is part of the people of wealth who have money they don't know how to spend it not only that it means that she the masseuse will be in contact direct contact of your Hara and this is not permissible in Islam no Muslim ever said that this is allowed body massage for medical reasons is permissible and she the masseuse can touch parts of the hour but not the whole thing not the whole nine yards therefore you have to revise this a little bit more be more careful because other than Ramadan this is not permissible yes if the masseuse is only doing it from top of the clothes for your shoulders for example for your arms for a knee below legs yeah no problem but to have your our exposed and to be touched just for relaxation and not from any medical reasons this is not permissible"
