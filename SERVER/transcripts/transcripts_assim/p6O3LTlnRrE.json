  "transcript": "Heena from India. Alaykumussalam. Alaykumussalam. So I need your advice. I don't want to go out but I need a job as since almost I am living on the money which my paternal uncle gives me and I try my best to manage with it. I used to teach in secular schools. There I have to deal with things like teacher's responsibilities to take students to show movie arranged by the administration. When there is any non-Muslim festival, teacher has to ask students to bring things related to that festival so that they can celebrate and attend school functions which include dance and music but by students. Teachers have to be there and in parent-teacher meetings, sometimes only fathers visit. So I don't know if it is permissible for me to take part in these activities even though I hate it. First of all, it is not permissible for a Muslim to participate in something that is haram or to collaborate on something that is haram. However, if someone is living in a kafir country and the system itself forces them to do something that is haram such as celebrating haram festivals or participate in something that is haram, it is the duty of a Muslim to minimize as much as possible their contribution to such haram activities. So you don't have to hang decorations or encourage them to participate in such festivals. If you just are forced to be watching them or supervising them, a by-watcher, then this is something that you don't have any control of and this is inshallah forgiven and negligible. It's different when you're the one who's supervising it and arranging it and encouraging them to participate in it. And this goes for the rest of that as well."
