  "transcript": "the last as his was a mission of the greatest task there was only moral degeneration people cl to Idol adoration for [Music] so may Allah be pleased with him was from Al the prophet Alat wasam from his family from the best among those who followed the prophet Alat Al Talib used to be known as AB Hassan the father of alhassan who was his eldest and this is a tradition in Arabia where they call a person by his eldest son so they would call someone Abu Muhammad Abu Abdallah Abu alhassan but may Allah be pleased with him had another name he used to also be known as Abu and t means sand or dust so why would someone call his son dust or whatever well he did not have a son by the name of dust or sand but there's a story behind this and that was when the prophet Alat wasam visited his daughter's house Fatima may Allah be pleased with her and he went in and saw Fatima with sort of a gloomy face and he asked about Ali and she told him that they had a small dispute and Ali left the house a little bit angry and he went to the Masjid so the prophet Alat wasam as any good father would do went to his cousin to his son-in-law to beat the hell out of him definitely not any good father would step down on his feelings and try to concile between the two not like lots of the parents do nowadays whenever their daughter complained they would say come with us to our house leave your husband he is not worthy of you he is a bad one he is so and so and so he's poor he's not handsome he's rigid he's tough he's not kind why simply because the wife had a small dispute with her husband and there is no one who claims that we don't have any disputes with our spouses this is life this is human nature We're Not Angels this happens in every house it has to have happen in every house there are exceptions but they're not as what we think we've been influenced by the media by the movies by the soap operas thinking that life marriage can be perfect no it cannot Subhan Allah so the prophet Alam went as any good parent would do and went to the Masjid he saw Ali be pleased with him lying on his back putting one leg over the other in the mid on the ground which was sand and soil and the prophet Alam came to him called upon Him Ali stood up but there was traces of dust at his back so the prophet wiped it off and said stand up Abu tab stand up Abu Tab and since then Ali enjoyed the this title given to him by the prophet Alat wasam in a humorous manner in a kind manner from the mercy sent to Mankind and it was his nickname to be Abu the prophet loved Ali A lot and he used to supplicate and ask Allah for things for him to bless his life to bless his wealth he did not have any wealth by the way but to bless him and to forgive his sins and Ali knew that he was among those who are granted a place in Paradise while they were still alive he's among the 10 with the Glad Tidings from Allah to be in Paradise it was reported in the authentic Hadith that Ali may Allah be pleased with him after his uncle died his uncle was Abu Talib after he died he went to the prophet Alat wasam and he broke the news to him in a manner that shows us the Dignity of Islam and he said in grief to his cousin to the prophet of Allah your look how he describes his father he's my father and he's your uncle but he went asay he would not accept Islam he's dead so the prophet told Ali may Allah be pleased with him go and bury him so Ali objected to that and said he is a disbeliever and I'm a Muslim how do you want me to take care of this disbeliever he's a pagan he's an idol worshipper and the prophet Alat wasam repeated that again go and bury him and don't do anything before you come and tell me about this so Ali went and buried him and from this we learn first of all that it is permissible for a Muslim to bury his non-muslim relative but it is not permissible for him to wash this relative prepare him like we do with the Muslims perfume him wrap him up in shreds and so on and then pray the funeral prayer no this is not permissible we just take him outside of the cemeteries of Muslim in the desert or wherever and we bury his corpse we bury his body so Ali did this and came back to the prophet Alat and the prophet instructed him sallallahu alaih Al wasallam to wash to have and this was the ruling in the beginning of Islam that whenever someone carried a funeral he should perform ablution and whenever someone washed a dead per person he should himself afterwards take a total bath or a so Ali did this and came back to the prophet Alam and then the prophet alham started to supplicate to Allah and he made Dua for Ali Ali may Allah be pleased with him says that by Allah I do not wish that I have the whole world in my hands in exchange for what the prophet supplicated to Allah for for me what the prophet said is far greater to me than this may Allah be pleased with him Ali may Allah be pleased with him was a learned person he was among the few who knew how to read and write and that is why on the Treaty of Al he was the one who was doing the writing and Prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam with SH who was the representative of the pagans at the time and who was not a Muslim at the time may Allah be pleased with him he was negotiating with the prophet Alam and they came to the conclusion so they decided to write a treaty something that would document the truth and that they would all follow so at the beginning the prophet Alam instructed Ali to write so he told him Ali WR and so says wait just write bis so the prophet tells Ali wris and then the prophet says to Ali this is what agreed with the prophet of Allah and then SEL stopped him again and said after Ali had written this and he said listen if we acknowledge that you are the prophet of Allah then we would not have any dispute among us but right this is what and Muhammad abdah agreed upon and remove and erase the prophet of Allah so the prophet told Al Talib remove the prophet of Allah Ali said by Allah I will not remove it you are the prophet of Allah and I will not erase it and the prophet Alat wasam went and erased it himself s we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back one might question this one might wonder listen you Muslims claim that the prophet Alam did not know how to read and write Allah described him in the Quran to be illiterate he does not know how to read and write Allah also said that if you had the ability to write with your right hand then they would question this so this is all true so how do you claim that the prophet when Allah be pleased with him refused to remove the word Muhammad rasol he refused to erase how did the prophet do this if he did not know how to read well Scholars said that this is a lame argument because even those who are illiterate who cannot read it right they have the ability to recognize their names once they see it because they've seen it so often it is like a photograph so they know they can easily distinguish what's considered to be normal writing and their names and that is why the prophet had a seal and he had a ring that was engraved on it Muhammad rasol Allah Muhammad the messenger of Allah three lines and he took this ring only when the people the companions around him told him if you want to send letters to the leaders of the adjacent Empires it has to be sealed because they will not open or read any unsealed letter so he had this letter he wore it sallallahu alaih wasallam he had this ring that is or this seal that is and he wore it all the time sallallahu alaihi wasallam and in this is a response to those who claim that wearing a ring is a Sunnah no it's not a Sunnah the prophet alham did not wear the ring because it was a ring it was a seal to seal the letters so that is why every time he seals a letter he can see Muhammad so when he saw it on the treaty or in the document it was easy for him to erase it and Ali went on to write the remaining of the documents may Allah be pleased with him Ali may Allah be pleased with him was a fair man the position like those who preceded him did not change him on the contrary he is the one who influenced it but there was a difference between his time and the time of those who preceded him why was that well once he was on the pulpit and he was a advising the Muslims and he was encouraging them to be good and righteous so one man stood up and said while you are saying this and Advising us with this why don't you yourself be with us like Omar and Abu Bakr were Abu Bakr and Omar as we know were righteous leaders like and Ali but they were different so the the man is objecting why don't you rule like Abu Bakr and Omar used to rule Ali looked at him and said Abu Bakr and Omar had citizens like me andman and that is why they ruled like this and with the scum like you this is how I can rule if I had citizens if I had subjects of my state similar to me and the companions of the prophet life would have been different but because the Muslim state had expanded and people from all over the world came to Medina and to Iraq and to Mecca it was all mixed up now they are not proper strong learned Muslims they are ignorant they have their own desires and they have their own hidden agendas and that is why we cannot rule as Abu Bakr and Omar used to rule may Allah be pleased with them all nevertheless he was a fair and just man especially when it came to courts as he was the best to judge it was reported that once he lost his shield and he found his shield with a Jew and the Jew was deliberately walking in front of Ali with his shield so he said hey Jew this is my shield he says no it's not it's with me now and it's my shield he said but this is my shield he said prove it so Ali may Allah be pleased with him took the Jew to the judge now this is beyond our imagination Ali is the top of this Muslim State he is the ruler the Undisputed ruler who has the ability to do anything he has a secret service he has the army he himself was a great warrior of Islam and he is taking the Jew to a judge to reclaim his own Shield this is a but this was their life this was the Justice they were living in there is no one to have Injustice or to be unfair to any of the Muslim or of the Muslim states subjects even if he was a Jew so they went to the judge and Ali may Allah be pleased with him put forward the case and when Ali went in the judge said AB Hassan please sit down and he himself Ali told him do not call me AB Hassan because now I am not the ruler of the Muslims I am one of the parties in this case so you should not call me with the beautiful names I love my name is Al don't call me by AB Hassan because this pleases me and this shows that there is something between you and me this is unfair you have to be objective so he sits down and the Jew sits down and then says what's the case and Ali says this is my shield so the looks at this Jew and he says what do you have to say oh Jew the you says well this is logical The Shield is with me so I am the lawful owner of it this is my shield and that's why it's mine no one would come and says whose dress is this it's mine I'm wearing it so the judge looks at Al Allah be pleased with him and says oh ruler of the Believers do you have any evidence to prove that this is your Shield do you have any registration do you have any Witnesses do you have any documentation is your name written over it and Ali says well sorry I don't unfortunately but it's only my word against his and he has the shield in his hand so the judge ruled it that the shield is the Jews and Ali accepted that and said you're right as long as I don't have any evidence The Shield is his on the spot the Jews said I believe that there is no God but Allah who is worthy of being worshiped and I believe that the prophet Muhammad alai is Allah's servant and messenger I saw you drop your shield and I took it from one of the battles and I hid it and by Allah this amount of fairness and Justice cannot be except for those who follow the right religion and the man embraced Islam the Jew embraced Islam what was the action or the reaction of Allah be pleased with him he immediately told the Jew then in this case my brother The Shield is yours keep it with you I do not want it anymore consider it as a gift from me this is the amount of transparency the amount of fairness may Allah be pleased with him had in his courts the position did not change him on the contrary he himself changed the position he did not indulge in the luxuries of this life of this world though he had the means to in the sense he could have lived in a big mansion He could have had all the money he wanted because now Persia was under his his control all the treasures of Persia was his of Iraq of Syria of Palestine of Jordan of Egypt up to Morocco all this great Empire they paid the zat and they paid the taxations to the Muslim government and to the Muslim Capital whether it was in Medina or it was in Al KFA where Ali was centered may Allah be pleased with him he could have had anything he wanted but not Ali Ali may Allah be pleased with him used to look at gold and silver and say oh you white and oh you yellow deceive anyone else but not me I will not be deceived by you he knew that his destination was Paradise and by Allah if I had the Glad Tiding that I'll be in Paradise one would think this is a check blank this is an excuse for you to do whatever you wish but not Ali may Allah be pleased with him and not the companions of the Prophet Alam once they had this glad Tiding this encouraged them more and more to work for the Hereafter Ali Talib was not deceived by this dun was not deceived by the wealth and the position he had he was and he remained as he was when the prophet Alat wasam died during the lifetime of the Prophet Alat wasam he was like any normal person Fatima may Allah be pleased with her came Ali and showed him her hands because of the grinding of Wheat and working in the house it affected her hands it became rough she is the daughter of the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam so Ali instructed her to go and ask her father for a slave for a servant to help her she went she greeted her father and her father said what do you want my daughter and she could not ask him she was bashful so Ali went and asked the prophet on her behalf he was not rich and he remained to be so the prophet Alat wasam came to their houses and told Fatima and Ali may Allah be pleased with them that if you say Subhan Allah 33 times alhamdulillah 33 times Allah abbar 33 times and conclude the 100 by saying if you say say these words before you go to bed that would be far greater for you than a servant Scholars say that whoever says this before going to bed Allah will give him the power will give him the energy that would suffice him and that would take the place of a servant this was may Allah be pleased with him a person who was not deceived by this word world or by the gold and silver but remain on the path that the prophet Alat left him and his companions to follow this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time"
