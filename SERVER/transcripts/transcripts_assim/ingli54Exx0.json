  "transcript": "at a time but never give up easy even when I'm really help behind I mean sallallahu wasallam Obama I believe he what also DK me the Vienna Muhammad why the ID he was sucking at remain assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Allah may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet salallahu alaihe wa sallam once said wealth does not decrease because of charity when you spend money your wealth does not decrease and Allah increases his slave in honor when he forgives others and no one humbles himself before Allah but Allah will raise him in status if we would like to go on and talk about this hadith it would probably take us a long time but what I wanted to talk about is forgiveness the Prophet says Allah salatu salam Allah increases his slave or servant in honor when he forgives others forgiveness is a beautiful thing people today when someone forgives others they label him as weak and coward they talk him out of it why do you forgive why didn't you avenge yourself why did you do this why did you do that not knowing that it is one of a loss beautiful attributes that he is forgiving the Almighty Allah and forgiveness leads to not punishing a person for what he has done and to wipe off that sin and that is why it is described in the Quran it is he who accepts repentance from his servants and forgives sins and he knows what you do this is a lot on my team our prophet sallallaahu honey where you seldom was asked my mother aisha may Allah be pleased with her and she said o prophet of Allah you see imagine that I have noticed and I have seen the night of decree lailatul cutter what should I say if I was successful and seeing that night which Allah compared to more than one thousand months of worshipping him so the Prophet said so Allah say Lam you should say or Allah you are all forgiving and you love forgiveness so forgive me this is how you supplicate to Allah you always mention the name that is suitable for what you're requesting so if you are supplicating against the enemies of Islam you don't say oh Allah you are most forgiving punish your enemies this does not come and when you want to ask Allah to forgive you you do not say Oh almighty all-powerful forgive me you have to say the name or to use the attribute of Allah the beautiful attributes that coincides that go side-by-side with what you are asking for and that is what the Prophet erase a lot said I'm taught is a may Allah be pleased with her he taught her to say o Allah you are all forgiving and you love forgiveness so forgive me forgiveness is a characteristic found in all messengers of Allah Prophet Joseph peace and praise be upon him Yosef he was mistreated by his own siblings they went to the extent that they threw him in a well in the desert in the wilderness and they abandoned him not knowing what would happen to him yet he forgave them after years and years when they came to Egypt not knowing that he was who he was he forgave them after all they had done to him our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam also forgave the people of mecca he forgave his enemies who got him out of his own town of his own house and forced him to migrate to Medina he forgave those who killed his loved ones who killed Hamza Abdul Mutallab his uncle and the rest of his companions he forgave those who tortured and killed his beloved companions why she had been horrible was an Abyssinian slave that was given the reward of freedom from slavery providing that he execute that he killed Hamza the uncle of the Prophet Aristotle Salim he did this but then later on regretted it and reverted to Islam and came to the Prophet Allah salatu salam because people told him that the Prophet RSM would never ever do anything wrong to you if you accept Islam so he came and he embraced Islam in front of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the prophet after he embraced islam he asked him about his name and he told him my name is washy the Prophet recognized that this is the man who killed his uncle yet he was a Muslim and Islam wipes everything that preceded it and the Prophet forgave him salallahu alaihe wa sallam the Prophet forgave those who came to assassinate him we were told that America al Juma he he collaborated with safaree Romania in the harem near to the Kaaba when they sat and they chatted they talked together no one was with them and Roma's son was captured and taken prisoner by the Muslims in the Battle of Badr so he wanted to go and pay his ransom but he did not have money and he wanted to free his son so as they were talking to disbelievers immitis said to supply and that if it were not for a debt that I have to pay and for children that I have and no one to provide for them if it were not for those I would have gone and killed Muhammad peace be upon him solid lolly or sell em so chiffon said do you mean what you say he said yes I do so chiffon said well as far as your children there with my children I'll take care of them until they grow up that's for your debt it's done I've paid it so a mayor went and dipped his sword in strong poison and immediately got his ride and traveled to Medina without disclosing this affair with anyone without waiting immediate effect so he entered the modulus of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the sitting area and Omar may Allah be pleased with him looked at his face and he said prophet of Allah this man does not come with good news he intends to do bad things I can see it in his face so the Prophet that I saw some calmed him down and said sit down Armour I'll take care of this so the man comes in stand in front of the profit that is a lot of Cena with his sword in his neck which means that he's in a distance that allows him to kill the Prophet by just touching him so the Prophet looks at him and says oh my what brings you and he says I come to three my son whom you've taken as a prisoner of war after the Battle of butter so the Prophet says Alice of Salaam then what about this sword you have and you're carrying and the man replied trying to hide his true intention and he said these swords are worthless they did not even do us any good on the day of better on the Battle of Badr what good did they make us at that moment the Prophet Eraser looked at our maid and said this is what we will know inshaallah after the break so stay tuned Salaam aleikum wa rahmatullah and welcome back so what did the prophet seer is salatu salam the prophet said oh my didn't you and so far no Maya sat last night close to the Kaaba and he told you that he will take care of your children and he will pay off your debt so that you come and kill me imagine the Prophet is saying this to his assassin and the man immediately said I believe and testify that there is no god but Allah worthy of being worshipped and that you are his messenger no one was with us and no one knew about this except the two of us and definitely you are a Messenger of Allah the prophet that is Hassan forgave him he did not execute him well he could have done that but he didn't the prophet sallallaahu was so forgiving that he would not ever avenge himself as aisha the mother of the believers said may allah be pleased with her he would never avenge himself unless someone did a sin then he will avenge it for Allah's cause peace and praise be upon him the prophet alayhi salatu salam as anis tells us was once walking and he was wearing a garment that was made of hard wool and he was not wearing anything underneath and this Nomad comes from nowhere and he grabs a prophet from His garment and he pulls him harshly saying that o Muhammad give me from Allah's money because you are not giving me from your own so this is a beggar begging for money in this rude manner and says I looked at the neck and shoulders of the Prophet aerosol Salam and they were red because this hard world garment affected it the Prophet looked behind him not startled Salalah Selim not angry smiling to the man asking his companions to give him something for the sake of Allah and so they did this was our prophet our a solemn forgiving and he pardons people and what is the difference between pardoning and forgiving in Arabic is called a suffering and a laugh ooh so pardoning is sort of forgiving but on the surface so you would not retaliate you would not punish those who have done you wrong but you will not forgive them with your heart you will not punish them you'll pardon them but you do not forget this with your heart while forgiving someone means that you'll not punish them and you'll not even remember that they had done you wrong at all and this was mentioned in Allah's or an in the book of Allah in the story of abu bakr may allah be pleased with him and his cousin muslin atha who slandered Aisha may Allah be pleased with her his cousin's daughter and accused her of adultery which she did not commit and which was completely false and Allah revealed the innocence of our Asia in the chapter known as surah - Noor so Abu Bakr in the beginning used to support Muslim because he was among the first to migrated to Medina and he didn't have any money he was extremely poor so he used to give him a monthly allowance because he's he was his cousin and also because he was among the mahadji read but when he said what he said and when he had done what he had done abu bakr said by allah i will not give him a single iota i will not give him one single dirham or dinar because of what he had said and then Allah revealed the beautiful verses of the Quran where our prophet went to Abu Bakr sallallahu seldom went to abu bakr may allah be pleased with him and told him of a Bakr didn't you hear what allah had revealed to me and he recited what translates to and let not those among you who are blessed with graces and wealth let them not swear to give any sort of help to their kinsmen those who were blessed by Allah should not swear that they would not give this money or that to the next of kin or their kinsmen Allah Almighty says and misurkin the poor and those who left their homes for Allah's cause must I can be called the three of these he is a kinsman of Abu Bakr he is among the poor and he left all of his homes and property for the sake of Allah Allah goes on to say let them Allah is referring to Abu Bakr and those who have wealth and grace let them pardon and forgive two things pardon that they should not inflict any form of punishment and forgive that they should not hold any grudge let them pardon and forgive do you not love Allah that he should forgive you and Allah is oft-forgiving most-merciful the minute Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him heard this verse he said to the Prophet idiso Salam by Allah I would love Allah to forgive me and to pardon me I make you my witness o prophet of Allah that I will not cut whatever I give and support and provide to my cousin master a benefactor Allah the Almighty has encouraged us to forgive although we know that it is an eye for an eye this is universal that when you punish someone for something wrong that he did for you if it's equal in punishment this is okay this is permissible generally speaking Allah says the almighty the punishment for an evil is an evil like there off but whoever forgives and makes reconciliation his reward is with Allah this is enough for a believer when you know that your reward is with Allah you should not even think of the reward because it's beyond your comprehension it's beyond whatever you can imagine so it's a well-known fact it's an eye for an eye but whenever you forgive and reconcile Allah will reward you greatly and the best form of forgiveness is when you forgive with an ability sometimes we forgive others but not because we're able to forgive but because we are forced to forgive for example if someone does wrong to me and he does something that requires punishment it's my god-given right to punish him but if he's like 6:4 and weighs 350 pounds it's a little bit difficult for me to get even so in this case I would probably forgive him not because I want to because I have to I'm forced to do this so this forgiveness is not for the sake of Allah this is incomplete the complete and perfect forgiveness is when you are able to do this the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam tells us that whoever controls his anger at the time when he has the means to act upon it Allah will call him before all of mankind on the day of judgment and we'll let him choose of the Elaine whoever he wants what a beautiful reward it shows us that it is complete and perfect forgiveness when you're able to act upon your anger when you control your anger and when you oppress your feelings of revenge and a vengeance when you do this for the sake of Allah Allah will reward you greatly and among the worst reasons that prevents a person from forgiving our anger a vengeance and arrogance anger rage a lot of us do things that they regret immediately after doing it but at the time the cause of doing it was pure rage arrogance prevents us from forgiving when someone tells you why don't you forgive and I say why should I he's way B low my status I'm a better person I'm a noble person this man has to be punished he has to be humiliated he has to know where he is and where I am arrogance and also the love of a vengeance just to have these feelings of hatred and enmity coming out of your heart being expressed in such punishment a Muslim does not have this in his heart a Muslim always forgives and pardons and that is why we should be careful it is said that beware of the pride of anger when you're angry you have this pride that makes you do things you regret beware of the pride of anger for it leads to the humiliation of apology and this is inevitable to reconcile you have to apologize for the wrong things you had done so instead of doing this instead of going to that place better more that you do not express your anger you do not do accordingly and who are the best people to forgive and to pardon they are the closest to you they are your wife they are your children they are your relatives they are humans they all have their shortcomings as you have your own shortcomings we have to forgive them they make mistakes as we do and we have to be compassionate merciful forgiving so that Allah who treat us in the same manner we have to do this for the sake of Allah we have to hope for them all the best to know that what they have done was human weakness they did what they did to us because they were humans we should avoid anger and arrogance we should avoid the feelings of a vengeance and we should say whatever they had done to me I'll make it for the sake of Allah and I'll forgive knowing that treating people with such gestures when you treat others with gestures of forgiveness and generosity you are inflicting more humiliation to them than if you would punish them then if you would reprimand them with harsh words or actions they will feel touched they will realize the amount of error they did in your favor and this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time via Manila was Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
