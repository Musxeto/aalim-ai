welcome to lessons in fit if we try to recap what happened last time we met we talked about a hadith and it would be more suitable for us to read and recite this hadith once again just to remind ourselves of the topic brother muhammad narrated abu huraira of the allahu anhu the prophet salallahu alayhi wasalam said whoever was a dead person should take about and the after and whoever carries it should perform perform ablution we mentioned if you recall that Islam is a religion of nature of Fatah and it's a simple religion we don't have any complications as long as the people need something Allah Azza WA JAL makes it easy for them as long as humans need something god almighty makes it easy for them to get in achieve and we give an example of oxygen or air and water we humans need air and water to live but our need to air is more than our need to water that is why air is found everywhere you don't have to pay anything to do that all what you have to do is inhale and breathe the water on the other hand is essential for our lives but it is not as easy as air to find likewise in our lives there are things that we need and there are no complications such as marriage we all need to get married at one point or the other and marriage is a very simple process in Islam the gentleman wishing to marry a lady goes to her parent goes to her father proposes the father says I give you my in marriage they named a doubt dowry mehar the man says I accept and this is in the presence of two witnesses or more of course after the acceptance of the bride to be because without her acceptance the marriage is not accepted and that is it she's his wife we don't have to authenticate it in the court though it's preferable nowadays we don't have to have a ceremony we don't have to have this or that it's very simple she becomes his wife within five seconds five minutes maximum likewise death it's a catastrophe when a relative or a loved one dies but this is life this is human nature we are born to die and then we would live for eternity we hope we aim and our target is to live in the to eternity in paradise so this is what we're doing and we're trying to achieve in sha Allah and Allah with His grace will reward this this so after we live we are going to die what happens when a person dies Islamically it's very simple we come to the corpse we wash it clean it perfume it wrap it in three garments white garments take it take the corpse to a mosque we perform the funeral prayer without any bowing or prostrating and then we take the dead person and put him in his grave and bury him no coffins no receptions no expensive ceremonies or vans or caravans or musical instruments or bands and so on no it's very easy and simple we grieve and we are allowed to grieve for three days except for the wife she is obliged to grieve for four months and ten days and that is it so this rituals these rituals connected with a person dying at the very beginning of Islam as a hadith says Abu Hurairah tells us that the Prophet said whoever washes a dead person should take a bath a total obligatory bath and whoever carries a dead person on his shoulder on the funeral to the burial place to the cemetery he should perform ablution this was at the very beginning of Islam and this was the verdict but this was abrogated and it was lifted alhamdulillah there are many things that were essential in Islam for example the prophets of are seldom used to stand up whatever a funeral passed by honoring the dead and honoring death by itself because we shouldn't you know pass these sceneries and as if nothing happened because then we are we would be drifting from reality and we will be drifting from the day that we will ourselves dying and this is quite evident when we watch news every single day you turn on your news channels and you find problems chaos catastrophes deaths in the hundreds or thousands worldwide either because of Wars or because of discrimination because of oppression of the Jews to the Muslims in Palestine or in Iraq or in Afghanistan or everywhere you would find bloodshed now what would happen we're supposed to interact we would support we're supposed to feel sorry for what's happening to our brothers we're supposed to feel sorry for the bloodshed and for the lives lost but because we see these sceneries every single day and night it become it becomes natural and normal so we would find kids being slaughtered and we'd say tune into the tune channel change the channel let's fight or see something that's more cheerful and we don't feel that there's a bond between us and our brothers the Muslims worldwide and this is one of the biggest mistakes and sins that a Muslim could feel the minute that you don't feel close to your brothers regardless regardless of their color race or language the minute you feel detached and away from them then your Islam has to be reviewed because it's a serious offense so coming back to our hadith at the very beginning it was obligatory that any person washing a dead man must perform total bath must have a total bath and any person carrying a funeral carrying a dead person must perform ablution this was obligated what hamdu lillah any questions though shall we move to the following question okay the following the following hadith please narrated abdullah bin abu book may allah be pleased with him the book written by allah's messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam for Amin has also contained none except a pure person should touch the Quran okay none except a pure person what do you mean by PUE person well there are two types of pureness very good spiritual pureness or yes okay and physical pure anus okay and also the physical pureness is of two types of two types major and minor excellent excellent very good mustafa now the hadith we have in our hands it says it's a famous hadith hadith um even his m and and and this hadith states that the prophets allah salam wrote a letter and then this letter to Yemen he made few or a number of instructions among them was that none except a power here a pure person which means translates to here none except a power should touch the Koran and scholars said that to be able to touch the Quran the holy book you have to be in the set of booboo you have to perform ablution by otherwise you may not touch it and then again scholars have their different interpretation to the hadith due to the fact that bahir has many meanings for example the in the Holy Quran Allah says verily the mujrimun are nature's innamal mushrikuna najasun' a says that the non-muslims because of not believing in the oneness of allah because they associate others with allah they are considered to be natures impure they are not pure so we cannot say that they are power they are not just nudges is the opposite of power so this is not physical this is mental it is a mental state that a person is not pure because if I shake hands with a nun Muslim mistake wash my hands of course not I could be married to a non-muslim lady and I don't have to do anything of that sort so it's not physical it is something that is mental or it's something that is inside because there disbelieve in Allah makes them impure yes fighting American Muslim in images in the sense yes I have explained this she is nauseous in the sense that she is impure because of a nun being non-muslim but her body is like any other boy of women so I don't have to wash after shaking hands or kissing or what whatever but in the sense of their net just comes from order impurity comes from their belief because they're not Muslims they associate other Lord Allah Azza WA JAL they are not considered to be power so this is one part the other part is the physical one and the physical one also is divided into two see the definition of Pajaro in arabic is removing the filth the impurity and lifting the state of impurity and I don't think we've mentioned this before but it's good that we try to review it every now and then p√°jaro to be able to qualify for the word Tahara you have to have two things present one removing of filth removing filth from the place you pray in and the place and your clothings and also your body so if you have any energizer any impurity during whatever on the place you pray and pray on or in your clothing or your body then you are not considered to be fire you cannot pray so this is physical and lifting the hadith lifting the impurity which is done through evolution also again is divided into sections major impurity and minor impurity as we've said earlier major impurity is through sexual impurity and minor impurity through nullification of voodoo and this is our topic for today's program we have to stop for a short break and inshallah we'll be right back ask Hodor nestled in mecca or close by to Mecca then you have to know that you are still in the state of a club as long as it is not for sale then he does not have to pay the comfort forbade praying which are similar to Malik prayer so whoever prays whitter three rokkes and sitting after the second wrecker as if he is praying mother a prayer this is forbidden this is haram to euthanasia is permissible with animals but not with human beings if an animal is suffering killing an animal for a legitimate reason is permissible both are acceptable but the majority say that after the rapport is the place of Knut but both was reported have a question or concern on your mind Oh daddy be decided based on popular demand we will be bringing you an additional episode of ask Hodor with chief Azzam bin Lachman al Hakim live from Jeddah Kingdom of Saudi Arabia salam aliekum wa rahamtullah and welcome back to lessons in film before the break we talked about the meaning of pas here where the Prophet says alayhi salatu was-salam none except our power here should touch the Quran none except a few person and we said that this has many different meanings and that is why companions of the Prophet eyes of Salaam well actually let me rephrase that that is why scholars have different opinion in regard to touching the Quran some of them say you may touch the Quran no matter what state you are you're you're in as long as you know you're a Muslim so if you are in the state of sexual impurity if you are in the state of impurity the minor impurity if you are on a balloon performed evolution it's okay you may touch the Koran anytime and this is the choice of alum mmm even hasma variety and also the choice of sheikh al albani may Allah have mercy on his soul and if you look into the sequence of evidence and the justifications they gave you'd find that this very sound because touching the Quran is a very important thing to prevent people from doing it you have to have a sound evidence because a lot of people would say hello chef can I touch the Quran I'm not in the state of evolution I'm not in the set of my purity and if we say that you have to perform ooodle this means that 90% of the people would say well okay I'll read it some other time so you are asking people not to read the Quran because of this hadith that may imply it may not imply that you have to perform model now regardless of or what was mentioned before the constant we all agree that it is highly recommended that you perform Odom before touching the Quran but to impose people and to make it a must on people you have to have a stronger evidence and again the saying this we do not discredit the scholars that say you have to perform Moodle before touching the Koran we cannot because the four schools of thought all agree that you must perform Moodle before touching the Koran but again to build an allegation you have to have sound and strong evidence without that you cannot enforce it you cannot tell and ask people not to read the Quran unless they have voodoo on now there is a difference between touching the Quran and reciting the Quran and before mentioning the difference I think Fatih has a question I was just wondering what did Albanian mmm the husband like how did they explain the the person the Quran that states that it is not touched except by the pure what did they say I mean the angel this verse they be mentioned it's in surat al-baqara at the very end allah azza wajal talks and about tells us about the quran and he tells us that it's in a sacred and preserved book LOL my fool and this book is not touched except by those who are purified and those are the angels it doesn't talk about the quran so the those who commented on the Koran such as I'm in kaffir Alcor to be they all say that it is not regarding the Quran the Holy Quran it's regarding the local my food the sacred and preserved tablets that in the heavens where Allah Allah has decreed everything and wrote everything in that preserved tablets and sacred tablets so it's a different thing now to come and say that we mean this or that you have to have a stronger evidence the prophet alayhi salat wa salam did not even recommend answering those who say peace upon you unless he was in the state of evolution so it's it's different than saying it it's a must it is highly recommended that you perform model before you touch the Quran but it is not a must and that is why allah azza wajal Allah's prophet salallahu alaihe salam told us not to take the holy quran to the country of those who do not worship allah why so that they would not abuse it and mistreat it as the case we hear in the news being the Quran being abused in prison camps such as in Guantanamo in Palestine occupied territory and so on this happens so whenever you're traveling if you fear that the copy of the Holy Quran you're taking with you will be abused or someone will mistreat it then you may not you must not take it with you what as in the case of hamdulillah nowadays we travel worldwide and nobody abuses it but hamdulillah then it's okay to take it with you whether you go to China or you go to Europe nobody abuses the Quran it's safe for you to take but if you're going to areas that you are afraid that there will be people abusing it then you may not take the Holy Quran with you before the break we said that there is a difference between two things do you remember nor nor do you remember what was we said before the break difference between I should charge you guys there's a difference between touching the Quran and reciting the Quran touching the Quran the four schools of thought say you have to perform ablution reciting the Quran without touching it it's a matter of dispute among them the authentic verdict is that you do not have to be in the state of mobile you don't have to perform ablution in order for you to recite the Quran the following hadith gives us a glimpse of why hadith said 73 yeah narrated I sorrow the loved one huh a lost messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam used to mention Allah's name praise him at all times now this hadith tells us that the prophet of allah used to mention Allah's name at all times and conditions see times here does not mean time but on any state he's in and this that's why the translation is a little bit tricky ala jami'a he Ani which means that on any state he is in whether he is performed he has performed ablution or not whether he is pure or not and this tells us that it is okay for you to recite the Quran on any state urine some scholars say well okay if you are in the set of sexual impurity you may not recite the Quran why is that they say because there is another hadith by Holly Willoughby Talib nor the allahu anhu baba he said that the prophet sallallaahu Selim used to teach us used to mentioned the name of allah azzawajal and nothing would prevent him from reading the Quran except sexual impurity this is the only thing that would prevent him from reciting from reading the Quran so scholars say okay then this is a different issue a person if he is in the sexual impurity he should not recite the Quran but a question that may arise in some of our heads what about if I am at the state of sexual impurity and before I go to bed don't I usually recite the Quran do I usually recite the Quran such as Mustafa it will coarsely ayatul kursi the verse of the throne the greatest verse in the holy quran aya - al kursi and and what is the greatest surah of Al Quran Muhammad what is the greatest surah bakra yassine fatty cross at a floss Noor al fatiha the greatest surah in the Quran Alfred you have several Missoni or honorably this is the greatest by far and it's a cure from all the Jesus if you believe in it it's a cure from snake wounds scorpion stings whatever it's cool from everything but you have to believe in it you have to read it and recite it with belief so before you sleep you go to before you go to bed there are supplications you do and there are verses of the Quran that you did such as ayatul kursi such as surah - a class a little fella & nass the last three chapters of the Quran Allah Allahu Ahad or developer luminous the Prophet Allah sallam used to ask us instruct us to do this and he used to do it himself to our surprise the Prophet used to recite before he sleeps suet Tabarrok alif-lam-mim says de Surat Annisa surat az-zumar and all of these suitors may take you like 40 minutes to recite 30 to 40 minutes to decide and this is before you go to bed now how do muslims or what do muslims do before they go to bed they put slow music soft music and why is that it relaxes us it relaxes you this is nothing according to Islam said well you know it's a tense life we have to put some symphonies you know fifth of Beethoven or something Mozart or sit on D on which makes me feel okay before I go to bed and this is completely out of the question you should recite and it makes you feel good so one says okay I'm in the state of sexual impurity I just had intercourse with my wife and I did I don't want to perform also I don't want to take a total bath now I'm going to do it before Fajr prayer so what should I do we tell him go ahead and recite because these verses and these short surahs are it's okay the prophet has a sauna used to do it and so many times he did not perform total bath so it's okay for us to do and you're not reciting the Quran you're just doing it as form of supplication before going to bed so in short it's okay for a person in within this in the case of sexual impurity to mention Allah's name without having total bath it's also correct and acceptable for a woman and her ministration a woman on in her monthly period to recite the Quran and get closer to Allah so gel by reciting it by heart there is nothing wrong with it and even by touching it scholars say some of them say it's okay to do it but preferably if you use a comentary it's better if you read the Quran if the lady or the sister reads the Quran when she's having her monthly period from a commentary' it's better because then it's not considered to be a Quran it's mixed between commentary and the Holy Quran I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time Fiorella or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
