  "title": "Have got savings-Hajj or Umrah, which takes priority? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "this question is i've got savings do i do umrah with these savings and then save later on for few years more for hajj or should i utilize my savings to do my hajj first the answer is your hajj is a pillar of islam your umrah is obligatory but not a pillar and hence if you have savings that is sufficient to take you to mecca to do umrah do not go for umrah keep it save a little bit more and do the big thing which is the hajj and afterwards you can make as many umbras as you wish without any problem so i'm afraid that this brings us to the end of tonight's episode until we meet same time next week i leave you for amanillah was too you"
