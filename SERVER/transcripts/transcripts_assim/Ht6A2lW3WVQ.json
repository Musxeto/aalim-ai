  "transcript": "trust him I think and martasam is not one of Allah's name so the name should be revised he says my question is suppose one can't do sajdah on the ground while Salah and usually he keeps a small chair in front of him and that's the jute on it is it permissible the answer is no if you're unable to put your forehead on the ground then there is no need to bring a pillow or a table or a chair so that you can put your head on it or your forehead on it this is not permissible and it's an innovation what you should do is when you perform record you do this if you cannot do proper record so you kneel a little bit forward you bow a little bit forward and for your sujitude you go a little bit further and this is what you must do Muhammad"
