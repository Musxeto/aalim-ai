  "title": "Doing Business while you're on Work Visa & Not Obeying the Law - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is uh saying that he he is here on um uh a work visa most likely if I heard it correctly and it is not permissible for him according to the Saudi laws to engage in business so some people are giving him this ill advice by telling him that this is unlam and he should not obey this instruction and he should do whatever he wants uh similarly to what the locals do because the locals are entitled to do business so he can do the business as well first of all there is something that we have to clear out and that is Allah said in the Quran oh you who believe obey Allah and obey the prophet Alam and Those whom Allah had appointed upon you as uh uh leaders and rulers and this includes the scholars and the actual rulers and governors so this is an instruction by Allah to obey them and as long as they don't tell you to walk on the on water or to fly on uh uh in air or to do something that is Haram it is mandatory for you to obey them as they are your your leaders they are the so when they tell you when it's a red traffic light you have to stop you have to stop if you don't it's a sin plus it is a traffic violation but it is a sin so obeying them is part of the system that Allah has put on Earth imagine if we were all chiefs and no Indians if we were all officers and no soldiers each one of us Hears A decree listen to an order says no I'm not going to do it I don't feel like it it's un Islamic it's not right then there's no need for having a ruler or a governor to control the Muslims and to make them live in a system so this is part of the system that Islam promotes not that you do not work Islam promotes that you obey and listen to a lot of the Muslims complain mus Saudi Muslim country and they have restrictions on uh residence visa and they strict people from coming to live in Mecca and Medina this is UN Islamic these are imbeciles these are people with out knowledge without even the simplest logic we have 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide in Hajj we get 4 million 4 million coming to perform Hajj and meca and Medina the people are suffocating because they are unable to take in all these pilgrims coming at the same time now imagine not on Hajj if 10 million 20 million this this is the least from Pakistan Bangladesh India would like to come and reside in meca and Medina and the government allows them to do this how would life would be there can you imagine this it's out of any logical or human proportions so if they do not restrict this and put these laws then it would be chaos and this is why Allah appointed them to rule and Allah knows best um"
