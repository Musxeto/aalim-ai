  "transcript": "um if you can Enlighten us through your experience in the da uh da sector how you managed to start dawa and where you are now as I always say and this is not part of me being humble because it's very rare to show my humbleness when you don't have any humbleness um I always say that I am not a typical D in the sense that I did not choose to become a DI I was pushed by the People by the community to give lectures to give of J to give D and through the process with the grace of Allah Allah blessed me to learn more and more to get in touch with SH to be able to help people and I found myself in this position not that I chose to be there and I'm just doing what the people want me to do this doesn't mean are you doing it for the sake of Allah or not of course I'm doing it for the sake of Allah but I'm not your typical di who would jump the moment you tell him oh we would like you to give us a lecture sorry it's not organized it's not scheduled I don't have this in me so do I have the passion yes to do what to help people to answer their questions I enjoy answering people questions even if it takes half of my day I have no problem with that I have problems with giving lectures because lectures require preparation require uh sitting down and putting your thoughts requir delivering it in a specific time while answering questions help people helps people you can see what you're doing the benefit of it and it's self- satisfactory and at the same time it's a form of worship to Allah so in a way I hope this answers your question about the beginnings and the ends"
