  "transcript": "Adrian from Siberia or Serbia that is not Siberia sorry from Serbia so is it permissible to use soap and shampoo and quickle to clean major ritual impurity or we can only use water okay first of all we always stated that the actual ritual which is is only done by water now most people would like to hit two birds with one stone so they would like to perform rul but at the same time clean themselves up so they use soap and shampoo there's no problem in that but my advice is to segregate both from one another so either you shampoo your body and hair and use soap then after you wash yourself up in one minute do the proper rul and the quick rul that is with water only or do the opposite do the proper quick Gul in one minute or two minutes with water and afterwards now the major ritual impurity has been uplifted you can use soap and shampoo for as long as you wish and Allah Knows Best"
