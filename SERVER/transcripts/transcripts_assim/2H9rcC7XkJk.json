  "title": "Can we pray behind someone who says if you change from Hanafi madhab, all your deeds are void",
  "transcript": "Arik from Bangladesh So my today's question is, if a person says that all the Imams come after Imam Abu Hanifa, they are not acceptable, and also he goes further and says that if any hadith is not described or narrated by Imam Abu Hanifa or didn't respect Imam Abu Hanifa, we cannot take that hadith, and even he goes further and says that if you are following one school of thought and you change from one school of thought to another, all of your deeds of the past will be erased. Can we pray behind such person? Of course you can pray behind this person because he did not commit an act of kufr. However, he is an ignorant imbecile. Anyone who says such rhetoric, we counter it by saying, anyone who says that any Imam after Abu Hanifa is wrong, or following one school of thought and changing it, your deeds are void, or any hadith that was not reported by Abu Hanifa is not a hadith, any person who says such a thing, we say, is an ignorant imbecile and should not be listened to or learned from or even given any weight in society. So if he comes, we don't give him the honour of leading the prayer if he is not the regular Imam. If he is the regular Imam, we simply don't show in his masjid and go to another masjid. But the prayer behind him is valid. The prayer behind any ignorant imbecile is valid. The prayer behind a kafir is not valid and I hope this answers your question."
