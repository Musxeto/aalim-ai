  "title": "Zakat on borrowed money - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "if I borrowed money most likely when I borrow money I do not possess it anymore but let's assume that I borrowed ten thousand euros from a cousin and I have the ten thousand euros in my bank account and it stayed there for a whole year if I did not give it back to him before the year was over I am obliged to give 2.5% zakat on it because when the prophet alayhi salaatu sun dispatched his men to collect the zakat from all over the tribes the zakat collectors would see a herd of sheep and tell them that you have to give 10 sheep as the cat and would not inquire would not ask is all this yours or did you borrow some of it which means that they takes a cat of whatever is present in your possession and likewise if I borrowed money I have to give the cat as long as a full lunar year had passed it reached a threshold and I have it in my possession"
