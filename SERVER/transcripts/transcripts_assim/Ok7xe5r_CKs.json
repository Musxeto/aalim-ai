  "transcript": "because when I go to this approach education okay first of all ah azzawajal did not create an illness without creating a cure some people will know it some people won't know it so how to differentiate between different types of medication number one there is medication the medication that Islam came with such as honey such as black seed Haba soda such as cupping hijama such as Hindi such as zamzam such as Rupiah all of these are healings from the Sharia so you can do this providing that the person doing it for you is Muslim and not doing number two of healing is natural healing medical healing which is known through practice so Physicians come mix this with this and you take it oops he died this is not good this is not good they mix this with this oh he's cured antibiotics is good for this kind of illness this kind of medicine is good for headaches so it is through experiments and medical reports and science we know this is halal now we come to the third type of forms of healing that is neither sorry nor medically or scientifically proven and this is minor shirk such as wearing a copper bracelet what is this oh this is good for your knees and joints and rheumatism and it's very good chair we go to the doctors doctors orthopedic doctors is this good it's not under this Focus so believing in it is Haram wearing the disc of energy something they have every time they bring something to you and they say that this this ring it's also all of this is if you think Allah will cure you through it it is major shift if you think it is a cure so now we go back to the question he says I go to the Healer what is healer is he doing rookia if yes he has to be from he prays he doesn't do any and you heal his Rukia I don't go to someone he says no no no no no maybe he's praying to the gym a real Muslim rakhi would be Audible and this is why the prophet said let me hear your rookia so that I would know if it has anything that's against Quran and Sunnah or not because European is Dua is making Dua so you can I can make Dua in Arabic not from the Quran in Sunnah but it would be accepted but to mumble things without knowing what it means no this is not permissible so I need to know what is this healer what does he do"
