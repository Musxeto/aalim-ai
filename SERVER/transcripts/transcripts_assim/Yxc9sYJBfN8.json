  "transcript": "foreign but he added that each Arabic letter can be represented by a specific number so if we don't write the actual words rather we write the numbers which is representing the verse then it is also Halal to order that tabis so can I pray behind this Imam Sheikh she have bye didn't you ask me this question on my website yesterday that was I think a bit uh different question okay um this was a similar question and the answer is no this is not permissible to be done saying that wearing taweed made only from Quran is a weak opinion and some say that this is the opinion of Abdullah Allah be pleased with him but this is not true and this is why we would not say that this is Sheikh we would say okay this is a weak opinion it's not permissible to add the Hadith to it this is not permissible to go a little bit overboard and write numbers so saying letter A is for one letter uh W is for 15 and we put numbers this is what sooth Sayers and magicians do so definitely if the Imam does this you must not pray behind him and Allah knows best Abdullah"
