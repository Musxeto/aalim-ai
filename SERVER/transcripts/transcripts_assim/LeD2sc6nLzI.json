  "transcript": "so ayman from india says he has a person has a lot of whisperings of satan and he doubts his islam frequently and he repeats shahadah a lot every day what to do about this as i said this before the vast majority of people who contact me on the counseling sessions do that because of this and usually with the grace of allah it takes like maybe 15 minutes 20 minutes to talk them out of it the basics are quite easy but you have to take it from the horse's mouth so that you would be convinced so i'm giving it to you now first of all there is a rule that states certainty is not affected by doubt and everybody knows this rule it's one of the legal maxims one of the five great legal maxims of uh islam and it can be implemented to everything so is my pen pure or najis no certainty it is pure but i am doubtful whether i've dropped it in a the toilet and urine whether their feces on it should i act upon this doubt no throw it in the dustbin as easy as that certainty is not affected by doubt so when you cascade this to everything in life you will block shaytaan from whispering into your ears so for example i'm doubtful have i committed shirk have i committed kuffar these intrusive thoughts that i'm having would they have impact on my islam apply the rule simple as that are you a muslim he said yes of course are you certain or doubtful of your islam said no definitely i'm a muslim this is certainty okay these intrusive thoughts are they certainty or doubtful he said no they are not certain they are definitely doubts and whispers from shaytan but wait don't elaborate i didn't ask you did i don't elaborate are these whispers certain or doubtful he said no they are doubtful throw it in the dustbin but sheikh but me no but it's that's it if you apply this you'll be saved and you will not have these intrusive thoughts but if you yourself like to be sympathized by others if you yourself open the door for shaytan and say come in come in you're quite welcome and invite him to invade your head and put these ids in it then this is something nobody can help you because you're the one who's happy with it so stop it and apply the rule and then you will have no problem insha'allah"
