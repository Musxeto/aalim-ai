  "transcript": "yes sir like I am still searching for a job in a company that accepts the proper Islamic jilbab but I am unable to get one the one I got I left there because of my situation so my question is will I be sinful if I remain prayerful and patient even if I may get into homelessness and poverty sir I don't understand your question will you be if I sinful sin for sir yes for what doing what if I remain putting on my jilbab like still putting on my jilbab I refuse to remove it because of a job of course of course Hala it is not permissible to compromise your religion no matter what so if you cannot find a job unless you take off the hijab then you might as well not take off the hijab even if you beg beg people for money and help even if you beg them for zakat that is what you should do rather than compromise your religion so tomorrow you take off their your hijab you say they say you can't wear a long skirt you have to wear micro uh Jeep or or mini skirt or whatever what is this this is not something that Islam uh endorses or accepts at all"
