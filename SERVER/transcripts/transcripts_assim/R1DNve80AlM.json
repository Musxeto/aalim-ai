  "transcript": "Muzammil from the UAE: How \nwould we reconcile between  and uh um connecting our kinship with our \ndisbelieving relatives? I don't see any   contradiction. What is the concept of Al \nWala Wal Bara (Love & Hate for Allah's Sake) to have the allegiance to someone, \nto support to give support and   help to those who need you, this is wallah so \nAl Muminoona wal Muminat Bada Muli ow ba'ad so they are allies to one another, \nthe believers males and females   they stand together not free mixing i'm talking \nabout males with males and females with females   but in essence yes they are backing one uh \nothers back or having one's others back.   Al-bara is to declare that I have \nnothing to do with that person   and this was mentioned in suratul mumtahina when \nAllah tells us that there is a good example for   you in Ibrahim and his people when they declared \nthat they have nothing to do with their people   until they disbelieve in their idols and \nonly take allah azza as a true god to worship   so this is the concept of now if I have a cousin \nwho's a kafir if I have a brother who's a kafir if   my wife is a Christian disbeliever this doesn't \nmean I have to ditch her or get rid of her or   not have anything to do she's my wife I love her \nas a human being as a mother of my children but   when it comes to allegiance I would never back her \nup in regards of her religion or side with her um   other Christian people and support them I would \nalways be with the Muslims supporting them and   whenever she says anything that is kufur or \nattributing a son to Allah I would always have my distance and proclaim and say that this \nis kufur this is shirk I don't support this   I don't agree with this I wouldn't say okay \nthis is your religion I'm okay with that   you're wearing the cross you doing the trinity \nstuff etc I'm okay no, I would proclaim and   and uh say that this is against logic this \nis against Islam this is against this is   but that doesn't mean that I don't \nsend them gifts I don't be nice to them   I don't invite them for food because \nof their kinship and so on you"
