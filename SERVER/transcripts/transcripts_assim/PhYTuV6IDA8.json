  "transcript": "can you uh tell me how do I eat using my hands like the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did the prophet ate using his right hand only and he used to use three fingers to eat directly how however this is not something that is mandatory upon us so if a person uses a fork a spoon or any other means this is Hal but if a person uses his fingers the Sunnah is to lick your fingers after you finish can I use my five fingers my whole hand yes but this is not in accordance to the Sunnah and this is according to the iate according to the Customs according to the traditions in your country it differs from one country to the other and there is nothing prescribed as man mandatory other than you must not use your left hand to eat with or drink with and Allah Knows Best"
