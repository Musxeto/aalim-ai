  "title": "He hit puberty but did not tell anyone and did not fast or pray, any kaffara? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Adam from UK uh yeah so I know someone when they were young they noticed that they started to have Pub care meaning that they are now accountable and they did not tell anyone they are unsure yet it's more probable that they had a feeling that now they have a responsibility because of this including Salah and so this is probably why they didn't tell anyone he was very ignorant and he so he skipped fasting and did not pray a lot Etc so he miss fast does he have to make them up isfar he's only 16 and he gets 20 every week does he uh so he does get some money he uh also was told before by a relative that he doesn't have to pray Etc thinking that he is not accountable not knowing that he reached puberty he still did not say anything and just went along with it not sure whether he did that just because he didn't want to pray or he actually believed him what does he do kafara Etc if a person reached the age of puberty and out of ignorance or laziness did not pray he cannot make up these prayers because the prayers are fixed to a specific time and once the time is expired without a legitimate reason they cannot make up for these prayers so he has to repent ask Allah for forgiveness show remorse and never skip prayers again as for fasting if they or if this this individual did not fast the whole day intending not to fast it's the same ruling as the prayer he cannot make up for these missed days but if he started fasting for a couple of hours intended to fast and then broke his fast he has to make up for these fasts that he started that he initiated and broke but the fasts that he intended not to fast and skip the whole day no he cannot make them up and it's gone and Allah Knows Best"
