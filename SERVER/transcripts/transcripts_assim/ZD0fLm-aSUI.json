  "title": "Is it permissible to sleep on our stomach or our left side? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um my question is uh uh what's the authentic Sunnah uh to sleep because uh a few days ago uh well to be honest a few months ago I sleep in the Masjid and then out and then the people in the Masjid notice that I speak on my left side and then they say this is the way how set how shaitan sleeps is this too uh Jessica what the people say to you is totally baseless and unfortunately when people don't have knowledge they speak out of their own whims and desires and the dangerous thing is when they relate this to the religion of Allah so they are making something that is halal Haram and they are innovating in the religion of Allah the Sunnah as per the Hadith may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet instructed him whenever he wants to go to bed that he performs wudu as if he were to pray and then to lie down on his right side and to say the Dua this is the Sunnah however the scholars say that there is no prohibition in lying on your left or your back some Scholars said that lying on your belly lying on your stomach is prohibited some say it is Haram some say prohibiting is the same some say it's prohibited some say it is macro and some say it is halal why all depending on the authenticity of the Hadith where the Prophet Allah came and saw a man sleeping on his stomach in the Masjid so the prophet pushed him with his foot waking him up and telling him that this is the way that Satan sleeps and in another narration the prophet said that this is a format of sleeping that Allah tests and hates but the hadiths are not authentic and logically the prophet wouldn't blame someone for an action he is doing while asleep because the pen of accountability is uplifted when you're asleep you're not accountable for your actions so this is why the scholar said that it is permissible to sleep on your stomach without any problem because there is nothing supporting it from the authentic Hadith however sleeping on your left I don't know anyone who ever said that this is not permissible or um it is the way that shaytan sleeps or it's beloved to shaytan so what the people told you in the Masjid is totally baseless Muhammad"
