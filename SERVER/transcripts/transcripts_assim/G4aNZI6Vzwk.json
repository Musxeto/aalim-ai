  "transcript": "awesome it's uh Ramsey Weber I'm a sales engineer you may remember me from Saudi for their great speech my son was so excited he wants to die now and go into Jenna uh but real quick Sheik I mean many times we see on the TV uh many kids from non-muslim countries dying as we saw last week in the news with the fairy disaster almost 200 kids dying uh as a coping mechanism that I use when I see such things I always think that these kids have been picked to go to heaven because they die before reaching puberty um can you just elaborate on that maybe really quick about this thought process which I go through and I imagine many other Muslims uh might use this as a coping mechanism also uh that these kids in non-muslim countries that pass away before puberty are in heaven um it's an issue of dispute and this is the easiest way of getting out of trouble whenever someone asks me what's the ruling on this it's an issue of dispute alhamdulillah so I'm Saved by the Bell no actually it is an issue of dispute and in a nutshell we as Muslims cannot say that this individual is in Jenna or this individual is in hell not even XYZ of a cafer country or a leader I cannot say I do not have card blanch to put people in Jenna or in Hell otherwise I would have been much richer than I am I wouldn't be here speaking to you but the fact is we can only say that Abu Bakr is in J is in J is in is in is in J etc those whom the prophet told us we hopeful and Wishful that people who died after being righteous and Pious that will be in gender but we cannot affirm that say yes definitely he's in Jenna so from this general rule Scholars differed when it came to the children whether of the Believers or the disbelievers the disbelievers the majority say that they're in Jenna why because they follow their parents and by default they're Muslims they're admitted to Jenna but there is a Hadith of may Allah be pleased with her and another evidences that restrict us again saying this we are hopeful and Wishful also for the disbelieving children who did not reach the age of puberty Allah Asel did not hold them accountable yet so how can Allah punish them we do not say that Allah will punish them and yet we do not say that Allah would admit these specific individuals XY Z into Jenna however we can simply say all children are in Jenna Believers or disbelievers who did not reach the age of puberty they are in Jenna okay what about Tom the son of John the son of Mark Luke Etc I don't know about Tom he died when he was four or five years of age but generally speaking all children are in Jenna so you see the difference I don't specifically say Abdallah the son of my friend fared died who was 60 years of age he's in Jenna no I do not say this because it's not my right I say all children who die under the age of puberty inshallah are in Jen"
