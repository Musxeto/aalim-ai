  "transcript": "abdulrahman from india okay so sheikh today i have a question uh it is regarding the inheritance uh as mentioned in quran chapter 4 verse 11 and 176 as it is written over here they say uh the the usually apologists who who speak against islam they say that when we add the total uh like two thirds for daughters one sixth per mother and one six father one eight something like that for life so it it goes above the sum like it grows 1.25 instead of one and they say a concept of all is not there and all of these things so how does it respond to this and they say this is uh the mathematical contradiction in quran and how is this possible so how how do we answer this question sir okay i will answer inshallah says from india there is a controversy where non-muslims bring doubts that the issue of and how to correct whenever there is a need of correction when the distribution of inheritance is divided these people don't know anything about islam how do you listen to such people all the rulings of sharia the only thing that they found a loophole as they claim is this this was discussed by the companions themselves by the taberain it was made clear to everyone one and the consensus of muslim scholars and the muslim ummah is to fix it and it's a very minute branch of inheritance of very small when there is a father when there is a husband and a mother and daughters for example this is when we have to adjust the percentage but everything else 99.9 is crystal clear and mentioned so don't listen to these people when they're ignorant"
