  "transcript": "Hamza from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I was just wondering the meaning of this Hadith It says Allah says I am just as much slave thinks I am. So I was just wondering does this mean like If I think of Allah as Merciful, He'll be Merciful. If I think of Allah as Punishing, He'll be punishing me or I was wondering this like what the meaning of this Hadith The Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam Allah says I as my servant thinks of me. So let him think whatever he wants Meaning that Allah Azza Wa Jal is self-sufficient if you think negatively of Allah Then Allah Azza Wa Jal would deal with you in such a negative fashion some people say I Do not ask Allah Azza Wa Jal to grant me success in tomorrow's interview Why? He says every time I ask Allah for something the opposite happens so this is Something that he's saying sometimes we dare not say it. It's in our Subconscious whenever we make Dua Allah is not gonna make it happen. So I'm not gonna make Dua Audhu billah this is close to Kufr as If you're accusing Allah Azza Wa Jal of playing with you and Doing what you don't want and such negative thinking of Allah Azza Wa Jal is Despicable How would you how dare you think of Allah in such a negative way? rather a Muslim always thinks positively of Allah and this is how the Prophet used to be Alayhis Salatu Wassalam whenever someone While the Prophet was traveling Calls another person not related to the Prophet or those who's with him someone random says Ya Falah Ya Najeeh Relating to success the name of the man is Falah or Najeeh Which means prosperity or success the Prophet used to become happy and Believe that this is a glad tithing from Allah in the conquest not in the conquest of Mecca in Sulh Al-Hudaibiyah the treaty the covenant of Al-Hudaibiyah When they were blocked from going for Umrah one of the Mediators who came to negotiate His name was Sahl So when the Prophet Came to know that his name was Sahl. He said Sahl means easy so the Prophet said Alhamdulillah now Negotiations will be easy so this all Shows us that we should think positively of Allah no matter what happens and this is the meaning of the Hadith and Allah knows best"
