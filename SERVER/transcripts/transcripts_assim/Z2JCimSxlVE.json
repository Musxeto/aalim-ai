  "title": "Gates of hell closed & devils chained in Ramadan, what about jinn who do possession? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign does this also apply to the Jinn uh that are involved in possession in black magic or some Assad on an individual that does this also apply to those Gins um uh yeah the prophet Allah said that when Ramadan is due the gates of hell are closed and the gates of paradise are open and the Masters of Jinn are chained so that they would not be able to do what they used to do before Ramadan so this does not mean as so many of us think that whoops there are no Devils no Jinn no possession no Whispering of shaytan no the prophet did not say that and what we see and observe definitely confirms that he did not mean that what he meant was the evil is reduced in Ramadan and 11 months of the year we see the Devils doing whatever they want to do and the amount of evil is so high while during Ramadan they are subdued and the amount of evil is way reduced than before but there is still evil so they still whisper they still possess they still do their evil things but on a much lighter and smaller scale than outside of Ramadan and Allah Knows Best"
