  "title": "What is the ruling on Insurance? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and the last question is very straightforward what is ruling on insurance what is insurance you have property insurance you have life insurance you have car insurance anything basically you can insure so if I'm a celebrity and my beard is long I can insure it if I'm a singer I insure my throat if I'm a dancer I insure my legs etc this is the trend nowadays insure anything what is the concept of insurance the concept of insurance is you pay a premium and for a whole year we will cover you and we will give you great huge amounts far exceeding what you have given us what is your take in this how do you make money it's none of your business so what do you think come to think of it it's worth the risk it's like walking on the street someone comes to you and said the grand lottery buy a lottery ticket for $1 and you get the chance to hit the jackpot for a million dollars what is $1 nothing I'm willing to give it away in some airports whenever I travel to that particular Airport they have a Porsche or a db7 Aston Martin or the likes of these supercars and they say only 2,000 participants will be in a draw all you have to pay is 500 of the currency of that country peanuts so you feel greedy and you think will I be happy will I be lucky and you pay it this is gambling this is Mesa which is haraam and a major sin and a large el combined it with intoxications with intoxicants with wine a hammer well Mesa so insurance basically is paying a premium of a thousand or two thousand and they cover you up to a million and if you look at the ratio you think that it's worthwhile but at the end of the year nothing happens you lose your two thousand if in the middle of the year you make an accident or something bad happens they cover you for a million and how do they do this they try their level best to gather as many customers as they can and they know that only like 5% or 10% will have an accident this is totally prohibited is there a way Abdullah from Libya was asking about insurance and just before the break I replied to him and answered him that this is a form of lottery and it's not the simple type of lottery but rather it's complicated as it involves RIBA as well and banks and insurance companies they make a lot of money because they tend to lure the glede in people into joining them now is all insurance how long the answer is generally speaking yes however some scholars say that the tech careful the cooperative form of insurance is halan unfortunately this is theoretical but what do we mean by cooperative cooperative in the sense that a thousand people gather and each one of them puts a thousand euros as insurance so now they have of a million euros in a portfolio in a pot in a wallet on whatever they agree upon themselves that we thousand Muslims whoever has an accident will take whatever he needs to stand up on his feet back again co-operative insurance means that if within a month or two something happened in the town we live in our houses were burnt so we take from this portfolio or from this wallet and if the money runs out the whole million euros are gone no one can come after a week or two and says listen I have contributed with a thousand euros a couple of months ago and now my car has an accident and I need money to fix it we simply say we don't have any money this is true cooperative insurance because there is no benefits and there are no strings attached the money is gone it's gone so many times it can happen that the whole year nothing happens so the following year we have two Millions and the third and the fourth and eventually it grows but there is no profit it's a nonprofit organization this is Helen what is happening in the so called Islamic operative insurance companies that they have CEOs with a high salary maybe six digits maybe more they have bonuses they have executives they have shareholders so now this is not for the benefit of the society this is not nonprofit it be came a profit oriented and this is if you come after nine months and they ran out of money it states in the contract that we will borrow from the shareholders a year or two someone else will lend us money and then we will compensate them from the profits etc so this is not cooperative at all and I believe that it is not permissible however in the vast majority of countries worldwide Muslims and non-muslims alike they may mandate insurance upon you if you don't they will find you and maybe they will imprison you in this case scholars say that you may insure out of the necessity so that you would save your neck as in the case of the third-party insurance of cars so this insurance is covering the one you hit or may have an accident with so if I hit someone's car my insurance fixes his car not mine so this is called third party insurance and this is mandatory on almost all countries worldwide so scholars say that either this or pay a fine or maybe go to prison no pay it and you can utilize it but when it's voluntary when the country does not mandate health insurance and you opt for it just for the sake of saving money definitely paying 2,000 or 1000 euros a year and then get MRIs and get surgeries and and pregnancy tests and labor and cetera all of this is far greater so people again would become greedy and would like to take it this is not permissible if it's mandated by law then you should obey the law and in the sin is upon them and Allah knows best"
