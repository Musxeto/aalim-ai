  "transcript": "Sadia says it is true is it true that we must not recite Quran during forbidden times again instead of giving you a fish every day it's best for me to teach you how to fish anyone who gives you such a claim he says it's forbidden to recite the Quran during forbidden times I said okay what is your evidence he says I heard this so I heard that the earth was flat does it make it true I heard that there are aliens among us does it make it true not everything that we hear is true so those who make such a claim will fail to provide you with any true or authentic evidence because what is prohibited in the forbidden times is praying so the prophet alayhi salatu salam prohibited us from offering voluntary prayers after us or time till the Sun sets and after Fajr prayer until the Sun rises so these are the forbidden times alongside with ten minutes before the whole time these are the forbidden times to do what to offer prayer what kind of prayer only voluntary prayer but prayers that have a reason for their not a problem so if I make power off after fajar do I pray 2 rakats behind the maqam Ibrahim though the Sun has not risen yet yes the answer is yes if I enter a Masjid after a sir and I'd like to sit until mother do I pray 2 rakaats the Hagin message it sure is yes if there's a funeral prayer after us of salat do we offer it or we say that this is forbidden times we offer it if there is a Clips of the Sun do we offer it or say that this is from in time if there were to be an eclipse then we offer it so to combine what is prohibited is general voluntary prayers that have no cause or reason except seeking throw up seeking as you're seeking reward but to recite the Quran there is no time at all during the day or night that is prohibited for you to recite the Quran you can do that whenever you want of course there are exceptions if someone says I'd like to recite the Quran while praying for her behind the imam from almost half this is not permissible if someone says the imam is giving hot ba of Juma and I'd like to recite the Quran this defies the purpose of attending Friday sermon and listening to the mmm now I'm talking about the forbidden times which Selita mentioned"
