  "transcript": "[Music] um i think we have salheim they're having they're making an issue out of this and they're upset because she's not showing her face to them and they're saying things like showing the face is permissible islam and they we are like her father and even during hajj they show the face etc etc so my question is how can i best handle the situation and make them understand inshaallah and without harming the tithe of my kinship and please make a door for them for the guidance in allah i will inshallah i will canada says my wife wears the niqab and my uncles are quite upset why doesn't she unveil her face and why is she doubting us why are you doubting us and not allowing her to show her first to us this is not what the scholars say blah blah blah first of all this is the right to ask but it is your right to abide but but by what you believe so in islam a woman's face is an issue of dispute whether it's aura or not and in so many previous answers and lectures i have tried my level best to explain from the quran and from the sunnah and from the opinions of great scholars of islam such abnetamia that a woman has to cover her face and this is the most authentic opinion now if i am convinced of a particular opinion and you think differently i'm not obliged to obey you i'm obliged to do whatever frees me from hellfire on the day of judgment and this is my conviction so if i believe that sinful i will not do it and likewise so many times in the west women are offended when we men refuse to shake hands why are you offended so no this is not respectful who decides what's respectful or not so if someone wants to go a little bit further instead of shaking hands kissing on the cheeks or hugging would that be appropriate or touching any part of a woman's body would that be appropriate no this is inappropriate then why do you define what's appropriate and what's not according to your own worms and desires if i refrain from something because it's against my religion and my conviction you should respect this you say no you there is equality you have to shake hands with me someone says okay you have to give me a lap dance what is this this is totally unacceptable if i am lactose intolerant and you offer me milk and i refrain are you gonna shove it down my throat or you're gonna accept my decision you're gonna accept it because this is dangerous physically and medically for me shaking hands with opposite gender is dangerous for me religiously it will take me to hell and asking me to uncover my wife's face despite all the explanations from the quran the sunnah is also the same issue so you try your level best but at the end of the day ask people do you want me to follow sharia or do you want me to follow your whims and desires they will all say sharia in this case alhamdulillah our point of reference is sharia and in your view and mine it's an issue of dispute what makes yours stronger than mine and at the end of the day she's my wife i'm entitled to follow the opinion that i believe in with your wives you follow the opinion you want but you don't have the right to force me to follow what you think you"
