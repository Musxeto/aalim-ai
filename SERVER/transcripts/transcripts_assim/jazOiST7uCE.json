  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the U.S how's it going today doing great alhamdulillah   Sheikh um I learned the supplication a while back \nwhich has been circulating online for a while now   and it goes like this\n[ __ ]  and both are to be said three times after \ncompleting each mandatory prayer and before   going to bed it is said that the reward of \nreciting the supplication is that these words   will illuminate your grave and that these words \nwill also illuminate a Muslim's path on the Sarat   now these are very big rewards just for reciting \nthese words but I'm not sure if this Hadith is   authentic may you please shed some light on this \nthank you I wish it were uh authentic because it's   so little with great reward but unfortunately it's \nnot if it were authentic we would have circulated   it and highlighted it and encouraged people to \nsay it because the meaning is fine but it's not in   accordance to the authentic Sunnah so it's not uh \nverified and hence we should not say such things   because the authentic Hadith and athkaar are many \nand we can um it can suffice us with bi'thn Allah and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
