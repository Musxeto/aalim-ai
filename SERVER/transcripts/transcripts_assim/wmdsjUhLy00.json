  "transcript": "fil sh we know that Prophet used to seek for seek refuse from the knowledge that's not beneficial correct right so what will be the ruling on the knowledge that uh India especially in Indian education system is that way they teach us about the biographies about the famous people and force us to memorize it okay so uh fil's or fil's question is Crystal Clear we have a curriculum in school we have 15 subjects beneficial subjects such as biology chemistry physics uh language Etc but we have one or two subjects that we're forced to study otherwise will not be able to graduate that speaks about Hindus or sik or things that that are have no benefit none whatsoever for us Muslims we're obliged to do it in order to pass the exams and this is a problem if we say okay we seek refuge in Allah from knowledge that's not beneficial and yet we have to quit school then we will remain to be genitors and trash collectors for the rest of our lives not that these professions are bad but they're not what we aspire to we want to serve the ummah and the community and they are serving the um and the community but not like a surgeon or a doctor or engineer is so you have high aspirations but if I study these unbeneficial Sciences or knowledge due to being compelled to do this inshallah it's a win-win and Allah Knows Best"
