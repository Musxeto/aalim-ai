  "transcript": "Shammi mice's if the Masjid is 20 to 25 minutes away by foot from man's house would he be required to go and pray the answer is usually no because this distance is so far that if mo Advan goes on top of the Masjid in a village where there are no high-rises no cement blocks no double-glazed glass windows there is no cars there is no obstruction of his voice and he would call the I that it would not reach that distance and the Prophet made it obligatory alayhi salatu wassalam providing that you hear that event so the distance the hear that I then not with loudspeakers that could reach 10 or 15 kilometers no this is not logical hearing the Adhan which is given by the voice of a normal person in normal circumstances there for 20 to 25 minutes away by foot makes it not mandatory for him to pray in the masjid"
