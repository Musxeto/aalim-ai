  "transcript": "um can you raise your hand when you say the Dua question is this a prescribed Dua or a general Dua that was mentioned in the Hadith a general Dua so any general Dua you can raise your hands and say it without any problem if it was part of thear of morning and evening I would say don't because when the prophet said it he never raised his hands but if it's a general Dua for example I'm sitting in the Masjid thean is called and between the time of thean and the I have enough time to make Dua I raise my hand and say this Dua or I say or I say I say any Dua that is nice and not prescribed at a particular time with a particular format rather it's a general Dua no problem raising your hands"
