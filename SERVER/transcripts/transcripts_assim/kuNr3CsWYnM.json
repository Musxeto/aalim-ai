  "transcript": "Consider Subscribing 😄 Adi Conell from Nigeria? uh, so \nuh my question is, can one em   journey to the Haram just for the purpose \nof you know, making dua to uh Allah to   you know uplift a certain affliction that is \naffecting a certain person? Or in other words,   can one name you know go to umrah and then use it \nas a tawasul um for Allah to lift that affliction   or would that be considered an innovation? \nJazakum Allahu Khairan Sheikh [Sheikh] Wa Jazakum] So the question is, can I go to Haram and \nmake dua so Allah that would uplift my   whatever calamity I'm suffering from or can \nI make umrah, and after finishing the umrah   ask Allah using the Wasilla of my umrah \nsaying that o Allah I have performed umrah and   I ask you with this umrah that I have \npresented which is a good deed of mine,   specifically for yours sincerely to you \nthat you uplift this calamity that have had   before uh befallen upon me? Is this \npermissible? The answer is yes,   there's no problem in using your good deeds \nas a wasilla there's no problem in choosing   a blessed sanctuary like mecca like al-haram like \nel-kaba or doing it through the tawaf which or the   sa'ii which is highly advisable to do ask Allah \nfor such things and Allah Azza wa jal knows best."
