  "transcript": "um at the time of marriage with the with a lady the father was nowhere to be found so the mother lives with the daughter and the the brothers and so we couldn't console the father so the brother approved and the marriage went ahead a couple of years later the father came along initially it um happy but later on he approved does the marriage have to be repeated or that's sufficient okay first of all the prophet said allah there is no marriage without the presence of a guardian a welly and no one can override the weli or the guardian's permission just because he was not found or because they don't want to so what you what they have done was wrong and the marriage where the brother of the bride was her guardian is debatable and most jurors would say that it was invalid because they have overridden their original guardians approval and consent only the father can give his daughter in marriage if he was not to be found anywhere they tried desperately then they should go to the muslim court or to the islamic center the authorized islamic center and consult the authorities what to do if the authorities are convinced because most if not all such similar cases the girl wants to marry the boy they don't want to tell the father because they know the father would not agree they tried to give him a call once or twice after midnight and the mobile was off so they said we tried our level best let's get it over with and this is a trick that does not pass upon allah so if he is now accepting then they should renew the marriage contract with him being the guardian proposing to the uh the man that i'm giving you my daughter in marriage and he accepts in the presence of two male witnesses and this insha allah would rectify things may allah forgive them all sad"
