  "title": "How can I balance between Deen & Dunya? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "fez from india he says how to balance between deen and dunya and this question actually requires a lecture you cannot answer this in a q a session why it's a lifestyle allah tells us in the quran [Music] this is the advice of the scholars of the children of israel to arun one of the wealthiest men at the con at the time of prophet musa peace be upon him so they told him whatever allah has given you seek with it the hereafter but at the same time do not neglect your portion which is a very small part of it of this dunya so yes we here on this earth have a mission and vision we have a target to fulfill we have a place that we're traveling to now if we focus as travelers on settling in a city that we drove through and buying property and getting married we will compromise our journey we will never reach our destination so while we're traveling we have to always put our focus on our destination yet manage to eat drink and rest so that we can succeed in accomplishing our mission and vision and reaching our destination by saying this this life has requirements these requirements must not contradict with my journey to the hereafter so anything that is haram i have to cross it out anything that would make me compromise an obligatory act i have to cross it out my priorities are set by pleasing allah azzawajal reaching jannah following the sunnah and whatever comes afterwards is for this dunya so there's nothing wrong in becoming a doctor or an engineer or a pilot or a lawyer as long as i'm not doing anything haram there's nothing wrong in making a good salary from a job or buying a big house or having a car or two or getting married and having children though i know that i'm departing and leaving all of this but this is part of living on earth this is the portion that you must not neglect now at the same time i have to see how to balance and this was mentioned clearly in the hadith of the prophet islam when he advised abdullah ibn abram may allah be pleased with him and with his father and also the same advice identical advice was given by a buddha by was given by salman al-pharisi to his brother the hadith is identical your lord has rights over you so this is religious your wife has rights of you your guest has rights of you over you so this is social your body has rights of you so this is health related so give each its due right this is the balance that you have to manage and secure those who manage to do that they are the happiest people living on earth those who manage to please their wives their spouses and children and to please their relatives and kin those who are uh able to please allah by offering the obligations and staying away from haram offering night prayer fasting mondays and thursdays giving charity etc those who manage to take good care of their health by working out by eating good diet etc those who work and manage to earn and make halal money at the same time they have the correct cocktail that would give them earthly and worldly happiness which would definitely lead them to the happiness of the hereafter and i think we have on uh my youtube channel a lecture by the name of the balance in islam the fear"
