  "transcript": "can kids sleep in on the weekend both kids get exhausted and need to get some extra sleep my husband stands and yells outside the bedroom for our oldest to get up even though she may be exhausted from lack of sleep School Etc this is something that the parents should work out sleeping as sleeping is permissible whether you sleep in the day or in the night this is up to you providing that you pray on time and you do not leave out any of the mandatory things in Islam so if they're praying on time and they go to sleep and there aren't any negative consequences such as sleeping the whole of the day part of the night and then stay up late until fer time awake while the parents are asleep working on their uh internet or browsing or watching something that the parents may not know of no this is wrong but to oversleep a little bit instead of waking at 6:00 a.m. they pray and they go to bed and they wake up like 11:00 this is okay"
