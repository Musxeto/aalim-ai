  "transcript": "yes it says I did my Woodill and started my salah and then in the middle of it I remembered and I was confused whether I wiped over my head during Moodle or not what should I do the answer is ignore these wish wasps as long as the whispering of Shaitaan came to you after you completed the avada you ignore it in power off I made seven rounds I finished my toe off I went to sigh I finished my site on the way back in my car Shaitaan came to me said hey maybe you did six rounds around the Kaaba and not seven the badder the worship is over so neglect and do not look back because this doubt has no value and fine"
