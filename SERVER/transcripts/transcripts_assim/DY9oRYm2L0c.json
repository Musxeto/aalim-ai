  "transcript": "thank you um dear brothers and sisters and welcome to Mercy to Mankind last time we met we talked about the very first words that were revealed to our messenger Muhammad with these words our Prophet became a prophet these words were a declaration of his prophethood the instruction was to recite to read and this indicates that our religion promotes knowledge and by far our religion is based on knowledge the more you know the better at the side of Allah you are and that is why Allah Almighty says verily those who know are not equal to those who do not know so we are encouraged to pursue knowledge where whenever it is possible and there are priorities your first priority would be to study the knowledge of Quran and Sunnah to know what your lord what your creator wants from you and from there you may go on to explore other forms of knowledge that may Grant you the strength and power that may Enlighten you about the things that surround you and following the read recite following immediately Allah Almighty said in the name of your Lord that means that we should start with the name of Allah of course every work well this means that recite beginning with so you start by Bismillah and that is why whenever we want to do something almost everything we start by saying Bismillah before I recite the Quran I say Bismillah before I eat I say Bismillah before I enter the the toilet I say Bismillah before intercoursing Bismillah whenever you write in your car Bismillah and so on because this means that in the name of Allah I recite in the name of Allah I eat in the name of Allah I do this so there is Hadith every deed that did not begin with does not begin with the in the name of Allah or something that is missing out of it but this Hadith is not authentic though our Scholars and and and and great men of knowledge always begin their talk by saying Bismillah but the agreed upon is that you should begin with alhamdulillah praising Allah but to begin your discussion or whatever you want to do by saying Bismillah is a very a great thing going back to our story The Prophet salallahu descended from his cave came straight into his house shivering trembling of fear asking his wife Khadijah to put a a blanket on him that would give him some warmth and he started saying zameluni cover me so when he come down Khadijah asked him what was wrong so he told her what happened and he also expressed his fear to her saying that I was afraid I was going to die so she comforted him as any good wife would do and compare what she did to what nowadays wives would do to their husbands instead of nagging blaming or saying you deserve what you get this is the least that you get or you're insane or you're crazy no Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her comforted her husband saying by Allah Allah will not abandon you Allah will not let you die or suffer because there are so many attributes that are so positive and good you have these characteristics that are filled with Mercy that Allah will not let you go you give the poor money you feed the hungry you help the needy you always connect your next of Ken by seeing if they need anything you provide them with them there are so many things in you that Allah will not abandon you by by far so also the wisdom was in Hadith Behavior when she gave the prophet Muhammad the time to rest to have rest cover him after that she interrogated if you may well it's not an interrogation she asked him what happened after he calmed down and this is exactly the thing that we should do whenever we find someone in in trouble what should we do with their husbands husbands or or others if someone is is shouting in in in a very nervous condition it is not appropriate to go and talk to him or say something that may increase that you should try to calm him down try to get him to to to to be normal relaxation and then you may address him that's that's a very that's valid and good point now Khadijah thought that the best thing to do was to take her husband to her cousin she had a cousin his name was waraka David Nelson and waraka was a Christian he was an Arab but he was learned and learned Christian that read the Old Testaments and the New Testament and got knowledge of the people of the book but when Khadijah went to him he was over 80 he was blinded and he was very old so Khadijah took her husband and went to waraka and said oh cousin listen to what your nephew has to say he wasn't his nephew but this is the custom of the Arabs we Arabs look at the elderlies and call them uncle uncle and we look at our the children who are younger than us and we call them nephews because our son because this is out of respect and this is one of the things that we are proud whenever we talk to the West we say look at the amount of respect we have to the elderlies and look at the amount of Mercy when we talk to the young ones our Prophet sallallahu alaihi said he is not among us he is not among us meaning the Muslims whom he does not respect the elderlies and have kindness and mercy to the young ones so whoever does not respect the elderlies is not considered to be from the followers of of uh of the Prophet saws it doesn't nullify his Islam he's a Muslim but he's a bad one he's not a good and Pious Muslim so Khadijah told waraka listen to your nephew as the prophet sallam what do we see so he told him that he saw this man who told him so and so and so immediately waraka realized this and said by Allah this is Moses this is the the angel that came to Moses this is the Archangel Gabriel I wish and I pray I was young so that I would could I could defend you when your people throw you out their City so the prophet sallam said in in in in a very uh uh astonished voice are they going to try to try to uh send me out of their City kick me out of it and said indeed they will no one ever came with the same teachings that you are teaching and was not faced with enmity from his people so this is the Sunnah this is the custom this is the tradition of with all the messengers of Allah no messenger according to our knowledge was received with love and kisses every messenger that was sent to his people was shun was a thought was abused and insulted so this is the custom so the prophet saws knew that this was not an easy thing to do and he was being prepared to receive on and on Revelations from Allah we see that was Christian yet he was moderate he did not ignore what he was reading what he has written in in the gospel or in the Bible and he admit that Prophet Muhammad sallam will be the messenger this is quite uh true we are told not as we see nowadays from yeah this is why in the Quran we are told that the closest to us as Muslims are the Christians and the worst enemies of the Muslims or the most hatred the most people that hate Muslims are the Jews and the pagans this is stated in the Quran in black and white so Christians are the closest to Muslims because we have so much in common not all Christians some some of them are Madrid now I'm not talking about being mothers or not I'm talking about being close to us the Christians are closer to us than any other denomination they are closer to us than the Jews than the pagans than uh the atheists and so on and that is why Allah has stated in the very beginning of Surah that the Believers the Muslims are happy with the victory of the Romans who are Christians over the persons who are fire worshipers because Allah says at the very beginning that the Romans have been defeated but in few years time they will be Victorious and they will defeat the Persians it was normal that the Muslims felt happy because the Christians won because they are from the same uh um not from the same denomination but the other people of the book they have the scriptures as we do have our scriptures they have the religion of Jesus Christ who is one of the greatest messengers of Allah as Muhammad is one of the greatest messengers of Allah so they're close to us who was a Christian founded in black and white so that is why he accepted it and that is why the prophet saws told us later on when when he was asked about he told us that he saw him in Paradise which meant that he was accepted by Allah azzawajal because he accepted the prophet salallahu unfortunately he died soon afterwards and he wanted to be young to be able to protect the prophet Allah this by itself was a good intention for him that qualified him to enter Paradise because he believed in the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam this was the case now the floor the prophet saws is ready to get more Revelations and this is inshallah what we will talk about just after the break if you're 18 or if you're 18. if you've been Muslim for 50 years or five minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day our foreheads touched the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people better Muslims we want to serve Allah Almighty with all our hearts in the show let's talk every week we're going to talk about Islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve Allah we'll have Studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk at hooda.tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart is the show for you assalamu alaikum and welcome back after the event with novel The Prophet sallallahu felt that this thing was serious he waited for three or four more days hoping that he would be revealed to again some stories say that the revelation was disconnected stopped for a period of six months time and this is an exaggeration the authentic stories say that it was posed for two days or three at maximum and during these two or three days the prophet sallam used to climb up the mountains and look at the sky waiting to see the angel coming with to him with revelation some narrations that are not acceptable they are unacceptable to us as Muslims and they are unauthentic say that the prophet sallam almost threw himself from these mountains because he was not revealed to but these are unauthentic and it's not accepted the prophet saws was a very sound person A very wise person he would not kill himself for such a thing and this would not come suicide would not come from a wise person two or three days the pause of the Revelation and then the angel came back again to the prophet sallallahu with a particular message but before that while he was looking at the skies he saw jabriel for the first time in his original format he saw he said he's saying he's telling us I saw him sitting on a throne blocking the Horizon nothing can block your horizon unless it is really really huge and I saw this angel with 600 wings and from These Wings they were falling emeralds Jewels pearls and so on so this scenery is unimaginable words cannot give okay yes at all it cannot but the prophet sallam was startled with what he has seen because it was not a normal thing and definitely it has this impact on a person so he went back again to the mother of the Believers and saying Cover Me Again cover me cover me and then this was revealed to him Allah Almighty says what means oh you wrapped up in a mantle or garment arise and deliver your warning so Allah is telling him don't stay as you are it's time for you to tell the people and warn them and your lord do you magnify and your garments keep free from staying and all Abomination shun nor expect in giving any increase for yourself but for your Lord's cause be patient and constant so the minute this was revealed to our Prophet Allah he knew that it is time for him to spread the message of Allah and by these words he entered the uh the phase of being a messenger also there are some advices on this beautiful and the great verses the two Prophet Muhammad to those who followed him after his death like and your garments keep free from Steam something yes that urges us to keep clean all the time and the clean is is a characteristic of Muslim by far this is true but before cleaning your garments you have to clear your inside yes and the best way to clean your inside is by believing in the Oneness of Allah in Surat Toba Allah Almighty says verily that those pagans are not just which means filth or impure they are clean from the outside they have nice per they're wearing nice perfumes but they are still considered to be filth and not just impure why is that because inside them is the association of others with Allah azzawajal and the most important thing for a Muslim is to be Purity our religion is a religion of Purity and that is why once a person says the shahada the testimony he is ordered to take a total bath an obligatory bath so as he cleaned and cleansed his inside with believing in the Oneness of Allah now he is ordered to cleansea what affirm that what after and all um all Idols you have to stay away from now having said that it is essential for Muslims to always purify their garments and bodies and that is why if you compare and and this might sound gross to someone but if you compare the underways of Muslims to the underways of non-muslims you will find the the difference hugely it is not acceptable for a Muslim to have a stain of impurity of urine or of uh uh uh defecation any kind of impurities in his underwear or in her on his clothes so the Muslims are clean inside and out and that is why they whenever answering the call of nature wash themselves purify themselves not because it's nice and clean because they are ordered to do so from these words we can also learn that Allah azzawajal instructed our prophet and of course instructed us to glorify Allah by saying Allahu Akbar Allah is greater Allah is the greatest so by doing this we glorify by glorifying Allah everything else becomes minute and small once you have one thing in your mind that you glorify that you think highly of everything else becomes a next to it and that is why Muslims all over the world need to decide these verses and need to behave accordingly they have to glorify glorify Allah azzawajal and think highly of their lord subhanahu and also in these verses Allah says nor expect in giving any increase for yourself which means that when whatever you do don't think of it as being great or expecting reward for yourself and this adds a lot of value to those who are performing dawa who are engaged in calling people to Islam if they think that they've done enough and they sit back to relax then they have not done anything yet because whatever you do it should be for the sake of Allah and you should not look back and say well I did a lot of good things in my life and and I think this is about it there are some narrations which states that the prophet salallahu after being revealed these words he told who told him come to bed let's let's rest and sleep he told her oh hadija the time of sleeping has gone away no more sleeping it is now time for us to start and making dawa and calling people to Islam last question regarding the verse arise and deliver the message is that something special to the prophet Muhammad or any Muslim to arise and call non-muslims um okay this is a very good question because this is the essence why we are studying the seera now the Sierra tells us about different stages at a time and life of the Prophet so by studying each portion we can apply this to our lives for example if we are living in the West and people are preventing us from worshiping Allah not in the west let's say in the Eastern Bloc 30 years ago just before the um the fall of the Berlin wall and the prostrika and so on or whatever they call it 30 or four or more years ago people could not practice Islam they could not pray in mosques because they did not have any mosques they could not obtain or or have a copy of the Holy Quran and whoever they have this copy of Quran will be prosecuted and probably uh thrown into jail if not executed this was 20 or 30 years ago in Eastern Europe unfortunately this is still the case in some Arab countries where they prosecute where they uh uh oppress those who worship Allah once you study the Sierra and you find that there are different phases in the city of the Prophet sallallahu you believe and you know that this is the time for you to apply the secret phase of a dawah of calling people to Islam so it is not wise for you to go and tell everybody come to Islam and then they throw you to jail or execute you you're not doing anything harmful you're not doing anything that is considered to be a terrorist activity you are just worshiping your lord yet there are people who deny you this right so in this case you call to Allah azzawajal but in hiding in secrecy don't show people that you're a strong Muslim or a committed Muslim be like everybody else in order for you to uh uh uh set the floor for a better community cries and warn thy people this is for everybody but it depends where they're coming from it depends who are who they are communicating with it is a must for us to spread the word of Islam but spreading it does not mean that you and you should have a TV program of your own this is one small aspect of dawa there are spreading books there are communicating with people on the internet there are spreading tapes there are showing people what Islam really is by your conduct Yeah by yourself by being a good example by being the perfect example of a Muslim when saying the truth behaving the things acting in the manner that you're supposed to and I think it is the most influential method is to be a good example of course indeed it is the best way of spreading the the the The Message of Islam by being a good Muslim I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time mm-hmm
