  "transcript": "um Amina From the Emirates so I do wash my hair once a week and I spend a lot of time to wash it like big conditioning so sometimes I have uh water in my ear um can I do this when I'm fasting or my fast is broken if I have water in my ear if you if you eat and drink through your ear no the fasting is is broken but nobody drinks and eats from their ear because the ear is not a normal passage to the stomach nor your eye nor the ornaments I put on my feet and I find the taste in my um uh my throat all of these are not normal passages to my stomach so the only thing that would invalidate my prayer My fasting is what goes in my mouth or through my nose because these are passages to your stomach and Allah Knows Best"
