  "title": "Taking money from Groom during wedding customs & games halal for us? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "from bangladesh he says we have a tradition in bangladesh that is when the groom comes to collect his wife we build like an arch and he goes in and on the side of the entrance there are the relatives the brothers the nephews the cousins and it's a tradition that he hands money to them and some scholars say that this is haram because we don't know whether he is giving this money willingly or not so is it permissible for me to take this money well if the guy is giving it out with a big smile and he's rich and he's giving you like 10 teka not giving you a lot of money something symbolic and he's happy there's no problem in taking it but if he's marching with a grim face and you feel that his soul is coming with every banknote he is handing to you then it is not permissible to take it generally speaking it's a cultural thing if it's not related to hindus or to disbelievers there is no problem in that providing it's within norm with it within reason is not giving a thousand dollars each he's giving them peanuts or pennies just symbolic there's no problem with it inshallah"
