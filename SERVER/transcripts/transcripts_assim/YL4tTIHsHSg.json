  "transcript": "manha says can a Muslim woman join a Muslim Army when does it become mandatory upon everyone including women to fight against the enemy I don't know what kind of a Muslim Army would employ women what would women do in a Muslim Army entertainment give me a break if Allah made the segregation in Salat mandatory between men and women how could women work in the armed forces or secretaries only which means that they have to mix with men and not any type of men with officers with brass generals captains Majors uh whatever and what do you expect them to how they would treat women but if you say no she she becomes a fighter she becomes this becomes that no this is totally prohibited in Islam to assume a fighting position is totally out of the question a woman is not allowed to fight in a Muslim Army she's only allowed to fight when her Town her home is being invaded in this case every man woman and child must take arms to defend themselves providing that it is within within their capacity and that is after weighing the pros and cons whether it would lead to their annihilation in total or there is a possibility of having some form of resistance and fighting it depends but generally speaking in offensive Wars or to enlist in the Army it's totally prohibited for women to do such jobs that would require them to uh mix with the opposite gender"
