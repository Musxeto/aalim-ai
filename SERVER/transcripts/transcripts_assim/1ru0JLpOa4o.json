  "title": "There is a fake beggar, can I post her picture online & warn people against her? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so rashad or rasheed is warning from a beggar who's a professional claiming that she's a refugee and taking people's money unlawfully by begging so is it permissible to expose her on facebook i would say that this is not a natural thing to do and posting a photograph of a woman is haram whether she's an imposter or not secondly this was not done in a large scale among the muslims and thirdly you would give her more publicity by doing this and a lot of the people do heinous things for publicity so i would recommend that you may warn the people if the masjid not necessarily the globe on a facebook post"
