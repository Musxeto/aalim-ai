  "title": "Should I leave Pharmacology because of the Haram ingredients in Medicine",
  "transcript": "uh idris says i'm contemplating on leaving uh studying pharmaceutical of uh pharmacy i don't know what what's the noun of it who cares so you know what he said he studies uh to become a pharmacist and he's afraid that the vast majority of component to be sold in a pharmacies haram because they have glycerin and they have gelatin and they have components that may have pork in their ingredients and this is a problematic issue which scholars have two different opinions one say that it's totally haram to work and to use any such ingredients and the other part of party say that such ingredients have undergone a rigorous vigorous process of changing their chemical and physical characteristics so now it's a new substance altogether so it's the concept of istihad and there are different fatwas on this and this seems to me to be the most logical choice instead of saying to people that don't work in uh pharmaceutical companies don't sell drugs don't consume drugs that and look into all food products that you have that has glycerin and or gelatin and this is haram stay away from it this makes life too difficult and whenever things are so difficult sharia makes it wider and easier for people and allah knows best"
