  "title": "My clarification about drinking beer & percentage of alcohol in drinks and food - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Dola says there's a video on the internet where you said two to three percent of alcohol in a drink is okay and he'll add is this true first of all there is no such video on my youtube channel yes there was a segment that I did maybe eight years ago or or something like that eight or nine years ago and it was on ask Hooda and I did say while explaining the ruling on drinking non-alcoholic beer which contains a percentage of beer not the regular beer that intoxicates I'm talking about the non-alcoholic beer that is sold in Saudi Arabia and in some Muslim countries as well so I was explaining the ruling of it now in order to give you a preview and for you to understand where I was coming from I'd like you to walk with me not necessarily hand in hand first of all what is the ruling on food drinks clothes we wear what is the general ruling is it hella or Haram old scholars say that all food drinks clothes things that we use cars watches computers cameras TVs all of these are halong allah azza wajal said it is he who created for you from or whatever is on this earth all of it so who created whatever is on earth it's a large ocean which means that the default is everything on earth is halal someone says so weed is halal shakes it no because there is evidence proving that it is haram so whatever you see from food drinks etc is considered to be halide until proven otherwise easy hamdulillah so what's your ruling on eating french bread ah because this French is Haram no it's hella it's bread but it might have this or that prove it to me once it's proven documented it is Haram and I won't expand on this because this is common sense this is what Islam the Quran the hadith states upon now we come to the issue of the presence of alcohol alcohol itself is made of different types of alcohol and the chemists know this different compositions of alcohol yet not everything that has alcohol is Haram because alcohol by itself is not wine it is not intoxicating if you bring a ripe banana for example it contains alcohol and it contains point five grams of alcohol in it so this is a percentage if you bring orange juice you'll find that it contains point like 1 to 5 grams of alcohol and if you look that is per liter and if you look at the burger buns such burger buns contain one point two eight grams per every hundred grams of it so does this make it Haram how would I know very simple as a Mufti as someone who's talking about Islam Hallett and Haram we go to the Quran in to the Sunnah the Quran totally prohibits intoxicants that would not make you know what you say and this is one of the degrees of prohibiting intoxicants and wine that you should not pray while you are in the state of intoxication so that you would be aware of what you say the Sunnah there are so many hadith the prophet alayhi salat wa salam stated that whatever intoxicates if consumed in large quantities then amanoot quantity of it would become Haram this is not referring to alcohol this is referring to intoxicants such as wine whiskey vodka tequila scotch bourbon gin you know you name it so these are intoxicants now alcohol is one of the ingredients but being there does not mean that it is Haram or it becomes intoxicants so the rule is as our scholars say if there is alcohol present in a juice or in a fruit or in dough we put yeats with dough so that it has this thing in it that makes it bigger and I don't know what's called an in English but it has alcohol as well they say that if the presence of alcohol if you consume a large amount of it and you are not intoxicated this means that it is permissible to consume because why is wine Haram because if you drink a lot of it you become intoxicated if I have a barrel of whatever substance and I drink the whole thing and I'm not wasted I'm not intoxicated then drinking a little bit is okay but if I have a bottle of a liquid of a drink and if I drink the whole bottle I become wasted I become drunk then a single drop of it is haram understood the sharla the auto hopefully you understand this coming back to the question of brother Abdullah and I have been bombarded by so many brothers haters and lovers those who love me would advise me out of their love and care and I pray to Allah as a gel that he brings all the goodness in this world and the hereafter to them for their kindness and their love as for the haters my skin is thick in the beginning I used to be depressed and saddened when people to speak rudely and they abuse me publicly but nowadays hamdullah what doesn't kill you makes you stronger my my my skin has become thick this video that brother Abdullah is talking about was conducted by an ahmadi at Yanni and we all know how much they love me because simply we don't pamper them we say what the vast majority of all Muslims different schools of thought different sects all agree that the Qadiani remedies are cafard are apostates they do not belong to Islam we cannot marry from them we cannot eat their slaughtered meat we cannot reply to their Salam when they die we do not wash them pray funeral prayer or allow them to be buried in Muslim cemeteries this is a well-known fact it's not from my pocket go and ask any respected denomination organization Islamic committee scholars they all agree on that so he came up with this video in saying look at what this share is saying after what to tarnish my reputation and he has all the right to do that it's a free country who cares however this is not our question did you check Assam say 2% to 3% in a drink is permissible because it does not waste yes I did do you still stand by this no I don't what do you mean okay when I talk about Islamic issues I don't talk from my own self I am NOT a scholar I don't come up with a hmm yeah I think this is holidays Harlem this is not up to me I consult scholars I research issues and I quote what previous caller said I'm not someone who comes all of a sudden and says I Eureka I came up with something no one else had ever spoke spoken about I'm the first one to I don't know how the Companions did not figure it out I don't know how the scholars ever stand did not figure this is nonsense whatever I say 99.99 percent is backed by coats of scholars so two to three percent where did you get it from Shaham I got it from Sheikh Mohammed bin Saleh hello hey me and it's on YouTube and it's in whose books and in Aziz fatwas this is what he said that it Zakia's explained to you the presence of alcohol does not necessarily mean that it is intoxicated however if a drink such as non-alcoholic beer which we have in our country and there's Barbican des moosie there's different kinds of of such beer and he said if it has 1% 2% or 3% this does not intoxicate so I quote it what the cher said now is it true or not this is not to me to decide I have given you the Islamic verdict which segregates between wine and intoxicants and other foods and drinks that contain alcohol how would we know if consuming a lot of it intoxicates you then this means it is considered to be wine it's Haram if it doesn't then drinking a little or a lot doesn't make any difference because it will not intoxicate you now what is the percentage this is something for the scientists for the experts to come and say some of them till date after researching say that 2.2 grams or around this ratio does not intoxicated oh the max is 0.5% in a in a liter or something or less than that in 100 milliliter so it is an issue that scientists doctors should contribute in the principle is the same nothing changes the percentage of 3 percent yes I beg to differ now that's this was an exaggeration sure how dare you coat something you're not sure of sue me I think I give fatwas and I speak and I teach like all other shoe over thousands of issues per day if one makes a mistake throughout the entire 20 years or 30 years of giving Dawa Allah this is excellent track record so don't bleed on shoot the messenger don't discredit someone just because he made a mistake or two we can list so many mistakes of great scholars of Islam great Imams of Islam but this doesn't discredit them and it's not fair to only point out a single mistake in an ocean of goodness and of correct up either correct for issues correct fat words correct advices and you just come to one single thing so to sum things up fairness is part of our religion allah azza wajal tells us in the Quran which the Cadi on ease don't believe in if you hate a people you must be fair and your hatred must not make you transgress this is what we as Muslims are obliged to do so going back to the issue as I have talked about this so many times I'm getting old I'm getting tired I hope this explains to you that everything is hell on until proving proven otherwise when we have this drink that has percentage of alcohol you have to look whether consuming if I consume of the local beer non-alcoholic beer that we have here in Saudi Arabia a full pack a six-pack nothing would happen you have to go to visit in the low every five minutes but nothing would intoxicate you because it does not intoxicate and I hope this answers your question"
