  "title": "How is speeding not a sin & how is it not considered as disobeying Wali Al Amr? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign basically the person was asking a question and you answered that for example if someone were to do speed above the speed limit then he would be liable to what the law would give him if he would be God but it's not a sin So based on that I was assuming that I could operate in my country have business transactions we built a business license even though that come to demand did you have a business license but my question is though it's not sinful how is it not disobeying when he will um they're disobeying but does this make their income Haram no if they are selling uh food and the food is halal but said to them don't sell it they're sinful but their income is halal you have to differentiate between what is sinful and what is not in the sense of exceeding the speed limit it is sinful to disobey the it is sinful to endanger other people's uh livelihood but if I'm in a Freeway and there are no Radars and there are no cars and I'm exceeding the speed limit by 10 or 20 or 40 kilometers and I'm willing to pay the fine there is no problem in that in the sense that there is nothing in the Quran that says this is Haram and this is halal except to the notion of the has said this but said it for a maslacha but you cannot put what the said to be in the same level of the Quran the Sunnah in the sense of being sinful or not so this is the comparison and I don't know if this makes sense to you or not uh"
