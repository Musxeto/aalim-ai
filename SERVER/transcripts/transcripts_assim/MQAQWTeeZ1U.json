  "title": "Can I transfer my Zakat to a different city or country from where I am living? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is what is the ruling on the transfer of the cat to a different town so I live in Jeddah Saudi Arabia and I don't know any poor people per se personally definitely there are thousands and hundreds tens of thousands of for people I don't know where they live so is it permissible for me to send my zakat to a city that I know of let's assume to send it to Makkah or to Medina because I know friends there who know really poor and desperate people it's an issue of dispute and the reason of this dispute is that there is the hadith of Mahadev Najib L may Allah be pleased with him where the Prophet said Ali salat WA Salam said to him and informed them that is the people you are calling to Islam if they believe in the oneness of Allah and that the Prophet Azam is his servant and messenger and they established a lot then we instruct them and ordered them that Allah has mandated upon them that they should give zakat a money taken from their rich and returned back to their poor so scholar said this is an indication that it is not permissible to give zakat outside of your city and a lot of scholars adopted this opinion other scholars said no you misunderstood the hadith the hadith was referring to money taken from the rich Muslims given back to the poor Muslims and not to a location or to cific city or town and the biggest evidence backing this opinion is that from yemen itself whenever they used to give zakat they used to ship all that zakat money taken from Yemen to Medina and they would distribute it in Medina and elsewhere not in Yemen itself so scholars say that this is the most authentic opinion when wherever there is a need for zakat money it can be reallocated so I'm an expat working in Riyadh Saudi Arabia and it's time to give my zakat money whether on my savings or on the cutoff filter itself and here I don't know any poor person yes I do know organizations that collect the cat but I don't feel like giving it to them I don't know them I know they're legitimate and official but I know my family in Pakistan or in Bangladesh or in sri lanka who are poor and needy I know my village people in my hometown who are below the poverty line so I'd like to send my zakat to them is that permissible the answer is yes there is no problem in doing that and allah azza wajal knows best"
