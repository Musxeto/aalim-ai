  "title": "Study in foreign country for 5 years Am I still a traveller & can I make dua as it would be accepted",
  "transcript": "she I'm studying abroad um for five years at least so am I still considered to be a traveler because this country is not mine I like to know that in order to know if I can make Dua whenever I want to because the Dua of the traveler is answered a traveler is a person who carries the label with him so he moves from one town to the other he does not have a house to settle in so if I go to attend a conference and I spend two weeks in that country so I go from Calgary to Ottawa to Toronto to admon 3 days 4 days here three I'm staying in hotels I'm a traveler even if I stay in that country for a whole month I'm still a traveler I shorten my prayers I can't skip Ramadan fasting I make Dua as a traveler because whenever they call my family they would say oh the sheh is traveling for you my friend the moment you set foot in that country you started to rent a house or an apartment or moved into a hostel or to the do D dorm and now you have your own room you have your own bed you have your own uh wardrobe you put your clothes on on in you've settled down so now you're not a traveler anymore you're a resident you've settled so you have to pray on time you cannot combine prayers you cannot skip Ramadan and when you go on vacation to your own country it's the same thing but you can shorten prayer and Skip fasting when you're commuting between the country you're studying in and your own Hometown because you are a traveler but in both of the places you are a settler and you cannot combine or shorten your prayers and Allah Asel knows best bearing in mind that Dua is not necessarily related to a traveler you can make Dua between and every single and you can make Dua to the last third of the night and when the rooster uh makes its call you can make Dua when it rains you can make Dua when you are in distress you can make Dua so many uh places that and the last um hour of Friday you can make Dua these are blessed times and recommended for us to make Dua and Allah Knows Best"
