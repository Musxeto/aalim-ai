  "title": "What is more in reward for a woman in hajj, to pray in her hotel room or in haram? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i want to know which place would bring me more rewards for praying obligatory prayers is it haram or my hotel room the prophet told us that praying in your home which is at the moment your hotel room is more rewarding than praying in the haram now logically most women and men would think that come on the prophet said aslam a prayer in the haram is equivalent to a hundred thousand and you want me to pray in my hotel room i said i don't want you to pray in your hotel room this is what the prophet said allah to one of his female companions who said o prophet of allah i love to pray with you in the masjid of medina where the single prayer there is equivalent to 100 to a thousand prayers elsewhere other than mecca in the masjid al-haram so the prophet said i know you love to pray with me but praying home is better than praying with me in the masjid and that the prophet continued to emphasize this fact in a long hadith praying home is better it depends you want the reward pray in your hotel room you don't feel like praying in your hotel room you want to pray in the masjid be my guest the prophet did not prevent it he simply directed us to what is more rewarding and better you want to choose that welcome if you don't this is up to you you haven't done a sin uh insha allah inshallah"
