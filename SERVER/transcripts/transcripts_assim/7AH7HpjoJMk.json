  "title": "How to achieve the sweetness of Taraweeh when Imam recites too fast? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mohammed says how to get the sweetness of taraweeh in recitation if it is done at 10 times the speed we usually read this is problematic we refer to that on a couple of days ago with these Ferrari Imams who's who read it so fast and so quick that you cannot find the beauty of the Quran and I've stated that it's a shame but in order to make it feasible for me to gain the reward of praying the whole night I am obliged to follow the Imam but after he finishes and concludes taraweeh prayer there is no problem in me going back home opening the Quran and reciting beautifully and nicely and slowly so that I would face and find the taste of my prayer and Allah knows best"
