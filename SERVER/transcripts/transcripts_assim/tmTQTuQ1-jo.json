  "title": "Can we share Iftar food with non muslim neighbors? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sadia says can we share food during if bar with non-muslim neighbors so basically speaking I think that Satya is concern is resulting from the fact that if bar which is the meal that we break our fasting by having it is a religious meal so the non-muslims are not supposed to eat from it and this is a misconception they're not fasting correct but feeding the food whether to Muslims are to non-muslims is one of the great forms of worship and hence whether you're having breakfast or you're pre-dawn meal or your lunch or your dinner or whatever and you share it with a non-muslim especially if you have the intention of showing this non-muslim the true values of your religion definitely this is a great deed and a good deed that you do it's a form of worship the Prophet told a bird our Salalah Allah may Allah be pleased with a Buddha that whenever you cook try to make the water of this or the soup more so that you can give to your neighbors and we know that the neighbors are of three types one a non-muslim neighbor being good to him Allah gives you one reward to a Muslim neighbor being good to him Allah gives you two rewards for his Islam and for his being your neighbor three a Muslim neighbor who is of your kinship and Allah gives you three rewards for that therefore whenever you make a par or you want to break your fast and you send some food to a nun Muslim or to invite them to eat with you this is surely highly recommended good deed for you because you are giving a good impression about Islam to the non-muslims"
