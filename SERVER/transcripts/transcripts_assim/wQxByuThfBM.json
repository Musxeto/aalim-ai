  "title": "Is dog saliva considered pure or impure in Islam? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "tariq from the uk says now in the maliki school of thought they were the only people who went against considering the saliva of a dog a canine to be impure they said no it is pure and they coated few hadiths here and there such as a pool that they used to drink from such as them going in and out from the masjid of medina of the masjid of the prophet and other examples but all of these do not stand up to the hadith which is highly authentic without any doubt in it which all the other schools have thought the school of abu hanifa of shafiri and of ahmedn hambal agreed to consider it the cornerstone when talking about a dog's saliva which stated that the prophet said allah the purification of any of your utensils that happened to have a dog lick in it is to wash it seven times with water and once with soil in another narration the eighth with soil so this hadith indicates that the najasa the impurity of a dog's saliva is of the highest levels because urine defecation menstruation blood all of these are impuring edges but they can be washed squeezed and washed again and that's it it's purified not with the dark saliva when licking in a utensil that dish that plate that glass has to be washed seven times even though we don't see anything on it but it has to be washed seven times and once with soil so this is the most authentic opinion backed by the hadith of the prophet sam that is unambiguous that does not accept any room of error and allah knows best"
