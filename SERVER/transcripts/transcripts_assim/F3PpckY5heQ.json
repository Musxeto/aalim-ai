  "transcript": "lessons from the prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim alhim dear brothers and sisters in Islam Muslim in his book sah Muslim reported that Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam once addressed us and he said that six are the duties of a Muslim over another Muslim the companions said oh prophet of Allah what are these the prophet alisam replied when you meet him offer him greetings when he invites you to a feast accept it when he seeks your counsel advise him and when he sneezes and says alhamdulillah say when he falls ill visit him and when he dies follow his funeral the prophet saysat when he seeks your counsel advise him this means that when someone says to you advise me I don't know what to do tell me what is the most appropriate thing to do you have to give him a sound and good advice advising in Islam is part of Islam advice is part of the most important practices of Islam the prophet said in an authentic Hadith and this means that religion Islam is has two meanings it means that a person gives advice and it also means sincerity and wishing welfare so the prophet tells us that religion is to be sincere to Allah to his book to the prophet Alat to the rulers of the Muslims and to every Muslim individual to be sincere to wish them well and to give proper advice and this is why when you give proper advice to your brother you are actually being sincere to him and you are trying to fix what needs to be fixed with him and only those who care for you would advise you those who don't would see you do wrong things and would look the other way and if you look at the proper advice one gets you'd find that on top of the list is advising others of the dangers that may affect their religion and their belief so whenever someone advises you about wrong things you're doing or about things that you're not doing where you are supposed to be doing then he is a person who cares for you among the different types of advice is teaching the ignorance so when someone does not know and you teach them you're actually giving them a sound and proper advice Allah the almighty tells us in the Quran that the best friends in this life would be the worst enemies on the day of judgment except those who were righteous and why is that because they take care of each other they watch each other's backs and that is why when you accompany when you befriend with a practicing Muslim your life is transformed because he takes care of you he gives you proper and sound advice and that is why the prophet saidat in a beautiful Hadith where he gives us the example of a righteous and good friend by by saying that he is like a person who sells perfumes so he either sells you some of it or gives you part of it or in worst case scenario you would find a beautiful fragrance and scent from his shop and this is a proper friend who you get the advice from him without asking and if you ask him he would definitely be there for you the prophet Alat wasam goes on to say that among the duties is when a Muslim sneezes and says alhamdulillah which means all praise is due to Allah it is mandatory upon every individual who heard him say alhamdulillah to reply to him by saying which translates to may Allah have mercy upon you this is mandatory it is part of the Sunnah but we have to pay attention that it is a precondition that he Praises Allah after he sneezes this mean that if he does not say alhamdulillah we should not say and so many times people sneeze and we don't hear them saying alhamdulillah yet we hear people saying out of a good gesture and this is not part of the Sunnah okay what happens if someone sneezes and does not say alhamdulillah should I remind him or not Abdullah muak one of the great Scholars of Islam whenever someone sneezed in his presence and did not say alhamdulillah he would ask him as if he's learning from him he says brother what does a person who sneezes say and the man says alhamdulillah then says and he would consider this to be part of reminding him yet if you look at the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat wasam you would find that the prophet sallu alai wasallam in an authentic Hadith he was once with two men one of them sneezed well actually both of them sneezed one of them said alhamdulillah and the prophet said the other did not say anything so the prophet did not tell him anything so the man objected and said why do you pray for the other one one and you say and you don't say this to me and the prophet replied by saying he said alhamdulillah and that is why I said you didn't and that's why I didn't from this Hadith we learn that if someone sneez this it is not part of the Sunnah to remind them to say alhamdulillah it is up to them if they want to say alhamdulillah if they don't want to say it is not part of the Sunnah for me to remind them and this is part part of following the Sunnah because the prophet would not have left such a thing had it been part of the Sunnah so if the prophet did not remind him it is not appropriate for us to remind him but there can be a way out by what Mubarak did may Allah have mercy on his soul and believe me this is one of the great deeds in Islam because if someone who you do not like a lot if someone who you have strong bad negative feelings against sneezes in front of you and says alhamdulillah in normal cases you would not reply to him but because this is a duty you break the barriers and you approach The Man by saying and he replies to you you as the Sunnah stated may Allah guide you and may Allah Comfort your souls look at this beautiful exchange of beautiful words even if you have this enmity in your heart towards this Muslim yet by saying and exchanging these beautiful words everything is cleared and your heart is cleansed with these beautiful words this is all the time we have until we meet next time lessons from the prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim alhim he [Applause] [Applause] [Applause]"
