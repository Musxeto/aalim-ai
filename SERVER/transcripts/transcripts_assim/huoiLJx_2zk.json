  "transcript": "welcome Abu safan second question was what's the ruling on changing evil we know that as Muslims we have to uh enjoy virtue and forbid Vice and evil so the evil we see in Bur Burma and Syria and Palestine the evil we see worldwide that is happening to the Muslims the unmanned drone attacks to the Muslims in uh uh Pakistan in in Yemen in Somalia in wherever what do we do against this evil that is being committed first of all we have to stand up and fight if there is an Islamic flag that we fight under so there has to be a ruler there has to be a Muslim ruler who leads the way unfortunately at the moment there isn't so we go to step number two is that we fight through what we say through our rhetoric through talking about it where we can and try to give them moral support whether through the uh uh social networks whether through U the media whether through writing articles in newspapers and magazines supporting our brothers who are being oppressed by the cfer regimes or by the cfir states killing the Muslims as if it's their blood is as as cheap as water and unfortunately no one is talking whether they're afraid whether they are afraid physically are afraid for their Thrones Allah knows best anyhow as individuals this is our not role our role is not to discuss those on top Allah would take care of them our role is to try to change this by whatever we can say so we support our brothers in Syria and Burma and Palestine and everywhere if this is not enough the rhetoric we still have something that we can do and that is financial aid so we give our brothers in these uh deprived countries uh charity we give them financial aid a doctor can go there and help them physically I remember in the early Wars of Afghanistan in 19 80s When The War the Jihad was true Jihad between the Muslims and the cafir not what we see nowadays unfortunately of Muslims killing others and giving takir to others and fighting and the cafir are laughing their heads off at that early time I remember that there was a surgeon and I know him personally who works in a hospital here in jeda and he is a sweetheart he was an orop orthopedic surgeon who went to spend his annual vacation a whole month in Afghanistan to save the people and to operate over them and Dr Abdullah aam wrote in his book his name of this man and he said that he saved so many limbs from being amputated because he was an expert so doctors can go and help any type of doctors can go and give medical help businessmen have a responsibility on the day of judgment on everything that they save in their bank accounts and I'm not talking about a thousand or 2,000 I'm talking about the millions and the billions of money they have stored Allah would ask them for each and every penny for not supporting their brothers and if you're not rich and you're not a doctor and you're unable to write an article or come or come on TV to help them the least you could do is to pray night prayer tud at the last third of the night and raise your hands and supplicate for their Victory ask Allah Asel in humility and submissiv submissiveness that he would grant them Victory and Allah Asel would respond to you"
