  "transcript": "from the us uh question one why is it allowed uh to marry cousins in islam when science tells us that the child could potentially be abnormal okay english from the u.s she says why is it permissible to marry one's cousin if science disapproves of it or at least this does not recommend it due to the possible genetic diseases that may be caused of such a marriage firstly islam is a divine religion it is from allah azzawajal and generally speaking it does not go against science but throughout the years we've discovered that science is not always right and so many theories that come up only to be proven after a few decades that they're totally bogus or wrong and the theory of evil evolution is one of the closest and simplest ideas of its how bogus people are and how atheists mess up with people's minds claiming to be scientific when it's baseless and ridiculous even but this is not the time to address such an issue therefore when science comes and says cousins must not get married to one another we do not look at science and neglect our own religion so we look in the quran it doesn't say anything about that we look into the sunnah there's no prohibition none whatsoever about that on the contrary we find that the prophet himself alayhi salatu-salaam married his cousin zainab bin jash the mother of the believers may allah be pleased with her if there was anything wrong he would not have done that or allah would have told us that this is not recommended not only that he gave his own daughter fatima to his own cousin ali ibn abi talib and they have the best of families existing till date with so many offsprings of theirs healthy and sound he also gave zainab his own daughter the daughter of muhammad to her cousin and they were all their their maternal cousins so the whole of islamic history has nothing against cousins marrying one another so when science comes and says oops this is not recommended this is not permissible or um advisable we with all due respect throw it in the dustbin they say oh you will be responsible for any genetic diseases that come well we've seen total strangers marrying from the east and the west having children with genetic diseases so this is not a criteria that you can judge by and this why is why we ignore it you"
