  "title": "Is Income earned from using cracked or pirated software Haram",
  "transcript": "um mohammed from india my question is i know that using pirated software is haram but my question is if the uh is the income earned through using software for multi planning and multi-story building which helps us in analysing building so if the income went through the software is completely haram or only using the software is around okay hidden from india he says if i use a cracked software and i make money out of it is the money haram to me using the software is similar to cheating and stealing people's rights and what you generate from that is accordingly haram because this is not knowledge you've learned this is a software that was stolen so it's like stealing someone's car and working as a uber driver taking people around and collecting money this money is haram because the means you've made this money through is haram which is a stolen car and allah knows best"
