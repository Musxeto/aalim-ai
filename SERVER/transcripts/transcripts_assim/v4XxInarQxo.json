  "title": "Placing hands on the chest in prayer VS placing hands on stomach, which is authentic Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "i mean so shay i heard the statement which says that every hadith talking about the position of holding our hands in the standing position in the prayer is weak but the hadith which says that we should place our hands on the chest has the least amount of weakness in the chain and that is why it's more accepted than the hadith about placing the hands on stomach so is this statement true shaykh the hadith was authenticated by sheikh al-bani and we are not scholars of hadith so we don't have the luxury of sitting and saying that this is weak and this is more authentic because this is not our field so those who say such things are not specialized in hadith sciences and even if they're if they wear they're not in the same level of have mercy on his soul and hence talking about such topics is not worthwhile sheikh al-ban in his book the description of the prayer of the prophet describe that hadith or may allah be pleased with him the companion said that the prophet used to put his right hand over the left hand on the chest whether some scholars re graded it as weak or not that authentic or maybe hassan this is an issue of dispute we follow al-imam al-bani in such hadiths and allah knows best"
