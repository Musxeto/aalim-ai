existence in this life and this is why allah azza wajal combined his right to be worshipped alone with being kind to them with honoring them with being dutiful to them Allah says in the Quran your Lord has decreed not to worship other than him and to be good to your parents among the best deeds any person can offer in his life especially in these blessed days and nights of Ramadan is to honor your parents to be kind to them to be generous with them abdullah al masud may allah be pleased with him said to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam which deed is most beloved to allah the prophet said on 'his alato salaam answered prayer performed on time abdullah miss Rosa said then what the Prophet said honoring one's parents this is the answer of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam we spend so much time enquiring asking trying to detect which is most beloved to allah azza wajal when it is right there in our backyards in our homes there is a difference in culture between us muslims and the non-muslims especially those who live in materialistic in materialistic worlds such as in the west there they treat their parents rudely they don't obey they do not respect and once the parents are old they throw them in a house for the senior citizens for the elderly and never ask about them until they die muslims are way different muslims compete with their siblings to honor and be dutiful to their parents they compete and consider oneself an uncrowned king if he wins the honor of hosting his father or his mother in his house there was a case in saudi courts a couple of years ago when two men went to the judge complaining one was in his Lane 60s and the other was in his 70s they were fighting over who gets the right to host his mother in his house the mother testified and she said I would like to be with the eldest not for anything just because the youngest relatively speaking who is in his 60s he has so much on his plate and he would not be that easy taking care of me the man started weeping and crying in court because he lost that great honor while we or some of us keep on pushing their parents to the other siblings trying to buy their way out of caring for them Islam makes us in debt to our parents while they're alive and if they're after the death and people when dealing with their parents are three types the first type is the one that honors his parents he's dutiful to them never harms them not even with a bad look and in addition he goes out of his way trying to please them this type is rewarded by Allah the second type of people is the one who does his duty nothing more nothing less and this person is sinful for just doing his duty giving them a house providing them with food paying their electricity bill is an obligation you have not done something extra claiming that you're not abusing them or not harming them this is your obligation you're not doing anything X this type is sinful and the third type is the one that does not do his obligations and in addition he harms them he abuses them he saddens them he depresses them this person is definitely doomed the Prophet said alehissalaam Salaam there are three whom Allah will not look at on the Day of Resurrection and will not enter paradise one of them was the one who disobeys his parents disobedient of parents is one of the major sins in Islam to the extent that Allah Azza WA JAL prohibited us from complaining by simply saying when they tell you to do something Allah says don't say oath to them or chide them and say kind things to them with respect how can one be dutiful to his parents how can one be kind to them and honor and honor them by default when people are kind to you you must be kind to them this is human nature there is no test in this for you the test is when your parents are not kind to you when they are abusive when they go out of their way to make life difficult for you here you express your obedience to allah azzawajal by obeying them and being respectful to them to the extent that Allah Azza WA JAL orders us to be kind to our parents even if they order us to make even if my own parents tell me to disobey Allah to associate others with him one would think that I should not speak to them Allah says in the Quran but if they endeavor to make you associate with me that of which you have no knowledge do not obey them but accompany them in this world with appropriate kindness this is the way Muslims deal with their parents the selleth if you go to the biography you will be astonished some of the Salif and this was reported by Ali bhai said if not evening ABI talib may Allah be pleased with them he would never eat with his mother from the same plate out of respect he fears that he may stretch - part of the food that his mother just looked at it and desired it just because she looked at it he refrains from eating with her until she is satisfied and had enough Ordnance Survey the son of asthma bit ABI bakr may allah be pleased with them the son of a surveyor minowaman one of the ten heaven bound one of the seven fokaha of medina all what miss Rubin says by Allah if they make you angry do not look at them sternly because a person's anger is detected when he has a stern look and he says by Allah he is not beautiful who looks straight at his father's eyes sometimes when you're having a discussion your own son looks at you in a way that is inappropriate though he did not say a word that look is sufficient to admit a to help me Allah save us Mohammed Amin serine one of the great tabby Reem when people who do not know him if they see him speak in the presence of his mother they would think that he is sick compare how we speak in the presence of our parents how we raise our voices how we shout one of the Salif his mother called him from the end of the house so he replied she didn't hear he shouted Yes Mother I'm coming so that she hears him and then he felt guilty and he gave 10 of his slaves for the sake of Allah in repentance he didn't shout he just wanted her to hear compare how we treat and deal with our parents the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam the pleasure of allah azza wajal is in the pleasure of one's father and anger of allah azza wajal is the angle is in the anger of the father Apollo Kohli had a washed-out phylogeny whether confessed a few in Whoville for Rahim al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen edwin la ilaha illa ma who who - arica de wash hadwin muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh sallallahu alayhe wa aalihi wa sahbihi ajma'in the mother in islam has great importance the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was approached by a man and he asked Oh prophet of Allah who among the people is most deserving of my good companionship the Prophet said that let's assign your mother the man said then who the Prophet repeated again your mother the man said then who the Prophet said your mother the man said then who the Prophet said al-islam your father the mother has three times the need of you being good to her than your father because your father usually is a man and he's strong and he is harsh and hard and rarely you would disobey him because he has the ability to force you while the mother is the weakest link usually we think of a mother's instruction or a mother's prohibition not to be serious when the father says no it is a known when the mother says no it might be if you wish if you want and if you pressure me a little bit I may say yes so we keep on insisting not paying attention not caring for our mother while Allah Azza WA JAL says and we have enjoined on men and we have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents his mother bears him with hardship and she brings him for with hardship and the bedding of him and the weaning of him is 30 months if you tried as a man to hold your child for 10 minutes your biceps would ache for half an hour you're willing to give your child for adoption your mother stayed with you so many years each day and each night when you had your fever she was next to your bed when you were starving she was cooking for you when you were in need she was always there now at the autumn of her life where do you find yourself how do you describe yourself have you ever seen how you treat her do you kiss her hands and feet every time you see her do you show her how valuable how important she is in your life or you make her feel that she is bit and n't this is her duty she's nothing but a person waiting to die among the greatest deeds we can get our sins erased is to be kind with our mother is to be soft when speaking to them a man came to Abdullah have no mark he was shivering scared of his sins that he thought that it would definitely take him to help Abdullah have Naaman asked him do you have your parents with you he said I have only my mother I'm the lion Armour said if you fear hell and if you want to enter paradise by Allah if you speak to her softly and feed her then by Allah you will enter Jannah as long as you refrain from committing major sins a man came to the prophet he saw two son like many youngsters Oh prophet of Allah permit me to go for jihad they want to die in the cause of Allah they want to travel they want to they want to scribe so the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam do you have a mother once or twice and the man says yes the Prophet said go and be dutiful to her and the man is insisting being dutiful to mom is not a great thing I want to die in the cause of Allah in the third time the prophet alayhi salaatu wa sallam said to him woe be to you go and stay next to her feet because jenna is their paradise is at the feet of your mother people in the West also always ask what's the ruling on celebrating Mother's Day Muslims don't have Mother's Day every day in our life is a Mother's Day we do not need to imitate the disbelievers in honoring them one day per year every single day and night is a Mother's Day to us Muslims and being dutiful to them is not limited to their life even after they die Islam tells us to be dutiful to them the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam was approached by a man and he said o prophet of allah is there anything that I can do to continue honoring my parents after they died the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam yes pray for them ask for forgiveness for them fulfill their last wishes honor their friends and uphold the ties of kinship which you would not have wear it not for them honored their friends even after their death have the love no matter may Allah be pleased with him was one thought was once on his donkey when he saw a Bedouin so he dismounted chit-chatted with him for a while and afterwards took off his turban put it on the bed ones head and gave the Bedouin his donkey so his companion said may Allah have mercy on you this is too much imagine giving your car keys to someone and giving him your clothes this is too much these Bedouin would be more than satisfied if you give them little money he said this man's father was a friend of Roma my father and I heard the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam say the best of good deeds is for a son to uphold ties with his father's friends if you want to be dutiful to your parents check on their friends if you're truly a practicing Muslim you have to connect to your kinship whom you would not have any connection with had it not been to your parents so check on your uncle's your aunt's your cousins all those who are related to you through your parents for the sake of allah azzawajal even if they don't call you back even if they don't invite you even if they abuse you our biggest problem is that we do what we do not for the sake of allah azzawajal not for the sake of worshipping allah azzawajal this is why we don't find the taste of worshipping subhanahu wa'ta'ala when we are kind to people is because we are waiting for them to reciprocate to meet our kindness with similar kindness and if they don't we stop this is not how Allah wants us to be we have to begin from today to honor our parents to love them to respect them never to argue with them never to look them straight in the eyes to show people how respectful we are to them and how humble we are truly to them if we succeed in doing this we will gain the pleasure of allah azzawajal as the prophet has said the pleasure of allah is in the pleasure of the father in another narration the pleasure of allah is in the pleasure of the parents oh allah azza wa jal have mercy on our parents as they have brought us up in this fashion oh Allah forgive our parents oh Allah those who have died from them expand their graves make their graves a garden of paradise make them happier in their graves and they were on this dunya or a life our parents are alive oh Allah give us the success and help us to be kind to them to be dutiful to them to honor them to make them happy to make every moment of the rest of their lives a happy moment where they raise their hands and make duaa for us Allahu Alem when is a bachelor in merely haslam rasul allah wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad alayhi wa sahbihi ajma'in walking salat"
