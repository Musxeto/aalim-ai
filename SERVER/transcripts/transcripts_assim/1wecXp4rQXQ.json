  "title": "Does hating something of Islam make me an apostate (hating hijab, waking up for fajr Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if people hate something of islam and not all of it would this render them apostates or out of the fold of islam first of all i receive hundreds of questions every week literally if not thousands actually thousands and a lot of these questions are from muslims from young muslims and the vast majority of these questions revolve around kufar and shirk they have this obsession of condemning everything to be an act of apostasy so i was going to the masjid and i said i'm going to pray in the masjid and my father smiled is his smile considered to be kufur was he mocking islam things like this tends or or seems to give me the impression that people are so trigger happy they want to get people out of the fold of islam idahi said so and so is he a kafir someone said masha allah or tabar on a cat that was walking in a very funny way is he a kafir why is this happening why are people so anxious to get people out of the fold of islam this is something that needs to be addressed this is not the time definitely to address it but be careful now if someone hates something of islam hating it because of its self or because allah revealed it as part of the religion in the hadith the prophet said that when allah created heaven and hell he told jibril go and look at it and jibril said after looking at it by allah that when i looked at paradise i thought that no one would hear about it except we'll enter it no one can resist not entering it and when i heard so help no one would hear about it and enter it people will be afraid of it then allah azzawajal adorned paradise with hardship and adorned hell with desires and and lusts and jibril went and took another look he said by allah i am afraid that no one will enter paradise and everybody would enter hellfire or as the prophet said what does that mean it means that there are things that we hate not because they are part of the religion but they go against our desires and what we want for example when fajr is at 2 30 or 3 a.m and isha wa is very late like 11 30 or 12 o'clock the time is not sufficient to sleep and if you do go to bed you wake up hardly so you go to prayer you go to fajr not singing and whistling and clapping you go with a lot of hardship you feel the suffering and the burden you don't hate fajr this is a hypocrite rather you hate the state you are in and the sleepliness and being tired so this is not hating islam if a woman hates wearing the hijab because she's sweating is hot and she cannot breathe properly there's no problem in that that's very natural but if she hates hijab because she feels oppressed or subjugated or discriminated or that this is illogical why would allah do this to me this is hypocrisy that leads to kufr because they hated what allah has revealed in allah"
