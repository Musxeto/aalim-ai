  "transcript": "alhamdulillah Hadith number 137 in the chapter that deals with Friday with the J narrated abuur Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said when the Imam is delivering the kba and you ask your companion to keep quiet and listen then no doubt you have done a an act which is useless prohibited and rewardless sah alkari this Hadith is highlighting the importance of listening to the Imam and it is not something to be taken lightly because the prophet saidat whoever says to His companion listen and the word listen itself the word listen itself is it something that people say with without any cause or Reason no you only tell someone to listen if he is talking or doing something that is not useful so you're actually doing him a favor you're actually enforcing virtue by saying listen however despite the fact that this action is something that we may think that it is good the prophet says whoever says this then he has committed an act of and as referred to in the Quran those who reject and turn away from what is anything that is not useful anything that is not beneficial so the prophet says whoever tells His companion listen then He has committed something that is considered to be in another narration the prophet said and whoever commits such an act he has no and Scholars differed in interpreting this portion does it mean that his jum is void and it is not accepted or does it mean that the reward word of such a prayer has been cancelled the most authentic opinion is that the jum the Friday prayer is valid but the reward has been canceled so if it's canceled why should I sit I might as well leave Scholars say no you're compelled and you're obliged to sit though there is no reward otherwise you would become sinful even worse and they give the example when the prophet saysat who ever visits or goes to a fortune teller and listens to him or hears him Allah will not accept the prayers of 40 days from him and if he goes to a fortune teller or to a priest and believes him he has nullified his Islam so what's the difference the difference is that I went to him just for the sake of listening not to believe I'm having fun it's like when you go to the fun fairs and there is a tent of a fortune teller and you just go for the sake of playing with your friends and the woman tells you after looking in her crystal ball that this will happen and that would happen and you laugh because you know that this is a lie and you leave or if you open the newspaper and you go to whatever scope it is bioscop telescopes whatever scope it is the signs and and the zodiacs so if I am for example a scorpion or he's a bull or the other one is a donkey they have certain Zodiacs though this is my Zodiac lucky you and you just go and read yours for the fun of it what is the punishment Allah will not accept the prayers of 40 days imagine just for the fun of it in Arabia we have some tradition especially in Egypt and and Syria elsewhere when they drink the Turkish coffee they turn after finishing the cup upside down and the remaining of the coffee would cause traces so after like 30 seconds you turn it up and the woman says ah you have a problem in your life who doesn't but it's going to be solved it's always being solved and you have a friend who will betray you I have many but an enemy of yours will come a friend so many enemies became to be my friends afterwards so all of this is nonsense yet if you have this done to you or you notice it and testify not testify witness it then Allah will not accept the prayers of 40 days one would say okay if Allah is not going to accept the prayers of 40 days why should I pray scholar say if you do not pray Habibi my friend if you do not pray you become a cafir you invalidate your Islam you have committed an act of apostasy but if you pray Allah will not reward you but you will remain a Muslim so it is a must it's not a choice likewise here Scholars say that speaking to the one next to you is completely prohibited at all so what happens if someone sneezes and says alhamdulillah we know that it's mandatory for us to say not when the IM is delivering the he says alhamdulillah I wouldn't even listen to him what happens if someone comes to me while the IM is giving the and says I would not look at him and I would not even answer him and I wouldn't even point to him doing this because this is also like saying listen so I would completely ignore him people said she this is rude this is not rude this is Sunnah you're teaching him to follow the Sunnah he is the rude one who is trying to nullify my jum and then I should not listen to him and should not pay any attention to him Scholars say that it becomes mandatory to speak if something worse is going to happen for example in some masjids is ceiling so high there is a ladder that they use to take and change the light bulbs and whenever maintenance is needed so while the Imam is giving I've noticed that one of the children is climbing up he's four five years old I know that he's going to fall and die but I cannot speak tough luck no you have to speak or warn his father get your son down and this is considered to be mandatory because the advantage of speaking is far greater than the disadvantage also Scholars say that it is permissible to address the Imam or to answer the Imam when he addresses you so while in the the Imam sees something and he asks you you did you do this and that I'm not even going to look at you no he's the IM you have to respond to him you say yes I did or no I didn't and also if you have an urgent need for a question or a correction for example the IM makes a mistake in reciting an Ayah do you hold or sit there without correcting him no you have to correct him why because in prayer which I'm not allowed to say any single word if he makes a mistake I do correct him if he recites a Ayah wrongly I must correct him so likewise in the if I'm close by and he says a wrong Ayah I correct him only I correct the wrong Ayah that he has said I believe that this is all what is related to this uh topic we move on to the following Hadith the Hadith of Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him and we have the brother there narrated Abu Allah's messenger Sall alaih wasallam said any person who takes a bath on Friday like the paath of janaba major janaba major stage of impurity and then goes for the prayer it is as if he had sacrificed a camel and whoever goes in the second hour it is as if he has sacrificed a cow and whoever goes in the third hour then it is as if he has sacrificed and horned RAM and if one goes in the fourth hour then it is as if he had sacrificed a chicken and whoever goes in the fifth hour then it is as if he had offered an egg when the Imam comes out that is starts delivering theba the Angels present themselves to listen to thear we learn that if you go early to the Masjid Allah would reward you as early as you go so if you go in the first hour and the scholars differed in regards to what is the meaning of the first hour is it the 60 Minutes that we have this means that we have 5 hours 1230 this means that you start going from 7:30 is it this hour or is it a period of time Scholars differed tremendously about it and unfortunately we cannot pinpoint exactly what was meant however it so appears that the hours to be divided upon the time from Sunrise until the time for prayer which is approximately 60 minutes per hour how would we say that simply because you have to look at the daytime where it is permissible for you to pray and this is indicated by the rising of the Sun the measurement of a spear this is about 3 m High and and in calendars when it says or the rising of the sun to be able to pray you have to add to that 15 minutes approximately and then you can pray DHA prayer or ish prayer or any prayer you want to pray so to continue this we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be asalam alaykum and welcome back so the times that most likely is mentioned in this Hadith are referring to five hours and most likely it is like the hours we use per day which is consisting of 60 Minutes give or take a little bit and the prophet saidat that the first hour is equivalent to as if you've sacrificed a camel the second hour a cow the third hour a ram and not a goat which means that a ram is an a ho one the one with with horns is more valuable than any other sheep or of goats and fourthly or the fourth hour is a chicken and the fifth hour is just an egg and after that when the IM enters the Masjid and saysay the angels as in one of the narrations fold their books so that anyone who comes afterwards is not registered to have sacrificed anything and they themselves sit and listen to the sermon of the Imam from this Hadith we understand though it is permissible in Haj to offer sacrifice of a camel or a cow and this suffices for seven houses yet a camel is more precious and more valuable to Allah Asel than a cow because it has more meat and that is why the first hour is a camel and the second hour is a cow if they were equal it would have been the same and from this Hadith we learn that it is extremely important to try to go to the Masjid as early as possible a lot of the Muslims enter the Masjid just before the IM or after the IM has started the very few are there in the beginning of the time for example J is 12:30 20 minutes to 1 it's rare if you go to the Masjid at 11:00 that you'll find hardly anyone if you go at 12:00 maybe you'll find one or two which means that that they have not sacrificed maybe except a chicken fried allaham but it's a chicken that they have sacrificed and this is not very good the companions used to go extremely early not only that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam said in a very beautiful Hadith and authentic Hadith whoever washes his head then washes his body for rul and leaves early and reaches the Masjid early and walks and does not drive it's not drive he does not ride but nowadays Nobody Rides no everybody drives and he draws closer to the Imam and he listens and does not make any does not speak or do anything that is useless what is the reward the prophet says am and this is Hadith authenticated by albani and it's an authentic Hadith there's no doubt in it the prophet said whoever does this give me the reward then Allah would give him would reward him with every step to the Masjid the reward of fasting and night prayer of a whole year if I live 100 steps away from the Masjid and I do this Allah gives me the reward of 100 years that I have fasted and prayed night prayer yes she I live a thousand meters 1 kilometer away from the Masjid then this is500 years every every but I'd rather ride my car and go I don't want to walk Subhan Allah people are so ignorant they don't want the reward and this Hadith is extremely important for us to encourage us on J you have to offer similar to the of janaba you have to go out early you have to try to walk and if it's too far away drive but park your car away so that you can walk as many steps as possible and to the extent some of the salaf when they used to go to jum they used to shorten their steps they instead of opening their strides they would make it two in one so that it would add more record and reward to them so this Hadith is an encouragement for us to try our best to go as soon as possible any questions yes brother the KN the intention is very important so in the gusul if I take a gusul for sexual sexual impurity and I completely forgot that I had to go to Juma and then I remember that I did not so any uh what is the ruling on that some Scholars say that you have to repeat it but the most authentic opinion is that one is sufficient so if you perform of Jan and whether you intend or not that this is also for Friday it suffice you inshallah yes brother can we say when we sneeze can we say alhamdulillah uh when we sneeze during the can we say alhamdulillah and secondly can we say sallallahu alaihi wasallam when we hear the mention of and thirdly can we say a when the IM makes Dua most likely that these things are not supposed to be verbal you should not raise your voice so even if you sneeze you say alhamdulillah by only moving your lips and not speaking aloud and likewise when the IM is supplicating you say a mean not raising your voice by saying aan and also when he mentions the name of the Prophet Alat wasam you do not offer solitation in a loud voice and keep it to the minimum sh as you said the Hadith that the person he gets the reward an immense reward so you you only mentioned that he arrived at the Masjid early and u means how and if a person he does fortune telling and he believes in it he's out of the fold of Islam so if he recites the kma once again he will come in the fold of Islam and will his bad Deeds because now he will be considered to be a rort so will his bad Deeds be erased like rewards bad Deeds are erased first question is that how early one should arrive to the Masjid and the answer was given to us in the prophets when he said that if you come in the first hour you get so and so so most likely when he said that mean that he goes early and he goes really early so most likely this refers to the first hours of the day as For Those who commit an act of apostasy and revert back to Islam if they have have done what they have done and then repented sincerely from their act of apostasy and from the sins that they have committed Allah would forgive all of that however some and I've heard this from some of the brothers and sisters they say we have so many mistakes and sins and that is why we deliberately nullify our Islam and we commit an act of shik so that when we come back everything is starting or beginning from scratch this is not acceptable their determination to nullify their Islam is an indication of hypocrisy and even if they revert to Islam their sins remain as they are and it's a very dangerous thing even to think of doing such an act because it means that a person does not have or not carry any type of glorification to Allah if he thinks that it's a child's game that I erase it and then start all over again and Allah knows best yes brother Alam in many masjids in India we see that there is a speech related to the ayats and Hadith to be recited by IM in theba but kba is in Arabic only is it recommended it's two cbas two cbas in Arabic only but before the two cbas there is a speech related to the ayats which he understand I understand the prophet Alat wasam forbade making circles before the jum what is the meaning making circles Circles of knowledge so it is not permissible before jum to have a d to have a lecture in the Masjid because this would go against the essence of Friday which is identified by the sermon and therefore in a lot of the masjids especially in non-arab countries they come and the Imam gives a sermon and people listen to it as if it's the sermon of jum afterwards he sits on the pulpit say they offer thean he gives twas in Arabic any fast food and then they offer the prayer and when you ask them they give much attention to the first one which was in their language rather than the two which was in Arabic this is wrong the Imam should not do this the Imam should devote both sermons both cbas instead of doing them in Arabic he should do them in the native language of the country he's living in I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time oh"
