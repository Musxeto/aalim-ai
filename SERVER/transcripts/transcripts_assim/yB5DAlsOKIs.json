  "transcript": "brother tribe asks about a situation a couple they don't have any children the wife's sister gave birth to a daughter the sister gave her daughter to this couple to adopt and to bring her up is this permissible first of all adoption in Islam as understood in the West is not permissible sponsoring and providing and taking care of an orphan or a child whose parents are alive is permissible there's nothing wrong in that so what to avoid one the child quote unquote adopted cannot be given the name of the adopting parents so the child she got from her sister is still known to be the daughter of her brother-in-law and his own sister and the documentation show this she may call her my mom or my auntie or whatever this is no problem secondly the child cannot inherit when one of the parents died because in adoption we don't have such inheritance they can write one third of the will if they wish to that girl this is permissible thirdly the man after she reaches a certain age is a nut is a nun Muharram to her because in relationship she is the daughter of his sister in law which is not a Muharram and he is her auntie's husband who is not a Muharram so in order to avoid this this young infant before the age of two years must be suckled by one of his Muharram so if the man's sister circles this girl he becomes her becomes her uncle and etc and this is legit and there's no problem her parents are alive no problem they may have other children and giving their child too her sister they see their own sister growing up in a good house being taking care of and yet still acknowledging that these are her biological parents she knows her mom and dad there's not nothing wrong in that insha'Allah"
