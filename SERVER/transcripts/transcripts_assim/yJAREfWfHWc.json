  "transcript": "Aman from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh I want to know, I want to ask that is putting right hand under the right cheek and left hand on the thigh when sleeping is authentic or not? And if not then can you please explain us why it's not? Jazak Allah Khairan. I did not understand your question. Putting the right hand where? Putting the right hand under the right cheek and left hand on the thigh when sleeping, when you go to sleep. People say it's from sunnah. We know that the sunnah as per the hadith of Al-Bara' Ibn Azib, may Allah be pleased with a man with his father, that the Prophet said Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam whenever you want to go to bed, perform your wudu as if you were to pray and lie on your right side. And in some narrations on your right hand. And this is when you don't have a pillow, but when you do have a pillow you don't need to put your hand underneath your cheek. And your left hand could be anywhere, could be next to your stomach, could be on your thighs, could be on your head, it doesn't matter. I personally don't know any hadith that supports what you've said and Allah knows best."
