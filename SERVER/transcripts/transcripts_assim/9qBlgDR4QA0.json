  "title": "Why do I see people praying towards the imam? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "boom our roof had three questions the first question is a misunderstanding from his part now the sooner the authentic found it sooner that the Prophet Elisha sir in every single for prayer for Java hoorah sir Maghrib and Isha once he concluded his prayer he would say facing the Qibla a star for Allah a stuff for Allah a stock for Allah Allah and the Salah mooncastle on table Ã©litaire the Jedi were o'clock and then he turns and faces the congregation giving his back to the Qibla so this is well founded this is authentic and there is no turning away from it you think that it is only supposed to be in fire and a sir this is your understanding there is none of the scholars had ever said such a thing because the Sunnah is the sooner we learn it from the Prophet as you Sam so we come to the second part of your confusion which is those who face the Imam when they pray their voluntary prayer afterwards there is nothing wrong in that meaning that they're not praying for the Imam and they're not prostrating for the Imam and there is no difference whether the mm is giving you his face or giving you his back so if I come and I pray behind someone with his back to me and he's facing the Qibla and I take him as my Sutra as my visor as my screen so that no one can pass in front of me while I'm praying there is nothing wrong in that our Prophet Allah says I'm used to pray night prayer with mother Aisha lying in front of him so even that whenever he wanted to prostrate on the ground the house was so small the room was so tiny that he used to touch her or pinch her so that she would remove her legs until he finishes his prostration and stands up and then she continues sleeping as usual so it is a recent understanding from you abou ma roof there's nothing wrong in that for them to do it but it is disliked among the general public because they think that this is inappropriate yet it is totally normal in sha allah is it the best scenario no of course after finishing the for prayer you are not allowed to stand up and pray in your position until you speak so if you did not speak with anyone you have to change your position and praise somewhere else because the Prophet ordered disarray his salat oh sir"
