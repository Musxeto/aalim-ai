  "title": "Are Judge Policeman or position where one is in charge not recommended jobs in islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign and I was reading about Ali and I read something about when Andy was telling uh no that um do not be white or noiseman a tax collector he told collector so I want to confirm if this possession this profession are not recommended for Muslim and also I think um he also said um on the beta of a drum or a player which is uh something around us I I answered only one question so as per what you've mentioned in the beginning I don't know about this narration whether it is authentic or not related to Ali may Allah be pleased with him I know that be pleased with him said something similar to that and something is also mentioned about Abdullah may Allah be pleased with all the companions of the Prophet Allah and they used to warn people from being a ruler being a policeman being someone in charge not because this is not permissible on the contrary the prophet said there are seven on the day of judgment who will be in the shade of Allah when there is no shade other than his shade the first one is a just and fair ruler so the prophet is telling us that being fair and just is something that would lead you to Jannah however the vast majority of people who assume such positions of power and authority would do Injustice to people would be unfair would use brutal force against the civilians and we see this worldwide so it is best for your Deen not to be a judge though you have the knowledge though you have the religious commitment yet you don't know when fitna would sneak into your heart and corrupt it and this is why many scholars rejected the position of being a judge some of them were even tormented and thrown into jail and tortured to accept and they would not like Imam Malik like so many of the Great Scholars of Islam because they know this is a huge responsibility and you never know if you push me too far I just might you never know what may happen when they see the money the gold and the power when someone who's close comes into them and cries and says I need a favor just once in a lifetime and they would compromise their religion accordingly so I hope this answers your question what's in"
