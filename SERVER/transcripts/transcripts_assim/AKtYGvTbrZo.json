  "transcript": "njma from Kuwait Alum uh my husband committed adultery with me but uh while repenting from it he had smoked weat a day before it and he was sober while repenting so is his repentance accepted as the prayers are not accepted for 40 days but if he repents for a sin like adultery uh is it accepted as it depends on his Nia and our nikah is valid and does having images in the house has anything to do with repentance as angels of uh prayers of forgiveness don't enter that house but if a person repents from a major sin like adultery he has we we had done our duty and it's up to Allah to accept it or our not so is our nikah valid does he shave his beard no oh alhamdulillah I was hoping that you would say and if he shaves his beard and his trousers are below his ankles and if he watches uh uh Netflix and listens to music and if he drives a car uh uh in speed what kind of things are relate these are not related at all to your nikah and I had I have this tendency from people that are coming to me in counseling sessions doubting their marriage they are obsessed with the notion that is my nikah valid we did this before nikah we did that we had like your question portraits in in in the house or drawings what does this have to do with your nikah he he did he did drugs one day before our nikah and before his repentance what kind of drugs he smoked wheat what kind of wheat is it marijuana or hash and what brand is it what is this what are you doing some people are so fixated on destroying their lives destroying their marriages and when I say to them yes the marriage is invalid they start weeping and crying and I give them a a shock therapy and they start to have a a nervous breakdown say no no no no I was just joking with you I was just tripping you come on these things are known through Scholars whether your marriage is invalid or not it's not up to you to judge and say yeah but I I heard in this website I asked this uh uh uh Q&A site about this and they said this and that it is not up to you to decide I believe that you've went you've gone to like five six Scholars before me and they all said to you that it is valid but you're still not content because you're wacko you have something wrong and and this should you raise red flags because Shan is messing up with your head get your stuff together before you destroy your marriage and your life the verdict is it has no impact on your marriage your still marriage the marriage is valid so move on I know you're going to talk to she Muhammad Salah next week or somewhere else and you're going to keep on calling other sh it's your life you want to destroy it it is up to you you"
