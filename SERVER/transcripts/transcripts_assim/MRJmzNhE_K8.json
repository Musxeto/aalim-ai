  "transcript": "in the Quran that it is not befitting for the prophet Alat wasam and his uh uh and the Believers uh with him to ask Allah for forgiveness for the mush for the idol worshippers or the non-muslims even though they be ofkin after it has become clear to them that they are the Dwellers of the fire so it is not permissible for someone to ask for forgiveness to a person who died as a non-muslim and this was addressed to the prophet Alam when he wanted to seek forgiveness for his uncle Abu Talib who took care of him and who protected him and who guarded him from the harms of the idol worshippers even though Allah Asel did not allow him to seek forgiveness for his uncle Abu Talib not only that the prophet told us the is in Muslim when a man came and said oh prophet of Allah where is my father and the prophet being revealed to from Allah told him your father is in hell so the man was a little bit upset the prophet told him my friend your father and my father are in hell so the prophet told us about his father that he's in hell now in Muslim as well the prophet once wept and he was asked why are you weeping so he said I asked Allah to seek forgiveness for my mother and he forbade me from doing that which means that she is in hell and Allah does not allow him to ask for forgiveness and I asked her to visit her grave and he granted me that so now I can go and visit her grave now people with would not swallow this well though it is in the most authentic book after the Quran which isar and Muslim and generally speaking it's the sufis who do not accept this and they fabricate and they make lies about the prophet Alam when they give Hadith and say that Allah gave life to them so they accepted Islam and they di died once again all of these are fabricated and lies there's no Hadith as such but having said that by Allah I and all the scholars of Islam would wish that we would sacrifice our own fathers and mothers for the sake that Allah would grant the father and the mother of the Prophet wasam Islam and make him pleased with that we would do anything in our possession so that Allah would please the prophet wasam with his father and mother but this is not to us now people who have their own personal Vendetta would come and say ah wahabi super salafy or salafy or whatever why they try to label us so that they would think that they would gain more and more followers where they can eat from them when they give them the money unfortunately this is the case we go out of our way to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet to teach it to the people to implement it in our lives in our families in our neighbors we love the prophet alhat but when it comes to what he has himself said that his father and his mother are in hell what do you want me to do Allah tells us in the Quran about ibraim the of rman his father is in hell are you going to say now yeah yeah but there's some somewhere that Allah gave him back to life and then he accepted Islam and he died again we know about the wife of prophet n and Prophet lot and they were all this Believers we know what prophet n said about his son oh Allah what you have said is the truth and he is my son but he died as a cafir so Allah forbade him from asking Mercy to him because he is a a bad deed he's bad news and no immediately repented to Allah Asel and sought Allah's forgiveness so in short those who die non-muslims we consider them to be cfir disbelievers now generally speaking they're in hell but when it comes to specific people to n Mandela or to George Walker whatever his name is or Princess Diana can we say that they are in hell and answer is no this is Allah's hands we don't know if the last word they said we don't know if they had things to block them from accepting Islam that are justifiable at the sight of Allah however generally speaking we say they are cfir we don't participate in their bar burial we don't say rest in peace we do not uh ask Allah for forgiveness and mercy for them at all likewise and this is a very important issue we say that all Muslims who die will go to paradise but I know that this cousin of mine his name is Abdullah he died yesterday would I say he's in Jenna never a person who dies in Syria or in fighting in the battlefield with the disbelievers would I say he's a martyr and he's in heaven never no one can say a person is in Hell or a person in heaven specifically naming them but in totality this Believers are in Hell Believers are in heaven and it's all at the hands of Allah and Allah knows best and this doesn't mean that the man was not great while he was alive and he did not do good things he did wonderful things but still when it comes to asking Allah forgiveness or for Mercy or saying that he will be in Paradise or so he we do not know that he was a Muslim and hence we label him and describe Des cribe him as a disbeliever this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
