  "transcript": "well the Hadith is authentic without any uh uh dispute among Scholars and the Hadith says that there will be 70,000 of the prophet's uh umah who would enter Paradise without any accountability or punishment and when the companions disputed upon these uh 70,000 the prophet Alam came out to them and told them that they are people who do not believe in bad Omen and who do not um burn themselves as part of medical treatment this is called uh it's not like uh sterilization it's when you bring a hot piece of metal and scalding maybe I don't know and you put it on certain areas of the body to relieve certain types of illnesses so this is number two number three that they don't ask people to give them R and number four they have full dependence and Trust in Allah they have on Allah and in another Hadith the prophet said with each one of these 70,000 there will be a 70,000 more so you multiply 70,000 by 70,000 and in another Hadith Allah would add to them with his honorable hand uh uh more of that a SC a scoop or two now the Hadith tells us that it is part of the breach of full confidence though it is permissible but it is a breach of full confidence and dependence on Allah to go to an individual and say I have a problem I have gin I have magic I have um an evil eye I have Spirits in me so please recite Quran on me so that I would be relieved this is permissible but it is not a sign of full dependence and confidence and Trust in Allah the almighty and I hope this answers your question"
