  "title": "He wants to marry a woman from the UK but is afraid she may be too liberal, should he marry her?",
  "transcript": "i'm i am a jew national from the uk and libya and alhamdulillah married the libyan woman okay i wish to sponsor her so she can join me in the uk um i was born in the uk which is why i'm a jew national so it's not something i've attained in my life um so i wanted to know she handles that she prays and she reads the quran and i'm always asking her how she's getting along in relation to the islam however i'm wondering uh she can they can be quite liberal so i'm wondering how i how i can avoid her from falling into sin and becoming too liberal when she joins me in the west and i know this is a broad topic so what's the most useful and important ways of ensuring that she reigns steadfast and adheres to the basics of islam i would highly recommend that you cancel the whole thing marriage is not a test drive it's not a road trip that might be good one and might prove to be a failure and this is why we have to always try our level best to do our due diligence take someone after doing our homework who is a practicing muslim who checks all the boxes so that when i commit to it i've done my level best to bring someone from out of the uk who's a bit liberal who's inclined and susceptible to do things that are more heinous than what she's doing back home where it's a free country where there are feminist uh rules and regulations and rights where everybody's backing her up to rebel against her husband kick him out and sue him in court it wouldn't be at all logical to bring fuel and put it next to fire and pray to god it does not ignite this is not logical so despite all of the kinship the relationship the promises if you come to know that this investment is not a fruitful one on the long run run escape and minimize your losses so instead of losing 100 in the stock market hoping that the prices would go up no compromise your loss and lose 20 but run away with 80 percent rather than wait and you see the ship sinking and you can't do anything about it this is my advice to you and allah azzawajal knows best you"
