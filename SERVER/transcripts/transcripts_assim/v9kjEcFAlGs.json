  "title": "New Trend of Gifting Prayer Mat with the personâ€™s NAME on Sujood Spot Permissible??? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Ibtisam says, Sheikh nowadays it's a trend to gift a prayer mat with names written on it on them. Is this permissible? These names are mostly written at the place of Sajdah. There is nothing wrong in having a prayer mat with a name on it. But does it have any place in Islam in the sense that is the prayer mat as a piece of cloth something sacred? The answer is no. I can take a prayer mat and wash my car with it or wipe the floor with it. Sheikh, no there's no problem in it. It's just a piece of cloth. There's nothing sacred about it. Now why do we use prayer mats? Oh Sheikh because to have our prayer accepted. Oh this is an innovation. If you think that your prayer is not accepted without such a mat then this is an innovation. If you're using it because the floor has a bad smell or it's dirty or you're suspecting that there is an impurity, there's no problem in that. If the floor is too harsh for your skin and you need something softer, there's no problem in that at all. But as we see for example in many masjids, the full masjid is covered with carpets, very expensive, yet the imam has a prayer mat on top of that. This is totally unacceptable. Why would you have a prayer mat for the imam? Just because he's an imam, he's a higher degree, this is an innovation. What's the difference between the spot you're praying on and the spot the followers are praying? It's the same thing. So why have an extra prayer mat? This is an innovation. Unfortunately it's prevailing and it's spreading all over the Muslim world but nobody thinks about it unfortunately. So to conclude, to have a prayer mat with your name, my name, anyone's name on it has no significance, there's no problem in gifting it and Allah knows best."
