  "transcript": "lessons from the prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim alhim ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam may Allah be pleased with him told us that a man came to the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam and and he said oh prophet of Allah advise me but be brief so the prophet gave him three advises he said when you stand to pray pray like a man bidding farewell do not say anything for which you will have to apologize and give up hope for what other people have we talked about the prayer and its importance and how is it a person would pray the prayer of a person bidding farewell and we move on to the second part of the Hadith where the Prophet saysat do not say anything for which you will have to apologize for now this may sound a little bit strange and those who do not understand the Hadith would probably say that the prophet does not want us to apologize and some would even go further to say it is forbidden to apologize for the things you do and of course this understanding is not straight it's twisted the prophet alhat wasam is not telling us not to apologize on the contrary it is Islam when you do something wrong that that you ask for forgiveness and you apologize and that is why the more sins we offer the more we ask Allah for forgiveness and whenever you do someone wrong you surely have to apologize for him and seek his forgiveness and that is why the prophet Alat told us that whoever has any form of aggression or oppression against his fellow Muslim he should ask him for forgiveness before the day of judgment because then that is on the day of judgment there is no Durham or dinar there is no way that a person could compensate for the wrongs that he had done with paying money it is only good deeds and bad Deeds so the prophet Alam is definitely not instructing us not to apologize for our shortcomings and wrongdoings but the prophet Alat wasam is tackling the root of the problem so instead of doing wrong things and apologizing for them the best case scenario would be be that you don't do wrongdoings at all and this is exactly what the prophet is instructing us not to do that is not to say or do anything that we will have to regret it and apologize for it and unfortunately we are in great need for such an advice because we are not definitely doing any of that if we look at the things we say we will find that we have a lot of sins coming out from our mouths and this tongue of ours has lots and lots of implications that can be fatal and unfortunately whenever you sit with the Muslims you will not be able to skip b backbiting or ridiculing someone or slandering and as Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him said that nothing on Earth requires and needs long incarceration more than the tongue because this tongue is what takes a lot of us into big big trouble not only on Earth not only in this life but unfortunately on the day of judgment as well there are so many marriages and houses that have been demolished and destroyed by the tip of a tongue there are hundred hundreds and thousands of there are hundreds and thousands of feuds that were lit into flames by this tongue how many words a person says without noticing would take him down the fire of hell for more than 70 years the prophet Alat wasam was given the concise speech they used to count the number of words he utters sallallahu alaih wasam but if you look at all of these words you would find them only in the things that would please Allah the almighty and this is how we should be we should avoid saying saying things that we would need to apologize for and we should avoid saying things that would anger Allah and finally the prophet saysat and give up hope for what other people have this indicates that if you connect your heart to what others have hoping that maybe they will give you some of it this shows that you do not have full dependence on Allah and that your heart is not connected fully to him and that is why the prophet Alat wasam said whoever guarantees that he does not ask the people anything I would guarantee him Jenna the more you look at what the people possess and have in their hands the more you are enslaved to them and the more you look only at what Allah possesses and has the more you you will be rich by Allah free from worshiping free from being a slave to the Servants of Allah so this is a call from the prophet Alam to all of us to be only Rich by Allah and not to look at what people have whether in their power whether in their Fame or in their wealth I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time lessons from from The Prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim [Applause] alhim [Applause] [Applause]"
