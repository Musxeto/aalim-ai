  "transcript": "similar Rahman al Rahim hamdulillah hello banana mean rasul allah wa sallim wa barik alaa a birdie he wore a sword I mean nabina muhammad in water ali he was having a Jemaine assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today we're going to talk about one of the mountains among the companions may allah be pleased with them all we're going to talk about the 4th caliph of Islam his name is Ali they've been a bit early even Abdul Muttalib eben Hashim he was the first cousin of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and he was the son-in-law of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam he was born 10 years before the Prophet arezzo son became a prophet and a messenger of allah which means that he was 10 years old when the Prophet had a son became a prophet and he immediately accepted Islam to be the first among the children to become a Muslim there are lots and lots of things about I leave now with Allah may Allah be pleased with him there are lots of things to be said about him and the reason behind that is that he was the most of the companions that people spoke about and why was that because people were divided into two one were those who would make him a god-like figure they would go into extreme in praising him in fabricating things about him which he does not need as a great companion of the Prophet Allah so Salaam the other group went in the opposite direction degrading him talking negatively about him so that they would praise those who came after him from Benny ume√• and the history was not written except after the demolish of Brno manias Empire and that is why but Amaya so was to be said that they tried to silence people from talking about Ali and whenever they did this people spoke about him more and more and they started spreading all the good things about Ali may Allah be pleased with him and unfortunately lots of things were fabricated we do not need this to praise and to have great respect to our beloved I leave nabi Talib may Allah be pleased with him it is enough for us to read and know what the Prophet said erase salif's tell him about him the Prophet said if I am someone's mullah which translates to ally or friend if I the prophet of Allah the friend or the mullah or the ally of someone then Ali is his maole to Denali has to be our mawla our ally our friend may Allah be pleased with him and Ali himself says about himself and this is an authentic hadith he said that the prophet alayhi salatu salam told me once that no one would love you except those who believe and no one would hate you except those who are hypocrites so we know this for a fact that whoever this respects Ali may Allah be pleased with him whoever degrades him or say anything negative about him he is a hypocrite no Muslim on earth would say anything mad about Ali may Allah be pleased with him he was a student of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam as he was brought up in his house well why is that his father was alive but it was kind of returning to his uncle Abu Talib the favor the favor that Abu Talib took upon himself to bring up Muhammad our prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam as we know muhammed sallalahu Selim the prophet of Allah was brought up as an orphan his father died when either his mother was pregnant or his mother gave birth to him six months ago so he was 6 months of age and his mother died when he was also 4 or 6 years old so his grandfather Abdul Muttalib took him in his house and custody and after a year or two of the local he passed away and it was Abu Talib to take care of this boy to take care of his nephew and to bring him up among his children and when the prophet alayhi salatu salam married Hadiya and he noticed that Abu Talib was going through tough times he had ally he had a lot of his children such as Jafar and other children of his he noticed that his uncle was suffering and he could not afford and provide his children so he took Ali in his house under his custody just to relieve his uncle and Ali was brought up by the Prophet Ariel Absalom in the house of Khadijah I live nearby Talib was articulate he spoke beautiful words with light around these words words of wisdom that are documented to show us how wise and articulate this companion of the Prophet al-assad salam was he was not just an orator with beautiful words he was also among the most knowledgeable among the companions may allah be pleased with them and that is why the Companions of Allah would go to him whenever there were difficult problems they could not solve Omar may Allah be pleased with him would go to him and consult him for advice and Ali would give him this advice and if anyone would have been proud of something surely I leave never thought I would have this pride in his hand he would be proud he would boast if he wishes that he was the cousin of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and that is he was the son-in-law of the prophet ra salatu salam his uncle was the master of the martyrs hamza even Abdul Muttalib his two sons are the masses of the youth in Paradise al-hasan and al-husayn and his brother was known to be Jaffa a PR the companion of the Prophet Elisha rostrum who was martyred in the Battle of Makkah he carried the flag of the Muslims with his right when they attacked him and chopped his right he held it with his left when they chopped his left arm he held it with his shoulders and then they killed him and that is why the prophet alayhi salatu salam when allah revealed to him what had happened hundreds and hundreds of miles to the north immediately the Prophet Allah saw salaam said they didn't Haditha the leader fought bravely until he died a martyr and then took the flag my cousin John from na VI Talib and he fought until his both arms were chopped off he held it with his shoulders and he was martyred and then Abdullah Abdullah had a third leader to lead the army was also martyred and then holiday meal Walid a sword of Allah the prophet called him the sword of Allah took the flag and Allah grant them victory and saved them from defeat and they came back so this was his brother Jennifer even Abu Talib known as Shar for a pie yah because he was replaced with two wings and he flies in Paradise with the Angels and so that is why he's known as Jaffa the flying or the pilot or whatever you may translate that to we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back Salaam alaikum wa rahmatullahi and welcome back Haile even I be tired may Allah be pleased with him his biography is so vast and big to the extent that scholars say no companion of the prophet alayhi al-salam was said about him more than I leave my battalion but whenever you read his biography you would find that a lot of wrong things bad things things beyond imagination to be said about the Companions of the Prophet array salatu salam Platz politics dirty politics and all of this is a fabrication all of it is not true the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said do not insult my companions for by the one in whose hands is my soul if one of you were to spend the equivalent of a hood in gold it would not amount to a mood of one of them or half of that what is the mood a mood is what you carry in the palms of your two hands so the Prophet is saying Alice a lot of serum that if we spent the equivalent of the mountain of hood in gold imagine how many tons thousands of tons in this mountain if there were to be gold and we spend it at the cause of Allah this would not be equivalent to the amount of mud of one of the Companions of the Prophet Allah some or even half of that and the funny thing is do you know who the Prophet said this is the last time - he said it too highly evening Walid he Holloman Walid Mela be pleased with him the sword of Allah disputed once with Abdullah marry me off and they argued and apparently how it may have said something wrong to Abdul Rahman which angered him and he went to the prophet and told him I saw Sarah so the Prophet is addressing Khalid ib'n Alwaleed safe Allah and he's telling him that if you spend the equivalent of Mount Hood you would not come close to what the mood of abdomen off so what about us this is between two companions what about us definitely would not even come close to anything of that at all yet we are shocked we are dismayed we despise the act of some of those who claim to love I live never eat Allah may Allah be pleased with him when they slander and insult all the other companions these people are not Muslim who insult Abu Bakr Umar this man Aisha may Allah be pleased with them all they insult them and they say that they have all apostates after the death of the prophet alayhi salatu salam this is blasphemy none of them is a Muslim if he continues to do the and if he dies on believing this those who compiled on Ali may Allah be pleased with him did fabricate things and those who spoke against Ali they are also not Muslim because they are hypocrites so the Muslims the real Muslims are in between they love Ali they acknowledge that he's a human that he is the fourth man to come after Abu Bakr Umar and earth man and they also protect him from anyone to talk negatively about him as he was the son-in-law of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam so take this as a rule of thumb anyone who talks negatively about ali is not a Muslim he's a hypocrite and anyone who praises Ali may Allah be pleased with him on the account of degrading the other companions or insulting them is also not a Muslim a real Muslim loves all the companions of the Prophet Ali salatu salam has great regard and respect to them all Ali bin Abi Talib was one of the bravest warriors of Islam he was so brave that when the Prophet alehsalaam wanted to migrate to Medina he told him that the people are coming to assassinate me tonight this is what Allah has revealed to me and I need someone to sleep in my bed so that they would not attack me as I am leaving and migrating to Medina so we would like to come of Lodge it we would like to pretend as if I'm sleeping and when it's daybreak when they want to come and assassinate me I would have been way gone from Mecca Ali volunteered and said o prophet of Allah I'm the one to sleep in your bed and so it was the Prophet told him O'Reily sleep in my bed Allah will protect you when you wake up give all these deposits that people entrusted me with give it back to their lawful owners and so it was highly spent the night in the profits bed sleeping knowing that they will attack him there is a big possibility of them assassinating him thinking that he was the prophet alayhi salatu salam but he had his trust in allah if he dies he dies a martyr and if he doesn't then he protected and helped to protect the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam he was among the bravest in the battle field he was a fierce warrior he was only 25 years old in the Battle of Badr when three of the greatest warriors of the pagans of the disbelievers came before the battle took place and they requested a duel and this is was the habit in all nations whenever they meet there is a duel just to show who is braver and who is stronger so three men came from the pagans army rota and Sheba the son of Rabia two brothers and the son of utbah in his name is al walid they came out and they requested warriors to come and fight them man-to-man so three of the Ansar came out and they said who are you and they said their names and out of respect these three dignitaries of Mecca said you are honorable people and the sons of honorable men but it is not you who want to fight we would like to fight someone from our cousins from our tribe look at this respect even among the disbelievers they are in a place of war they were just about to kill each other but respect is always there so the Prophet is a lot of Sam when he heard this he said Hamza Ali obeyed them in hadith all of you from Beni Abdul Muttalib go and fight your peers immediately Hamza and Ali with one strike they killed those whom they fought with and obeyed them in hadith and the one he was fighting with exchanged blows injuring one another and then Ali and Hamza assisted him and they all killed the third one and the pagans were outraged highly at this early age was a very strong man his strength was unbelievable and he was not a big fellow he was shorter kind of a short person but he was both strong physically and mentally I didn't have a Talib may Allah be pleased with him also was among those who gave the Pledge of Allegiance in Seoul today beer or the treaty of hudaibiya when Beata radwan took place when the prophetess took their allegiance pledge of allegiance to fight till the death and I leap ABI talib may allah be pleased with him attended all the battles with the prophet a list of Salaam whenever the Prophet went and fought he was with him except in the Battle of Tabuk where the prophet alayhi salatu salam made him his deputy and the ruler of medina while he went with the army to the north of Arabia and ali did not like this and he said o prophet of allah was it something you saw from me am i a coward so that you leave me behind with women and children why is that I want to go with you and fight so the Prophet said that in his salat wa salam o honey you are to me like Haroon was to musa but there is no prophet after me look at these beautiful words the Prophet is comforting him and saying to him that to me you're exactly like my brother Aaron who was - Moses please be upon them but there is no prophet after me so you're not a prophet but you are as close to me as Aaron was to Moses Ali may Allah be pleased with him also attended the Battle of high bar where the Prophet Allah Salih said I'm besieged and surrounded the village of high bar where the Jews were the first day Abu Bakr went and fought fiercely without any results the second day Umar went and fought with the army fiercely but with no results at night the Prophet said Ali salatu salam tomorrow morning I will give the flag I will give the leadership to a man that loves Allah and His Prophet Ali so solemn and a man who is beloved by Allah and His Prophet so every companion of the Prophet Isis I am wanted to gain this honor and to be that man Robert says never ever I wish to be a ruler except on that day because whoever is given the flag this is a testimony from the prophet alayhi salatu salam that Allah and His Prophet loved him so after Fajr prayer the Prophet said that is awesome where is Ali and he was not attending they told him Ali has an illness in his eyes sort of a trachoma whatever so he called him he came not being able to see the Prophet spit in his eyes and it became well again and he gave him the flag and he told him go and fight in the cause of Allah and called them to believe in the oneness of Allah Azza WA JAL and he told us that Allah will make him victorious so he left and he fought bravely and subhanAllah he managed to conquer and to win the war against the Jews and that is why the Jews still today remember hiber and the kids in Palestine when they fight those aggressors they fight high bhai Berea hood Mohammed Sophia rude fiber fiber or you Jews the army of Mohammed is coming back because they know it commemorates something bad and sad to the Jews it was said that he killed merhaba alia who D a fierce warrior from the Jews he killed him with one blow he split him into two and then one of the Warriors managed to cut and to have his shield so he grabbed the door the gate of that fortress and he fought with it the whole day until Allah so jail grant him victory the Companions say that we tried to carry this gate this door and six of us could not carry it this shows you how strong this man who fought with this gate at his arm this is Ali bin Abi Talib and this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
