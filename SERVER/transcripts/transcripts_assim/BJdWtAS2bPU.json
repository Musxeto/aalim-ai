  "transcript": "what do we mean by nan muharram in the states if a person has a cousin they treat her as a sister they cannot marry her and this is totally false and baseless in Islam a cousin is a cousin the one you are not allowed to marry or your mother your sister your daughter your paternal or maternal aunt your niece from your brother or your sister these are permanently my mom to you but your male cousins are not Muharram for me my female cousins are not Muharram I can marry them which means that straight pawn can come in between"
