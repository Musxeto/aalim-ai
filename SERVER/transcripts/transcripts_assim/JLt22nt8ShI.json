  "transcript": "and from the philippines he says what's the meaning of fatwa and who are qualified to give fatwa well fatwa means a religious verdict over something so it's an answer to a question or to a situation that requires a religious verdict so fatwa can be in religion if i ask someone a mathematician what is one plus one equals he says the fatwa is two the answer is no this is not a fatwa this is in answer to a question but a fatwa is a religious verdict and who are qualified the scholars the scholars of islam who possess the tools that enable them to understand the sources of islam quran or the sunnah jumac consensus analogy class and they know the uh usual abrogated and abrogation and they know the interpretation of the quran in not necessarily in totality but they can give fatwa in things that they have full capacity and knowledge over so someone can give you fatwa in prayer issues because he knows inside out these issues but he can't give you fatwa in zakat because this is not his field so you have someone who is known as someone who is not and this is a long topic but for us laymen we should look for someone who is trustworthy in his knowledge islamic knowledge in his religious practice and that he is recommended by other scholars to give fatwa like sheikh islam in tamiya did not give fatwa until so many people approved him from the scholars imam malik they say that 70 people approved him from the scholars of his time to give fatwa and so on and allah azza knows best abu haf says"
