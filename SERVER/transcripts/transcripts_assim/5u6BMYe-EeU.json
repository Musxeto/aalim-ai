  "title": "Eating meat slaughtered by Christians and Jews",
  "transcript": "and the second question regarding halal meat and this is a very very long topic we can spend an hour or so discussing it but if you look at the Hadith governing it you would and and the verse of the Quran of course that mentions this you would understand that Allah permitted us to eat any meat that was slaughtered by a Jew a Christian or a Muslim providing that they did not the Jews and the Christians did not mention any other name than Allah they did not say in the name of Moses or in the name of Jesus if they did not say this or we did not know what they had said it is halal for us for a Muslim he has to say bmah if he forgot to say Bismillah then it is not lawful for us to eat from what he had slaughtered now the this is the main rule if I go to the US or to Canada now the country is a Christian country so Scholars like baz and may Allah have mercy on their souls say that going to these countries they are Christian countries so it is lawful for you to eat without asking other Scholars say well this is generalization and making life easy for people but if you are a little bit of a practicing Muslim and you'd like to be safe rather than being sorry and you know that the majority of the slaughter houses in these countries they do not Slaughter they sting the animal they give it an electric shock that kills it then they slaughter it if you know this for a fact not speaker Rel ations or he say if you know this for a fact this is a dead meat you cannot eat it and if you don't know and you you're doubtful this is up to your level of virtue and and piety and and fear of Allah so if someone says listen I have no idea whether they slaughter or not and it's a Christian country by default can I eat the answer is generally speaking yes you can but if you are a person of not a knowledge a person with fear of Allah and an amount of righte righteousness that you believe it's a little bit more than anybody else or more than most of the people in this case you should investigate and if you in investigated and found out that the majority do not Slaughter it's best for you to stop and not to eat from it so if I personally when I travel I don't eat from these places I don't eat from places that are doubtful I travel most of my travels go are to the UK and they have the HMC and the HFA and I would eat from both because both of them claim to be Halal and this is enough for me now there are a little bit of technicalities HFA have uh has a different process and procedure not as strict as HMC and this one is much better but to me I would eat from both now if I did not find food that is served by or certified by both organizations can I go to KFC or to McDonald's or to whatever and eat just depending on the claim that it's a Christian country and I can eat whatever they serve and I say simply thism I wouldn't do this I would never ever do this because I will not die if I don't eat in these fast food uh chains but if I see someone eating in them I would not look down at him and say what a bad Muslim you are because he has some sort of legitimacy in what he's doing he has the fatwa backing him up now the level of righteousness differ from one person to the other me thinking that I am o mashallah I cannot look at people and force them to follow what I say because they have other Scholars and uh legit Scholars who advise them to do this so I believe inshallah that this uh uh is the answer to your question sister am mean"
