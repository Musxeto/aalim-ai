  "transcript": "so I heard the Hadi that we should move or shake the index finger and look at it while T however during T I look at the place of frustrations and I don't move or raise index finger because I am not used to do that so in the last T when I re could you please specifically tell me that in this four parts is there anything wrong if I look at the place of frustrations and what's the recommended Sunnah to look at in each of this part and should we move our Shake finger until saying Salam why don't you add three more questions just to make it half a dozen maybe that would make it easier we said only one question anyhow theith of may Allah be pleased with him that the prophet Sall wasallam used to point with his index finger moving it making Dua with it the Hadith of Abdullah Zu may Allah be pleased with a man with his father says that he used to point his index finger and not move it so the scholars took the first Hadith to be evidence that this companion saw something the other one did not see either way it's a Sunnah so if a person does not raise his finger at all he just keeps his hand like this the prayer is totally valid and correct if he does this and moves it throughout the prayer according to the of may Allah be pleased with him then he is doing the Sunnah if he looks at his index finger throughout the sitting position he's doing the Sunnah if he doesn't he looks at the spot of his prostration no problem the prayer is still valid these things are Sunnah if you do it you'll get more reward if you don't do it your prayer is valid and you're not sinful if you skip it for any reason and Allah Knows Best"
