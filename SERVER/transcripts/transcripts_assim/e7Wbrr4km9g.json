  "transcript": "from the u.s he says i want to buy a house from um united islamic financing or whatever and they have a plot and they have a profit by of 2.8 they say the final price is fixed and there is a penalty fee if you are late etc i cannot answer such questions because a lot of the muslims call me about such financing and i say i have to look at the contract and it's not logical for me to look at the contract when it's like 15 20 pages and there are fine prints all over the place and the devil is in the details so you cannot just simply say oh it says islamic financing no lots of the islamic financing are unislamic they have scholars on their sharia board that meets every blue moon and they discuss few things that are shariah related and they sign and they give the verdict how this is implemented nobody knows not even the scholars they don't have an auditing system to check whether their fat was are correct implemented or not so the islamic quote unquote bank goes and does whatever he wants from the general corporate banking the standard a conventional court with banking and whenever someone doubts it and says oh but this is haram this is we have a fatwa and nobody knows that this fatwa is on paper it's not implemented on the ground so i cannot say that this is halal but the most authentic opinion among scholars that the late payment fee is ripa because this is interest taken from a debtor or someone who took a loan from you so this is interest over a debt now most of these on quote-unquote islamic banks would say yes but we don't take this fee the penalty fee for ourselves we give it for charity it's the same concept the loss that occurred on the one who took the loan this loss this interest given to charity giving to a masjid taken by the bank itself it is still riba for him to pay it now taking 2.8 percent profit over the general amount of the property and this cannot be increased there's no problem in that if i have this pen for one euro and i'd like to sell it to you in installments and i say okay i'll sell it to you for two euros 100 profit no problem this is fixed the issue is you're buying the property from the owner or from a third party financing it so my name is asam i'm interested in buying a house that belongs to abdullah i go to abdullah he says 300 000 for the house i said i don't have it in cash can you take stones he said no i need the 300 000 in cash so the bank xyz islamic bank comes and says listen i'll buy it for you and you pay me four hundred thousand dollars instead of 300 i'll take only um 33 i don't know i'm not good at math so what do you say i said okay he said okay then sign all these documents and papers stating when i read that i buy it that i'm committed that i will not default and i say okay what should i sign here but you're saying that you're selling me the house and you don't possess the house said yes after you finish i will go and possess it and then i'll resell it to you this is not permissible he's selling me something he does not possess so actually he doesn't care about the house or it's a mansion or if it's a veron uh uh he cares about giving me three hundred thousand and i return them to him four hundred thousand that's it what i do with it it's none of his concern no this is not permissible the second uh oh well i'm told that we have three minutes left so there is a something called diminishing ijara where you become a partner with the bank you buy and then you rent from this company that is you and the bank and the ownership of the bank is diminished and reduced while yours is increasing but this needs more uh time you"
