  "title": "Why are the Prophet’s ‎ﷺ parents in Hell? Can we pray Janazah or ask forgiveness for non-Muslims?",
  "transcript": "61 can we ask for forgiveness or to offer salatul janazah to non-muslims what is the evidence the prophet islam was denied this right in the quran by saying do not ever pray for any of them that dies and that is of the uh of the hypocrites openly hypocrites and of the disbelievers and also in the authentic hadith when the prophet is muslim the once so they asked him oh prophet of allah why do you cry and this is authentic muslim he said i requested my lord i requested allah to seek forgiveness for my mother and he forbade me from doing this and i requested him to visit her grave so he granted me the permission what do we learn from this hadith that it is permissible to visit the graves of non-muslims for what for asking forgiveness no just to remember the to remember that this is uh what we will where we will be and we learn from it that the mother of the prophet is not a muslim and she is in hell wow this is difficult yes it is difficult but this is what's in sahih muslim a man came to the prophet and he said oh prophet of allah where is my father the prophet said your father is in hell so man the man was a little bit taken away and saddened and the prophet said listen your father and my father are in hell so this means that the parents of the prophet islam are not muslims and they are in hell one would say how dare you say such a thing i say i didn't say it if it were for me i would sacrifice my father and mother so that the father and mother of the prophet islam would become muslim and they would join the prophet elizabeth because i love what the prophet loves but this is not to me and am i being disrespectful this is what the prophet told us i bring something from my own pocket okay what about the narrations that allah revived abdullah the father amina the mother and the talib and they accepted islam to the prophet this is authentic i would be more than happy to accept it but it is baseless it has no authenticity at all we all love the prophets some more than we love our children and more than we love our parents and more than we love anyone else on earth so don't try to take advantage of this if it was authentic i would 100 support you but i cannot and this is what the prophet said okay weren't they among the people of fatra weren't they among the people where there were no messenger and we know that those who do not have messengers will be questioned on the day of judgment the answer is yes but we also know that the religion of jesus christ was there the original religion of ibrahim was there in matka and there were people who were manifest would not worship anyone else but allah such as the father of saeed one of the ten heaven bound he would come and buy the women or the girls to be executed when they're young and whenever they bring him a sheep slaughtered to their idols he said i do not eat something like this allah gave us the rain which grew the crops which this sheep ate why do you sacrifice it to someone else than him so he was among the monarchists and the prophet told us that he before the prophet was a messenger he met him and he said that he would be resurrected on the day of judgment alone as an ummah as an individual because he was a monotheist he believed in allah azza so scholars say that the parents of the prophet islam had the tau hate but they did not accept it and therefore they were classified as disbelievers so again do not become emotional this is black and white this is if you falsify it you might as well falsify everything else in the sharia because it doesn't suit your brains and what difference does it make if the father of a messenger is in hell to us can you give me a father of a messenger in hell in the quran azer who is azer the father of ibrahim it's mentioned in the quran you want to falsify the quran as well so you have a problem and you have to solve this problem inshallah you"
