  "transcript": "should the right foot while sitting in etosha hood be erect or should I put it on the floor no the right foot is always Iraq this is a Sunnah whether it is your first raka your first shot your last shot it should be erected but if you are not used to it or if it is giving you some pain no problem in laying it down number three what's your ruling on shaving the body for men hair on a man's body is either mandatory to remove or prohibit it to remove or permissible to remove the prohibited hair to remove is the hair of the beard and eyebrows this is totally prohibited for a man to remove the obligatory hair to remove is the hair on the armpit and over and around the pubic area this is a must and the hair which is permissible is the rest of the body so if a man wants to remove the hair on his arms or legs or chest this is permissible but as Asadullah said that because the coach while swimming tells us that this affects the flow and the aerodynamics or the water dynamics or whatever they call it and this is problematic if you're going to swim with these thongs or these what they call swimming trunks in and the word is longer than the trunks themselves this is haram you're exposing your outer your thighs etcetera this is totally prohibited with hair or without hair but generally speaking if someone simply doesn't want this hair and he's not doing it because he's becoming you know like figure skating he wants to become a little bit gauge or imitate women no we're talking about a straight man but he's annoyed by the hairs too much is too bushy he wants to remove it this there's no problem in that insha'Allah"
