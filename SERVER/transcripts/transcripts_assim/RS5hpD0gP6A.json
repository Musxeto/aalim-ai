  "transcript": "and finally Zubair says is with Amanda Terry it's an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion and the majority of Muslims they say according to hadith over abadan assignment may Allah be pleased with him that it is not mandatory the only thing that is mandated in the five daily prayers which the prophet alayhi salat wa salam has stated in hadith hamza salah wot 5 mandatory prayers that allah has obligated upon his servants whoever performs them on time and perfects their will and their Recor and their sujood he has a pledge with allah azza wajal to forgive his sins and whoever doesn't then it is up to allah whether to forgive or to punish so roberta muhammad said this hadith when he heard that there were other companions stating that whitter is watching so he got angry and he said no this is not true and the evidence is the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam"
