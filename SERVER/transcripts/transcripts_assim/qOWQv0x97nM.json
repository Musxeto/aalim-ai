  "transcript": "can we have zany dean from uk um this is regarding um the concept of wishful wishful ideology you know when we were kids like we used to be taught that if you look at the stars and you wish for something or if you go to the wishing well and you throw a coin into the wishing well and you say whatever you wish for it will be granted so what is the basis of this and is it permissible to go to the wishing well and to throw a coin into it and to ask something or to look at the stars and to wish for something okay i will answer your question inshallah so zen is asking about the concept of seeing a shooting star and hoping for something with the ideology that it will come true or going to a well in in venice or in rome and throwing a coin hoping for something or putting a lock in a fence and hoping for something this is all not related to islam it can be major shirk major if you think that this star would get your wish fulfilled or throwing a coin in a well because it's a blessed well it will get your uh wish fulfilled and it can be a minor shirk which is greater than the major sense if you think that allah azzawajal is the one who answers your wish but through this innovated means so definitely this is haram and not permissible"
