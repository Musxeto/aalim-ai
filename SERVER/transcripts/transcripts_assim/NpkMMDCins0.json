  "transcript": "Lahaina raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salamu ala nabina muhammad in wallahi wasabi ajma'in assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we have with us hadeeth number 103 so we would like someone to read it for us please yes brother over there are necessary Porter that prophet salallahu alaihe salam peace be upon Abu Bakr and Umar you shall begin the appraised by al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen one question before we continue do I say peace and blessing be upon him or salallahu alaihe wasalam I personally prefer to use the Arabic Silla tation because the translation itself is not correct when you say sallallahu alayhi wasallam so they say peace and blessing but a salat from Allah is not blessing it is praising because Allah is mentioning the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam among his court in the seventh heaven so Allah is actually praising the prophet and sending his peace upon him so I would prefer if you would like to translate it to say peace and praise of Allah be upon him but if you say it in Arabic it would be much more convenient because this is the actual salat we offer to the Prophet or a sorcerer I pray read messenger of allah salallahu alaihe salam I earn with Abu Bakr Umar and Othman and I never heard any one of them reciting bismillahi rahmani raheem loudly and in another narration for muslim i prayed behind the messenger of allah salallahu alaihe salam and with Abu Bakr Umar and Othman and used to begin the prayers where al hamdulillah he rabbul aalameen and would not decide bismillahi r-rahmanir-rahim neither in the beginning nor at the end of the situation very well the hadith is referring to reciting loud the basmala which is the short-form of bismillahi r-rahmani r-rahim before reciting surah al-fatiha or any other given and the majority of scholars consider reciting the Fatiha not loudly generally speaking consider reciting the Fatiha before there is let me rephrase that the majority of scholars consider reciting bismillahi r-rahmanir-rahim before the fatiha to be recommended mustahab with the exception of mmm Malik who says that this is not preferred or recommended at all and reciting it loudly has been only recommended or has only been recommended by Alabama Shafi so the Shafi school is the one that you always pray behind them and say bismillah r-rahman r-rahim al-hamdu Laramie and also they cascade this to all of the prayers or actually all the sewers of the Quran so if they want to recite Kalevala wahad they say bismillahir rahmanir rahim allahu allah ha ha and whether this is acceptable or not it's an issue of dispute and whenever we have dispute what to do go back and refer to the Quran and to the Sunnah and how do we know the sunnah by referring to the hadith of the Companions we weren't there and we don't have anything that the prophecies say or do not take an assembly malik accompany the prophet alayhi salatu salam for how many long years ten and then he accompanied Abu Bakr Omar and Othman for about 25 years and none of them ever recited bismillah alrahman alraheem before fatiha what does this tell you it definitely and surely tells you that it is not part of the Sunna with all due respect to the Shafi'i must have and the school of thought one of the greatest schools of thought in Islam and Imam Muhammad ibn Idris Mushaf al may Allah be pleased with him and have mercy on his soul one of the great Imams of Islam without any doubt however no one is perfect and no one's narration or rulings can be blindly accepted except the Prophet Allah to serve all the rest we have to cross-reference it we have to cross examine it with the Quran and Sunnah it applies and goes okay with the Quran Sunnah we take it otherwise we reject it and this is what abu hanifa himself said may allah be pleased with him and have mercy on his soul honey if I said if we get the hadith from the prophet alayhi salatu salam it is over our heads meaning we go nowhere else other than the hadith and if we have the ruling and the verdict from the Companions of the Prophet ala sjöström we take from their sayings and nothing else comes ahead what does he mean meaning that if they differ we take one of theirs but we don't take anything out of what they had taught us and said to us then he said but if we get anything other than the prophet and his companions meaning the tabie rain or the other types of scholars he says they are men and we are men what does that mean that means that they have no holiness to what they say because they're normal people the prophets teachings is sacred al-islam the Companions when they say something and agree upon it it is part of the deed if they differ we have to choose one of them but we cannot go against what they have said it has to be among one of them but the others they can be right and they can be wrong and likewise when we come to the issue of reciting bismillah al-rahman al-rahim before the fatiha anise is stating it clearly needed the Prophet nor Abu Bakr Omar Othman had done this therefore we do not do it and the question that may arise what about if I pray behind an imam who follows the chef in email hub and he reads this what should I do nothing listen and pray because he believes that this is part of the Sunnah and you are a follower you have no say to him and therefore your prayer is valid in sha Allah and there is nothing wrong in what you have done we move on to one of the great chapters of Islam and that is the prostration of forgetfulness or known as cejudo as Sahu and we have a number of hadith with us yet before we go through the hadith I'd like to bring it to your attention that the Sahu is done or the forgetfulness prostration is done for one of three either you subtract from your prayer meaning you miss something out or you add something in your prayer or you're in doubt whether you did or you did not and this you did or you did not has also two sections we will come to talk about them when to prostrate for forgetfulness there are certain situations we prostrate before salam concluding the prayer and there are certain locations and situations where we prostrate after the salam and we offer another salam and how we do we know this by following the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and the sooner that covers this are found in the hadith of abu huraira the hadith of Abu Lahab Mahina the hadith of absurdity the hadith of the law have masud may allah be pleased with them and we will come to mention some of these hadith and the things related to them with the grace of allah azza wajal so the first hadith is a long one reported in Suhail Imam Muslim yes Karen if Miss Irene Ramallah reported a boo-boo radar the Allah one who are saying the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wa sallam led us in one of the two evening prayers that is either zohar or a sir and gave salutations after two rakahs and went towards a piece of wood which was placed to the direction of the Qibla in the mosque leaned on it looking as if he were angry putting his right hand over the left and crossing his fingers together Abu Bakr and Umar but among the people and they were too afraid to speak to him and the people came out in haste saying the prayer has been shortened however among them was a man called vivoli a Dane who said messenger of allah salallahu alayhi wa sallam has the prayer being shortened or have you forgotten the prophet of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam said I didn't forget and it wasn't shortened the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said to the companions is it as zulia dane is saying they said yes he then offered two maracas and ended the prayer by salon then set the green and frustrated similar to his frustration or longer and lifted his head then gave that bead and frustrated again similar or longer than the first one then said that bead and raised his head they asked the narrator if he had offered another Salam he the narrator then says I was told that Imran bin Hussein may Allah be pleased with him said that he concluded with Salam is widely known among the jurors among the folk AHA to be hadith Vilia Deen and Zulia Deen means the man with the two arms or the two hands so what's the special don't we all have two hands they say that he had an extra length in his hands so he was known to be the man with the two hands we have a short break so stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back Salam alaikum and welcome back so what is hadith do leading the Prophet once prayed the hoorah sir two Rakas and he offered salaam and then he went to a piece of witches which might have been a member or any piece of wood in the direction of the Qibla sat on it put his right on his left and put his cheek as if he was worried or he had something that is angering him something that's worrying him some scholars say that he was worried because he concluded the prayer but he felt that it wasn't the usual prayer and another said no he had something that was worrying him and the people had Abu Bakr and Umar the closest to him but they were afraid to talk to him because this is something new and no one spoke those who were at the end of the Masjid the latest to come and the first to leave there are people who are always the late late to come the last one to enter the message but the first to leave immediately after he offered Salam they said hamdulillah the prayer has been shortened instead of for now is two and they left and the people sat there did not know what to do one of them was duly attained a man described as the man with the two long arms and this brings us to an issue which is wouldn't this be backbiting to call someone a man with the long ears or the man with the long arms or shorty or fatso or whatever wouldn't this be backbiting scholars say if it is describe him and it does not anger him then there is no problem what do you mean if someone says I met came yesterday and I said which I met he said the bold one the one who has no hair now he's saying this to ridicule him or discredit him or to describe him so as long as it's a description there is no problem in saying it insha'Allah this man was brave enough to stand up and said two questions prophet of Allah has the prayer been shortened or did you forget if it was shortened this mean it is a revelation from Allah and the Prophet would never ever make mistakes in revealing the Quran or the order of Allah true because Allah protects it so he's got two questions so the Prophet said that Islam it was not shortened and I did not forget so now do Leah Dane knew that it was not a revelation this only makes or keeps only one other possibility and there is human error so immediately he said in another narration in this case prophet of Allah you have forgotten Allah he knew it's not a revelation from Allah it was not shortened then you are forgotten so the Prophet looked at abu bakr umar said what is due leading saying i need verification and they said yes prophet of allah you pray 2 rakaats so immediately the Prophet came down faced the Qibla and offered his remaining Torah cards the third and the fourth after tisha hood he offered salaam and then offered to prostration of Sahu so long similar in length to the normal frustrations of his prayer and after it he offered salaam as a more honorable assigned may allah be pleased with him said now what do we learn from this hadith we learned that the salute of prostration can be after and we will get to know inshaallah when it is before we also learn that speaking talking during prayer does not nullify it if it was done out of ignorance I didn't know as in the hadith of Mariah hymnal hakkim when he was in prayer a man next to him sneezed and said alhamdulillah Somalia out of courtesy said your hammock a mullah and prayer and all the companions started looking at him in prayer because looking at the time was permissible it was even permissible to talk but at that moment it wasn't so they started looking at him and when he watched that everybody is looking at him with wrong way of looking he said why so glum Maya may Allah make my mother lose me what what are you looking for what are you looking at what have I done he's speaking and the people started clapping their thighs making him shut up so he did not speak after the prayer finished the prophet alayhi Salam Salam brought the man and told him my friend this prayer is not suitable for people's talk it is only made for dhikr Allah and for reciting the Quran and he told the men that whenever something takes place and you would like to bring the attention of the Imam or someone else you say subhanAllah and the clapping is made only for women that is during prayer so talking out of ignorance does not nullify Salah talking unintentionally does not nullify Salah can people talk unintentionally in prayer yes I'm all the time happens your mother is praying and your younger brother or sister who is a child is climbing over the sofa and then over the television set and is about to jump your mother without even intending it said watch out or bring the attention to another sister Aisha going take your brother unintentionally does this notify her prayer no because it was done unintentionally and likewise luleå Danish conversation with the prophet alayhi salatu salam the Prophet himself stalking this did not nullify his prayer so a similar situation I've missed two rakahs with the Imam and I'm completing it after them I'm finished I pray 2 rakaats my friend prayed only one raka and he gave Salam before me after I finished my prayers and I said he you prayed only one other car he said no no I pray 2 rakaats so no no you prayed one raqqa and he said did I miss one or two I said no you missed two stole what should I do I said you go and pray the rocaille you have missed and then offer Salam and then offer to you the so said before or after so he's talking to me and he did not conclude his prayer does this affect his prayer no he goes and continues his prayer like described in this hadith and there are a number of different scenarios but I believe that we should leave it here and when then we will talk about the other hadith of the Lahaina bemis road and I was 8 and then we will summarize it at the very end and when to prostrate before when to prostrate after what are the situations and we will shallow the sky is the limit we have few minutes left so if you have any questions yes brother Salam aleikum la what we have to recite enough after 2 such that such dancers do so excellent question what do we recite when we make the prostration of Sahu what do we say do we say oh Allah forgive my forgetfulness or no the scholars say you make the normal Vicar of sujood do you have to read yet no no no no I've said this after performing Surya who you offer Salam there is no tired after it and what you say while in this route subhanAllah beer and like any other schedule yes brother Shaikh this is for information the hadith which we dis know when true it says that the Prophet Salla Salemi forgot to pray 2 rakaats did this happen any other time as well or how many times did this happen in the life of prophets allah wa salam we don't have exact number but we have in for example the hadith of abdullah heaviness road where he states that the prophet al-islam prayed of the wife rocailles he added more and after he concluded they told him prophet of allah you prayed v rocker he said did i do so and they told him yes he did so he faced the qibla and offered to salute Sahu you cannot erase v rocker also there is another hadith where the Prophet as Salam stood up to the 3rd raka and did not sit for the jihad and the people said subhanAllah subhanAllah and he signaled to them and saying that stand up so he finished the prayer and he offered to do the Sahu before Salam so we have these three cases we have a fourth case where he recited the Quran once and dropped an ayah and after he finished the prayer had been carved may Allah be pleased with him one of the greatest and highly regarded the situs of the Quran the whom the Prophet told us to take the Quran from them obeyed niqab one of the for whom the Prophet told us to take the Quran from told him o prophet of Allah you did not recite ayat so and so and the professes subhanAllah why didn't you remind me during prayer so we know that the Prophet Allah Islam was a human being that he may forget but he would never make a mistake in conveying the religion and in the recitation of the Quran because this was and this is protected by Allah and that is why when he forgot an ayah and he said I am a human being like you if I forget remind him when he forgot an ayah immediately the companions were the one to remind him of that which means that the religion is completely protected by allah azza wajal yes brother Shi if I join in the ruku will that you completed the cut for me the Prophet said RA his salat WA Salam whoever joins the Imam in the ruk or while the Imam is in the rock or this is Erica and likewise whoever prays one raka before sunset then he has prayed also because if he did not finish one raka he did not make record before the sunset this would not be a valid prayer for him I'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
