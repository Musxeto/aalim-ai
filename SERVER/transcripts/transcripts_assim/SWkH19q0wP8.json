  "transcript": "The second question is, what does it mean when Allah repents on us? Allah's beautiful name is At-Tawwab and this is one of His names, which means that Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala, one, throws in our hearts the remorse and the regret over a sin that we've committed so that we would quit that sin and intend not to do it and to seek His forgiveness. So He's the one who initiated the feeling of repentance in our hearts because His name is At-Tawwab. Secondly, He's the one who accepts us after initiating such feeling of remorse and repentance. He's the one who accepts our repentance and forgives our sin and pardons us, Azza Wa Jal, and this is what is meant by Allah's repenting on us, Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala."
