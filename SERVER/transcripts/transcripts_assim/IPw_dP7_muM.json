  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good day lighting this day is so bright as the first time always tonight with family around a nice meal we're making the one i feel how nice it is to be so neat to those i love and welcome to this new episode of virtues of fasting we're still studying the book of bulu al-maram and to be specific the chapter that deals with fasting hadith number seven in this chapter and it is narrated by the mother of the believers hafsah may allah be pleased with her she says that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said whoever does not form his intention to fast to fajr his fasting will not be accepted and in another narration also reported by darul kotni the prophet said no fasting is accepted for one who does not form the intention to fast the night before the following hadith i think it is best that we also read it hadith number eight so that we could have an idea when we talk and explain the issues related to this may allah be pleased with her said one day the messenger of allah entered my house and said is there anything here to eat i said no he said i shall then be fasting today then he came to us another day and we said to him someone has offered us some haste as a gift he then said show it to me i had i had been fasting since this morning and he ate from it as it was a voluntary fast and not during obligatory fasting of ramadan and this was narrated or reported by imam muslim in his sahih so now we have two hadiths and the prophet was highlighting to us in the first hadith of hafsah and we all know that hafsah is the daughter of um may allah be pleased with them both so the prophet is highlighting the issue of intention so he says that whoever does not have the intention to fast before fajr that is during the night time then his fasting would not be accepted and he would not be considered to be fasting and also in the hadith of there is no fasting except for those who obligated from the night time so first of all what is the intention mentioned in the hadith of the prophet in islam intention has two meanings one is to differentiate between forms of worship so a worshiper could be praying two raka's what is his intention he might be praying a voluntary prayer he might be praying fajr prayer he might be praying istihara he might be praying any type of prayer and what differentiates between these different prayers the intention a person praying for raka's what is his intention if he says okay this is valid if it says asar if it's at the time of assad it's valid but if it's time of the hour then it is not valid so to differentiate between forms of worship this is the first usage and the first meaning of intention the second meaning is who are you intending this form of worship for so if i pray the prayer in the in congregation what is my intention one would say my intention is to pray to allah in this case your intention is sincere the other says i don't pray usually but my boss is praying out of the ordinary so i'm showing off so that he may give me a bonus or a raise and then this intention is invalid and he will be punished for that so the prophet has taught to us before by him that all our deeds they are dependent on our intention verily that deeds are held accountable or are dependent on your intention therefore the prophet says in the first hadith of hafsa that he who does not form the intention before fajr while it was it is nighttime then he has no fasting valid for him and this again is falling under the general category that deeds are by their intentions and there's a rule um all things are by their intentions so this falls and fits like a glove however this is only directed at fasting that is obligatory and we know that there are fastings that are obligatory and there are fastings that are not so among the fastings that are obligatory the fasting of ramadan this is a must so if you do not make the intention from night to fast tomorrow the day of ramadan your fasting is invalid making up for ramadan if i missed the day in ramadan and then after a few months i had the chance to make it up but i went to bed without having any intention and woke up in the morning maybe five minutes after the athana fajr and i said oops let me consider this to be part of making up of the day missed in ramadan this is invalid because you had you have to have the intention before the adana fajr one who has an oath or a vow so i say if allah cures my child i'm going to fast a day for his sake so this is mandatory i have to have the intention for that day before the call of fajr one who has expiations for example he said well i will not come to your house tomorrow and i change my mind i have to feed 10 people clothed them or free a slave and if i'm unable to do any of the previous three then i have to fast three days so these three days i must keep the intention at night time now the prophet says whoever does not form the intention before fajr that is at night time and we know that we have two types of fajr one is known as the false fajr and the other one is known as the true fajr the false fajr usually comes before the true an actual break of dawn by 40 minutes maybe to an hour depending on the region and the seasons and it comes like a vertical light that disappears after a while and the total darkness follows and then about 40 minutes later you get the true dawn you get the actual break of dawn which is horizontal so you see it all over the horizon unlike that one we where you only detect it in one place and it is vertical so the prophet is referring allah to the true dawn and this true dawn is the one once it breaks you have to stop and refrain from eating and drinking if you're fasting it initiates that you can pray fajr prayer now this is the time for praying fajr before it you could not pray it etc so the prophet is telling us allah who does not form the intention before fajr then there is no fasting for him is an article of negation no so when i say i have no money i have no interest this is i'm negating it i'm saying that this does not exist or i don't have it etc and in arabic when you look at the verses of the quran if you look at the hadiths of the prophet salallahu salaam you see that this this negation article is used in a number of different ways and if you don't have knowledge you get things mixed up you mix apples with oranges and then you don't know what to do there is a negation for existence so when i say that there are no two gods i'm negating it they do not exist when i say la ilaha there is no god illallah worthy of being worshipped except allah so when i say la this means that there is no existence the second type of negation would be for the validity so when the prophet says there is no prayer valid to a person who has no wudu no abolution this la here doesn't mean it doesn't exist it exists because he's praying i can see he's praying it means that it is not valid so though it exists but it is not valid meaning that it does not exist islamically and the third type of negation is for perfection and this is similar to when the prophet says there is no belief to someone who is not trustworthy he does not become a believer whose neighbor is not in safety from his harm so when the prophet says that he is not a believer does he mean that he's a kafir the answer is no definitely because he is a muslim but it means that he is not a perfect muslim because we know that there are 60 plus in another narration 70 plus of branches of iman the highest is the lowest is removing harmful things from people's way and bashfulness is a branch of amen so we know that he is a true he's a believer but he's not a perfect and complete believer he has lots of things missing so when the prophet says that whoever does not form the intention before fajr then he has no fasting does it mean existence no because he refrained from food and drink until sunset does it mean perfection the answer is no because it is not valid to begin with so it definitely means the validity and the hadith straightforward tells us that the fasting of this obligatory day is not valid if you do not form the intention before fajr time now is there anything else that falls under the same category alongside with obligatory uh fasting the answer is yes scholars say that limited or restricted voluntary fasts must take the same ruling can you give an example i will six days of shawwal these are specific the prophet said allah whoever fasts ramadan the whole of it 29 or 30 days complete and follows this with six days of shawwal he fasts six days of the following month then allah azzawajal would grant him the reward as if he fasted the whole year if someone woke up on the second day of shawwal after eight and ten minutes after adana fajr he did not have a prior intention to fast and then he woke up and said listen i will consider this to be one of the days of shawwal what do we say to him we say to him that your fasting is valid but it doesn't count from the days of shawwal why because the prophet allah indicated that you have to fast the whole day and your intention came 10 minutes late likewise with the day of with the day of ashura if you do not intend it before fajr then your fasting is would not be considered to be part of arafah or of as if it were an obligatory fasting now having said that how would we know the intention some people make the mistake of saying i intend to fast tomorrow as the first day of ramadan we hear this in masjid people after the imam starts his prayer they say they do this and say i intend to pray allah prayer for raqqa on time not qatar and the imam's name is so-and-so time is 13 so and so date is today's tuesday or wednesday or whatever what are you doing this is a manifest you're not boarding a plane and you have to check the passengers names what are you doing said no this is intention and this is wrong totally wrong intention is something that is in the heart so someone puts a plate of fruit in front of me and i see some nice beautiful fresh strawberries and i reach out to take them what am i doing i'm going to eat strawberries did you intend it yes what did you say nothing i simply ate it this is my intention when i want to go to the toilet to make a one or one or one or two whatever and do i before going to the toilet say i intend to go to the toilet and do this or that definitely not likewise when you intend to pray the hurt and you say i intend to pray who are you talking to he says i'm informing allah for allah allah knows everything why do you inform him he says hmm i didn't think of that oh okay i'm informing myself are you crazy you need to talk to yourself to know what you're doing you simply intend and do it so the intention for fasting is unlike what people think today is wednesday tomorrow is thursday i intend to fast tomorrow this is wrong you simply have your pre-dawn meal your sahur is sufficient and after aisha you know that tomorrow is the fifth of ramadan and you know that you're fasting so you do not need to make an intention for that now this brings us to another issue and that is do we need an intention as the hadith of states for every day of ramadan because every single day of ramadan is mandatory to us to fast it so do we have to renew the intention it's an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that you only need the intention for the first day and afterwards as long as your fasting is continued then you do not need an intention for every single day so from the very beginning the first night of shaban which is the first night of that is ramadan before the first day i make the intention after sighting the moon i'm gonna fast the whole month and that is it so even if i fast the first day and then after maghrib i fall asleep and wake up only after fajr because i was tired now no one says ah because you woke up after fajr this day doesn't count you should have had the intention last night no the whole month is connected but only if you separate it and you break the fast of one day or more in this case you have to renew your intention example first seven days i fasted intention was on the first day of ramadan the eighth day i got a flight and i had to travel so i broke my fast and i came the following day and i went to bed now i did not intend to fast tomorrow i did not have the intention because i was breaking my fast for a day or two or etcetera this day that the following day doesn't count because the intention was not there but if i intended it before going to bed or before the adana fajr to continue my fasting then this is valid insha allah now the hadith of isha is a beautiful hadith and i hope we have time to go through some of the benefits in it says that the prophet and this was his routine he goes out to the masjid and he comes back and he asks is there any food do you have anything to eat and this shows you how diplomatic and polite our prophet is he does not say to his wife bring me food why not because he doesn't want to embarrass his wife maybe the food is not ready maybe they don't have any food so when he demands food this will break her heart when she says we don't have anything oh prophet of allah or i didn't prefer anything oh prophet of allah so the prophet islam first asks do you have any food if she said yes then he would continue to demand or ask but because she said no in this case the prophet salaam takes another decision so as in the hadith it states that the prophet asks salisa do you have any food and she says no so the prophet says in this case i'm fasting today now is this an obligatory fast answer it's definitely not this is not an obligatory fast this is a voluntary fast and is there any specific time for me to begin a voluntary fast the answer is no no time at all no time so if someone goes to bed before fajr and he was totally beaten and he sleeps until 10 minutes before maghrib time and he wakes up and he says wow 10 minutes to maghrib i didn't have any breakfast i didn't drink anything tell you what i'll consider this to be a day of fasting and he fast these 10 minutes is it valid the answer is yes it's valid however 10 minutes are valid for his fasting because he cannot be in the same boat with someone who intended to fast from the early hours of the morning so the reward is in accordance to the suffering and the person who fasts and days did not suffer at all so this is valid and this is permissible in another incident the prophet came ali salatusam and said do you have any food well actually he didn't ask mother isha gave him the glad tiding the minute he came in and she said that we had been given a gift that is heists and heist is made of ghee of a flower and of dates and it's very nutritious very nice to eat and it gives you lots and lots of energy when it's winter time so the prophet said al-islam show it to me bring it over and when the prophet saw it ali saw he ate from it and said to her that i was fasting but now i had broken my fast and ate and again this fasting definitely was voluntary fasting so from this hadith we learned a number of issues one of them the simplicity of the prophet sallallahu salaam the prophet doesn't know what's in his house so he's very simple he talks to his wife in a very simple manner he's not demanding do you have anything to eat if they said yes alhamdulillah he eats if they said no alhamdulillah he fasts some of us are so nagging and demanding why is the food not salty enough or why is there a lot of salt it's not well cooked it's this it's that why the house is not clean why the the kids are not well dressed this is not the behavior and etiquette of our prophet salsa with his family also the prophet haslam does not know the unseen as so many ignorant deviant sects belief the prophet doesn't know the unseen otherwise he would not ask do you have anything to eat and compare this to those who say that the prophet is nazer meaning that he is a traveler around the globe and he sees everything and he hears everything and he is present whenever he is what did they leave to allah may allah be exalted they are definitely insulting our prophet hassam when they compare him to allah and give him something that allah did not give him also the prophet accepts gifts and this is the characteristic of a muslim someone gives you a gift not a bribe a gift you take it accept it no matter what it is if someone gives you a pen and say why this is not mom man i'm not going to take it this is one real two reals no accept any gift that comes to you because this shows good character as the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam used to do and also it tells us and shows us that the prophet utilizes the circumstances if there's no food to eat what is the best thing to do well consider this to be a fasting day so if you're not going to eat both ways might as well make it for the sake of allah azza and hit two birds with one stone and we know that the prophet saw had he wanted to be among the richest richest people on earth he would have he could have but he didn't and his family and his wives mother aisha says that we used to have like two months without lighting fire in the house of the prophet to cook on and the majority of our food was water and dates and that is it compare this to our lunch and brunch and dinner and supper and and and what comes fillers in between so the prophet assam's life was simple had he wanted to be the richest person on earth he could have but he did not and finally it is okay it is permissible for you to as it is to initiate a voluntary day of fasting providing that you did not have anything after the adana fajr that nullifies fasting you can also void your fasting if it's voluntary so if i fast five six hours it's midday and then someone serves me something and gives me food wow this is good i'm gonna eat but you're fasting yeah this is voluntary fast i can i have i'm the the prince i'm the ruler of my own so i can void and cut and break my fasting voluntary fasting whenever i want and this goes with most if not all voluntary deeds and acts this is the end of the first segment of today's program stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back to take your calls assalamualaikum and welcome back juji has a question he or she says can we rebel against democratic system and democratic politicians now the issue of uh rebellions and uh things that are taking place nowadays need an extended uh talk and elaboration but uh we have uh idris from nigeria and we'll get to juji's question insha'allah it is it is from nigeria yes number one question is um you said it is not necessary to say you're near you want to make any prayer because it's in your heart for most people we normally say we normally do here before they meet alive so we might read all different daily prayers then my number two question is we have problem in nigeria with which i'm very sure you are aware of the boko haram please can you tell us what is the consequences of anyone who kills a failure of human being without any vision thank you you're welcome we okay first one is on the behalf of my parents if a person did not wear is out of ignorance then what is the ruling on it second one how to do that third one woman should uh should women wear hijab and a while doing sajdah shukran okay thank you you're welcome okay so should we begin with juji or we'll be again with idris well let me begin with juji and please hold the lines for uh two to three to four to five minutes who cares first of all the issue of rebelling against the government now is this part of islam what we see people are dying just to form what is known as khilafah even if it was made of legos they just want khilafah is this part of islam now we've heard this new islamic state and calling people to come and give baya any tom dick or harry could come and say listen tomorrow i just declare it and say i'm the new khalifa and i ask people to come to give the pledge of allegiance to me people in the uk people in the u.s people in somalia maybe the shabbat would have formed maybe boko haram would call khilafah is this part of islam or islam is part of implementing the quran sunnah some people neglect the prayer the fasting implementing of shariah they neglect the ethics the moral conduct they neglect their relationship between them and allah azza only focus on how to dominate how to rule how to kill how to blow up things etc so is this part of islam is this part of our religion the answer is definitely not this is not part of islam and rebelling was not something that the prophet told us allah to do on the contrary he says in regards to a person who's a muslim you have to obey and listen even if an abyssinian slave his head is like a raisin rules on you you should obey him he did not say assam from the quraish as now they are doing a lot of noise about oh he's a quraysh he's a quraish he's a khalifa we have like a hundred thousand of them so someone from uh persia comes and says that he's a mullah or something and he wants to become khalid because he's a qurashi that's it no this is not the thing this is out of context islam is not a rebellious religion that teaches people to rebel and to make conflicts and chaos and kill people no islam is a deen is a religion of peace of dawa of tranquility when jihad is needed it is there but it comes not as a ba a product by itself it's a byproduct of calling people to islam and giving the wa by following the quran under the flag of a muslim leader but to come and form what is known as a islamic state giving takfer to all muslim rulers everybody is a kafir and not that only the governments are kafir as well their cabinets are kafir the members of parliament are kafir without any discrimination and giving takriv to the army forces to the police forces and then you say that they're not hawari come on give me a break anyhow we had someone from somalia but i do apologize because i have to make this in points rather than segregate the answer every now and and then brother idris he's saying that people here we have um okay we have muhammad salam i had a question as if uh imam says i can get up and grade two and after that i can complete the remaining uh and make my 20 record now the question is that in my masjid here my mom prays uh dual clue in every vital praise and uh as he's playing with her i'm also like you know saying i mean along with him and after that with her if i get up so will it be considered as my wither or would it be considered as a uh show my next question is should i complete the remaining part of my 20th car after the message or can i come back home and complete it and when i pray my wither can i pray or do i collude again or should i not uh what is it okay you're welcome so idris says that the people usually um say the niyah for maghrib for isha where he comes from probably they are following the shafi madhab and this goes against the majority of scholars of schools of thought and the easiest thing to counter answer this is that the prophet ali saw some never done such a thing not his companions none of them ever uttered or said the nia or even told us that he said it in his heart so you may not move your lips but you can still repeat the knee in your heart by saying oh you're in trying to pray more prayer but you don't move your lips again this is wrong the prophet never done this had done this as some nor his companions so you should not do it uh either uh shams from saudi i have a question actually two questions the other day i heard you were talking about drew's i live in saudia city and my neighbor is a druze would it be impolite to not answer his salam okay and me just turning over would i be a bad neighbor or something like that and my second question is also related to one of your questions yesterday like my daughter is of age and she is living in canada and as a parent i think it's my responsibility to ensure that she settles down but most of the suitors are um like they smoke or drink and we have to keep saying no to that and i do get frustrated sometimes but she tells me to trust in allah and inshallah mom when the time comes so should i just let it go and just you know okay yeah i will answer inshallah very much you are welcome uh om iman from saudi arabia uh yes my question is about making up for the past of ramadan but as soon as ramadan is over and we have the shawal and what if we intend to pass for the six days of shawwal first and then we make up for the missing or the mandatory facts of ramadan and the following like ashura or yom larafan so like that so are we supposed to make a make up for the mandatory fact first or we can pass the voluntary ones first and what about the intention of uh for the white days and the mondays or thursdays if we have to pass on mondays or thursdays then are we like if we wake up after fajr can we just uh make the near that we have to pass for that day or not okay and second question is about uh uh like if if a child is seven years or eight years then is it okay for the parents to teach them salah and just tell them to uh offer the first uh first and then uh make them habitual of uh offering the sunnah okay all right thank you very much you're welcome uh say it from saudi arabia to you as well i want to ask two questions the first one is the about the sunnah prayers what we are discussing two days back about 12 records prayer before zohar we have to pray for rakat sunnah that is four of us together our two records and my second question is okay uh five years back my mother died she was admitted during the ramadan in the hospital for six months almost she cannot be able to recover from the illness so she couldn't be able to make up the fast so i have to pay any physia for that one or anything like that okay i will answer the question thank you you're welcome thank you you're welcome uh sophia from the uh the emirates i would like to ask one question yes if a woman has missed her uh first pass from the previous ramadan and have not made up for them before the following ramadan then what is the islamic ruling on it okay and uh how can she make up for the miss pass is she liable to pay for kaffara or can she so fast and make up for the past okay i will answer this question you're welcome okay i think we will take a short break from uh picking up calls so bear with me inshallah in four minutes time i'll try to answer your questions idris asking about boko haram what's the ruling on boko haram boko haram as we hear from the news is a terrorist organization no matter what they claim what they say let us analyze okay i might be a terrorist it is a possibility analyze what i say you can quote me on that but when you look at what's happening the kidnapping of 200 schoolgirls the blowing up of churches the killing of uh innocent people suicide bombings cars etc atrocities this is not part of islam whether you call it boko haram you call it boko halal you call it uh islamic state you close you call it is ia isis they call it now isis like iphone or whatever this is not part of islam you hate mujahideen on the contrary we are full fledged supporting the mujahideen who follow the quran sunnah who do not do things that tarnish our reputation as muslims so you defend yourself to defend the vulnerable and uh the poor people yes this is legitimate but to do things like this blowing up churches killing innocent people yeah but they're christians even if they're christians even if they're jews innocent people you're not allowed to kill and it is not to any tom dicker harry just to come and pick up arms and kill whoever is not a muslim this is out of the question so this is what i see about them and probably this means that i'm not going to go to nigeria soon tawba from saudi arabia says and she's asking three questions on behalf of her parents what's the penalty for making haram not from the mercad you have to slaughter a sheep in the haram area in the makkah area and distribute it to the poor people there such that the sugar what is the format how to do it and do we need to be in the state of no says the recitation prostration these two prostrations are not prayers and that is why they do not require wudu is required for prayer and they do not require covering your aura so if you are a woman you don't need to wear the hijab to do it and they do not require facing the qibla because facing is for an obligatory prayer therefore it can be done how to do it you just say allahu akbar and you fall and prostrate and that is it when you raise your head you don't say allah but again and you don't offer salam because this is not a prayer muhammad from the uae he's asking question about taraweeh he says that he usually prays 20 raka's for tarawih but the imam next to his house prays 11 raka's that is eight plus three witter so what should he do if you pray with the imam 11 rakhas allah would reward you as if you prayed the whole night so this is sufficient for you you don't have to need you don't need to add anything to it but if you do if you want there's no problem and you have two choices either to offer winter with the imam and alpha salaam and leave to your home and then pray two raka's two raka's two raka's until you finish the 23 raka's already you've prayed 11 so you have um 12 missing so you're gonna pray uh six uh prayers of two units each and do not repeat the withdrawal because the prophet said allah there are no two witters in a night only one the second option is that when the imam offers salam from the witter you stand up and you pray another rakah which makes his winter two for you and then you can pray with her home saying ameen behind the imam in kunut does not mean that you cannot make another knot in your home this has nothing to do with that in sha allah okay shams from saudi arabia she has a neighbor who is a jersey and she says wouldn't that be inappropriate not to return the salam on the contrary this is an islamic thing if a christian or a jew comes and says i would say if i come to the office or i meet a christian i say what's happening how are you hi good evening good morning but i would never say assalamu alaikum because this is prohibited for me to begin a non-muslim with that and the best thing instead of being so careful not to offend your neighbor is to give him that or to give her dawah so you call her to islam tell her you're a muslim she says yes okay do you believe in the quran she says yes then show her the verses that deals with praying why don't you pray why don't you fast why don't you give zakat this is the sunnah where allah tells us to follow the prophet isam why aren't you doing this after that if she uh alhamdulillah accepts and and embraces what you say you have gained a lot of reward with the grace of allah azza but if you don't if she doesn't then you don't have anything to do with her she says shems that a lot of suitors come to her daughter and some of them smoke some of them listen to music and watch movies some of them are not practicing or don't pray on time so what should she do well you have all the right either to throw your daughter to hell or to keep her until a good shooter comes to her how would you give your daughter to someone who was a playboy or is still probably having relationship with girls or who smokes and he doesn't care about his health or the health of his family or he doesn't pray on time what kind of a muslim is he so you're willing to give your daughter just so that the people who say ah you got your daughter married and you throw her to such trash no this is not permissible for you as a mother we have uh sarhat from saudi arabia hello yes yes yes i wanted to ask what is the age for the children to be made compulsory to pass and for salah is it seven or okay what is about time okay i think we've lost mahmoud um iman says that the question that comes every single year uh lots and lots of time and she says that women break their fast during the month of ramadan due to their monthly cycle so after ramadan is over they would like to begin with fasting six days of shawwal and then make up for the missed days is this possible before we get the answer mahmoud from somalia mahmoud from somalia well i don't hear anything and i don't think he's on the line anymore so what is the ruling on that no this is not permissible it's an issue of dispute among scholars some scholars say that it is okay to fast the days midst of ramadan after you do the six days of shawwal but the most authentic opinion that this is not permissible because the reward which is fasting the whole year the prophet made a condition that you fast ramadan and then you follow that with six days of shawwal so if someone fasted 27 days of ramadan and has three days to make up and started fasting six days of shawwal he does not fall under this category and hence we cannot uh say that this is valid is it okay to make up the missed ramadans on ashura day or on uh the answer is yes you get both rewards for that insha allah what about the intention of the white days mondays and thursdays the same thing if you intend for the white days before fajr it's valid if not then it is not a credited to you except part of that day and it doesn't give you the same reward mondays and thursdays is a little bit maybe lesser in degree a seven-year-old child we teach him to pray fart and soon or only the father will depends on the child if he is enthusiastic for prayer and he wants to cooperate then yes give him the father and the sunnah so that it comes becomes in his system but if not then don't burden the child let him learn first how to pray when he's 10 years old maybe then you can introduce this to him in sha allah we have a caller and the time is running hussein from iran okay hassan is gone from saudi arabia says that the four raqqa before should they be with one salam or should i separate them with two raqqa salaam turakasalam hanafi's school of thought say that there are four raka's in a row with one salam and sheikh al-bani authenticates a hadith saying that this is a applicable to be safe when this is the majority's view pray to offer salam pray to offer salam and no one would say that you had done something wrong is the tahitu masjid part of the twelve raka's dancers no the twelve raka's are specific and they are related to the daily prayers while the message can be done anytime and his mother died may allah have mercy on her soul and and on all the souls of our loved ones and the the muslim deceased and he and she could not make up for the missed days due to her illness and she was bed ridden so should he pay kaffar should he fast on her behalf the answer is no you should do neither because she did not have the chance to make up and this means that allah would not hold her accountable if she had the chance for a month or two and she out of laziness did not do it in this case it would have been a different story safiya from the emirates says that those who delay and postpone making up of missed days of ramadan for no apparent reason and then ramadan the following ramadan is due and they could not fast or make up for the missed days what is their punishment they're sinful because they don't have a legitimate reason but they're only ordered to make up for the missed days without any expiation so a day for a day whether you do it before ramadan on time without any sin or you are sinful and postponing it after the following ramadan you just make up for that day sarhan i think from saudi arabia she says what is the age the appropriate age for uh instructing our children to fast and pray the as for prayer the prophet indicated that instruct your children to pray when they're seven spank them when they're ten so the three years from seven to ten you do not force the child in the sense that you do not spank the child you do not reprimand the child you just simply instruct come and pray let's go and pray wake up for prayer and for three years this is like conditioning the child to prayer now fasting we don't have a designated date or age however the companions used to say that we used to order our children to fast and whenever they are hungry and and thirsty we give them toys made of wool but yani they don't complete the full day so most of us begin teaching their children how to fast when they're six or seven or eight years of age and we are a little bit lenient in the sense that we do not um force them to fast because it's not mandatory but we try them train them as much as possible hansa says that she's not good in reading the quran hence she takes a lot of time to read it and in ramadan she doesn't know what is to look for best is it quality or quantity so should she read arabic quran that would take a lot of time and consume a lot of effort without pondering upon the verses because she doesn't know arabic or should she read it from the translation which is not a quran it's a translation of the meaning of the quran but gives her an insight of what is meant and what she's ordered to do the quran was revealed to be pondered upon however the reward of reciting it is on the arabic text so if you can balance and combine both you've got a win-win situation so recite as much as possible from the arabic quran and try to ponder on the translation of the english or whatever language you're reading it from uh for like half an hour to an hour a day and with this you would gain uh the best reward in sha allah hashim has questioned that he is will be traveling to pakistan by the end of ramadan and he asks about the difference of days of fasting so we started to fast here on sunday in saudi arabia in pakistan probably they started on monday so they are a day late what happens if he started here in saudi and by the time he went to pakistan and stayed there for a week or two they celebrated the aid after saudi by a day or two well in a nutshell if you as an individual began in one country and went to the other country you should celebrate read with the second country you're in and you should calculate the days that you've fasted if it is 29 or more then your month is complete if it is less than 29 then you have to make up for the missed days if it's 30 31 you have no days to make up and allah azza knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time while watching the new moon it felt like a good enlightening this day is so bright as the first time always tonight with family around the nice meal we're how nice it is to be so neat to those i love whenever we think of ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
