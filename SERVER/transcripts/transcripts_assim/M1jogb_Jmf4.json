  "transcript": "Judea from Uzbekistan my question is that since last months were working in in our home I had to cover myself every day while passing by them and it was hot summer day as you know it's somehow difficult to cover oneself in hot weather once while talking to my husband on the phone I said I am fed up with covering myself in hot weather after some time I pondered over its meaning and I was so scared did I become happier for for saying those words did I go against Allah immediately repented I repented and said my shahada I don't know what to do after that I have started questioning and the validity of my marriage as well is it still valid okay should I first of all uh are you a Muslim shudea okay she's gone what her question was about is a typical scenario of an OCD session that I usually give people come to me with the same problem I did something I said something now I'm doubtful with her I left the fold of Islam so I took my also said my shahada repented but then it's escalating is my marriage valid or not are my children born out of wedlock or not do I inherit my father who died couple of years ago when I took his money because I was a cafe and it's like the house of cards that falls down it's a domini domino effect and all of this is nonsense but these people need counseling they need someone to open their eyes first of all are you a Muslim or not she said yes I'm Muslim I was born Muslim my father and mother are Muslims I said okay keep this aside your Islam is certain or doubtful she said no I'm certain I pray five times I love Allah I read the Quran this certainty cannot be affected by doubts so have you exited the fold of Islam certainly and for sure or you're doubtful she said no I'm doubtful but Sheikh said don't butt me as Queen Elizabeth said but me no but or Queen Victoria who I don't know no this is not what to say answer in full stop but don't go on with the procedure of shaytan stop your Islam is certain doubting whether you exited the fold of Islam or not is doubtful the rule of thumb certainty is not affected by doubt and hence you're still a Muslim until proven otherwise give me a proof yeah but I said I'm fed up with covering up are you fed up with the ruling of Allah no no no no no I believe in hijab I love it I wear it all the time are you fed up with the heat and being compelled to wear the hijab due to the circumstances of Nan maharam laborers working near a home yes Sheikh so where is the kufur come on and if you even let's hypothetically say committed and you repented and sought forgiveness from Allah who said that your marriage is affected and that you have to make a new contract all of this is from shaytan messing up with your head so don't worry"
