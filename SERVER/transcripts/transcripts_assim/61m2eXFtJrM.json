  "title": "Can I buy a house through Islamic Finance that takes 50% late payment fee? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the U.S and my question is um it's Halal to buy a house through the Islamic Finance through here in the United States and is approved through the independent Sharia the board they approve it my question is um they take in late fee fifty dollars and this fifty dollars will go through let's say to the zakah um now my question is my situation is I have four kids before and I live in apartments now I have six kids and they're trying to uh take me out because they we're not allowed to live six kids in the apartment and I have another situation my daughter she's autistic she's autism and now she's getting worse and she's scream and yell and they call the cops and uh they keep sending me baber's warning and they want me to leave and I try everywhere to rent nobody camp with me with six kids and me and my wife that's eight people and I try so hard the only solution I have is to buy a house through the Islamic Finance here in United and United States for I can't live me and my family and my autistic kids and peace if you can tell me if this is halal or Haram because we're trying so hard and we knock everybody door and we ask everybody to help us no one help us except we found a way of the finance Islamic Finance they can help us I sympathize with your situation nevertheless you know that when a person gives an Islamic verdict he tries his level best not to make himself a bridge over Hellfire where people would cross over to safety while he himself Burns in hell that wouldn't be logical so I wouldn't try my best to make things easy and soft for you just because I sympathize with you it's a very long topic that needs thorough discussion but we don't have the time to do that on a live program so I'll give you hints not every Islamic institution whether in Saudi Arabia or in Kuwait or in America or Europe are Islamic and not every Sharia I bought is to be trusted we have to look into their details and policies and procedures in order to know whether this is in accordance to Islam or not the issue of late payment fee the most authentic opinion is that this is riba whether they give it to the cat sources or give it to the poor or give it to a third party still it is a prophet occurring on a loan having said that in your case if you as you claim are always threatened to be vacated from your apartment and you won't find any other place to take you in with your six kids which is highly doubtful to my own understanding but let's presume you're telling the truth this is something between you and Allah if this is the case and you are stuck between a rock and a hard place and there's no other alternative except to go to these so-called Islamic financing companies and they have approved fatwas on their transactions from a trusted Sharia board that is independent that is not taking yearly bonuses and it's not on their payroll and they're known for their knowledge and for their uh piety and that they fear Allah azzawajal if this is all correct and valid and the only exception is the late payment fee do your level best not to be late and always pay on time so that you can avoid this and inshallah you can go ahead for with it and Allah Knows Best"
