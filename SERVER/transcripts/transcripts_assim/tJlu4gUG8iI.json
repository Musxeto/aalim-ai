  "title": "Can we Seek assistance from Non-Muslims? (Borrow money or consultation) | Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "cave from india he says can we seek the assistance of non-muslims in terms of consultation in terms of borrowing money whatever is halal there's no problem in seeking their help we know that the prophet al-assam hired a kafir to guide him and abu bakr from mecca to medina while migrating so hiring such a kafir was permissible if you want to borrow from a kafir this is also permissible it is well established in the authentic sunnah that the prophet is salam pond his shield with a jew in exchange of a sar of barley so he borrowed this barley and he pawned his shield with this jew and the prophet died with the shield being with the jew so the prophet borrowed from a jew ali so this is permissible what is not permissible is to consult them or to take them as confidence in religion in things that may impact the muslims and islam so a ruler of a muslim country is totally prohibited from seeking the consultation of a non-muslim or appointing a non-muslim to rule muslims or to manage muslims or to be appointed upon them because this is a breach of our allegiance should be only to the muslims yes if you ask a non-muslim in something that he's specialized in and no muslims possess this okay but all muslims with the grace of allah are knowledgeable if not superior to these non-muslims that we bring them and make them in control over our lives and pay them astronomical salaries so taking them as confidence it's consulting them about other muslims and what to do this is not permissible but if he's he's a shrink he's a doctor he's a physician he's an engineer and i need him in that specific world the issue there is no problem in that insha allah you"
