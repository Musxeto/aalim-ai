  "title": "Importance of contemplating The Quran in the renaissance of the Ummah - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "other awesome brother all right without further delay delaying i would like to invite you to enlighten us from [Music] of islam is undergoing a period of weakness and humility that was unprecedented though as a nation we have all what is needed to be superior yet we are unfortunately at the end of the list nobody cares about us nobody pays us any attention instead of being leaders the muslims today are followers and this is fulfilling the prophecy which the prophet had said allah in the authentic hadith all the nations are about to collaborate upon you like when a beast when an animal when a pet is going to eat from a plate it has everybody's collaborating upon you there will come a time so one of the companions may have agrees with them ask oh prophet of allah are we few in number the prophet said no you're so many yet you are a quantity not quality you're like the foam that rises on top of flood water and you have no value and allah will extract the fear of you from your enemy's chest and allah will throw in your hearts which is the love of this dunya and the hate of dying this hadith fits us as a glove and scholars tried to analyze the reasons behind our um coming at the end the deterioration of things why is this happening and some of them attributed it to economical reasons so they pointed out that if the economy were to rise and to become better that should solve all our problems so we found that people started adopting capitalism socialism trying different economical regimes so that they could solve this problem others said that no no no it is illiteracy that is causing this problem it is ignorance so we have to focus on technology we have to focus on science and others thought that the reason behind all of this is political reasons once we manage to fix politics and the leadership everything would be fine so they focused on democracy parties trying to acquire and get hold of authority in different countries all of these were focusing on the symptoms of an illness but not the illness itself and this is a very common mistake someone comes to you complains of a severe headache and pain in his stomach you give him a panadol or tylenol or aspirin pain relievers the pain goes he feels better two hours later he comes back and the pain is back you keep on giving him pain killers would this ever solve his problem never he probably has cancer he probably has something that is chronic you are only curing the symptoms but not the real illness so what is the real illness the real illness is that people have gone away from the only source of guidance and this is not my word and this is not my opinion this is the religion of allah azzawajal the people has gone astray and the consequences will appear as we see them today even worse allah says the almighty whoever follows my guidance will neither go astray in the world nor suffer in the hereafter and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed that is difficult life and we will gather that is raise him on the day of resurrection blind a depressed and difficult life for all those who turn away from allah's remembrance from allah's religion but if you follow his guidance you'll never go astray nor suffer in the hereafter this is allah's promise so the honor the dignity and the pride of this ummah relies on how close this is to the quran not only by reciting it and memorizing it because this hundreds of thousands if not millions of muslims are doing they we have competitions of the quran we have recitals from world wide places we have reciters from indonesia we have reciters from malaysia from america from morocco all over the world and they're competing in mashallah they perfectly recite the quran but this is not what the quran was revealed for it was revealed to be contemplated upon to have what is known as and al-imam said he says it was revealed to look into the meanings and work your mind in how it started the consequences of the quran and what entails all of that and part of what entails all of that is implementing it in your life al-hasan al-basri may allah have mercy on his soul says this is a blessed book which we have revealed to you o muhammad that they might reflect upon its verses so al-hasan al-basri says reflecting upon its verses is nothing but following it and by allah he who does not implement it yet perfectly recites it so that he would at the end of the day say i have recited the whole quran not missing one single letter of it al-hasan says by allah he has lost the whole quran he doesn't see the quran to be a moral conduct or a way of life something that is to be applied and implemented this is how the self view reflecting upon the quran at the double and when we look at the title of the lecture to reflect upon the quran quran and the impact of that upon the renaissance of the ummah we have to understand what is the meaning because sometimes the words can be misguiding so when we say that the renaissance this was a movement in the middle ages so to them the christians in europe it is related to the rebellion against the church and renaissance is to go out of the norm and to separate science from church we don't have this in islam islam embraces science islam goes side by side with science so sometimes a person may fear that such association between the word renaissance and islam can be misleading and to some they would understand that in order to do this we have to separate science from islam when this is not true then what is tadabur what is to reflect upon the quran some people think that this is related to tafsir and this is not true tafsir is very important and it's the first level of tidabur you cannot reach the dabur without tafsir which leads us to something that a lot of the muslims fall into as a big mistake and that is to think that they can reach the level of tidabur on their own so you get someone who doesn't know arabic who had never gone through a book of tafsir and he sits on his couch and he says i was pondering upon this verse and i came up with this idea imagine that allah means so and so and so by this verse did you get this from said i contemplated upon it alhamdulillah allah guided me to find this meaning this is inapplicable this is not permissible because you're not qualified my friend to do this to give to see on your own like this this is a great mistake that you are committing so we have to understand that pondering as the way the word means or the word is stemmed from it's stemmed from the word and means the end of things so essentially means what the ayah would eventually lead to so i understand the meaning of the word i understand the meaning of the verse but what is meant by it and what it should lead us to that is to implement it to understand what it entails is what is included in tadabur and this is a very high level of understanding the quran because quran is a book that creates souls that it creates nations it builds civilizations this is the ability of the quran this is the capacity of the quran unfortunately if you lit a torch and then you don't see the light there's nothing wrong with the torch if your eyes are closed it's your vision that is impaired the torch is fine the light is shining but it is your vision that is impaired we have the book we have the torch there is nothing more worthy of being pondered upon than the quran there is nothing to reflect upon that is better than the quran where you should focus to understand and what about repeating the quran repeating the verses this is one way of pondering upon the quran by the way this is one wave to the book in certain hadith of the prophet allah there are sometimes we repeat them three times stop for allah stop for allah stop for allah sometimes we repeat them seven times some ten some of that card we repeat 33 some of that we repeat 100 every day and the more you repeat it the more you are rewarded then what about the quran isn't it worthy of being repeated over and over take as an example we part of pondering and reflecting upon the verses are ordered to recite it minimum minimum number of times 17 every day 17 every fart or the five farts let alone etc this type of repetition is part of pondering upon the quran we always say guide us to the straight path the path of those upon whom you have bestowed favor not of those who have earned your anger or of those who are astray this shows you that the muslims at the moment are not fully synchronized with the straight path otherwise they were would have been guided they would have been blessed and bestowed the favors of allah azzawajal if people were to take other than the straight path destruction would fall upon them and they would be angered upon or they will go astray prosperity all that is good lies only in abiding by the way of the prophetic and you cannot attain the hope for renaissance in any system other than the way of the prophet says we have not sent down to you the quran that you be distressed the quran is not means of being distressed it is means of guidance and this is why revealed it how did the companions deal with it the companions dealt with the quran unlike what how we deal with it and they had the best teacher when the prophet salallahu salaam used to pray the whole night repeating one ayah were to torment them they are your servants and he repeated it kept on repeating it pondering upon it reflecting upon it so this is quality and there was quantity as well as in the authentic hadith when the prophet salallahu once offered night prayer with one of his companions in the first rakah he recited surat al-baqarah surat and nisa and surat al-imran in one single not only that every time he passes by an ayah of dua he used to ask allah if he passes upon an ayah of mercy he would seek allah's mercy if he you pass by an ayah where there is mentioning of hellfire he would seek refuge in allah from it and likewise mother aisha she used to recite one ayah we were these are the people of jannah saying that we used to be among our families living in fear of allah's torment and this fear is what led them to safety and jannah this is how they reflected upon the quran and if you compare the difference between them and us it would be like the difference between heavens and earth hundreds of millions of light years between us and why is that because they took the quran as an instruction book not as a means of barakah where are our copy of the quran it's in the glove compartment in the car what is it doing there oh it's to give us safety i have a good belief in the quran that it's like a good omen to have in the car or under the pillow so that nobody would harm us nobody would attack us where did you get this from it's not from islam but this is what people think of the quran means of baraka and if you look at them you see that they have sincere love for the quran but not the right love they kiss it they some of it put it on their forehead like they call it the minor sajdah this is not part of islam or the way of the sunnah this is the best they have some of them even open it and puts it on his eyes to express his great love and devotion but they don't ponder and reflect upon it they don't implement it in their lives it's not their constitution that makes things or breaks them how did the companions behave favoritive may allah be pleased with him was known among the companions as the prophets orator so when people came tribes came and they started to give their speeches as an introduction to the prophet sallam fabit would stand up and reply to them or present to them what the prophet wanted to say ali susan because he was articulate and he was loud in his voice at the time no loud speakers so a narrator has to have a very loud voice when allah revealed this ayah listen to it all you who believe do not raise your voices above the voice of the prophet sallallahu alaihi or be loud to him in speech like the loudness of some of you to others lest your deeds become worthless while you perceive not this is a threat from allah azzawajal not to have your voice higher than the voice of the prophet is yourself when we're talking when we're arguing many times you find that when i'm or when you're speaking i interrupt you while you're speaking i say no no no but the problem is so i raise my voice and i interrupt you so that i would overwhelm whatever thought or idea you have i will win by doing so so allah says to the believers don't raise your voices or be loud when speaking and addressing the prophet because this may render all of your deeds void when this ayah was revealed sat in his home and said i am among the people of hellfire and he would not join the prophet sallallahu salaam in his gatherings in the masjid he would not visit the prophet in his house sallallahu assalam as he used to so one day the prophet alaihissalam said to sadhani to me allah be pleased with him what's wrong with sabbath is he sick meaning i don't see him he doesn't come to us anymore so sad said he's my neighbor and i don't know of any illness to him sad visited travis in his home and he mentioned to him that the prophet is checking upon him so thabit explained himself to the to sad and said i am the loudest in voice when i speak among all of you so i am upon the people of hell fire because of my loud voice my voice is always louder than anyone even in the prophet saw so he thought that the ayah meant that to physically have your voice loud is to render your deeds as void not knowing that the ayah actually has a further meaning which is that your opinions should not be higher or louder than the opinions of sharia which most of us unfortunately may do allah says don't do this the prophet says in his sunnah don't do that and we say no no no no it's okay it's okay this is a hadith where allah says there is a hadith where the prophet saws prohibits you of doing so and so yeah it's okay because the scholars say it's okay to do it i'm telling you a hadith where the prophet prohibits you from doing so and so he said yeah but the scholars say it's okay so now you're making your voice and the voice of the scholars louder than the voice of the prophet and this would render your deeds to be void this is what was meant of the ayah so tabith said i am among the people of hellfire saad went to the prophet isaiah trying to get the clarification he told him about what fabit had said the prophet said he is among the people of jannah it's not like what he had understood he's among the people of jannah look what pondering and contemplating about upon the quran how it reflected on their lives and there are hundreds and thousands of similar examples that we would like to investigate and mention for example alice obramatic says about his stepfather and we know that was anna's stepfather may allah be pleased with them and he was a wealthy man he had a lot of farms palm tree farms and his most favorite was was a farm known as bayou roha and it was close to the masjid of medina the prophet assalam used to always enter it and he used to like drinking from its well because it had sweet water ana says when allah the almighty revealed this ayah never will you attain the good reward until you spend in the way of allah from that which you love when this ayah was revealed went to the prophet recited the ayah and he said to him the most beloved wealth of my is by roha and it is for the sake of allah i'm giving it in charity because i want to attain the good reward that allah has promised so here you are o prophet of allah do with it whatever you wish instant reaction to a verse he heard instant on the spot he gave not a portion of his wealth the most beloved thing to his heart the most favorite thing to his heart wanting and anticipating the reward from allah the prophet allah that's a very good thing you're doing that is a winning wealth a successful wealth and i heard what you said and i recommend that you allocate it among your kinship so the prophet gave it back to him telling him you know who is more needy of your kinship give it to them so did that and distributed it upon his kinship and again this hadith is agreed upon narrated by bukhari and muslim how many of us reflected upon this ayah which we had heard thousands of times who among us was moved by it like was moved and instantly reacted to it how many around us need food clothes charity and how much do we give from our own food clothes and charity to the poor yes we do give but is what we give the best of what we have or it's the worst that we're not using that we don't have any need for and if someone were to give it to us we would not accept it what is this you want me to wear this what kind of shoes they're three years old and you want me to wear it i would not accept such a gift or a charity yet this is the quality of the things that we give all what we see in our ummah today is attributed to our distance from the quran from reflecting upon it and pondering upon it and implementing it in our lives and if we were to come out of this bottleneck if we were to survive the crisis we're going through we have to go back to the quran we have to abide by it we have to hold on to it strongly and make it leading us not following us when the muslims keep the quran in front of them and whatever they are told in it they follow instead of them making decisions and after they make decisions they look in the quran to see what fits it or not so they first choose and then look in the quran to find what supports their choice this is why everybody is stepping on us unless we make the quran our leader there will never be success allah says and we have sent down to you o muhammad the book as clarification for all things and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the muslims who said this allah the almighty this is not a test this is not something to choose to take or to leave this is allah's words and you have to have full conviction in it if you want to be saved if you seek salvation listen again and we have sent down to you the book as a clarification for all things everything is clarified in the quran and as guidance and mercy and good tidings for the muslims if you embrace this you will be among the winners if you neglect it you will have a distressed life and everybody will take you as a doormat as we see the vast majority of muslims unfortunately today i pray to allah azzawajal that he grants us the love to his book to the quran and that he grants us the ability to recite it day and night and to grant us the pondering and understanding of what he wants of us from it and that he grant us the ability to implement it and to act upon it foreign the capabilities of uh contemplating upon the quran is how he as though the displeased with allah i mean in greatness the chances the ability to attain the means which are pleasing to all allah just to recap before we go into the q and a sessions in sha allah a very beautiful point that has mentioned with regards to when he recited and he reached the verse immediately without hesitation he went and acted upon the commandment commands of allah and throughout all the lectures that the lecture that we have listened is how are we dealing with the verses of allah are we just looking at the quran as a means of you know putting it as what she has mentioned true we've put the quran as a on the shelf on the side on our beds in the car hang it somewhere as it is a means of giving barakah to a a place or a car or something but quran is more than that the quran is not a book where you if something happens you show it in shaytan uses the cross but the quran is a way of life a guidance for a muslim to act upon his life and the double without tafsir as sheikh has mentioned will not reach the double so one will not reach the double if there's no taxi so one must accompany the the path of reaching the dabur with tafsir right and we also and sheikh also mentioned that means from the word at the end so it should be the fruit of reading understanding and contemplating and means the action and uh moreover quran builds human builds nation builds a country as we see today the quran has been neglected that's why we don't see real men we don't see real humans we don't see a real nation may allah grant us the ability to revive the quran the living of towards the quran is [Music] of a way of life not just a means of reading it and finishing every month or within a week that they used to read the quran with understanding is how the companions used to take the week 10 lines and once they finish after understanding and implementing then they move to the next with this shift we would like to move in to the q a session uh are you okay with this yes yes go ahead please right we have here questions number one right brother abdullah uh my question is um do we muslims believe in cavemen well depends what do you mean by believing in cavemen if you believe it is part of the theory of evolution and what darwin came up with saying that men evolved from monkeys and the likes of course not we believe that humanity began with adam and hawa peace be upon them adam and eve this is how humanity began allah created them not out of monkeys or chimpanzees evolving to them they were created so this is how humanity started whether they lived in cave caves or under a tree or in mansions this is beside the point so people usually mention cavemen where they refer to a man grabbing a woman by the hair and pulling her behind him being an animal like being a guerrilla-like no we don't believe in such things but did humanity at some stage of time managed to live in caves because they did not have tents or houses this is probable but not as they are portrayed to us like in the flintstones for example and the likes and allah knows best right the next question by brother muhammad if i completed reciting the quran from cover to cover then what to do next what should i do next conclusion now pondering upon the quran again it's a way of life it's not just quantity that we're looking for yes quantity is virtuous rewardable we know that reciting one letter allah will grant you a good deed up to 10 deeds up to the fold of 700 and more so the more you read the more reward you get but the quran was revealed to be pondered upon and to be a reminder so just reciting it without pondering and without benefiting is not the ultimate choice so it is highly advisable to have a moment of pondering today so you go about reading your portion of the quran the minimum is one jesus per day which means every lunar month you finish the whole quran and then you start again and again and again every month you finish the quran but this is the minimum a better stage is to recite it twice a month so two jesus a day and some finish it once a week as some of the self used to now if you do this and you manage to recite it a lot without even trying you will be able to ponder upon many verses that come to your mind because it is grown into your heart it is firmly cemented into your heart because of your repetition if you add to that reciting a page or two or maybe more of tafsir so it is important that you know when you go through little eyes like allah what is the meaning of assad i don't know okay if you don't know what are you gonna do i'm gonna stay don't know him no this is wrong go to the tafsir open the book read what the word means hmm this is one of allah's beautiful names it means this and this and this so now when you read it again [Music] ah now i feel differently when you recite for example that allah says lists the names of the prophets a lot of them 15 20 prophets so and so and so and so and so and so and then allah says to his messenger uh those whom allah had guided so through their guidance you should follow so you you ponder what should i do is crystal clear no it's not crystal clear the ayah is so full and rich of meaning that allah is telling you to follow the guidance and not the individuals though they are prophets and messengers why because prophets and messengers are humans and we are supposed to follow the guidance each and every one of us may have shortcomings flaws though we believe that the prophets and messengers are perfect specimens of humanity yet they may have something that we're not supposed to follow the anger and strength of musa peace be upon him we're not allowed to follow this someone speaks to you punch him and kill him even if it was a mistake but no this is something not to be followed so allah is telling us to follow the guidance which means that if i pondered and reflected upon this ayah if i were to see an imam oh shaykh asam he is a good scholar masha'allah he's a reputable person but he is he has arrogance in him he has anger issues these imams are bad they are evil wait wait wait wait what are you doing he claims to follow the quran and ponders upon him and look at his character it's the worst of people follow his guidance follow his knowledge follow his teachings don't follow his character if there were flaws in them this is what you get from this ayah so brother to recap if you reach the level of completing the quran it doesn't stop here you keep on doing it until the day you die you add to it reading the tafseer so that you understand and then third level is to contemplate of what does allah want to you what does the spirit of the ayah show you so that you can manage and follow that all right the next question could you recommend some tafseer books for atlanta in arabic i can in english unfortunately i can't today i think that the most efficient and suitable book of tafsir found out of the classical books is the tafsir of imam assadi and he is the sheikh and the teacher of this book to my knowledge is translated and unfortunately it's not on pdf but it is printed and you can buy it if i were to advise you if you know arabic i would advise you and i would highly recommend that you uh get a copy of a sear by he was for decades one of the teachers in the masjid of medina may allah have mercy on his soul he passed away a couple of years ago or so this book of his in arabic i believe to be the most easy and comprehensive tafsir of our contemporary times very very efficient and dawa center or our corner uh would do a lot of good if they were able to obtain a copy get the permission and translate it because it is so nice so easy so structured that people would enjoy reading it and learning from it another question is is to my knowledge the head of used to be the head of jamal islamiy of india and it was a good movement at the time because it came to counter the british colonization and to restore the spirit of islam to the muslims and it did a wonderful job however the scholars say that there are a number of mistakes upon this tafsir and my way and this is the way of a lot of the scholars is that whenever there are controversial issues about a sheikh or a group or a book to leave it aside and learn from what is not controversial so with all due respect to the sheikh may allah have mercy on him and his good contribution to islam it's not the best tafsir to go through as the scholars say and hence we should not uh study it rather study things that are in alliance to the tafseer of the seraph and to the appeal of the self and allah knows best sister fatima asked please give me some tips to parents to make their children to love the quran this is problematic because in our busy schedule we tend to make grave mistakes the vast majority of us are so busy trying to make ends meet trying to put food on the table we have to work 10 hours a day maybe spend three hours on the road in traffic jams we have to attend to our own needs and social activities to obey our parents to do the shopping groceries to pay the bills and maybe to go to the gym and refresh ourselves a little bit through halal entertainment which means that we leave very little time in our busy schedule for our children yet we have good intentions so what do we do we delegate and this is the job of a good manager we delegate such activities to a quran teacher a special school that would teach them the quran and i'm willing to pay for that in order for them to become better muslims and memorize the quran however we fail to follow through when we actually consider it as a form of punishment so whatever we are frustrated coming back home tired and the children are fighting their children they fight what do we do we angrily reprimand them scold them why are you shouting why are you doing this did you make heaven did you revise the quran go and do this so it's like a form of punishment instead of masha allah come come come come how much did you revise from the quran today what is the new surah you memorized masha allah recite it to me allah embrace the child kiss them hug them give them some candies when guests come oh look at my son look at my daughter she memorized two surahs masha'allah it to them and when the kid does that you praise them this is how we build souls and nations by praising by encouraging not by did you pray today go and pray you always pray late why don't you do so all what they see prayer quran doing good things as a form of punishment something they hate so they grow up hating it unfortunately no deal with it with the psychology and with the way that the child perceives what you are addressing him make a day or a time in your day where you sit and praise your child encourage them let them recite the quran if you go the extra mile and you be the one who revises their daily revision with them it's good for you it's good for them but unfortunately we're not all alike our times schedule is not that yeah any uh uh generous so it differs from one person to the other the most thing you have to remember is consistency you don't have to have them all memorize the quran by the age of seven oh sheikh i want them to be like imam shafir i want them to be alhamdulillah if they memorize the quran by the age of 50 so be consistent some of them you masha allah when they begin their children go to tafe quran they have a teacher of the quran for a week or two and then they take a vacation for a month they don't know the quran they come back they want to start fresh no they can't even if it's a small portion make it consistent every single day so that it becomes in their system it becomes part of their dna and may allah azzawajal grant us the success in guiding our children to adore and to embrace the quran as they should mean a very beautiful point there we shouldn't be like forcing our children to memorize the quran because it's a goal of the parent not it's not facilitating the children to understand why they have to be the quran of memories next question which is the best to do have on learning arabic which one should come first both see yeah life is not a list of tasks that you can okay number one and finish it number two finish it number yeah people come to me say should i study only akida and then go to usual and then go to learning arabic and then go to learning by the time you reach this maybe it would take you three four years and you don't still know how to pray oh then okay i should learn how to pray first and focus on the description of the prayer of the prophet assalam yes but you will not be able to know the authentic apida iraqi that is corrupt oh then i will go and devote myself to catapult and to rasulullah and yes but you don't know how to speak arabic okay then i'll leave everything and alone isolated on an island you don't know what to do no life is not as crystal clear as this you have to time manage yourself time management is very important multitasking is very important what are you i'm a professional chef i'm an i.t i'm a doctor i'm this i'm that which means that your time is limited so what should i prioritize no learn the essentials that allah will ask you about in the grave which is the akhida the three principal fundamentals who is your lord what is your religion who is this man these are the essentials how to pray the sahu the essentials not that little minute details the essentials that your islam is dependent upon because you don't have time or no sheikh i have ample time i'm yeah i need a student i have like four hours a day it's okay you're a student of knowledge then we have to focus on arabic because this is the foundation all sciences are built in arabic without arabic how can you understand the quran or the you cannot understand without arabic how can you understand the meaning of blah blah blah you need to know arabic so start to balance your time so arabic a little bit of apida a little bit of tafsir a little bit of fair here and there and whenever you're bored a little bit of seerah of the prophet saw because you need refreshment something that uh cordial something that softens your heart and nothing softens your heart more than the quran and the seed of the prophet it gets you closer to that beautiful time where you wish that you had lived with and witnessed so it's a balance that you should try to walk a very thin line and allah knows best the other question here which one's supposed to learn first uh that's one is that there were a synonym of the again let's not play with words yes and if you go to different scholars and ask them to explain to you the meaning of out of 10 scholars you'll get 12 opinions so the what is this everyone has his own interpretation but as i said the most authentic uh and close to reality is that tadabur means the conclusion of things the end result so it's a combination of knowing the tafsir the meaning what is uh the of the ayah and the understanding and implementation of it in our lives it's a full package so this as i said does not come overnight it takes years and years because to reflect upon the verses not the verse so it's not one verse that you comprehend and ponder and and reflect upon and say oh eureka i found it i can rest for the rest of the year no it's an ongoing process of understanding the full quran as in its totality and in a holistic fashion and to know how the prophet lived by it because this is what the prophet did over the period of 13 years in mecca there was no hajj no fasting no zakah no salah no no marriage or transactions riba 13 years what was the prophet doing ah he was cementing in them the oneness of allah the belief in the day of judgment the moral character of a muslim how to ponder upon the quran how to reflect upon allah signs around us and to be connected in this universe as allah wants us to be and allah knows best we proceed with the questions we have do we have like 16 minutes for prayer okay can we read one ayah with corrected we then read its translation and go to the next ayah is this the correct way again it's not one size that fits all everyone has his own way that he finds it closer to his heart some of us may read a whole jesus a day okay i finished my portion of the quran of recitation now i'm gonna read one ayah uh or one page of the quran and check it in the tafsir so i recite one page of surat al-baqarah read the tafseer of it some say oh i would like to compare three or four tfc's together of the same page so we put them side by side okay this means this is okay now i i get a better glimpse and understanding of it some people would not do that see one of the best ways which it's difficult to have tadabur without is to slowly recite when we recite the quran we look at the are you doing receiving the quran did you reflect on the fatih yes the greatest surah in the whole quran really we seven eyes so quickly and we recite it every day what's so strong what's so powerful allah says the prophet tells us when the servant of allah recites the fatiha allah says i divided the salat between me and my servant so when my servant says allah says my servant has praised me allah says my servant has complemented me [Music] says this is between me and my servant this is a dialogue so how quickly do we recite the fatiha in not the application but the speed so fast so quick we don't ponder upon it and this is why i don't know people who speak about pondering the quran where do they get this from by reciting it slowly this is why when you go and pray behind some of the imams you finish the prayer and say whoa this imam's recitation is out of this world why because he made you ponder you felt the quran while some of the most famous reciters in the world the most beautiful voices in the world they recite the quran said i don't know yeah his voice is beautiful maybe if he gives it a sheet that would be yani nicely but i didn't feel the quran while someone from the jungles of africa who recites the quran you feel it penetrating your heart like an arrow this is the thing that we would like to reach and allah knows best the last question my sister uh no the second last question uh right okay last question my brother what's the best way to recite the quran consistently again everybody's asking about the best way the best way this is not the uh seeding and the ranking of the best tennis players in the world we don't have such a seating some people say who are the best five scholars nowadays how could i know they didn't have any roland grass wimbledon i don't know there is no ranking of them again what's the best way to recite the quran or to have a portion depends i personally prefer to do my portion during night some people prefer to do their portion after fajr some people prefer to do it an hour before fajr some people prefer to do it after assa this is dependent some people have a daily routine to stay between maghrib and ish in the masjid so that's an approximately an hour and a half so they recite a full jujo and they contemplate upon few pages and they finish their duty and portion between maghrib and asia and then they have the rest of the day for themselves so it depends from a person to a person according to their own needs and ability and the last question as we know every language is modifying upon the generations my question is if we learn the modern day arabic how close we can understand the meaning of the quran i would say 85 percent to 90 because if you notice that the modern day arabic is divided between two fosa and colloquial the fosa is almost 90 percent close to the quran's actual language because the literal the literature and the level of arabic in the quran is second to none nothing comes close to the perfection of the arabic language a couple of days ago i had a counseling session with a brother unfortunately who's practicing who prays five times a day who does tarawih etc and he has this ocd about the quran he says all of a sudden i'm beginning to raise doubts and the problem is psychological not an issue of belief it's an ocd of shaytan i was telling him through the process of convincing him that the quran is the ultimate miracle every messenger has a miracle musa has miracles the jews come to us musa had miracles i said what are his militars they said he split the sea into two and walked across it he had a staff that turned into a big python the big snake that ate all the sorcerers snakes and sticks he had this he had that they said mashallah very good can you show me any of them said oops no we we can't show you anything it's all gone so how can i believe something i don't see the christians say yes our prophet isa jesus peace be upon him you secure the leopard the blind give life to the death used to do this to the dead you used to do this and this and this masha allah very good can you show me something he said nope it's all gone every single prophet and messenger's miracle has disappeared nothing remains muslims believe in it because it's in the quran so we believe in it as if we can see it so they come to us and say okay you muslims talk a lot where is your miracle you say that your prophet split the moon into two your prophet made the water come from his gush from his fingertips your prophet did this your prophet did that show me said we have the quran this is the miracle that will remain till the end of time so what's american in a book subhanallah it is the ultimate miracle it's the word of allah he said how do we know that muhammad did not write it he said that's a good question 23 years the prophet isaiah revealed was revealed to him the quran the consistency is impossible if i was an author in the beginning and the youth of my life i would write novels in the middle of my life i still write novels at the end of my life i'm still writing novels now when i reflect on my early novels i said oh they are full of flaws i should not have written this i should have changed this letter like when you write an email two hours later you will delete half of it next day you will delete one third of it because you keep on reforming it the quran was not from muhammad ali 23 years it is so powerful so high so eloquent so supreme in the level it never goes down a little bit it's always on the top notch which shows you that this is from allah azza this is the miracle now the 100 well the 1 million kuwaiti dinar question would be why did i say all of this i don't remember what was the question to begin it i keep on jumping from one idea to another when i forget the question was uh was about uh is the modern day arabic can help us okay okay so when we compare the arabic of the quran to our day-to-day language we find that our language is trash nevertheless the muslims in morocco whom we don't understand their arabic when they speak together i don't have an idea what they're speaking about because they mix a mosaic with french with arabic yet when they open the quran they understand it and the people in kuwait when they speak among themselves sometimes we saudis don't know what they're talking when they open the quran they understand it and my people from the western region of saudi arabia especially specifically in makkah yeah what when they speak their own language of makkah and they start swearing people from morocco and people from kuwait what is this they have no idea what language we're talking when they read the quran they understand it so they all relate to the arabic language and this is only found in the quran which was revealed in arabic which is still spoken by more than 500 million muslims worldwide and alhamdulillah it will be preserved till the end of time for facilitating us today for inviting us sitting with a very important topic and especially uh motivating us and also learning the quran and also arabic at the same time uh with this one for having me and make us among those who abide by the quran learn it and make the quran their leader and their constitution and may allah azzawajal make what we have heard today encouragement and a push forward for us to excel with ourselves with our children with our families and may allah forgive also our shortcomings and any wrong things that we had said thank you so much
