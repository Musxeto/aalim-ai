  "transcript": "Hasan says if a person intends to do something for the sake and pleasure of so knows that part of why he's doing the deed is for himself for example for fame even though he seeks refuge in allah azza wajal for this subconscious in intention should he still do the deed or abstain altogether now this is one of the reasons where we get Satan the police to mess up with our minds the issue of intention so the brother is saying hasn't that he is doing it for the sake of Allah for the pleasure of Allah Sojin but deep down inside he gets this feeling that it is part of seeking fame and recognition from people so should he go on with it or stop and abstain from doing it because at the end of the day he's seeking refuge in Allah from the whispers of Shaitaan and trying his level best okay you have two choices either you stop or you continue if you stop this means that you have lost the reward of benefiting people of doing a good deed etc if you continue you have two options either you continue while associating others with Allah so why why am I giving asks at every week because people would recognize me and send me emails ask me questions maybe people would think highly of me I like that this is shirk if I'm doing it just to please others or to be pointed at as a scholar or a student of knowledge I have issues I have a problem if I do it for the sake of Allah Allah no one knows this except Allah subhana WA Ta'ala then I have a good deal so I have these two options which one to choose I'll tell you how he keep on doing what pleases Allah and fight your inner feelings of seeking fame or doing it for a recognition or to draw attention fight it strongly seek refuge in allah azzawajal and always rectify and purify your intention so that how would I know that my intention is sincere for Allah social or not if I get bad comments on tonight's show saying share you did this you do that we did not like it it was boring you spoke a lot you stuttered you did this and I felt sad for that or when people compliment me and craziness and masha'Allah you're witty you're smart you're this you that your show was excellent and I feel happy for that Imam I met may Allah have mercy on us all said the sign of sincerity what signifies what shows me whether I'm sincere or not he says the sign of sincerity is when praising and criticism are equal in your heart and this makes a difference because then whether you praise me or criticize me who gives whatever who cares I don't care I'm doing what I'm doing for the sake of Allah sirs so Hassan I advise you to fight your inner with wasps seek refuge in Allah soja and move on keep on doing good things pray to Allah to prevent hypocrisy from creeping into your heart or to your actions and pray to Allah to make your acts sincere for his sake"
