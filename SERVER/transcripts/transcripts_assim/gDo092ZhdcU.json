  "title": "Dawah: Calling people to Allah (Basics Part 2) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "um and welcome to this second episode of our series the basics the basics of what the basics of islam what are the essential things that each and every one of us has to know we talked yesterday about islam being the religion of fitra and today we will talk about another topic which is part of the basics of islam that we've seemed to have neglected and drifted away from among other things allah azzawajal says in the quran o prophet indeed we have sent you as a witness and a bringer of good tidings and a warner and one who invites to allah by his permission so one of the roles of the prophet one of the most important roles of the prophet sallam is to invite to allah in arabic we call this da'wah to call to invite to the way of allah azzawajal and a person who does this is known as da'i so if you hear these terminologies now you can relate dawah is to call to invite da he is the caller and the one who is inviting so the master of all daesh of all callers to islam is the prophet his life revolved around calling people to allah also the messengers before him had the same job description and this is the same job description of scholars of students of knowledge and before them of all the companions of the prophet salallahu so anyone who embraces islam and accepts it as a religion and a way of life he has no other choice but to be a caller to islam and to invite others to islam allah azzawajal says in the quran addressing his messenger say o muhammad this is my way i invite to allah with insight and i and those who follow me so it is the prophet as assam who showed us his way and he and those who follow him invite to allah azzawajal with insight basera with knowledge with wisdom with diplomacy and if you look at the life of the prophet you will see that clearly so all of his life revolved around calling others and inviting them to islam 24 hours 7 days a week if he sees someone of his some of his companions wearing a gold ring he takes it and admonishes him and says that this is not permissible don't you know that this is a stone of fire in your hand if he sees someone eating with his left hand like unfortunately so many muslims who follow the etiquette holding the fork with the left and the knife with the right and eating with their left and the prophet told us allah this is totally prohibited and only the devils satan eats and drinks with his left so imitating him is prohibited in islam if he enters a house and sees curtains or a portrait with a living being being drawn on it you can see the resentment on his face and he would not enter such a room until that picture or drawing is removed whenever he visits the people of the book the jews or the christians in their homes it would not be a social visit he would devote that visit to inviting them to islam in a diplomatic and kind way all of this is to seek allah's pleasure and to fulfill his mission so dawa and inviting others to islam is not a choice it is part of your job description as well as a muslim and allah did not order us to force people to make them respond to us no allah simply ordered us to invite as for the guidance that's in his hands not ours and that's why allah says it is not up to you to guide the people it is up to allah to guide whomever he wishes so we only invite we are callers to islam this is our role and part of our responsibilities in this given period of time we have on earth it's not to eat and drink and to enjoy it is with a prime objective and that is to reach jannah how are we going to reach jannah by implementing whatever we're instructed to do in the quran in our lives allah azza has made people by default leaders but there are two types of leaders the type that leads the people to jannah to paradise to guidance and there is the type that leads the people to hell fire so what's it gonna be for you for your wife for your children listen to what allah says in the quran and we made from among them leaders guiding by our command when they were patient and when they were certain of our signs these are leaders who guide with allah's commands to paradise and allah also says and we made them leaders inviting to fire on on the day of resurrection they will not be helped so it's up to you to choose and this is the basics of islam you don't have a choice to sit back and relax you have to call others to islam but many people would be confused and say okay i'm not qualified i don't have the knowledge i can't speak arabic i've never studied islam thoroughly so how can i preach and teach what i have no knowledge in the easiest and most convenient and most beneficial ways of dawa of calling others to islam is by walking the talk not by preaching as we do the best way is by walking the talk by acting upon what you believe about your convictions your beliefs your religion look at the countries of africa in southeast asia indonesia malaysia brunoi and the likes how did islam reach such countries not a single soldier had ever traveled there from the muslim countries and this is a clear refutation to those who claim that islam was spread by the sword because indonesia which is the largest islamic country in terms of population maybe 250 or 300 million muslims living there not a single soldier had ever fought there to spread islam so how did they become muslim through dawa through the muslim merchants who came from yemen and from arabia to trade when they saw their honesty when they saw their integrity and that they're trustworthy they don't lie they don't cheat they accepted islam and look what had happened this is the best way of dawa and you should ask yourself how many muslims have accepted islam because of you how many people entered islam because of you if you are unable to preach and give lectures you can financially support if you don't have the means the money you have the management skills to organize and to structure how darw should be if you don't have that either you have your physical ability you can drive you can uh carry things you can go in the streets and spread leaflets whenever is needed not that straight dawa is a good thing or a bad thing this has pros and cons i've seen people devoting their time for street dawah which i'm not very at ease with addressing random people and sometimes challenging them and sometimes shoving the material down their throat by force take these leaflets take this quran take this this and maybe they're not up to it yes if you have a a stool where people come to you whenever they're interested that's okay but to go and stop people and force them to do a social experiment listen to the quran then what if they cursed the quran what did you benefit from that but this is beside the point there are many ways of doing dawa so one of them is street dawa or preaching people in specific places or going through the internet there are uh um i don't know what's called in english that would corner maybe or a dialogue corner maybe where they meet people from all over the world on the internet catering for their questions and so many people accepted islam what did this person who's anonymous sitting behind a computer screen with the firm intention to make dawah and to spread the word and to invite and call others to islam who knows about him no one except the management but he is working hard to call others to islam this concept is one of the basics that i wouldn't be exaggerating if i said that 99 of the muslims are ignorant about unfortunately what do we think what do we live for the vast majority live for their school their uni then a job then to get married than to have children thinking of a mortgage to possess a house maybe having a car if they have a car another us suv or a sports car would be fun and to enjoy life at the very end of their priorities maybe to raka's night prayer maybe giving a dollar charity foreign organization but who has this in his blood to call people to islam to defend islam to illustrate islam as beautiful as it really is by being honest by being trustworthy by being punctual on your time by coming on time to work and leaving on time not cheating not deceiving others who among us cleanses his heart so he has no hatred no grudges no hidden agenda what's in his heart is on his tongue he doesn't change colors very rare and this is part of the basics that we have to adhere to and this brings us to how did the prophet islam give tawa for 13 years and this i will conclude my first half of the show with this thought 13 years the prophet alice islam stayed in mecca did he call people to there was no prayer no fasting no zakat no sharia rulings regarding marriages divorces custody no prescribed punishment no jihad rulings so what was it that he had spent 13 years doing in makkah what was his tawa at that time and this is inshallah what we will know when we meet tomorrow if allah gives us life and we have a short break before we take your questions so stay tuned me"
