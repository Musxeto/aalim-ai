  "transcript": "Zuhair from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh, my question is that Are we sinful for watching New Year's Eve fireworks Without any intention of celebrating it because like my family goes out and watches the fireworks But we do not celebrate such events or engage in such parties or anything like that. JazakAllah Khair Wa Jazakum, it's an issue of dispute some would say There is no sin. I'm just enjoying the colorful display of fireworks and I am enjoying the weather and it looks nice and That's it Others say well, actually these fireworks are the result of a haram celebration Muslims do not celebrate the New Year and they don't imitate the disbelievers as The Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam had warned us 15 centuries ago when he said you Will follow the footsteps of Those before you even if it's a hand span Even if they enter a lezards hole you will follow them and enter it So the people ask who are those before us? Oh Prophet. Alayhis Salaam. Are they the Jews and the Christians and the Prophet? Astonishedly said to them who then who else then Meaning that they are the Jews and the Christians and nowadays we see so-called quote-unquote Muslims trying to be moderate trying to be civil and they imitate the disbelievers in every thing they do To the extent that you may find Someone's names Abdullah or Muhammad or Abdur-Rahman Muslim having a Christmas tree in his house Duh You may find Muslims Gathering their family on New Year's Eve and celebrating you might find couples or families Doing the countdown five four three two one for midnight Audhu billah What else is? Left hang across Maybe I don't know. So definitely I would my own personal view is a Muslim should prevent his family himself from admiring such rituals that would soften his heart and probably introduce Elements of hypocrisy without him knowing it creeping into his heart little by little Until he starts to question Islamic values until he starts to wonder why don't we have? Similar things like they do Look at our Sheikh when he comes on the Friday sermon. He has a long beard and he's wearing his Islamic dress and he shouts on the pulpit there the day of judgment and you will all go to hell This is what they say but when we go to a church and we see the preacher wearing a two or three piece suit with a tie and Clean shaven. He looks nice and all the colored Windows and or these clean places and the man playing the organ and they chant and dance This is Cool, man Unlike what our south our Muslim Imams are doing Subhanallah, look at the hypocrisy. This is what we are Inserting in our children's hearts without us knowing it and this is what a Muslim must be really careful of We have to build our Islamic identity. Sure. Give me a break. My Islamic identity is gonna be Affected by watching the fireworks it might be Better safe than sorry, but as I said, it's an issue of dispute. Some would say it's okay Me personally I would never ever go or be seen in a place where people just go by the lake and Look, let alone pay four hundred or five hundred Euros or dirham or dollars to get a table and drink coffee and watch it May Allah protect us all You"
