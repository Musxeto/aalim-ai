  "transcript": "sorry um I learned that you're supposed to show as little of your eyes as possible when wearing a cup so I don't know I'm trying to do that but my mom told me that I'm defeating the purpose of their God because I had a few Muslims including an Agave who looked at me weirdly because you could only see a little bit a little bit of my eyes uh like the Olive's Idol I had girls that wear gloves they don't wear that account like that and my dad told me what he went to her but he saw people wearing a cup like normally um and I watched over the cup the way there's a hobbies in it but I'm getting doubts I'm getting that I'm being extreme at doing it wrong so if you have any advice on this be steadfast whenever you're abiding by the truth by the Quran by the Sunnah you'll have enemies you can have critics what you're doing is A-Okay 100 perfect those who look down at you among the quote unquote nekabis or among the quote unquote hijabis they're envious because you're doing it so well they're looking down at you and trying to uh put you down or pull you down put you down is a little bit too extreme um they're trying to make you feel inferior the hijab that many women wear today doing this showing their eyebrows showing their cheekbones some of them showing to the tip of their nose this is not who are they joking about they need braces to fix their teeth that's why they're covering it they have pimples in their cheek that's why they're covering it they're not wearing the hijab for the sake of Allah most likely I'm not judging them who cares I judge whomever I want sue me so unfortunately they're not abiding by the hijab may Allah be pleased with him Illustrated how the hijab should be done by only exposing one eye and then is to be worn so that you could see not so that people could see you so wearing it this tight okay people could see my eyes but they can't see anything else there's no fitna in that when you do this and they see the eyebrows people would say it's pushy you need to pluck your eyebrows well I don't want to be among those who's cursed this by itself is a form of adornment of beautification when they show this area from the temple again this is not permissible to show what are you doing so don't listen to your mom in this regards don't listen to your father don't listen to these Alima and and the likes because they're envious of you you're on the right track my daughter keep being steadfast and inshallah uh they will follow you with the grace of Allah"
