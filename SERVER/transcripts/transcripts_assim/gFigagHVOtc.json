  "title": "Is Not saying Alhamdulillah Minor Shirk?",
  "transcript": "[Music] of the videos you told that if we don't say alhamdulillah for major projects and minor things it is minor so my question is suppose i managed to complete my homework or i managed to chop the vegetables for example so in these type of situations if i don't say alhamdulillah will it be minor sheikh i never said this but i will answer your question ayman from india he says you said that not saying alhamdulillah over a project is minor shirk i did not say that i said that when you attribute favors to other than allah azzawajal some say that this is minor shirk as in the case of the hadith of even abbas may allah be pleased with a man with his father when a man says that had it not been for the duck of our neighbors the thief would have stole or broke into our house and stole our house but because of that duck or because of that a puppy uh that bart we were saved he says this is minor and to sum it up it's not there's no enough time to to explain it depends on the intention when i look at the means and see that they caused my success in the project my hard work is what caused my success in the project not allah's help this comes to a problem of shirk but when i'm attributing the things to its cause so i had a headache i took two pills of pain relievers and now the headache is gone it's alhamdulillah i took these pills and the headache was gone attributing it to the cause while acknowledging that the main reason is allah azzawajal then there is no shirk in that and allah knows best you"
