  "transcript": "sulemani raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu sallim wa barik alaa muhammad al al-amin nabina muhammad in wa ala aalihi wasabi woman dead bee honey he was tender personality he la almudena amma bad assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Allah Azza WA JAL has praised his messenger sallallahu alayhi wa sallam in the quran by saying verily you are on the exalted standard of character anyone who reads the biography of the Prophet is Raja Ram would know immediately that the Prophet is awesome was unlike any other man he was the perfect human being to walk the earth with his moral conduct with his manners and ethics of the highest standard possible and the Prophet when he came to us are a sort of Salaam he wasn't praising himself or confusing others by saying I came with no one else had ever come with on the contrary the Prophet told the solecism in his humbleness that I have only been sent to perfect good characteristics which means that there were good characteristics in the times of pre-islamic era but they needed perfection they needed completion and this is what Islam came to complete to fulfil and not to regenerate something from scratch the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam highlighted the issue of manners and ethics in Islam when he stated that the best of you o Muslims o companions are those with high moral conduct and ethics an exalted standard of character in manners providing that day no Islam they have knowledge they have FIP and he also promised that a histological salaam those who have an exalted stunt standard of manners and ethics to be next to him and the closest sitting to him in paradise on the day of judgment the prophet said had a solemn whoever exalts the standard of his manners and ethics I will guarantee for him a house in the top level of paradise not in the middle not at the bottom on the top level of paradise so it goes without saying in Islam that good ethics good moral conduct righteous manners makes you closer to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and would admit you to Jenna as not having them would admit you to Hellfire may Allah protect us is this is this possible yes the Prophet told the Sallisaw to send that bad manners spoil good deeds similarly to vinegar spoiling honey when you add it to it even your charity though it's for the sake of Allah if you follow that with bad manners Allah would reject it Allah says in the Quran o you who believe do not render in vain your sadaqa your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury haven't I done this for you few weeks ago didn't I give you and we tend to think that Islam is only prayer and fasting which is partially right because these are pillars of Islam but this is not all of Islam the Prophet Allah so Salam was told about a woman who prays all night and she fasts all day meaning that she's quite righteous when it comes to forms of worship but she hurts and abuses her neighbours the Prophet said Alice Oh Sarah she is in fire so don't be delusional yes your prayers your fastings are all good for you but they're not everything and Allah says in the Quran indeed he succeeds who purifies his ownself so this is the road to success your own self purification among the best things to reach that exalted standard of manners is to make duaa whenever the Prophet Isis Salam started to pray he used to say a very long door and among that door he used to say and guide me to the best of manners and ethics no one guides to the best of it except you and distract me from the worst of manners and ethics no one distracts me from it other than you so dua is essential and it is an indication that you're attempting to achieve and Allah will help you in achieving it and when we want to purify our souls ourselves from such bad manners this begins by training yourself by putting an effort because door alone is not enough so when a man came to the prophet I some said advise me he said do not become angry he said okay give me more said do not become angry do not become angry do not become angry which means that anger is the mother of all bad manners when you are in rage you don't see in front of you clearly and you would say and do things that you were inevitably regret more Adam New Japan the great companion may Allah be pleased with him the Prophet instructed him ordered him withhold your tongue meaning do not speak because when you speak you make errors and when you make errors you make sense most bad character most bad manners and ethics result from our tongues when we slander when we lie when we curse when we say things that are extremely bad and offensive and the Prophet used to seek refuge in allah azza wajal from a number of things he used to seek refuge in allah from bad manners and ethics from laziness from a nobility from cowardice from being stingy from old age from so many things he used to seek refuge in it because in a larger from it because this is one of the virtues of dua and when it comes to manners and ethics some of us are blessed to be born with it but not all of us so you would find people who are generous by nature since birth you would find people that are truthful and honest and would never lie or cheat but the vast majority of us require training and the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said whoever refrains from asking allah will make him content whoever seeks to be independent of means Allah will make him independent and whoever is patient Allah will bestow patience upon him so you have to seek Allah's patience through that the Prophet goes on to say all is awesome and no one is ever given anything better and more generous than patience so when you Elijah analyze yourself and find that Allah has bestowed upon you a number of good manners and ethics and moral conduct know that this is a blessing from Allah Azza WA JAL preserve it try to make it grow and try to complete what shortcomings you have in you through practicing and striving see a scribe a scribe who writes with beautiful lines and and letters with practice he becomes perfect those who want to be generous must give in the cause of Allah Azza WA JAL and those who feel arrogant in themselves they must humble themselves and force themselves to be humble and this is not possible unless you are diagnosed with such an illness and then only you can know how to react and try to get a cure some of us fail to find their own shortcomings by themselves but we need to seek the assistance of our teachers of our shoe of our elders of our close friends righteous pious friends who would give us a sincere advice Omar says may Allah have mercy upon a person who gives me and shows me my own shortcomings so when you listen to people criticizing you and trying to avoid mistakes and when you mix up with people and see their shortcomings and try to avoid it in yourself you will succeed insha'Allah and finally the best means of attaining good character and manners is by reading the biography and the serie of the Prophet erase thought of cinnamon because he walked the talk and if you follow his footsteps you will have the most excellent of ethics and manners ever possible for anyone Heather Allahu Alem when it will merely Aslam was a little ah who wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad why the early he was sahbihi ajma'in"
