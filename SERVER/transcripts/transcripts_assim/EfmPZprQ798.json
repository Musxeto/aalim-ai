  "transcript": "as-salaam alaikum and welcome to another episode of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman a beer host today's subject is about the grandchildren of prophet muhammad salallahu alaihe wasalam we are continuing to look at ways that we can be with the Prophet in our lives in these times despite being fourteen centuries removed from the prophet's life our guest for this show from Saudi Arabia Sheikh Azam al Hakim assalamu alaikum and welcome wadi comes saddam or floorcare - and thank you for having me our pleasure we look forward to a discussion this will be our last look at this relationship that the Prophet had peace be upon him with his family members his grandchildren and we going to go as we promised earlier on to different members of society around around him I'd like to ask you about we'll start out by by mentioning Prophet ISA peace be upon him prophet ISA Allah gave miracles to each of the the prophets the one that Allah gave to Prophet ISA peace be upon him was that of supernatural healing as a supernatural healer of the body and mind of course the prophets miracle was the Quran but on the subject of health and healing prophet Mohamed Salah solemn performed rock Rukia okay which connects to health and healing it's of course not the same powers that were given to issa nevertheless it's something that we can implement in our lives what is Rukia did the Prophet practice it that he recommended that he'd perform it on his grandchildren okay smile on him the autosum I'll also allow my Tel Aviv oh yeah I'm about now you're taking us a bit of course and I have to get back to the course first of all the there were many miracles of Jesus Christ peace be upon him as there were many many more miracles of the Prophet Ali salatu salam so it is unfair to say that his miracle was the quran see we as Muslims believe that Moses had miracles Jesus had miracles Noah had miracles all the mess jism prophets of Allah had miracles but the acid test would be for any Christian who comes and claims such miracles show me and he cannot so those who follow follow Moses show me and they cannot when we as Muslims say that the Prophet had many miracles and people say show me we have the Quran so it is the miracle that still exists till date until the day of judgment the Prophet had many miracles he had the splitting of the moon which is mentioned in the Quran in Surat al comer where he made illogical made the moon split into two halves for the people of garage to see that in front of them he had the miracles of pebbles talking to him animals talking to him he had the miracles of running water from his fingertips in times of drought filling up wells of of water so many of these miracles that this is not the time to so just a clarification of your introduction secondly the healing process is coming entirely from Allah and this is the cornerstone that each and every individual must believe in so that his healing would be quick and a certain why do I say this a lot of us think that it's the medication that cures them it's the rukia that tourism is this pious share and righteous scholar when he does his supplication that would cure us and this is totally wrong the one who cures is allah azza wajal all our healing and curing is in his hands he had placed means for us to take and follow while our hearts are 100% connected to him so we do not depend on the means having said this introduction the Prophet told the Saudis awesome and this is mentioned in the Quran that the Quran is the best form of healing and we have the prophetic sayings and supplications as a form of healing when we come to look at what he did during his salat wa sallam in terms of healing there are many venues to investigate and to look into but what sticks in our mind is that he used to do some sort of supplication to Al Hasan and then Hussein his grandchildren and he sometimes used to call them as my children this is the Rukia you're getting - yes it is not a rakia that he used to give he used to give dua or supplication of protection see Rukia he's done whenever a healing is required so if you're physically ill if you have pain in your stomach a headache if you have fever if you have an evil eye not inshallah may Allah protect us so if a person has a envy or black magic or jinn possession this person is in need of healing so we give him rakia we recite the rakia to him what is mentioned in the Sunnah when it comes to Al Hasan and Husayn is not a rakia this is a protection invocation order what does this word mean routier rupiah is an Arabic word that is an umbrella to whatever a person recites in order to uplift the calamity an illness a trouble from a person so it can be from the Quran it can be from the Sun it can be of good dua and it also can be from jinn and back magic and voodoo doctors so if I had to force myself to choose two words I would say a healing utterance it's an invocation okay more with the purpose of healing yes so for example earth man even alas may Allah be pleased with him narrates that I came to the Prophet as I'm with an illness in my chest and I complained to the Prophet that it's hurting me what did the Prophet tell him so Louis and he told him place your hand on your chest and recite three times bismillah bismillah bismillah and then recite seven times our wood will bear is that Allah he was a devotee he mention Rhema as you do what - earth man may Allah be pleased with him did this and he said by Allah I was healed I personally practice this on myself whenever I get a sports injury in my knee in my back or I hit something and it hurts or I get a headache I just placed my hand and say this door and with the grace of Allah it's gone not because I have special powers everyone does this door and alonzo gel cures the vast majority of them not because they have special powers because they are going to the source and they're seeking assistance and help from the one who has the pure for them so what what did this look like when the Prophet peace be upon him did this for his grandchildren okay this is something we do for our children by seeking Allah's protection for them so he said to them I'll supplicate to you like your grandfather Ibrahim used to supplicate for his children is Mariel and his ha - mal and Isaac so what did he used to say the same thing or a lucuma I seek refuge in Allah for you Bukhari Mattila Hatem in a las perfect words min kulli shayin Wow from every devil and from every insect or reptile that is around women currently I name lamb and from every evil eye that looks and gives you this evil look as a Wow you're so strong he's so beautiful he's so healthy and all of a sudden the child falls sick what happened this is evil eye even if an unintended it happens so the Prophet used to do this Ali system which shows us how much he cared for its children okay nowadays do we do this for our own children do we supplicate do we try to invoke allah azza wajal to protect them in the morning in the evening or not because the children by nature are vulnerable they have impurities that urinate maybe they don't clean themselves they don't know how to they don't recite that car in the morning in the evening they go and they might be unprotected so the Prophet is telling us how to deal with these issues hmm so this is why we have a record of the prophets Aloha Salam teaching his grandchildren supplications to empower them turn and give them the ability to protect themselves and make them less vulnerable so would you care to talk about that some of the things that he taught okay now people generally speaking care only about materialistic things we see parents astonished and shocked why are children behaving like this we brought them the latest iPhone we gave them the latest Playstation 4 or 5 or whatever we provide them with a week ends to Resorts we buy them the best branded clothes material stuff we take them to international schools we have the best food for them why are they behaving this way this is not the right way of bringing your children the right way of upbringing your children is to instill in them to install in them that is the fear of Allah the love of Allah the knowledge of Allah and when you look and compare how the grandchildren of the Prophet s Islam where and how our children are you'll find that there is a big serious gap our children may not pray on time even when they are in in their teenage even if they're grown up they may not pray on time they may skip a prayer every now and then look at a lesson and this is astonishing and shocking he came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and how old was he he was like six years seven math.max a child and adolescent kid he says o prophet of allah teach me something to supplicate to Allah while I pray with her what is whitter we have the five daily prayers we know whitter is an odd number of Rocca's prayed at the end of the night to conclude your night prayer this seven-year-old kid offers night prayer yep not only that he comes to the Prophet as I'm seeking guidance from him to teach him what to say so the Prophet Isis and did that mmm Sheikh before you continue we are ready for our break we'll come back to continue our discussion Jolla salamualikum' welcome back to with the profit shake awesome before the break you were talking about our Witter the odd-numbered raucous following the Aisha prayer please continue so the Prophet is Adam taught his grandson the Duha which we all over the Muslim world supplicate it and said specifically and especially in taraweeh in Ramadan which is Allah who maha Dini FEMEN had eight Wahine FEMEN our fate whatever Lonnie what oh well then if he meant they were late to the end of the drop now a child of this age coming to you as a father or a grandfather and asking you to teach him something of this magnitude if someone does this in our era most likely the father would say listen take like five dollars go back buy candies and don't bug me and we have a problem of spending quality time with our children teaching them what they need to learn because ignorance is the mother of all problems of the Prophet as Sam was a teacher a judge a husband and a grandfather let us look at the grandfather's and how they treat their children nowadays I remember once in a lecture in a public lecture I posed a question and I said I'm gonna ask you a question in one voice try to answer me with one word and the question was what our grandfathers known for everybody said grumpy the vast majority said grumpy these this is what people have their recollection of the grandparents that they're always old grumpy whining complaining and this is not the Islamic way where a grant father or a mother is supposed to be portrayed on mm-hmm and we have a number of examples to point to and the prophet's life peace be upon him one is actually at a time when you would least expect an expression of love and mercy while in the pulpit delivering a sermon with the people around him listening it's a well-known story many of us know about it where he saw his grandsons entering the Masjid and descended from the pulpit to it go and embraced him can you describe that I mean nowadays if we saw someone expressing openly their love for the grandchildren that way we would they would probably be criticized we would see them as being unorthodox it would be a negative thing but it's a different very different model that the Prophet gives us see again when we think of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam we tend to think of him in a way that does not reflect the truth and the reality so we think of him as someone who is strict someone who is serious someone who does not joke someone who does not express his feelings and all of this is wrong this is not the Prophet s elitism how would we learn the true reality of the Prophet our son through such series through going deep into the serie and the Shamal of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam abu boorda may allah be pleased with him tells us that the Prophet once is awesome was delivering a sermon mm-hmm and he was preaching us and all of a sudden al hasan and husayn wearing red clothes walked into the masjid tripping falling and standing which means that they were like four three five years of age real toddlers yes and the Prophet interrupted his hot body sort of Salam he came down from the pulpit walked across the the Masjid hugged them and embraced them and carried them and went back to the pulpit and he said by Allah Allah has said the truth why because in surah that Terrebonne allah awj Allah has mentioned that verily your wealth and your offspring our means of trial means of test I saw my children coming in I was impatient I could not hold back and could not just continue without going interrupting what I was doing embracing them and loving most times when we talk about trials from children or grandchildren it's not like that correct yesterday opposite yes I like to address perhaps a misconception you know many of us who have family members or parents that are in high positions in government wealthy business persons we think of ourselves as being somehow or tempted at least to think of ourselves as somehow better than all the other middle class low-class people so maybe there's a temptation for the people who are find themselves being born as descendants of Prophet Muhammad SAW so long so should we as heir a basis for assuming true or false being an Arab makes you a better Muslim being a descendant of the Prophet makes one a more righteous person that's bound for paradise no this is wrong the Prophet stated himself a little Atossa in a number of authentic hadith that so-and-so claimed that they are part of me and they are my allies by Allah this is not true he addressed even his closest relatives he said Sophia meant Abdul Muttalib his aunt ask from me whatever you want money-wise because in this dunya I can give you because on the day of judgement I cannot benefit you at all or our best even Abdul Mutallab my uncle ask whatever you want from me because on the day of judgement I cannot help you or Fatima the daughter of Muhammad ask from me whatever you wish because on the day of judgment I cannot help you at all so this illustrates clearly that being a descendant of the Prophet also some has no value at the sight of Allah none whatsoever however we as normal people are supposed to be kind to them for their relationship to the Prophet aresome not to give them any kind of supremacy or power or obedience yeah in some countries and like the subcontinent and India and elsewhere if a person is a saying it he claims that he has powers over everyone else and he has the right to be obeyed and it's like Simon says I'm the descendant of the Prophet and this is totally bogus this is not true it's not related to Islam none whatsoever good thank you for clarifying that misconception what about this balance you know there's a balance between the right approach to strike the right balance in the relationship with the grandchildren this is our subject grandkids but I think it also applies to children some have on one end of the spectrum you know we might have a tendency to be too harsh to be authoritarian to have establish a hierarchical relationship the other end of the spectrum may be out of love we're too lenient and we think that the best way to love them is to let them have their way and in the process end up spoiling them crippling them making them in ill-equipped for life so about this balance what can you can you say about this between kindness the the best expression of love okay now this is a big issue we have just mentioned how the Prophet as I'm interrupted his sermon mm-hmm to go and attend to his grandchildren and express publicly his love for them right now lots of heads of states lots of wealthy people may be hesitant to express such a thing publicly the Prophet is telling us a letter saying that this is human nature and the natural thing is to do so to express it the Prophet was once I assume with his companions and in the presence of al Akram new hobbies one of the nomads and a tribesman and a leader of his tribe so Al Hassan walked in and the Prophet as usual embraced him smelt him kissed him and made him sit on his lap a local I said you do this I have ten of my own sons I've never kissed a single one hmm so he's a tribesman he thinks that this is an expression of bravery and manhood the Prophet has not replied in a very short statement whoever does not have mercy Allah will not be merciful to him in another narration the Prophet said to him how can I help you if Allah extracted mercy from your heart then this is a serious thing the expression and showing them your love and conviction is essential yeah but at the same time if they cross the line you have to stop them you may have to reprimand them also at Husein in in an authentic hadith was once walking he saw a date lying on the floor he took it and ate it and he was a toddler 3 4 years of age hmm a natural thing to do the Prophet came to him at his asylum and took it out of his mouth from this child's mouth saying no spit it out mm-hmm he said didn't you know that we the of muhammad sallallaahu seldom charity zakat money sadaqa all is not halal for us so now he didn't kiss him as before he didn't embrace him as before he taught him that this is a wrong action though it he is in a young age now you cannot have the stick without a carrot and it's totally wrong to have the carrot without a stick even in day-to-day transactions we have to deal with our children with our subordinates with our relatives in ways that we give them incentives and at the same time if they do mistake we reprimand them accordingly and diplomatically likewise with our children you cannot be harsh all the time they'll run away from you and now they are in an age where you expect them to run to you but when they grow up and have friends you'll be running after them they don't want to sit with you yeah so you have to at an early age give unconditional love give quality time so that when they grow up they have reserve to bank over and to remember and when there is a need to reprimand them they can remember the good times and your kindness in your love and your compassion so it would be a form of balance well that's sound advice we have run out of time for this episode and I'm sure there are many things that we were not able to get to but we appreciate your being with us and hope that our discussion was beneficial and inshallah we will be continuing with our next episode in the near future thank you again and thank you Sheikh Baba calafate as-salaam alaikum when I went to LA forgot"
