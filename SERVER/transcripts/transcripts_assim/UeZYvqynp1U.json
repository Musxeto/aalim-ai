  "transcript": "hamza from bosnia uh sheikh what's the ruling on praying loud prayers silently only because one doesn't feel comfortable when others around him can hear him so for example if i'm praying isha prayer in my room and somebody enters the room would it be hypocrisy if i stop reciting loudly and just do this silently for as long as this person is in the room with me first of all the scholars say that prayers can actions and the things we say can be pillars can be mandatory acts and can be sunnah so sunnah acts in prayer such as raising the hand when saying allahu akbar if i do it i'm rewarded if i skip it there's no sin and the prayer is varied so if i simply come to start the prayer and say allah and i do this no problem even if i don't do this i put my hands to my side no problem the prayer is valid secondly the same thing goes for reciting loudly in fazer magrib and isha in the first two rakaas if i decide to do it silently so in fajr magnesia i recite the whole prayer silently the prayer is valid and if i reverse this and i decide to recite loudly i have abandoned the sunnah but the prayer is still valid so whether you do it because of people in the room and you're shy or you don't want to disturb them there is no problem in that insha allah you"
