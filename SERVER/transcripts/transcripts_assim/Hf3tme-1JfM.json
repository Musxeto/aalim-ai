  "transcript": "what is the place of women in islam and what are their rights and oh assalamualaikum and welcome to youth talk i would like to welcome my guest in the studio i have with me it's a pleasure having you with us pleasure is all mine i would also like to welcome my three participants i have with me osema as well as mahmoud and muhammad let's start off asking by asking a very simple question what is the value or the place of women this question usually arises when we talk about women generally and in islam particularly because people tend to make this an issue that they would have lots of hidden agendas coming out of it a woman's place in islam is a very important one and it's logical before it is islamic because they constitute half of our society they are the mother the wife the sister and the daughter so men are surrounded with women and women are surrounded with men so it is essential for us to know the rights of everyone so one could be on a clear road and path while living with each other islam gave women their rights centuries ago and this issue comes to the surface nowadays by people who themselves were only recently fighting with each other whether a female has a soul or not it's it's almost 150 years in europe that the discussion was heated up to say and and and acknowledge that females women do not have souls only recently they have uh come to the point that yes they have souls they're human beings and they have their rights and so before that in in europe and elsewhere in the mid evil ages women had no rights at all islam 15 centuries ago came to an environment where women were inherited so if a man dies his son is uh uh by default inherits his his wife his mother-in-law she becomes his property in countries like india and so on if a man dies his wife is cremated with him and and this is still practiced in some states in india and so on this practice was completely stopped when islam came to give the woman its honor and its rights okay um i think we'll start off with mahmoud for example maybe there was something else yes i agree with this viewpoint as i read that the indian and the european culture in the middle ages and what followed it they they would estimate the woman as something like a property of a man and if he died this property was entitled to another person but islam is is giving the woman all over its a legacy and it's uh history the all rights that the west never give here what is the role of women in islam let's start off maybe with the talk about the role of a woman is there certain role that women should play in an islamic society or according to islam a woman is like a man they share the same role in the society they are addressed both with the same legislations rules instructions orders of allah azza they all have to pray fast perform zakah gives the cap perform umrah and hajj they all have to be kind to their neighbors to the parents to the next of kin they all have to stay away from sin not to fornicate not to steal not to do this and that in that sense they are all equal the role of a woman is determined on her position so if she's a daughter she has to be a good daughter to her parents she has to obey them she has to care for them as the quran instructs us to do if she is a wife she has to be good and kind to her husband if she's a mother she has to bring up her children in an islamic way to be kind of them to be loving and caring and so on so it depends on her yes i would i want to ask about the rule for the female to choose her husband okay okay is that a right i mean does the female in islam have the right to choose her husband or is she subordinated to her father he is the one to choose the allah azza describes the muslim nation as being a nation of the middle which not to the extreme in some countries you'll find women to be liberal in the sense that if a woman or if a girl is 15 or 16 years old she has all the right to leave her parents house and go and move on to live with her boyfriend or go and just leave and in some cases the parents kick the children out of the house and tell them you go and support yourself so no matter what they do if they indulge in uh uh drugs if they go into prostitution if they kill steal it's not our job we we raised you until you were 14 15 and then it's you're on your own so in such societies a girl has the right to choose whatever she wants to do even if she makes the wrong choice even if she wants to become a a homosexual a tetrasexual whatever it's her right she can do whatever she pleases it pleases her on the other extreme there are countries and societies that impose the choice of the father and the mother on the on their child so the child has no uh uh say what's up no decision she has to marry this man regardless of his age his religion his social status this is not your problem you have to marry him it's a must islam is a way in between marriage cannot take place without the consent of two the girl herself and the guardian and the guardian usually is the father yes but if the father is not there then the brother or the son or the uncle depending and why is that simply because girls are emotional by nature so anyone could you know uh sweet talk her into getting married to her and then men she would find out that he was not suitable so if she accepts someone her guardian the father has to approve it otherwise the contract is invalid i know that in some countries they claim to follow some school of thought that gives the woman right to marry herself and this is wrong and this has been proven wrong in so many uh islamic countries and also in the west where the girl uh objects to her father's choice and decides to marry herself to that man and after a week or two discovers that he was not the right one and then she is in a whole lot of problems and trouble trying to get rid of this marriage and is unable to do so and at the same time she lost her family because she went out of their decision and decided to marry this man on her own islam tells you to have a proper marriage contract you have to have the consent of the guardian you have to have the consent of the girl you have to have two witnesses and you have to have a dowry for the wife or the court excuse me why it's important to guardians approve again it is important because girls usually do not have the uh full not the same yes but the and the wise decision to determine if this person is suitable or not but sometimes guardians depend on personal troubles or something like that okay that's true and that is why the consent of the girl is also a muslim so if for example if if the father says to his daughter i want you to marry this gentleman and she says no he's older than i am i don't like him he's rich but he's not religious he said he says i insist she has all the right to say i refuse he cannot false you cannot force her but but if a woman finds a suitable husband who is pious religious rich handsome this usually is in paradise but let's assume that he's he exists he's on earth yes with a white horse prayerfully if he comes and the father insists on not to refuse him if he refuses him then the girl has all the right to go to the judge to the islamic judge in a courtyard and she complains to this and the fi and the and the judge brings the father and interrogates him why do you refuse this man if he does not give justifiable reasons the judge has all the right to override the guardian's decision and he gives this man to or gives this girl to this uh man okay so yeah i think if we have uh um for example the role of women in archaic ages like i'll take for example asma which supplies brother muhammad and um and her father and cave far away and more cave in the mountain i think if we compare that with today's contemporary society women how far the gap is you know in the past pastor as women were really women you know what i mean like men yeah and now there are more indulgences spoiled you know uh welfare life if we could compare between the arctic period women like azmab and bach and what is the analogous or the um the one who like her these days just a small comment if you please if i were to be a woman i would say well before you start comparing us to us compare yourself to the companions yeah so it's touching it's the same thing now it's a different generation different those had the crystal clear idol to follow next to them the prophet sallallahu assen them they had him coming in their houses he was there it's easy for you to hear his instructions and they had all the means to do this but they were more feminine than our females nowadays actually i'm concerned about the bringing up the way they brought up what i mean different from these days well this is easy if you look at a child that was brought up in that era but we're talking about females that reverted to islam that have been non-muslims for 30 or 40 years and then they've accepted islam yet they were transformed 180 degrees totally so it's not the upbringing only it's the belief of being a good muslim women at the time of the prophet had a very strong belief and it's it would be very unfair for us to generalize and say that nowadays our women are more likely to be men than women there is some truth to that but there are lots of women in nowadays time times that are extremely excellent examples that have been but usually unfortunately that is unfortunately at the same time women that set the best examples are in the shade because they are in their houses they're not exposed to the media those who expose them yes they're a minority those who are exposed to the media are usually the worst examples okay we'll take a report now and be back after it i think that under islam women have as many rights as to other religions and cultures and i think that that's important to realize and i think many people around the world are trying to focus on this now as an issue and try to bring that sort of recognition to the table where hopefully we can as a global society try to increase the rights of women under islam islam gave women a lot of rights that were previously in non-islamic times not given she has the right to own property she has the right to engage in business and i think the best way to correct an image about a certain topic in islam is by giving positive examples in the community by showing the positive attitudes of women in islam and their contributions to the society and this creates a good example for other muslims and the muslims to follow instead of talking theoretically by giving models in the community about successful women this will have a stronger impact on the audience and on the community in general back to just a point i wanted to touch upon some people who look at islam from the outside who are non-muslims for example or western countries be it whatever tend to say or believe that females in a muslim society are subordinate are at a second level to men be it in the home for example that the with their relationship with their husband that they should follow the orders of their husband that makes him less for example or in society at large could you correct that if i'm mistaken no i can't see no matter how you try your best to counter attack these allegations you'll end up doing nothing because it keeps on going and going and going their critique is not for the welfare of the of of women is for their own welfare this can be answered by the women themselves i could sit here for uh eternity telling you that everything is fine we're okay women are happy but i'm not their spokesman you have to ask women this question and to tell you the truth there is a difference between a man and a woman they're not equal in the sense of that a man and and his wife are equal she can do whatever she wants by leaving the house working with us she does have a say definitely this is this is this is not life if you have a wife in your house without any say this is a slave and not a wife she has a say as we citizens have a say in what our rulers do but our say does not mean at the end of the day it's going to be implemented it's just an opinion but is there is there a sense between for example the husband and the wife where there's a consultation for example with his wife or that she can have certain decisions to do with certain issues the problem is that the west looks at the problem without coming to the roots of it to be able to imagine what's happening you have to go into a muslim's house and interview the girls interview the women and you have to be a woman of course because a man interviewing this is unacceptable but yes this takes place i've i know a lot of women and i have daughters i have wives i've i have a mother i have a sister i have aunts and so on and we talk and they complain but never they have complained about islam because they're believers they know what their religion tells them to do and they know what the things they are not allowed to do so in this sense yes men as husbands or men as fathers have the upper hand over their wives and daughters but women as mothers have the upper hand over their sons so it goes here and there now she is controlled when she's a ma a wife or a daughter but she is controlling when she is a mother and a son cannot go out of her of his mother's will if she wants something else he has to do it this is allah's given right to mothers so it's not only one way growth it's two ways and i always give this as an example marriage is a boat if you have two captains the boats will sink because if i if i say uh uh up you say down if i say right you say left and and this would not go on there has to be one captain and there has to be a crew and the crew has all the right to say captain with all due respect you're going in the wrong direction the captain says none of your business this is what i'm gonna do and at the end of the day if the something wrong happens the crew has all the right to say ha ha i warned you that's gonna happen responsibilities okay muhammad um is it right for the woman to choose your job is it right for for a woman to have a job for example well okay so no not have a job let's tackle it first one to have a job because uh i think shikhasam will comment on that well see to choose a job this means that she has lots of jobs to choose from but this is not a problem the problem is is she allowed to work the answer would be depending on the situation the situation of her uh occupation so if she wants to work as a belly dancer then this is working not like this then okay as long as you refuse this this means that there is a level that you will not accept true yes okay now as muslims we have to know what is the level who draws the line is it me and you is it society or is it the quran then from here we can easily go on and move forward by saying ability dancer is not acceptable an actress is not acceptable maybe why so actress uh sometimes there are acting for a purpose i mean religious episodes and something yes you know okay i believe that's your best i exactly understand where you're coming from coming back to the red line okay who draws the red line does the actress work involves does actors work involved working with the opposite sex men that it has to be actors right yes there has to be a director with all due respect to the director yes yes there has to be uh sound engineers there has to be other men so this mixing in islam is forbidden mixing mixing with the opposite sex i cannot work with a woman because islam tells me you have to put a partition and i don't want to go but i think it's helpful it's good to clarify a few things allah azzawajal tells the companions such as abu bakr um whenever they want to ask something from the wives of the prophet house who are their mothers huh yes the wives of the prophets of uh the wives of the prophet are the mothers of them the believers so allah tells them whenever you want to ask something from the wives of the prophet ask it from beyond a petition and allah gives us the justification this is allah tells us that the reason because this is purer and cleaner to your hearts and to their hearts whose hearts is allah azza talking about the hearts of the companions and the hearts of the mothers of the believers the wives of the prophet allah is telling them to to communicate beyond uh or uh from behind or a partition or something why because the cleanliness of your hearts now nowadays if an actress works with an actor whose heart is in need of this cleanliness ours are the companions for god's sake definitely our hearts are more corrupt are more polluted and weak therefore the mixing of the opposite sexes is forbidden in islam which leads us to the point that actresses is not acceptable we come back to any other form of work okay what about uh i'm an accountant and she's an accountant and we're sharing the same office in the same desk again this leads to a lot of problems in prayer allah tells us the prophet tells us that the worst role of the congregation of men is at the very end and the worst straw of the congregation of females and women are the very beginning and the best are the very beginning for the men and the very end of women which means stay as fast as possible if wearing perfume for a woman is forbidden and is a major sin if touching when shaking hands a man a man to a woman is forbidden and is a major sin about taking hands in gloves or something like it's again same thing yeah same thing because the glove does not prevent you from or does not do something you cannot touch your face with a glove or touch or whatever with a glove because the same uh gravity of of sin is there this means and this leads us to the point is that a woman may work but you have to provide her with a proper working environment that is she has to be far away from men she can work in a hospital in in a hospital that is hospitalized completely for females that's hard everyday life okay i i think i'm going to say this and you have to contemplate a little bit onto it islam is a religion that is a frame and our life is a photograph the proper thing is to come and apply islam by putting the frame on our life and cut cutting whatever is on the edges now what you guys are trying to convince me off is trying to completely extract the frame okay we'll take a quick break now and then we continue after the break da la you mentioned just a few moments ago about the red line in terms of jobs for women or what to work or what not to wear do women work when there is a certain necessity i mean are there certain reasons why women should work and okay originally men are the one who should work who should do all the work and then that is why the men an edge over women because of what they support and sponsor their women with so they should even if in islam and this is one of the things why males why men are asking for their rights nowadays we nowadays are asking for our rights it's not the women asking for their rights in islam even if my wife is a multi-billionaire she is not obliged to pay one single cent to support the family or to support their house it's my problem even if i have a very low income it's not her problem she does she's not uh asked to pay anything though she's well off it is my responsibility to sponsor my wife so generally speaking the men are the ones who are supposed to do all the work women women's place is in her house to care and cater for her a husband and her children if there is a necessity or if there's a need or if she wants to fill up her time she has access time and she wants to utilize it she may work but she has to work with or under the conditions that islam allows her to do so okay um any of the other rights that do you want to talk about uh um yeah what about the um like if women have the right to vote in the policy life or something that's possible is that that's a political aspect of i believe that uh but because you know consists of women and men like if you are going to have a president or something you need the vote of a woman well again if you have one it's not gonna in islamic world yeah this is not it's not the situation yes it's not the determining case not even the votes of men would count because it's there love it or leave it you know you don't have a choice but in the so-called democratic countries in in the in the muslim world they do apply this and women have wouldn't have the ability to vote islamically speaking it is a controversial issue because those who have a say in how the the government or the state is run those uh have special characteristics to them so they have to be people of intelligence of uh highly qualified and it's called in arabic those who have a say so they have to usually be the generals the scholars the the top professors those who know what is good and what is not but if you come to a a a housewife of a farmer that does not know anything about anything and you show her a photograph of two people and say uh this one looks handsomer okay i'm gonna go for this and she votes for him and this may affect the voting system this is not acceptable those who are eligible to devote are those those are those who are qualified to do so okay let's move to another point um the issue of inheritance many people tend to look at the issue of inheritance from the islamic point of view that um women do not have the same right as men and that their be their rights are being taken away from them at least this is what some people on the outside tend to look at islam in that way what's what's the what's the doctrine behind that or what's the wisdom behind that the wisdom was not stated to us in the holy quran so we can make our best to figure it out but you may succeed and you may not inheritance was given to us by allah azza in the holy quran in four or five verses only that covers the whole inheritance and few hadiths also by the prophet and it tells us that every person in the family must take this portion whether he's a good son or a bad one whether she's a good daughter or a bad daughter you do not have the right as in the west to say well my son i'm not going to give him anything from my will and i'm going to give all my wealth and property to my favorite dog for example and you deprive your kids and and and those who you sponsor this is not your right this is allah's given right in the holy quran and he said that allah alone knows what's good for you and what's not therefore if a person dies everything is divided by inheritance in a an easy way of doing so the problem with inheritance again that some people think that it's only the daughter and the son in islam if a person dies and he has kids you know sons and daughters the son has twice the daughter so for example if he has one son and two daughters then the inheritance is divided by half to the son and quarter to each daughter and this is only with the children but in some instances they might be sisters and brothers and they are sharing the same thing in some instances the female gets more than the male himself for example if the mother uh is alive if the man dies and the mother is alive she inherits the third one third and the kids may get less than that or she inherits one-sixth depending on the presence the presence of of of of uh her husband who was the father or not and and so on so it is not something that was made up by man it's a revelation by the almighty and it has to be followed in this sense and no one has the the the the right to say why this is not my decision this was revealed 15 centuries ago and still exist as it is it's the only sacred book that was revealed with the original copy still intact okay the wisdom behind this doctrine may be inferred through the deduction that the the woman generally are not in charge of paying expenses of the household or something like that but man on the other hand is is in charge of and responsible uh to pay the expenses of all the house so jon george's george said that if the woman even if the woman is rich and well off but her husband is on the other hand is very poor when she when she gives anything as expenses for the house this is considered as something lent to the husband and he should repay she should repay it yes is that well it's if she gives it of her own without any agreement then it's it's not something that is uh lent it's not something out of our own will yes if yes if i'm poor and i ask my wife to lend me some money then yes but if she out of her own goes and buys something for the house or buys me a gift and then sends me the bill no this is not the case it's out of her own uh good will and and and this is accepted as a gift i i think this is an extravagant opinion but um it's still accepted you know some people may accept that type of opinion as well in the modern society you know the family there's they do not live together with with with an accountant next door you know saying that well i paid 50 so so for the groceries yesterday you have to reimburse me for that it it is easygoing yes if the man is in crisis financial crisis he seeks assistance from his wife then this is borrowing but if she on her own wants to buy a dress for tonight's party she's invited to a wedding and the husband doesn't have the money to do so he's not obliged to do so yes because he's obliged to sponsor her to support her to put the food on the table to buy her decent clothes but if she insists on accessorizing wearing gucci or photo for every you know weekend wedding she's invited to he has to be a very big crook to support that okay the issue of polygamy or number of wives again this is one of the issues that certain people look at it as though this is um taking away the right of a wife what what's your say in that are you married no i'm not doing nothing i had to have my reservations before going this is a very uh um critical situation but it's it's very easy polygamy has been there since god knows when the messengers of allah all had more than one wife abraham for example had two wives the mother of isaac who is the father of jacob who is israel and all the prophets of messengers of the sons of israel come of his descendant and he had a hajjar who is the mother of ishmael who is the grand grand grandfather of our prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam he had two wives david had lots of wives some narrations say that he had one thousand wives and he was a prophet and a king solomon had a hundred wives yes and and some nurses said no he had a little bit more than that so all the messengers of allah had more than one wife and polygamy is a very important thing in life because by looking at the current situation men die not because of women but women are one of the causes men die more than women and you have the rate of women more than men men especially associate themselves in wars car accidents they're careless drivers compared to women so they say uh they die because of blood pressure um uh heart diseases whatever never nothing happens to them they're always you know safe and and never sorry they're always intact women you know it's not islamic to say touch wood but there's but this is the situation so you end up at the end of the day with more women than men so if you give every man a woman you have a surplus and by nature women must look for admiration so if they don't have a husband they have to put on where where the makeup they have to put their perfume on and then try to look as beautiful as possible you are faced with a problem here like germany after the second world war germany like iraq like iran like bosnia like chechnya like everywhere you call you you name it we have the problem here so to encounter this problem allah has given us the choice to marry more than one woman this is not only for sexual pleasure and this is the worst thing that a man could think of because it is a lifetime and and it's it's a house that is built on marriage and love not only on sex okay we've got a report now about polygamy and after the report we'll continue with something that i think is very misunderstood i come from a culture where that's not really an issue that we look at very often um to be honest the benefits of polygamy are something that i do not understand i think that looking at a relationship between a man and a woman usually that relationship i think is best served when it's one-on-one because you get to know the person as much as possible you get to serve that person as they serve you and to me that's the important factor about a relationship so whether that can be done in a in a polygamous relationship is something that i just i just don't know polygamy is is something that is permissible in islam and in fact in some occasions the prophet muhammad encouraged uh to have more than one wife but we could always differ on why islam prescribed uh polygamy as like in certain in certain situations where there's war or like whereas a woman is just cannot have children and so the man wants to have other uh like another wife so that he can have children uh but in general like one should always treat all his wife's fear and avoid any injustice or leaning towards one wife over another if we apply polygamy in a certain manner it may be a solution to a lot of problems in the whole world like for example in countries where the the number of women are much more than the number of men and due to wars and certain things that are going on we find out that polygamy would be a good solution for certain cases in the community you just mentioned a moment ago about the wisdom or the reason behind polygamy but is it something that's advisable is it something that's preferable is it something that's um okay for everybody kind of thing uh islamically speaking it depends on the situation allah azzawajal has allowed us to have a second or more wife providing that we are fair so if you cannot be fair then it is forbidden for you to marry another wife and this fairness is interpreted in the sense of supporting both families equally and spending the uh enough time with both on equal basis so it you you may not spend three nights with this one because you love her you like her and one night with the other one you have to give three nights to three nights you have to give them a proper shelter you have to support them equally so if you buy this one address you have to buy the other one address if you give this one pocket money uh so and so you have to give the other one as as much but what is considered to be a necessity or need it's a different story for example if you take the one this one to the to the hospital and you pay a a thousand dollars for her operation you don't necessarily have to go unless you break her legs then that's a different situation do you have to have consent of your first wife to marry a second one then he would never ever marry at the core no the consent is not a prerequisite and it's not even a condition but and i don't recommend that you take her consent uh unless you are determined to do so a lot of the brothers make the mistake of you know uh talking to the wives saying i'm gonna get married soon soon i'm gonna look for a gorgeous woman and get married too uh she has to be blonde she has to be blue-eyed uh she has to be better than you well-educated more than you and he does not have the intention to do so he's just teasing her this is forbidden this is completely out of the question it's like slaughtering a sheep with a dull knife slowly it's not going to work because but he's going to inflict so much pain on on on the wife if you want to get married get all the things together you know weigh the pros and cons praise the hara and then go ahead with it tell her ahead of time a day or two or so that my mind is done my mind is made i have to make this and go ahead with it but to prepare her without having anything concrete is torture and you may not do this and again what is the decision behind your marriage marriage is not an easy ride yeah it's nothing that you do and you know well it's it's i don't want to drink cola i want to drink another orange juice or whatever it's fun you know no it's not it's a responsibility as the prophet tells us that if a person has two wives and he prefers one over the other financially or whatever he will come on the day of judgment with side of his face you know uh almost melting or uh leaning uh to the other side and people would know that this guy has two wives and he's not fair to them so it's it's it's a serious uh issue okay um actually i have um i have heard i um i'm sorry for uh for hearing repeatedly the attacks on islam uh as a predicate that islam is belittling belittling the position of the woman i have something which is admirable to mention to you that once i i read in the holy quran in the chapter of divorce and it was a very fantastic piece of information that the existence or explanation of this verse is as follows if the women feed uh your babies breastfeed that is yes breastfeed your babies i give them a fee for that though they are their children yes yes it's not oh yeah even if they are their children this is in in in in the case of divorce once the divorce takes place and the mother or the the divorcee is separated from her husband but she is still caring for her child but this she has to receive something from the the husband who divorced her because of this breast feeding and again i'd like to comment on uh why the west looks so down at polygamy in so many countries it's forbidden to have two wives in the states in europe you have only one wife registered in a civil court or in in as a civil marriage the other one is not registered so and and sometimes they can sue you because of that it's very awkward because if i have 10 girlfriends that i'm living with at the same time this is acceptable but to have this as legal marriage with legal kids and everybody knows about it it's not in the hiding this is forbidden islam tells you no you have the power to do this you have the urge and need to do this your wife can be sick can be ill can be occupied with caring for her parents can be working and and you have the need for that you may get married again rather than go and cheat on your wife so polygamy is the answer to all the west's problems and i know lots of people who are living in the west with their you know black book or blue book with all the names and numbers of of uh whatever he is in that state or that city he calls an ex-friend an ex-associate and he spends the night a one-nighter or so on in islam this is completely unacceptable you want to have a relationship have it within the constitution of uh uh uh of the institution of marriage this is everyone knows about it it's open to all i think that's the difference between us and the west society the um they won't be delivered from responsibility like we have dozens of girlfriends has been a great chance for them but if two more wives that's going to be a lot of responsible for the men and that is why marriage is about responsibility because they want to be away from the legal bonding another point is the issue of us projecting ourselves us as muslims i mean projecting the image that sometimes there's a projected image that women are as i mentioned before subordinate level or they're not taking their rights are we in a sense to blame at all for something like that i mean that foreigners or westerners or whatever look at us that see examples let's say they're minority examples they're small examples that women are not having the right so should we play a role in showing the true way or i think that we should enlighten people of the situation and tell them what islam really is now they have a lot of critique about us they don't give us a chance to say what we think about them for example if you open any satellite channel news channel from the west you'll find out that the man is properly dressed from neck to toe while the woman is exposed the more she exposes herself wearing a very mini skirt where showing her cleavage and and exposing herself then she is more famous than the other what happens if the thing was reversed what happens if the man comes with a a nice t-shirt or a short and the woman comes in veil they will ban this a channel why because this is not what they want they want women to be exposed and that is why in commercials they always present women as nude as possible and the sexier they are the better the commercial is but you never you rarely see men coming in commercials exposing their bodies why is that because all the temptation lies in a a woman a woman's body so islam respects women islam cares for women while the west does not but we should project the way that we that women's role really is or the rights that women have definitely yeah i'd like to thank you
