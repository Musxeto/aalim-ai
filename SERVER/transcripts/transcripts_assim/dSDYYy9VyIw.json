  "transcript": "[Applause] [Music] [Music] all [Music] [Applause] alhamdulillah last time we met we were discussing chapter 78 of the Quran and the last verse we discussed was verse 17 verse verily the day of decision is a fixed time and Allah explains to us what will happen on that day Allah says in Ayah 18 the day when the trumpet will be blown and you shall come forth in crowds in groups so there will be two blows in in the trumpet one that would end life and the second would resurrect everyone from their graves and they should come in crowds and who is responsible for blowing the trumpet it is the Angel by the name of israil the Prophet wasam told us about this particular angel that he has put the trumpet in his mouth anticipating Allah's order to blow in it and he does not blink so that he would not miss a split of a second to execute Allah's orders so Allah tells us that on that day this is the day of decision when the trumpet would be blown and you shall come forth in crowds in groups and part of what would happen on that horrific day is verse 19 Allah says so the first sign of global change well let me rephrase that of universal change not Global the first is that the gates of the heavens and the heavens shall be opened and it will become Gates so Allah is telling us that there will be cracks that there will be openings until it becomes into pieces this Perfection that we see above us would all change and there are so many different verses describing what would happen to the skies above us in this one Allah tells us it would become like open doors it would become into pieces so that everyone would come and enter from it in a way that we do not understand and Allah says after that on that horrific day the mountains shall be moved away from their places what would move such a big huge mountains that is millions of tons in weight well they shall be moved from their places and they will be as if they were a mirage and this is when they are blasted and they're flattened where it is made of soft particles that is so soft that it would fly away and move out as if it's a mirage something that you cannot hold on to and Allah on that day tells us that that truly hell is a place of Ambush hell on that day is going to anticipate is going to wait for those who will come near it and will fall into it and we know that there's a bridge on Hell known as the path and the description of it is so scary and intimidating that it is as sharp as a blade and as thin as a hair and every believer or someone who claims to be a believer they must pass over that bridge so Idol worshippers will not pass they will be thrown from the very beginning into hell those who used to worship people those who used to worship messengers of Allah Asel those who disbelieved in the message of the prophets and Messengers would be thrown into hell the only people remaining would be the Believers or those who claim to be the Believers among the Hypocrites so the Muslims would be there the people who believed in Jesus as the messenger of Allah when he came to them will be there the people who followed Moses until the time of Jesus because after the time of Jesus they must have followed Jesus and if they did not they would be considered disbelievers so the people from the time of Moses onwards till the time of Jesus will be there and then people would start to walk on that bridge it would be pitch dark and people would be given light in accordance to their deeds so if people had great Deeds they will have spotlights that would show them the way and they cannot miss it and those who had little Good Deeds they will have little light and the least of them would have a light in his toe and this is the least and they will vary in their speed Crossing that bridge some of them would be as fast as Lightning others would be as fast as the wind others would be as fast as a person riding a very fast horse others would be riding a camel others would be jogging others would be walking others who are little in Good Deeds would be walking and crawling walking and crawling and those who are unfortunate those who have sins those who have problems they would walk and then they get hooks coming taking them and making them fall they will trip and fall into hell beware truly hell is a place of Ambush and who is it going to Ambush Allah says a dwelling place for the those who transgress the boundaries the limits said by Allah like the pothus the disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah the Hypocrites the Sinners the criminal criminals so these are all kinds of transgression and it has so many forms the more you transgress the more you will be likely to be ambushed by hell and the worst kind of transgression is when you transgress against others in their wealth in their livelihood or in their health and blood so the more you transgress in these things the more you are likely to be ambushed and Enter Hell the prophet Alam in his farewell Haj he told the people that your wealth and your life that is your blood and your reputation and honor all these three things are Haram on one another you cannot transgress you you cannot see a beautiful car with your neighbor and you steal it from him you cannot hate someone and kill him or shed his blood you cannot backbite people or attack their honor or transgressed against their families against their wives and daughters Etc all of this is made forbidden and the more you have this the more you will go to hell and no matter how hard you try every time you try to get out you will go back to it over and over again but for how long Allah says which means that they will abide therein for ages they'll be stuck there for ages and this made people wonder are they going to be there for ages and then eventually they will come out and go to paradise the answer is no this Believers will be in Hell For Eternity they will be there forever every time an age is over another age begins and so on till eternity so it is torment and Punishment forever and likewise those who are blessed to go to paradise would be there forever as well now this is when it comes to Believers and disbelievers what about if we have sinful Believers in this case they will go to hell for a specific number of hours days years centuries Allah knows depending on their aggression or transgression depending on their sins they're Muslims in principle they have the shahada they have their submission they have their surrendering of their will to Allah's will but they are sinful what will happen to them this is what we will try to go through inshallah after the break so stay tuned asalamu alaykum and welcome back so we have people in health forever we have people in Paradise forever but there are believers who are sinful and those who enter Paradise must be purified from their sins and they cannot enter Paradise without purification therefore if Allah wills it they would have to enter hell and they would be purified from their sins they would have to pay for their sins and after they're purified Allah would admit them to Paradise there are people whom Allah would forgive their sins but no one can guarantee to be among those and that is why we should ask Allah Asel for his forgiveness we should repent before it's too late and we should express our true and sincere remorse so that Allah Asel would forgive us so Janam Hellfire the people who have transgressed they will be there for ages Without End Allah says now let's go into some of the torment some of the punishment of Allah to the people of Hell Allah says nothing cool shall they take taste therein nor any drink so Allah says that there isn't anything for them to cool off with and nothing for them to drink that would bring coolness to them sometimes when you're fasting you can't drink a cold drink with ice in it however when it's cool you at least can enjoy the coolness of it to reduce the Heat this is not applicable in Hellfire it is torture so neither they can get cold from cool things nor they can drink to relieve them from their thirst and from their heat however we know that they will be given something to drink and Allah Asel tells us that in the Quran by saying so they should not taste coolness nor drink except boiling water this is H and not only that you'll be giving another drink and that drink is the dirty wound discharges and by far this is horrible torment and honorable punishment and one would say why is it so hard why is it so painful why is it so much that they're being punished in hell and the answer would be as Allah says in Ayah 26 an exact recompense according to their evil crimes so they are are being punished because of what they had done and they would say what had we done what have we done we didn't do anything wrong and Allah says to us yes you've done that Allah says in the Quran in Ayah 27 now this was your biggest mistake that for verily they use not to look for Reckoning and the majority of of people are like this we live our lives we go to bed we wake up we do so many things during the daytime and during the night time and we go to bed and sleep and we wake up not knowing that we will be held accountable on the day of judgment this is something we don't think of all what we care about is how much do I make at the end of the week how much is my paycheck the did I manage in getting the most beautiful girl in town to be my wife or to be my girlfriend did I have a good time did I succeed in cheating someone off his wealth or did I manage to lie my way up in the pay grade did I get a good position did I do this did I do that what about what you will get on the day of judgment what about the things you're going to be held accountable for nobody thinks of that unfortunately for verily they use not to look for a reckoning and this is how we all unfortunately do we don't believe in it maybe we dare not say it but actually we don't believe in it that is why we sin and sin and continue to sin till the day we die about 20 years ago a friend of my brother-in-law came to visit and he was going to study to become a pilot so he was going to the US long before 911 alhamdulillah good for him and he came to my house so I was giving him advice and telling him you're like my younger brother take care of yourself don't sin watch out people there would love to get you into nightclubs Etc so be careful preserve your Salat and do this do that so I gave him a friendly sermon a reminder and then the guy said listen I'm going to be frank with you Sheikh now if I do what you're telling me to do and reframe from all the things that are entertaining and nice and stick to praying and doing things that are hard to do as you say but then after I die and I want to go to paradise I discovered that all of this was a myth it wasn't there so what did I gain I wasted a perfectly 60 years of my life being Pious and righteous only to end up with no Paradise we fooled you end of the game wouldn't that be a tragedy I looked him in the eyes and I said indeed it would but look at it the other way way around what would happen if you don't pray and if you don't abide by the Quran and the Sunnah and you play around and you have every single night a one night stand and you drink whiskey and intoxicant and you enjoy life to the fullest as they say only to end up dying and once you die you've done so many wrong things take him to hell how would you feel then and the man looked down and said hm I didn't think of it this way said yes because Shan only makes you think of one way look around you look in this universe look in your body the Perfection that Allah has created you and created the universe definitely point you to his Direction and that he is the creator only to be worshiped no one else if you look at the Quran if you Ponder upon it you will understand and you will believe that Allah is the Creator and Allah is the one who revealed the Quran to his messenger and the religion of Islam is the only religion accepted in the sight of Allah therefore because of that you have to believe that there is a Day of Reckoning and alhamdulillah the man obviously understood what I meant and he was convinced of what I had said may Allah guide him and us to the right path therefore because of their disbelief in in the existence of the Day of Reckoning this is why they're being punished so severely and Allah says but they be lied our ayat completely they belide our verses of the Quran and aat has two meanings it means the universal signs so the sun is an Ayah is a sign the Moon is a sign the universe is a sign there are so many signs of Allah around us so many aat and it also has a different and another meaning which refers to the verses of the Quran and those disbelievers they Bei both so the sun this was created by Mother Nature the universe this is something that happened by coincidence by chance there's nothing behind it and they also be lied the verses of the Quran they rejected The Messengers they rejected the prophets they rejected the books the Divine books of Allah and the Miracles that he had sent so Allah tells them and all things we have recorded in a book everything that you do is recorded in a book that leaves not a single aot and that is why the disbelievers when they are shown their records on the day of judgment they said what is this they say why is everything recorded every single small and big thing is recorded nothing that we had said nothing that we had done is missed Allah has recorded it but they had forgotten it so many times someone reminds you you remember a couple of years ago you did this and that you said I don't remember well Allah remembers and not only that Allah Asel has it in a book that you would see on the day of judgment and then your punishment would be as Allah says in the Quran so taste you the result of your evil actions no increase shall we give you except in torment this verse we will pause upon it inshallah and we will elaborate a little bit more next time we meet and until then for [Music]"
