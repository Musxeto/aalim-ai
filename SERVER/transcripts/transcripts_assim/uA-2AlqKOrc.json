  "transcript": "sohe says my father loses his temper too soon and this is very often I get mad at him for yelling for no reason how can I help him stay calm and also how can I control myself when he loses his temper so going back to sue has questioned that my father loses his temper too soon and this is very often now rage and losing your temper and getting angry quickly these are all defects shortcomings things that must be fixed and unfortunately as human beings we are filled with shortcomings that need to be fixed and we acknowledge of them yet I've noticed that many of us don't put the effort to fix themselves so now we have a problem we have a father and a daughter the daughter is justifying her own rage against her father by her father's mistakes and this is a vicious loop a vicious circle so why are you bad because he was bad why is he bad because she made me bad and we will never ever end who came first the chicken or the egg we have to know obligations duties and rights your father is a father he's not your sibling he's not your son he's not your colleague he is a father which means that he has so many rights that you cannot overlook so if he becomes angry if he becomes upset if he loses his time / if he says abusive words as a daughter you must be dutiful kind obedient and respectful but he's abusing me he's doing this he's doing that do you have no excuse first of all avoid the things that make him lose his temper avoid the things that make him angry and even if he is unjustly angry and loses his temper keep and maintain your cool because at the sight of Allah you are sinful big time if you retaliate or express your disapproval of what he's doing or your anger or your resentment you're doomed so first of all work on yourself our problem inflates if we start looking at other people's faults and turning a blind eyes eye to our own faults so yes he has this and that she has this in that okay what do you have oh no no I don't have anything me I may have shortcomings but this is not of great importance let us fix other people this is wrong and this shows how weak man is how vulnerable to Shaitaan messing up with his mind misinterpretation where the oppressor feels oppressed why are you invading this country and killing its people because I feel that I have to do something I have to act so now he's justifying his oppression due to any other reason that would make him go to bed and sleep but this does not change the facts so you need to get your act together he's your father try to advise him when he's in a good mood definitely avoid anything that would make him lose his temper definitely do not even express any type of resentment or disapproval of what he is doing may allah azzawajal guide us through the straight path"
