  "transcript": "from bangladesh unfortunately cheating and exams has become very common here even brothers who appear to be practicing with full beards and other acts even they seem to neglect this prohibition could you give us all a reminder inshaallah first of all don't be deceived by the looks because the looks can give you an indication not necessarily the reality secondly no one is perfect and no one is infallible only the prophets and messengers peace be upon them are infallible all the rest may make mistakes so don't judge people by a mistake or more they had committed thirdly we have to weigh the pros and cons a person who looks practicing has a good beard wears his trousers above the ankles prays five times in the first row in the masjid memorizes a great chunk of the quran gives in charity gives dawah gives reminders does his level best to become a practicing muslim but he has flaws and shortcomings welcome to the club aren't we all this type of man and this is why subhanallah when allah azzawajal mentions the name of the prophets and messengers he mentions a great deal of them at the end he says those o muhammad whom allah guided so upon their guidance you should follow the prophet was not commanded to follow them personally rather to follow their guidance why because their guidance is totally perfect they themselves are humans so there might be something that we're not requested or required to follow so the strength of prophet musa and his ability to fight is not something that we are recommended to do whenever someone speaks to us punch them or uh put them pin them to the ground and this means that if we were to ponder and reflect upon this ayah we will understand that if a person is an imam of a masjid it doesn't mean that if he did something small that is wrong or sinful that we should stop praying behind him it's not one hundred percent or zero percent there are shades of gray that we have to look into we have to be fair so if these students are trying their level best to practice they stay away from free mixing with women they lower their gaze they try to read the quran but they fall weak this is sinful we do not endorse or condole this or take it for granted we say this is sinful you guys are misrepresenting the the dean you are tarnishing the reputation of islam but you're still good brothers and i love you for the sake of allah for the good things you do but you have to fear allah you have to elevate your iman to reach the stage of perfection or nearby this is what's is that this is what is meant by fabihuda in their guidance you should follow not in them personally so you see a scholar for example and you see you learn good things from him take the good yeah but the sheikh i once saw him in an inappropriate position okay don't tarnish everything and cancel all the good in him because a shortcoming or a flaw that he did we're all human so my reminder to them remain steadfast don't cheat you're representing islam always remember that you're accountable by allah who's watching you and my advice to you and the likes of you ignore their flaws and shortcomings and focus on the good things that they have give them a reminder every now and then and also pray to them uh uh when you are in sujud and at the times of uh prayers where uh when they are answered and allah is most forgiving most merciful you"
