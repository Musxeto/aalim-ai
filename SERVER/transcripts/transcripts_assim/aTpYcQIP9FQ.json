  "transcript": "her third question is a bit confusing but it seems if I understood it correctly that she is suffering from being unable to concentrate whenever she sits and opens the Koran to memorize she gets thoughts and Shaitaan whispers to her that disables her from being able to memorize the Quran she so she says what to do there isn't much for you to do it's more than trying to empty your heart see your heart is a vessel you fill it up with things that are not related to pour on to Islam - loving allah azza wajal you will not find place for them so our hearts usually are filled with so many permissible and also unfortunately prohibited things so you get people with their hearts filled with music watching movies gossiping hatred - people Envy etc you get people their hearts are filled with thinking of work of a home chores of the children what to do the study so much so many things to do so you have to empty your heart a bit so you can get this concentration and focus and this needs training needs a lot of dora in your salute that Allah enables you to be able to do that it might also need good company sometimes if I try to memorize the Quran on my own I fail miserably but if I choose a buddy a friend a wife and I try to memorize and revise to her or to him this makes things much easier and this is why praying in the message it in the congregation it's much easier than praying alone because you get used to it doing it with the majority fasting Ramadan with the majority going for Hajj with the majority of Muslims makes the easy for you and Allah knows best"
