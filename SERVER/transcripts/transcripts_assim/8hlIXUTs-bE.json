  "title": "Which animal is better to sacrifice for Eid (Qurbani/ Udhiyah): Camel, Cow or Sheep? - Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "I'm Ron says which animal is best to slaughter on the day of Eid a sheep or a camel and why now we know that it is a highly recommended Sunnah for those who can offer the sacrifice known as the ODE bah√≠a and some scholars say that it is mandatory upon those who are financially rich so when it comes to a person who is capable financially some scholars say it is mandatory but the majority of scholars say that it is a highly recommended pseudonym so naturally our killer and we know that a man can sacrifice a sheep or a goat on behalf of himself and all those who are dependent on him especially those who live under his roof and each from an eat from his kitchen so even if a person has like a father who has four or five sons living in the same house grandchildren wives and they all share the food from his own kitchen and from what he provides for them one sheep would suffice for them or 1/7 of a cow or of a camel meaning that I along with six other people can share a camel or can share a cow instead of each one of us sacrificing a sheep so one cow is equivalent to seven sheep one camel is equivalent to one to seven sheep so now the question of mine is which is better to sacrifice a cow a camel or a sheep scholars say that the Prophet Allah is thought of sallam sacrificed a sheep for himself and on behalf of his family and this means that this is the best to do however when these scholars looked at the permission to share in a cow or in a camel with 1/7 they said that definitely offering a whole ship is better than sharing one seventh in a cow or a camel but if I were to sacrifice a whole cow that would be far more beneficial in terms of price in terms of meat in terms of the food that the poor would get in this case yes a cow or a camel is better than one sheep providing I do not share it with anyone but if I'm going to have a seventh of the cow or a camel in this case a sheep is far better because this was the doing of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam"
