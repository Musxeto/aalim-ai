  "transcript": "Ben from algers my question is like if someone moed Islam and there was there so is it permissible to to advise him like kindly like smileing his face and just say that this is Haram and should or should I be like I should be harsh with him no you should not be harsh unless harshness is rewarded by sh so the prophet used softness and kindness and also used harshness he used harshness in very particular incidents where his companions were knowledgeable and close to him and would not be negatively affected like in the case of Abu may Allah be pleased with him when he said to B you are a son of a black woman which is a racist comment the prophet said you are a man of ignorance when he took the ring the golden ring from one of his companions and tossed it and he said why would anyone of you go to a stone of fire and put it in his hand he didn't tell him softly or kindly you know he took it off his hand and threw it on the ground when he addressed abdah may Allah be pleased with them when he came with clothes dyed with zaffron he said did your mom order you to do this Abdullah was shocked and said should I wash them off he said no burn them this type of quote unquote harshness is to teach and to reprimand someone who is under the prophet Alam who would accept what the prophet says your harshness to someone in your level or above you would not be you taken or accepted nicely it may have consequences that are bad it may backfire so when someone mocks the religion don't be harsh and you're a cafir you're this you that you lose you did not prove a point everybody in the room would say this guy is an extremist I hope he's not from the Nic and will kill us but at the same time don't smile and laugh on the J yeah you're right but this is mocking the religion you shouldn't do this no keep keep a straight face and say this is disrespectful to the religion Allah says in verse number 65 and 66 in chapter 9 and if you were to ask them they would say we were just playing around and and and having fun say is it by Allah by his signs and by the messenger you are mocking and ridiculing don't apologize you have committed kufur after IM this is what Allah says in the Quran so what you're doing is serious be careful that's polite that's said with a straight face and that is better than being harsh or rude or swearing at them and making a scene out of it"
