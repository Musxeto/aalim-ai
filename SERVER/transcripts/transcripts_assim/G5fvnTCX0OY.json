  "title": "Covering the feet during prayer (for women) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so brother asif from saudi arabia's asking on or about the ruling of covering the feet for women when they're praying in their homes it's an issue of dispute some scholars say that it was the norm for people for women especially to pray in their homes without covering their feet and we don't have specifically an instruction to do so and she was named in Tamia and I think abou Hani feh also as well before him say that this is permissible however the vast majority of scholars acknowledge the fact that a woman must cover her body except to her face and to her hands that is it which means that even her feet must be covered and this is the most authentic opinion whether in public or in the privacy of her home she has to cover her feet in public if she adopts the opinion that obligates face covering then she has to cover the face as well if there are none maja man looking but when it comes to the feet she has to cover them whether in public or in private and covering them can be through wearing socks and it also can be by wearing an outer garment that is so long that it covers her feet while in the standing position the sole of her feet are exempted when she performs sujood because this is something that cannot be covered with a long garment otherwise it would be difficult for her to stand and to sit as well and Allah so JAL knows best"
