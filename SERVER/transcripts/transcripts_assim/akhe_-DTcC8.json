  "title": "When my phone glitched, friend said it's as if Allah doesn't want us to talk & laughed, kufr? assim",
  "transcript": "if I'm talking to someone on the phone and the phone starts glitching and when it gets fixed they say something like it's as if God doesn't want this to happen or it's as if God doesn't want us to talk and then they chuckled did they commit kufur and what should I tell this person no this is not kufur this is a possibility but it is inappropriate to say such things because everything is a possibility that Allah wills it or does not will it wants it to happen or not want it to happen and we don't have any knowledge of this so it is totally inappropriate to speak about Allah in such a fashion and to giggle or to laugh about it but I hope it is not to the extent of kuur"
