  "title": "What if a person makes 2 or more mistakes that require Sujood As Sahu Before and After Salam? - JAL",
  "transcript": "[Sheikh: .. from Germany.] [(Questioner): \nSheikh, my question about Sujood As-Sahw. It   was said that, when a person \nmade a mistake, he should   do Sujood As-Sahw before salaam, and when he \nadds something - do Sujood As-Sahw after salaam.   But what if the person both made a mistake in \nthe prayer and added something to prayer. Should   he do both, Sujood As-Sahw before salaam and \nSujood As-Sahw after salaam, or is one of them   sufficient?] [Sheikh: Okay, I will answer \nyou, in sha Allah.] (Questioner) from Germany   asks a frequently asked question. 'I made two \nor more mistakes in the same prayer. One of   them requires that I offer two sujood before \nsalaam, the other requires that I offer sujood   of forgetfulness after salaam. So should I \nperform both before and after? The answer is   'No'. No matter how many mistakes you do, \nyou only make one set of Sujood As-Sahw.   And the majority say that, \nyou say it before salaam,   so that it would be included in the prayer \nitself. Offer your salaam and that would be it."
