  "transcript": "from Hassan and Hassan says if a person is born in a non-muslim family how is it how is it his fault for being brought up as a non-muslim and why would he be thrown in hell for this to answer your question Hass we have to acknowledge number one Allah is fair Allah is just so there is no way for Injustice to be inflicted upon that individual agree of course you can't disagree because if you do you'll be thrown in Hell For Eternity Allah doesn't put Injustice upon people so we have full conviction that Allah would treat everybody justly this is why such a question could not come up because if that individual who was born in a non-muslim environment or family would was not led to Islam did not hear about Islam had no knowledge of it then on the day of judgment Allah would test them but if he had the chance and he rejected it if he heard about Islam and did not research it though inherently each and every human being has this urge to worship Allah alone not knowing how but they have it inherently in them it's installed in them with their DNA so if they fail to fulfill that they hear about the Quran they hear about Islam they hear about the Muslims they see how they pray they see their highly moral conduct and behavior and ethics there's so many things to praise about them but they shrug their shoulders and move on they don't want to in this case they have to pay the price for that and Allah Knows Best"
