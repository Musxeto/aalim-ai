  "transcript": "omama from saudi arabia sent us an email saying that my husband has his own house where his parents and sisters stay and an empty land and several flats which he has rented kindly advise and explain in which property does he needs to pay zakat we've stated this before and we've said that zakat is dependent on the category that it should be paid so you have four categories that you have to pay zakat for if you understand them if you believe them then you insha allah would not need to ask questions about zakah in the future the four categories that scholars say are as follows gold and silver gold and silver and whatever falls under this category such as currency euros dollars etc you have to pay zakat for that the second category is whatever comes out of the ground in forms of vegetation that can be weighed so in this uh and can be stored as well so we have dates we have uh raisins that we have wheat we have uh cereals all of these can be weighed or can be contained and can be stored you have zakah for this the third category is the cattle camels cows sheep and the likes if they feed on an open prairie so you have to pay zakah as well and the last and fourth category is things that are displayed for sale so things that you buy and sell goods then they have you have to pay zakat for them these are the four things four categories so if a person says okay i have a car do i have to pay the car i would look into these four categories it's not money and it's not cattle and it's not vegetation or something that comes from the ground plants or whatever and it's not something for sale so no i don't have to pay the car do i have to pay the car my clothes same thing my watch my pen my house my furniture the same thing so we go to omama's question her husband has his own house does he pay the car if we look at the four categories we say no we don't okay uh he has an empty land let's look at this empty land why does he have an empty land if she says that well he buys lands and he sells them and he makes like five percent profit on each land he buys and sells and he keeps on doing this six seven times a year and in this case it falls under the fourth category which are items displayed for sale goods so yes he has to pay the car but if she says no he bought it like five ten years ago and it was a good deal and he does not know maybe he's going to build the house maybe he's going to keep it so that his or our children would inherit it he doesn't know what to do with it and in this case there is no zakah for that because it does not fall under the four category she says that he has several flats and he rents these apartments if i have something that is for rent it is there is no zakat because it's not one of the four categories this means that i could have a company or i can own myself four or five buildings and i'm renting these buildings leasing them and i'm getting money and these five buildings cost a million euros so do i have to pay the car for a million euro the answer is no because it is neither money it is not cattle it is not something that's coming from the ground and it is not something that is for sale it is for rent but when i get the rent and a whole year passes on this rent then i have to give zakat for it 2.5 of what i have imagine i spent all the money and a whole year did not pass there's no zakah imagine i have a hundred cars and i'm renting these cars on daily basis and whenever i get the revenue and whenever i get money from such rentals i pay back the installments to the company so maybe i'm generating a hundred thousand or 500 000 euros a year but i'm not keeping a single penny do i have to give zakat the answer is no because what comes goes and you don't have any savings so if you understand this these four categories and you know what falls under them you inshaallah would would not need to ask this question again"
