  "transcript": "so Sheikh my father gave me a savings account in a Commercial Bank and it has been more than four years so I knew that diva is Haram so I decided to give away the Reba money but now it struck me that the river contract itself is also Haram so I told them not to give me any more interest and I also decided that I will close my account so when I asked my father he said that closing an account can take from like two hours to a long time depending on the situation since I have exams going on and my exams will finish by two days will I be sinful if I close the account after two days are you able to take the interest out from your account check I will and I will give them all but no no no no why why give them all if your father opened a saving account with 100 dollars this is a Halal hundred dollars the Haram is what the bank deposits on top of that so if you go and you find that it's a hundred and ten dollars all what you have to do is cleanse your wealth from the ten dollars which is Haram and dispose of it into poor and and needy Muslims and everything else is halal why give away Halal things this is not logical so what I'm saying is are you able to calculate the Haram money and take it out and give it to the poor I will but the Reba contract is already made so I have to so like I know I've read in Islam QA that I have to close the account because it's a savings account and it's in a commercial Bank not not an Islamic plan do you have another Islamic alternative uh I'm thinking of closing it and then making an Islamic account there's no problem no problem if you wait two days three days until you have time there is no sin on you inshallah"
