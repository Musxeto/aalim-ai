  "transcript": "a fan says if I performed Umbra in Ramadan we'll all my major and minor sins be forgiven even sure can cover we have answered this before and again Ramadan to Ramadan rumburak to Umbra would expiate what's between them providing it is not major sins so yes the answer it would erase your minor sense however major sins require repentance so if you perform Umrah without repenting from a major sin it will not be forgiven or erased but if you repent and then go for your ambra Allah would erase it and forgive it as for shirk and cover of course if a person goes to Umbra while in the state of share can cover he's not a Muslim Allah will not accept this from him if someone goes to Amara while having the conviction and belief that it is the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam who runs the universe he believes that the Prophet knows the unseen he believes that the prophet Aristotle Salam is alive at the moment and he runs the universe as he is however another as if he's looking at the palm of his hand this is kufur he's mixing up the Prophet assembled Allah only Allah does this so if he makes homra if he makes Hajj he's a disbeliever he says la ilaha illallah yet he contradicts it with his conviction and his belief so definitely this person's Remora would not benefit him by the fee before going to Umbra he goes back to tow he believes in the oneness of allah azza wajal in his lordship worship and his beautiful names and attributes firmly believing that only allah azzawajal brings such benefits and has such knowledge and power then he makes the Umbra then this would erase what before that insha Allah who as ocean"
