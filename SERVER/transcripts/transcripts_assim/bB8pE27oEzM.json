  "title": "Etiquette of using Miswak Can we use it in public In front of other people, meetings assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question for today is uh what are the etiquet of using mwat is it inappropriate to use it in the Masjid or in the street in front of people do we use uh our right or left hand there are many eates for using the miswak but none to my knowledge is part of the Sunnah so the prophet used to do this this is a miswak and he used to brush his teeth and he used to extensively do this and he recommended brushing our teeth whenever we want to perform Wu whenever we want to uh pray before praying and when also a person enters his home to meet his wife Etc he should have a nice uh um pleasant smell to his mouth this is part of the Sunnah now a lot of the people due to the Western etiquet see it repulsive to use the miswak in the Masjid in a conference room in a business meeting in the streets and it appears that they don't have anything against you but they have against something against the Sunnah so this one way or another raises feelings of resentment may Allah protect us and there's nothing wrong in doing it I'm not spitting in your face when I'm using my mwak like like this yes if I'm talking to you I wouldn't do yeah you should do this you should do this is inappropriate and U unethical but if I'm on my own if I'm walk walking in the streets if I'm in a meeting listening to someone and I'm using my I'm attentative even in and this may raise eyebrows for some unless they have micropigmentation anyhow if you are listening to the of the and you fear that you will fall asleep the is so articulate to the extent that everybody's nodding their heads uh uh uh dozing into sleep because his way of giving the and the subject itself and so if you fear falling into this form of lack of concentration there's no problem in using the miswak oh but theith says if you touch the stone then you have no Friday this is for those who are playing around but for someone who's about to fall asleep and he cannot shake it off then using the miswak for this purpose inshallah would be fine and Allah Knows Best"
