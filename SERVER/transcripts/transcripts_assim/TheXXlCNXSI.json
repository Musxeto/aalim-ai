  "transcript": "uh so my question is when we are in Ru we know that we need to keep our back straight um but is it permissible to also bend my knee in order to keep the back straight because if I keep my uh legs straight then my back is not going to be straight question for you when you do this posture anyone looking at you would they say you are in R yes or no I would say yes then this is permissible see in Arabic ru is to bend your back whether your knees are straight and flat or bent it doesn't matter your back is bent now must it be straight sometimes I have pain in the lower back so I may Arch it a little bit I may tilt it a little bit still people look at me they say I'm in rur is it the best thing to do no but still it is valid so your knees have nothing to do with your Ru position whether you bend them or you keep them straight and Allah Knows Best"
