  "transcript": "ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam my name isim alakim and you're watching Reflections on Islam and the topic as you may remember and recall is Dua we talked over the last episode about the eates of Dua in last program we met we discussed some of the times that Allah is most likely to answer the call our Dua and our invocations more than others and the fourth time is between aan and this is a time that is sacred the Prophet saysat the supplication and the invocation between thean and are never rejected Allah answers uh uh your call when you supplicate to Allah and this Hadith was reported byi in his Sunan now it is quite crucial and important for us to continuously make Dua an invocation not to be selective in the sense that okay I've got 5 minutes I'm going to make Dua and that's it every time Allah guides you to make Dua Allah guides you to recognize the times where he answers Dua more than others you have to enter that door and you have to supplicate to Allah in humility in submissiveness in expressing your poverty and need to him subhana wa tala and not to be selective a lot of the Muslims may choose a small portion of the day raise their hands pray and that's it and go you have to keep in a word in a sense bombarding Allah's doors so that Allah would open these doors for you and this is not out of arrogance on the contrary if you do this with arrogance Allah will throw you in hell but you do this in need in showing that you love him in showing that you are in need for him and then Allah the almighty would answer and respond to your call between the time of and it's very crucial one would say I live in a country where they don't offer aan well this is your mistake offer aan in your house do I have to well if it the Adan has not been given in the whole city or the whole country you're living in it is part of the Sunnah that you make aan even if you're in your house and always remember when you give aan first of all you're doing it to uplift the name of Allah to raise the name of Allah so it's a form of worship secondly it is your identity as a Muslim thirdly Allah as the pro the prophet promised us Allah would make each and every single item that hears your voice testify for you on the day of judgment and that is why the prophet says if a person is in the wilderness he's in the desert he's traveling there's no soul in sight and he calls for the aan the prophet tells usam that on the day of on the day of judgment the trees the Rocks the birds the beasts that have heard you calling the aan will testify and say oh Allah we heard this man calling your name for Salat so you do have a problem if you pray without offering the aan this means that you are ignorant of Allah give the Adan in your house I know Brothers here in the UK masallah that tell me their five and six years old children would make them filled with pride they would fill them with pride when they mount on one of the tables and call for the aan the children 56 years old why because they're glorifying Allah so call for the aan and between the aan and the actual prayer the it is a time for Dua don't be a shy some people you know when they're in the Masjid why don't you raise your hands and and and supplicate said people are looking so this is not a a recommended way of being shy this is actually being ashamed of calling Allah you have a problem and you have a big problem there are people who do not pray prayers on time why he said she I'm at work I'm at the uni I'm in in the marketplace and it's time for prayer but there is not a a suitable place to pray and who said said that we have to pray in a suitable Place Allah when he mandated prayer he did not instruct us that either pray in your synagogue your church or your Masjid or your prayer is invalid this is wrong the prophet said that Allah made the whole earth for me a place of worship and means of purification so whomever attends prayer at the time of prayer he should pray wherever he is so even if you're on the streets take a corner and pray even if the passer by are looking at you so what I'm doing it for Allah this is one means or one call of da do not I repeat do not pray on the middle of the highway or in the middle of the street say I'm going to make da let the car stop no this is insane if you're insured maybe it's okay but they will kill you and your family would benefit from that but no this is not meant to be but you have brains be wise when you practice your Islam there's a place to pray pray I pray in uh uh um uh places that are not meant to be used as prayer Hall if I'm waiting for my airplane in in in um the airport and the time for prayer is due all what I have to do is stand and pray it takes me 5 minutes and that's it people are looking so I'm not undressing I'm not wearing micro uh uh uh skirts or miniskirts I'm not showing or flexing my muscles I'm not doing something that is shameful I'm praying to my Lord what's wrong in that therefore raise your hands supplicate to Allah between and these are one of the times that Allah would definitely answer your call fifthly among the times that Allah answers your supplication is when it rains strangely speaking sah may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam said that there are two times when Allah does not reject your invocation and that is when it's called when it's time or when it is being called for the aan and the second time is when it rains and this is uh a reported by Abu daud in the Sunan why is that Subhan Allah I don't know but I know that the prophet said this when the call for the Adan is being called This is understood because we know that this is a Time the interval between the and the is a time of when Allah responds to our prayer and invocation but what about raining well it was part of the Sunnah that whenever it trained the prophet am would go out in the rain exposing his arms and parts of his chest so that he would be touched by the rain and he would say that this is this rain was close to Allah and it's a blessing so we do this we believe in this and we know that this connects us as individuals to Allah in everything we see it's not only the Masjid it's not only the Muslims even the environment we take care of the environment we take care of animals if rain descends to us from the heavens and the prophet says it is close it was close to Allah the almighty because it's coming down from the heavens and he's seeking Allah's blessing we also every now and then walk in the rain not to sing I'm walking in the rain but I'm fulfilling the Sunnah of the Prophet I'm doing the uh the prophet's Sunnah by exposing parts of my body not soaking myself so that I would get the flu and maybe fall sick but just to get a touch of the blessing of the of the of of rain water and this is why the prophet tells us it is a time when Allah answers your supplication it's a blessed time when rain falls upon us sixthly the prophet tells us about an an hour during the night time and he did not specify which hour it is so the whole night is a time of Supplication you never know is it in the beginning middle or at the end it's a time of Supplication the prophet saysat wasam at night time there is an hour that no muslim asking Allah at that hour of something that is good in the dun or in the Allah would give it to him meaning that if he does this Allah would answer his supplication or invocation and Allah would give it to him and this is every single night it's not one night in a month or in a year no every single night and this Hadith was reported by IM Muslim in theah of course night time you either spend it sleeping or you spend it in something that is useless lots of the people use it in going to nightclubs going to pubs wasting their time being wasted themselves and not recognizing that this is a blessed time for them to supplicate and to make Dua to Allah the almighty seventhly there is a time on Friday that if you supplicate Allah Asel has designated this time to answer your supplication more than any other time because we know that Allah is there 24/7 and Allah listens to our supplications and invocation but he has designated certain times and he told us subhanahu wa ta'ala that these times are more or highly more recommended for him to answer than any other time on Friday the prophet says in the is in that on Friday there is a time there is a period of time there is an hour in Arabic when the prophet says an hour it means a moment not the 60 Minute it means a period of time that can be a moment and not a 60 seconds a moment but a moment of time that when an individual Muslim prays to Allah asking Allah for something Allah would give it to him and this was reported in bukari in theah as mentioned before okay what time is it so that we could be able to try our best to invocate to Allah in them well Scholars differed over so many opinions some say when the Imam enters the Masid for the Friday one say when the Iman sits down one say when the is done one says this and that the most authentic opinion is that it is the last hour of the day of Friday that precedes Sunset that precedes M and in so many parts of the world of the Muslim world if you go on Fridays just before thean of M an hour or so You' find righteous people sitting raising their hands and supplicating this is not a Time for people to go to go to the Masjid because it's between and so it's about 3 hours people have gone prayed and gone yet if you come an hour before Sunset you'd find people sitting there supplicating to Allah following this Hadith and Allah would answer their supplication the eighth time where you would most likely get your invocation answered is when you drink Zam water what's zamzam water is it a fizzy or something a soda no no no zamzam water as Muslims know it is the water that comes from The Well of zamzam in meca next to the Kaa and this started when is when he was a child he was thirsty when he was abandoned by ibraim his father is and haer were left to uh uh on their own in the valley of Mecca no humans no beasts no buildings and she said ibraim who are you leaving us for and he did not respond and he left them and she said ibraim did Allah instruct you to leave me and this infant child in this Wilderness and he said yes what did she say did she say ibraim are you crazy you listen to such instructions with a heart filled with Iman and belief and conviction she said if Allah instructed you to leave us here Allah would not let us in vain and he left and she kept on going from saf and Mar as we do in going to the top looking for any means of of Life any means of living she has no food no water nothing no credit cards no cash there are no Outlets it is a complete isolation she kept on going from Safa to Mara seven times and then she could not find anything her son was crying out of thirst and he was digging the Earth with his feet you know when someone is he's a child he's an infant Haram so if you would like Allah to answer your calls if you would like Allah to respond to your prayers and your invocations you have to make sure that your income is halal and we gone through this so I'm not going to repeat it over again the fourth reason is being uncertain when you invoke Allah the prophet says when you invoke Allah never say oh Allah forgive me if you wish oh Allah grant me money if you wish because oh Allah have mercy on me if you wish because Allah has no one to force him to do these things so when you say if you wish as if you are forcing him and you are giving him the choice no when you pray to Allah say oh Allah forgive me now Dua and the format it's it's it's a verb that is called in Arabic it's an order verb but it depends on the people or the the person or whom you are addressing it to so if I talk to my child and say do this this is an order if I'm say saying this to one in my level do this this is a request I'm not ordering I'm requesting him because he can say yes I can say no but if I'm saying do this to Allah who is someone who is superior to me then this becomes as a Dua and I cannot say to Allah oh Allah cure me if you wish but if you don't wish to it's okay no this is Haram you are humilating yourself you are asking Allah in in in in submissiveness and and declaring your poverty therefore you do not make an exception say if you wish no you have to go straight to the point and say may Allah uh uh forgive my sins oh Allah cure my illness oh Allah pay my debt without saying if you wish the fifth obstacle is when your heart is not present and we went through that before and we said that one of the etiquet that you have your concentration it is impolite to go to an interview and the one interviewing you for your job is talking to you about a subject and you're thinking about oh tomorrow today at 5:00 I have to go and play tennis and I have to do this and I have to do that and when you wake up and he says so what do you think it's impolite to say um sorry I wasn't there I wasn't with you can you repeat the question again say well good luck with your new job next time you have an interview and he shows you the way out Allah has the highest example subhana wa ta'ala you do not supplicate to Allah you do not invoke Allah when your heart is not present it has to be there otherwise this a formats an obstacle and we have to be among those who enforce virtue and prevent Vice and evil so that Allah would answer our calls if we see things that are evil taking place and we don't do anything about it if we see people on the wrong track and we don't guide them and we don't teach them to the Quran and the Sunnah yet when we go back home we supplicate to Allah Allah would not answer our calls the prophet said by whom my soul is in his hand and that is Allah by Allah you must enforce virtue and you must prevent Vice otherwise Allah would send upon you his wrath and then you would call him and he will not respond to you this means that it is not a choice of ours to enforce virtue or not you have to give da you have to teach people you have to show them what pleases Allah and what does not and you have to say to things that are wrong that these are wrong and try to avoid them and try to prevent them otherwise Allah would not forgive your sins and would not answer your supplication and Allah would send his wrath upon you the last and seventh um obstacle is Illustrated in a Hadith the prophet saysat there are three whom call upon Allah and Allah the almighty would not answer their call Subhan Allah this is it's very uh uh important to know this because you don't want to be among them I don't want to be among them but who are they well listen the prophet says a man who married to a woman who has awful and bad character Allah and he does not divorce her Allah does not answer his invocation a man who lent another person money and he did not take any documentation to prove that and he did not have any Witnesses on him lending him that money so Allah would not answer his invocation and a man this is the third person who gives his money to someone who spends it unwisely like a child for example and then Allah would not answer his invocation a lot of the Muslims may know this Hadith yet fail to understand the meaning of it the scholars say that Allah would not answer the invocation of this individual when he supplicates against these three different people in the sense that if you have a bad wife if you have an awful wife who is nagging who is abusive who curses you who talks badly about your parents who's never satisfied of whatever you do to her when you go in the middle of the night and say oh Allah let me get rid of this woman oh Allah curse her oh Allah put her in hell oh Allah let her die oh Allah let her be crippled and blind of course this is not advisable don't try this at home but if this happens if this is how your wife is do you think that Allah would answer your call against your wife no why is why not simple it is your mistake if you have a wife that is this bad not to divorce her you should have divorced her and got rid of her end of story it takes two to tango Islamic Tango that is it takes two so if she is not willing if she's not giving you a good life if she's not obedient and kind to you this is not a life and likewise the other way around if the husband is abusive is if he doesn't pray if he doesn't his family if he has the most awful character the most awful smell then how would he expect his wife to to to obey him and to be respectful to him this life cannot go on they have to communicate so this is number one number two if I give someone money and I don't have him sign a paper nor I have people witnessing that I gave him money and then after a year when I say uh give me back my money claim my money back and he says do you have any evidences Pro prove that I took money from you and I'm agitated by this I'm frustrated and I pray oh Allah May destruction be fall upon this guy who denied me my money Allah would not answer your supplication why because it's your mistake Allah tells you in Surah Bak in the longest verse of the Quran that when you give money or you lend someone have it registered have someone witness this so that you can claim your money otherwise it's like throwing your money in the dust bin we have a joke in Arabia it says that when someone comes to take a a loan from you we usually kiss his feet people say why would you do this you're lending him and you're kissing his feet he said yes because when he's taking the money as the loan from me he's kissing my hand so that I would give him the money once he takes the money to get it back from him I have to kiss his feet and this is awful Muslims are not like this Muslims honor their word when they are committed to something they take it on time and they give it back on time now probably one would ask does Allah answer the call the invocation of a non-muslim of a cafir for example the answer is yes he does how is that he's not Muslim he's a cafir he's worshiping Idols well when he is in necessity Allah is the Lord of all and he answers the call of those who are in necessity and that is why the prophet Alam told us Beware of the invocation of Those whom you wronged if you were if you transgressed against someone beware of his invocation because Allah does not block his invocation until he answers it Allah will answer it so even the prophet says even if he's not a Muslim if you do wrong to him and he invokes against you Allah will answer his call so it is very essential not to have any form of Oppression against any person even if they were not Muslim because Allah would answer their invocation secondly one may ask is offering the salutation to the prophet wasam essential in answering your prayer your invocation the answer is yes it is one of the conditions otherwise it's blocked Allah would not respond to it thirdly what is the status of people and I've seen this myself who in times of crisis do not invoke Allah and you tell them why don't you invoke Allah he says at time of ease I never invoked Allah so I would be a hypocrite if I need him now and I invoke to him what's the ruling on that well whoever does this would be probably in great Danger on of being thrown into hell because Allah says that those who are arrogant and refus use to uh worship me and invoke me in times of Crisis they will be thrown in Hellfire with humility so beware of doing this if you had shortcomings and you neglected invoking Allah at times of ease definitely you need him a time of hardship so if you say I'm not going to call him at times of hardship then you are definitely going to face your consequences and there are people who whenever they invoke Allah Allah answers them so try to be among them among them are those who fast when they break their fasting among them righteous and fair imams rulers so if you are a head of your department a company if you're a ruler if you're a governor when you're fair when you're just with everyone you don't compromise Allah will answer your supplications and your invocations those traveling the prophet tells us that a traveler Allah answers his invocation so whenever you travel raise your hands and ask whatever you want from Allah also among those whom Allah never rejects their invocation are those who are being gred to who are being uh uh suppressed beware of being the aggressor because if they raise their hands and say oh Allah this person did this and that to me and he was wrong to me oh Allah break his leg break his neck do this to him do that to the to him because he was oppressed by you Allah would answer his call so put this in mind how many of us oppress their wives oppress their children abuse them do wrong to themill how many of us borrowed money from people and it's been 20 years now and I'm not paying them back and I'm not even confessing of having this do you think that Allah would let us be do you think Allah would not hold us accountable for these things do you think that Allah would not answer their invocation when they say oh Allah this man took my money and now he is denying it oh Allah do this and that to him W Allah would answer their calls and you will find this if not in your body if not in your health you will find it in your children you'll find it in your marriage you'll find it in your job Allah would have his calamities fall upon you Allah would have his tribulation befall on you on your life because of this aggression that you were part of because of this zul and Injustice that that you had inflicted upon others unjustly you have to revise your life you have to check what are the obstacles that I'm doing that prevent Allah from answering my invocation what are the etiquet I'm not fulfilling that prevent Allah from answering my invocations and when you do this always keep in mind that you're worshiping Allah you're getting closer to Allah so the more it is prolonged the more Allah Asel is rewarding you for you do I pray to Allah the almighty that he answers my invocation and your invocation and that we manage to apply these etiquet and to remove these obstacles from our lives so that Allah would answer our prayers this is all the time we have I pray to Allah that you have benefited from all what you have heard and that Allah would reward us for the things that we do"
