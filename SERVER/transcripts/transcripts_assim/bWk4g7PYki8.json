  "transcript": "Aman from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, what should we do if we reach Masjid and Iqama time is due and Imam is not present? Also the authorities of the Masjid like trustee Mohsen are absent, only regular people are present, then what should we do? Also our Imam of Masjid said that if you lead prayer without being waited for me then your prayer is invalid. JazakAllahu Khairan Wa Jazak. First of all, this is a hypothetical situation. When the Imam is absent and the Mu'adhin is absent and the authority of the Masjid is also absent, what kind of a Masjid is this? The community should speak and they should change the whole panel if needed because this is not acceptable. This is an authority, this is a responsibility that has to be established and demonstrated in the Masjid. People can't be left alone without having any guidance or leadership. Hypothetically speaking, if the time of Iqama is in 15 minutes, we waited for 5 more minutes, this is 20 minutes, and no Mu'adhin, no Imam, no one from the committee of or the board of the Masjid, in this case the community chooses one of the people present who knows the Qur'an and they make him lead them in prayer. As for what the Imam said that the prayer is invalid, this is, I can't say it on live TV, this is bogus. Who is he to render people's prayer as invalid? He should be there to attend the prayer, he's being paid for it and he just cannot let people wait for him and say that, Simon says, I come whenever I want. No, this is not your father's Masjid and these are not your citizens or subjects that you can control. So if he's late considerably and the people's having hardship, they should appoint someone to lead their prayer and Allah knows best."
