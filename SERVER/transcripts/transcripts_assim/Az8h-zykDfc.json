  "transcript": "yakub from china says that he read an ayah in surat fussilat where allah says that he created the heavens in two days but then he read elsewhere that allah created the heavens and the earth in six days there's no contradiction none whatsoever allah the almighty created the heavens in two days and created the earth and put its provisions and perfected it in four days which gives you the impression that the earth and all what's in it is far more superior than all what you see above you in these heavens and this is a fact if you just ponder upon the magnificence of allah's creation on this earth if not the humans and the animals if not then the fish then if not then the birds if not the insects the plants and the species which are in the millions it blows your mind away so there's no contradiction none whatsoever allah created the heavens and the earth in six days and this is exactly what was mentioned in the quran"
