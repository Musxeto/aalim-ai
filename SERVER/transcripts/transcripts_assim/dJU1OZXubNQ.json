  "transcript": "next question is that I'm a cancer patient and using a stoma bag I cannot control my stool I'm worried about my wudu and prayers what does Islam say about such condition the schools of thought call this person to be mad law and math or means that he's excused because this is not within his capacity or ability to control therefore scholars say whoever has incontinence whether urine or the vacation or with wind that it is coming repeatedly unexpectedly uncontrollably then he should the moment he hears the Athan calling meaning the time has entered he is to go and perform model of course before that clean himself whether by cleaning the the bag itself or if it's it's possible it's not difficult so that he would be ready to pray and from the time he performs Rudo until the time of the salat is over no matter what comes out he's still in the state of hulu and his prayer is not affected by whatever comes out of him because this is uncontrollable and unintentional and Allah knows best"
