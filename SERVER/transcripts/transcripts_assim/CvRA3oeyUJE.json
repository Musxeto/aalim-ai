  "transcript": "Niha from Qatar says that they're investing money with uh someone and this person is um giving them a fixed interest a fixed amount of uh uh uh interest and there is a possibility that there won't be any um loss occurring on them so is this is this permissible the answer is no once the prophet is fixed this is totally prohibited if I said interest so erase that I wasn't concentrating well let me rephrase the question again if someone is investing money and the person who takes the money gives you a fixed interest like 1,000 r a month or 5,000 r a month is this permissible the answer is no this defies the purpose of profit and loss when it comes to trading it has to be uh uh um not fixed but theic percentage might be fixed from the prophet so he says you have 40% of the prophet and I have 60 this is permissible because maybe it the the profit is one real maybe it's a thousand Allah knows best likewise to guarantee not to uh uh have any uh what you call um loss so you give him 100,000 R and says that if you lose I guarantee that I'll give you back your money this is also clear rer so"
