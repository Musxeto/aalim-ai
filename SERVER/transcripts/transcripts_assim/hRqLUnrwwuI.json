  "transcript": "uh faizan from India I know that shaking hands with women is not permissible now my question is sometimes you face situations where someone extends their hands towards us for example a female teacher now how do we escape from this situation do we tell them that it's that it's Haram or should we make other excuses first of all you have to always keep your distance from women you cannot be this close to a woman where she extends her hands and then you ask what should I do sometimes they may jump on you and kiss you in some cultures it's normal for women to kiss on the cheek men they meet like in Spain or in in the like so it's cultural there's no problem in that so you as a man when you come to encounter the opposite gender due to school due to work due to buying something in a store keep your distance from far away to three meters don't get so close so that you cannot Escape if you're two three meters she would not walk extending her arm or hand to shake hands still just not in worst case scenario somebody of the opposite gender extends their hand is it permissible to shake hands the answer is no why are you hesitant in rejecting it it's embarrassing embarrassing to who to the poor lady if I don't reach out if I don't shake hands if I don't touch her she might be offended okay and if you don't offend her and you do shake hands what are the consequences I may be thrown into hell and Allah will punish me and torment me for that okay what is it what is what's what's going to be what are you going to choose hell or offending her definitely it's no-brainer simply just keep your hand to yourself and say pardon me this is against my religion I can't shake hands with the opposite gender full stop whoever is offended is offended the hell with them with all we expect any I do not want to go to hell if they want to be offended be my guest who cares they have their culture I have my religion who's proud of his belief more you or them this is something you have to pay attention to foreign"
