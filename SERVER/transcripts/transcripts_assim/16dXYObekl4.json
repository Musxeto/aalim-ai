  "transcript": "sumaya says it's said that reading surat al-mulk every night protects person from the torment of the grave how true is it what is the best time to recite it this is authentic Somalia the hadith the Prophet said RA salatu salam i know a chapter of the quran 30 ayahs that prevented the one who keeps it in his chest from being burnt by the fire and we were told that it is the preventer the surah the preventer of the torment of the grave and it is proven through the sunnah of the prophet Ali so at some that he used to recite it every single night before going to bed so the best time to recite it is when you are preparing to sleep when you're sitting on your bed or when you're lying down you recite surat al-mulk until you finish it this is the way of the prophet Isaiah some people are too lazy and they say we recite it in Asia prayer but then we sleep after 4 or 5 hours some scholars say that this does the job but I believe that it is not that sufficient because the Sunnah and the way of the Prophet ala Kazam that he used to recite it as he was preparing to go to bed"
