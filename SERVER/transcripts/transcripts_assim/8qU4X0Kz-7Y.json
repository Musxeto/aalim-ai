  "transcript": "a doll says is Woodill made with clothes that have major impurity valid if we change it or if we change into pure clothes after making model so basically adults question is as follows I have impurity on my clothes and it's time for Salah I go and perform model and then I change my clothes and we're pure clothes is there any problem no problem providing that there is no impurity on my body because purity is defined as two types referral hadith what is a little habit ruffled hadith means the uplifting of the ritual impurity with a major or minor the uplifting of the ritual impurity whether minor this is done by wooden or major this is done by Goosen why is it ritual because I can see it and is a little habit removing the impurity and this has to be removed physically either from my body or from my clothes or from the spot that I am praying on so as long as performing voodoo is done correctly changing your clothes that are impure and wearing pure you have no problem in that sha Allah"
