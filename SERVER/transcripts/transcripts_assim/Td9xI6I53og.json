calma borussia hematin Delilah mean nabina muhammad anwar ali he wasabi he admin I'm bad dere burdened sisters in Islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh yesterday we talked about a beautiful hadith where Osama bin zaid may allah be pleased with him and with his father killed an enemy of islam after he had killed so many Muslims on the battlefield and when he felt after a duel with Osama that he was going to die he said the Shahada in a way to protect himself from dying Osama may allah be pleased with him went on and killed him despite of him uttering the Shahada the prophet alayhi salatu salam was outraged and he asked osama you killed him after he said la illaha illallah you killed him after he declared the testimony that should prevent you from killing him Osama replied the prophet of Allah he killed so many of our companions he killed so-and-so and so-and-so only he gave him a list and he only did this to protect himself from dying the prophet said alayhi salatu salam what will you do with la illaha illallah on the day of judgment Oh Sam said ask Allah for forgiveness prophet of Allah for me for I have sinned and the Prophet kept on repeating it what will you do with la illaha illallah on the day of judgment and yesterday we elaborated a bit on the issue of that we treat people on what appears to us and their intentions are to Allah as erosion and how for not abiding by this beautiful rule a lot of the Muslims have diverted and went into extreme they have left the straight path of Islam because the Prophet told the solid solid salam and the Prophet doesn't lie and the hadith is authentic that his Ummah will divide into 73 cults or sex all of them are in hell except one which one is this one this one has a main feature that signifies it that identifies it from any other sect the Prophet said I so solemn Marla Reba Antoinetta feliz a meany whoever turns away from mason is not of me so the 72 sects are not of the Prophet erased a lot Rosanna because they do not follow his son this hadith was taken by some of the deviant sex and say and they said that okay by saying la la la la this is sufficient no matter what you do and rather no matter what you do not do from the commands of the Sharia you're still a full-fledged believer and you will end up in paradise just by saying la la la la and this is wrong and this is a breach of al-qaeda when ignorant people come and downsize the importance of al-qaeda this what happens takeda is found in the Quran and it's also found in the prophetic sunnah prophetic hadith so you compile them and you present to the Muslims what the Quran and the Sunnah say if you neglect to hate a lohia you're not a Muslim even the idol worshippers as stated in the Quran when you ask them who created the heavens and the earth who created them build say Allah so though he drew booby the Lord ship toe heat everyone approves and agrees to it except atheists of course in the sense that who created the heavens and the earth they would say Allah who makes rainfall Allah who gives lives life and takes it Allah who provides for every soul Allah they all acknowledge this then what is the problem ah the problem is with toe Hadel hulu here the toe heat of worship so when you die verte any form of worship to other than Allah this is shirk the ignorance should fail to understand the importance of al Qaeda fall into this that is why we have in the majority of Muslim countries shirk present in even their messages you have graves in their message and they're worshipping the Saints the peers they are obeying the shamans and they're asking them for a fortune telling and to predict what will happen for them they believe in their tOWIE's intelius mints and all these things that they hang in their necks and in their arms to protect them all of this is check without art either you will fail to identify this unfortunately now part of the 73 sects are definitely the how r h and the most identifiable feature of the Huaraz is that they first give tech fear to others secondly they kill them sometimes they killed and then they justify this by giving tech fear afterwards they improvise so do you say that we should not do tech fear now I'm not saying this because Islam is the middle path it's the middle way of two extremes there are those who are rich who give tech fear to each and every one so that they can kill each and every one even katheer mentioned this in lb day one knee hiya he said that if it were left to these people hence there is the huarache they would have killed every boy and girl among the children and every man and woman among the adult in Syria or in Iraq Subhan Allah this was like 700 years ago and is he's describing it as if it's today and why is that because the Prophet told us that they will come from Iraq and I'll explain this in sha Allah more in detail if Allah Jojo gives us a time and life so these how Irish kill after giving tech fear on the other side of the coin are those who do not give tech fear at all so even if so-called Muslim and I've read this in the news yesterday that an Egyptian an Arab actor or a singer i think was announced that he's supportive of the homosexuals rights and gay marriage this support by itself is an act of co firm but people don't believe that tech fear is something essential in the sense that even if you reject the Quran even if you reject the sooner even if you reject the law of allah azzawajal then this is ok and the middle path would be that tech fear first of all cannot be done except by the Muslim ruler and the scholars the real scholars a panel of judges who are appointed by the ruler so it's not full Tom Dick and Harry it's not for you and me to give tech fear if I meet someone and I talked with him and all of a sudden he says something I immediately say no you are a kafir no I can't do that even that actor or singer who says who said that he supports gay rights and gay marriages the act itself is coo for but do I say that this individual is a kafir god forbid no I do not say this because there are conditions to be fulfilled and there are obstacles to make sure that they are not present when giving such a statement and again this is not for you and me this is only for the ruler the Muslim ruler and scholars he appoints why do we emphasize on this because if we do not put this condition it would be chaotic how is that I would end up having 911 from all over the city or the country people killing their spouses why did you kill your husband she said he committed an act of Cooper and he cursed Allah so I blew his head off Wow why did you kill your wife she rejected the eye of hijab and she said there is nothing such as hijab and women if they have to wear hijab men should wear hijab as well and this is not a fad and not equality so I killed her this is not what Islam is about there is law and order there is a panel of judges that would look into these cases and at the end of the day and act of apostasy has to be ruled by the Muslim ruler whether to be executed after being tried and convicted or not having said that you have to walk a very thin line between these two extremes the Huaraz and the more gia and this thin line is the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam you will find this in the Quran as well as in the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam there this is why you need and we need scholars some people come and say read the book of allah read the quran is sufficient for you yes it is sufficient for us and allah had made it easy for those to recite and to ponder upon but you don't expect any high school student to go into encyclopedias of medicine and perform a surgery this is insane you have to be qualified no one is preventing you from reciting the Quran but you have to recite it while acquiring the knowledge of the sooner to understand what you recite without the Sunnah of the Prophet item you cannot understand it properly not only that you may be guided if you turn your back to the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam therefore we have to look into what the scholars have produced to us from the Quran Nelson ready for example the compact that the scholar said that you cannot and you should not give any tech fear without conditions so a person he says that feel or he does something that I think that it should be labeled as cover I cannot say that this individual is a kafir unless he is an adult seen aware and knowledgeable of what he had said intending what he had said or done does not have any misinterpretation and he's not forced so if a person was like this then the panel of judges the scholars only with the instruction of the Muslim ruler can deem him and label him as kafir and they usually give him the benefit of the doubt and they usually give him time to repent and reflect which means that among those whom we cannot label as kafir number one a child so if a ten-year-old child who did not reach the age of puberty says something or makes fun of the Koran or of the sunnah or reject something while speaking with his father that is of the essence of Islam you cannot label him as kafir you cannot the Prophet said that is awesome the pan that holds people accountable for their good and bad deeds has been uplifted from three one of them is a child until he reaches the age of puberty so if he did not or she did not reach age of puberty they are not held accountable and hence they are not labeled as kafir even if they do an act of Cofer even if a child prostrates to an idol this is not an act of cover the act is act of cover but this child is not a kafir because it is not accountable yet secondly a person who is insane who is not in his sanity he's labeled as unable to determine right from wrong such a person also is not accountable in the previous hadith the first one was a child until he reaches the age of puberty the second one is a person who is insane until he regains his sanity until he becomes awake from this phase he's in thirdly an ignorant I cannot label a Negro ignorant who does not know the ruling to be a kafir a revert in Europe fasted the whole month of Ramadan and used to have intercourse every day with his wife and when told that this is wrong he said no it's not wrong Allah told us only not to drink on not to eat he's ignorant of the ruling that it is prohibited can we give the clear to him sometimes the scholars give a hadith that support that an ignorant person is not to be given tech fear due to his ignorance this is an obstacle that prevents us from doing tech fear it was reported and the hadith is in verse sahih so it's highly authentic that a man on his dying bed gathered his children and said what do you think of me and they said you were the best of fathers his wife said you were the best of husbands and he replied I was one of the notorious servants of God and I was an evil person so when I die I'd like you to criminate me I'd like you to clean a to me burn me get my bones and crush them grind them and toss my ashes on the hilltops and in the bottom of the valleys and over the oceans for if Allah were to get me back to life he would severely punish me now this thought itself that a lot is incapable of resurrecting you and gathering your ashes this is blasphemous by itself but the man was ignorant so Allah so jeal ordered the hilltops the valleys the oceans to gather his ashes and he was once again standing in front of a large original asked him my servant what made you do what you had done so the man said the fear of your punishment and the fear of you Almighty Allah so Allah said take him to paradise I have forgiven his sins the man was not a disbeliever in Allah but he committed an act of Khufu but due to his ignorance Allah forgave him the act of cover is doubting that Allah is capable of making you back though creating you from scratch and from nothing is more difficult than restoring you back to what you were so ignorance prevents you from giving tech fear to people fourthly when you do something unintentionally if you make an error a mistake without meaning it do you become a kafir this how Irish say definitely he said the word of co for did he intend it none of my business aya kill them when I find them subhanAllah we all know the hadith of the man who was stranded in the desert and his camel his ride with his food and drink ran away he tried to look for it everywhere he could not find it when hunger and thirst took hold of him and he realized that he's going to die for sure he took a small nap only to wake up with his camel licking his face so he took the rope and out of joy said o Allah you are my servant and I am your Lord he twisted it he flipped instead of saying o Allah thank you I am your servant and you are my lord he made a mistake and said o Allah you are my servant and I'm your Lord now this is blasphemous this is cover but did he commit go for himself Nasser is no because he did not intend it it was unintentional fifthly misinterpretation and this happens a lot a lot of the times people would misinterpret things and think that they are doing something that is good but you cannot give them tech fear especially if they have misinterpretation which means that they misunderstood or died my mother owned may allah be pleased with him was one of the people who fought in better and we know that the people of butter allah forgave all of the sins it was reported that he once was caught in the state of intoxication he was wasted you know drunk so they arrested him and he said why are you arresting me even if I am drunk I'm not sinful whoa we know the consensus of scholars that this is a sin how dare you do such a thing sir Omar told them to ask him why does he say he's not sinful so Adama may allah be pleased with him misinterpreted and ayah of the quran and this misinterpretation of his led him to thinking that it is okay for him to consume intoxicants the ayah is 93 in chapter 5 surat al maeda allah says there is not upon those who believe and do righteous ness any blame concerning what they have eaten in the past if they now fear allah and believe and do righteous deeds and then fear allah and believe and then fear allah and do good and allah loves the doers of good so he said allah says there is no blame on us now this ayah was revealed when the Muslims had concerns about their brothers who died in battle before wine was prohibited so they said they'll meet Allah with wine in their bellies they used to drink because it was hella until it was obligated and it became Haram Muslims stopped but what about those who died while still drinking it so I'm reveal this ayah telling them that there is no blame on them because at the time it was Helen now after it was prohibited and Muslims knew about it kodama did something that is classically called cover because he made something holla haram he made it bluntly halal Romar said to them ask him after clarifying to him that this was revealed its own zone zone what he had done was wrong if he still insists on that intoxicants is halal execute him because he's an apostate and if he admits that he was wrong then flogged him 80 lashes because he consumed something that is Harlem so this was is one of the things that any person before indulging in giving tech fear must be aware of and finally why was I finally wanting to do something out of your own free will if a person was forced to give a statement of Cooper or an action of Cofer should we label him as a kafir definitely not if someone was forced to do something that is not permissible or forced to do something that is clearly an act of apostasy being forced does not hold him accountable Allah says in the Quran but the people don't read the Quran this is a problem they recited but it doesn't go into their minds you do not comprehend it Allah says whoever disbelieved in Allah after his belief the end of the ISS on them is the wrath from Allah and there's will and there's will be a great torment ok whoever disbelieves in Allah after his belief whoever apostates a pasta sizes in the middle there is an exception of the ayah Allah says except him who is forced there too and whose heart is at rest with faith but such as open their breasts to disbelief meaning that they're exempted from the punishment and going to help because they are forced at gunpoint to behave or to do an act of blasphemy though their hearts rest with strong belief this I by the way was revealed when I marred neossat came to the prophet Alice Alice I'm crying so the prophet said what's wrong and this was in Mecca Ahmad was a slave and a son of a slave he said o prophet of Allah they kept on torturing me and torturing me so that I would curse you and curse Islam and I felt under the pain that I had no other choice but to do so so I cursed you and he came crying to the Prophet eres la tercera the Prophet Sal Allahu Allah told him and ask him a clear question how do you feel your heart how is your heart he said wallahi or prophet of Allah it's filled with a man and he's crying anguished in pain and suffering because of the words he had to utter under extreme torture the Prophet said to him as asylum if they return back to torturing you and asking you to say these heinous words go ahead and say them you have no problem and this is where Allah social revealed whoever disbelieved in Allah after his belief except him who is forced there too and whose heart is at rest with faith but such as open their breasts to disbelief on them is wrath from Allah and there's will be a great torment so those who do it under gunpoint they have no problem with that and this does not take them out of the fold of Islam these are conditions and obstacles that must be fulfilled and must be removed before a person is deemed and labeled as a kafir and all of the salaf and our righteous predecessors and our scholars and our judges and our Muslim rulers since the beginning of time till the day of judgment they would always clarify the statements of co 4 and when it is dangerous for a person to approach it and when with a person fall into it yet they never label an individual of co 4 until that is implemented and it fits him as a glove and the conditions are fulfilled and obstacles have been removed whether he's an individual whether he is an organization whether it is a country or a government now if you fail to follow the Quran and the Sunnah in the fashion I've just mentioned you will end up like the how I rich giving tech fear and automatically afterwards killing children women elderly Muslims non-muslims with mainly Muslims indiscriminately and thinking that this would lead you to paradise as even will Jim may Allah have his curse on him killed Ali ibn ABI Talib and was tortured and and executed while being patient thinking that what he had done would take him to paradise we have a short break

is here with me nowadays on wizard reason she cannot fast she's a very older like 80 severide here like that age and he cannot fast so we have to give her a cydia but up till now my husband has not paid so he was asking that only five fast things are left so how should he give gift for all the month many are only for five days how should it be ok and my question number two is if for example like 14 15 years old girl she has not completed her faster hello yes yes yes I'm with you okay so I for example 14 15 years old who have missed her period I was sorry you have before fasting and till the next Ramadan she couldn't complete sometimes because she's going to school and sometimes because of laziness for example so in this Ramadan she has some previous fasting which he will complete after the summer than but about the ransom she has to give the we have to give the vidya but her father refused that no why should I give the failure because she is not fasting like the laziness it's not my

ok i will answer you sure you're quite welcome I mean from Kenya yeah I'm here funky yes I mean hello how r equal sounds a lot I wanted to ask a question sure Aoife if I have my money if if I have money that stays about six seven months on the bank then I decided to reinvest Italy to buy cards and because come very scary for myself and I get profits keep on drawing that money on and off so do I have to play soccer on that money ok i will answer young and one more question here sure yeah if somebody's giving Petrie here on the amount of Omaha and then it takes the city and 42 another person even is a poor person but it every month it is but it takes a 15-page to other person is it allowed so mature okay we have a me from Bahrain hello salam alayka sure I'm salam I share I have two questions yes the first question is of they say that people who died in the month hola for Ramadan they have special status with Almighty Allah there in a higher position so can you please let us know is it true or no okay second question is how do we make entire inheritance deed before our death distribution of our wealth and property among our relatives among his why friend or brother and sister just how to make the inheritance it e ok I would a solution ok like a la hoja Zakir ok ask a second question what should we do when a person dies if she if you ask if you're asking me as here when the person is now dying in his soul has been taken the first thing to do is to close his eyes and to try to get his Joe up by tying something and there's not from the cinder but this is out of practice because usually the job Falls and maybe something would come in insects or something it's it's a horrible seem to have to take the clothes of the deceased off and to cover him with a sheet to try to loosen up his joint his arms and his legs so that when he is being washed it would be easy to deal with him so it would not be stiff but if you're asking generally when a person dies can we do offer good deeds you can make du'a you can seek Allah's forgiveness you can give charity you can perform number or hodge that's about it audra from saudi audra yes yes your questions I'm on lately yes hello

separately which the cut yes what's the cut are you asking about filters a cut or money is a cut you know the money of the zakat like both of us are honey so we have two together can we use a cutter or do we have to do separately in our ok i will answer in shallow okk supra your quads welcome reheema from Kenya ok I think we lost for him oh I mean from Saudi she says that someone claims that she saw the prophet alayhi salatu salam can this be in a dream can this be possible it is possible the Prophet said that Islam whoever sees me in a vision in a dream that he has seen me for real however scholars interpreted this differently some of them said that this was addressed to the companions and the Companions saw the prophet and lived with him at is awesome so if they see him in a vision or in a dream they can recognize him so definitely this is the Prophet coming to them in the dream and the dream is real other scholars say that this can be to any other person afterwards like you and me so if you see the profit that is a Salaam but you have to be able to describe his features his face his color his shape and it has to fit his description the sealer so if someone says I saw a prophet kasami's like 772 so no this is not the prophetess m if someone says yeah so the property was like five four this is not the prophetess time he was middle in height if he said I saw a prophet or

your friend you have a plan holton non-muslim yes and we got a program like it when the ceremony so you go and attended or not ok wedding ceremony ok sorry I think myself Lovato ok I think we don't have time so we will not take any calls inshallah Nadia says that a 15 year old girl she did not fast the previous Ramadan and until this Ramadan and her father is refusing to pay for the expiation for missing not disturb mode on the previous Ramadan first of all there is no expiation on this if a person did not make up for missed days of previous Ramadan until the current Ramadan was due and then he's going to make for both from a bonds after this Ramadan there is no expiration even if this is five or six or seven years old there is nothing for you to pay or to spend the attitude of the father Allah guides him he should be advised if you don't give for your daughter who are you going to give you're gonna die tomorrow and everything she's gonna inherit so if you're kind to her today she's going to pray for you when you die and if you are stingy and holding back she'll take the money against evil and she will not pray for you or be grateful for you so be kind you to your children that is says that her nieces whenever they hear something good and pleasant they offer to rocca of sugar this is an innovated prayer now they say we're doing it to please Allah and we say jazakum allah here but do something that was done by the Prophet eyes of celeb either you know more than the prophet has a sauna or you're innovating so it's safer for you definitely to be elevating than your claim that you know that more than the prophetess therefore my advice to you is do what the prophet used to do sol la la salem he used to prostrate prostration of gratitude one prostration now if he salah salem knew that praying to a carnival as a form of gratitude is better he would have done it so don't be any extreme and anyway invent something that the Prophet did not do I mean from Kenya he says if i had money for seven months and then i decided to invest it in buying cars and selling it and then make enough profit and buying out the cars and buying property and selling it do i have to pay the cat on the seven months money which i had that it answer is yes because you're buying of a car and selling it and trading in this money is a continuation of possessing the money itself so for example if i started my transaction in the first of safar the month the second month of the lunar year so my money was with me in suffern seven months down the line this is the month of Ramadan the cat is not due yet I started investing it selling and buying commodities stocks cars selling and buying selling and buying once i reach the first of suffer meaning the following year i have to look into the value of the commodity I'm owning or possessing the car is the wealth the money and give 2.5% on that the cattle fritter I did not understand this question in it if I was any i hope i'm not mistaken he says that if someone is poor and i give him the cattle footer can this poor person give his the cattle photo to some other port answer is yes and can this be yes it can't be if i were poor and I'm classified as poor but I have what is sufficient for me for today and tomorrow to eat and somebody gives me the cattle photo it is mandatory for me to give the cattle fatter as well and I shouldn't be worried because people would give me more and much more than what I deserve I mean from Bahrain says people think that those who died during the month of Ramadan have a special place with Allah Allah this is baseless there's nothing to back this up in the authentication of the prophet alayhi salatu salam but we hope that a las mercy is more on them and that the gates of paradise are open and the gates of hell are closed and the amount of people offering salat al janazah and the funeral prayer are much much more than any other month then this would act as an advantage he says how can we distribute our wealth before we die this is not up to you my friend I mean this is an Islamic aspect that the government has no interference in one side I my wealth no matter what that is will be distributed according to the Quran into the sooner so by default my wife will get 18 if I have children my mother would get 16 my father will get 16 my children boys and girls would get an equal share where the boy gets double the female so the females are all alike and the boys are double the share of the females this is prescribed in the Quran now in a case that for example you say I don't live in a Muslim country in the country where I live they only distribute my wealth and according to a will i right in this case you have to distribute it according to the Islamic sharia and you have

person who does if a person does not have male offspring is different than a person who has a son so this depends on the issue and you have to update it on it on you have the right to allocate one third of your possessions for any legitimate reason so you give it for example to who the TV to sponsor their good actions and programs this is sabotage area this continuous charity and so on but not more than one-third then you cannot allocate one third to anyone who would inherit you by default a drop from Saudi Arabia she says if a Muslim said if a non-muslim says assalamo alikom can we say you
