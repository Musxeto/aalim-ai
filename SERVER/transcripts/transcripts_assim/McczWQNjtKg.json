  "transcript": "I did not say this. It was the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. He says, whoever innovates in a religion, what is not part of it, it is rejected. So is the religion fine? Is the religion complete? This day, this is on the 10th year of Hijrah, in Hajjatul Wida'a. This ayah was revealed to the Prophet ﷺ. Allah says, this day I have perfected for you your religion and completed my favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as a religion. So you tell me, is or was Islam completed at the time of the Prophet ﷺ? Yes or no? Can anyone come 10 years after his death and say, whoops, we forgot a loose bolt. Can we please tie it? We would like to increase this. By the way, we saw something that's not normal. Fajr two rak'ah, Dhuhr four, Asr four, Isha four, Maghreb is three. We'd like to add one rak'ah, so that would be all even. Can anyone do this? Why? Because the religion is complete. So now, if someone comes after Maghreb prayer, finishes their Salat, the Imam finishes, faces the congregation and says, Allahumma ghafir lana, Allahumma rahamna, and they say, Ameen, Ameen. Okay, let's read Subhanallah 33 times. Everybody, Subhanallah, Subhanallah, Subhanallah. Let's read Alhamdulillah 33 times. Hey, whoa, hold your horses, my friend. What are you doing? He says, this is dhikr. Good for you. Did the Prophet do it, Alayhi Salaam? Yes or no? So where did you bring this dhikr? Quran, please? It's not found. Sunnah, please? It's not found. So what is this? Khalas, end of story, bid'ah. If someone introduces things to the deen, no authentic hadith backing it up and insists on doing it. Why? Well, our forefathers used to do it. Every time we say, As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah, as-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah. What are you doing? I'm holding my head, doing adhkar. For what? If it is in the sunnah, I will do both. I have no problem. And sometimes with flexibility, I can put my foot on my head. I'm very flexible. But give me what? Dalil. Otherwise, we can introduce to the deen what's not part of it. And the sad thing is, you think that you're doing something good, while Allah Azza wa Jal is angry with you. Satan is happy. The Prophet says, Alayhi Salaam, in an authentic hadith, Allah Azza wa Jal has blocked repentance from everyone who commits bid'ah. Scholars said, whoa, we know that Allah accepts repentance. How would He block repentance? The scholars said, ah, Allah does not prevent in the sense that He does not accept. Allah accepts anyone who repents. But those who innovate, don't think that they're innovating. Go to them when they're swirling, doing dhikr. Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah. And they're swirling in the masjid, like a tornado. Category number five. But for you, mashaAllah, you go to Jannah straight. What are you doing? Said, oh, this is dhikr, dhikr. We are in a state of dhikr. You're in a state of hallucination. Change the brand, my friend. This is not good for you. It's bad. It's making you do things that are not from Islam. Show me any of the companions that he had ever done such a thing. The scholars of Islam, any Tom, Dick or Harry. No one does this. So, excuse me, is the religion complete or are you doing an innovation? Now you put him between a rock and a hard place. So, bid'ah is something that shaytan loves."
