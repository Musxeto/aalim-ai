  "transcript": "she there is a game that is cracked and made available for anyone to play online there is no need to go to any sketchy P pivate websites to get it rather it's easily accessible just via Google search is it allowed to download and play the game in this case if this is a game that is available on the internet and it's Halal there's nothing Haram in it the manufacturers if they wanted to copyright they would have blocked that from Google or from that website or they would have sued them failing to do this makes it available for everyone to share and to use and hence I have no problem in using it it's like going to a public library and picking up a book and reading it I don't have copyrights and the books author has copyrights but they gave access to it and I don't have the ability to check every article I read on the internet whether it's copyrighted or not so what's available and I have not hacked into it I have not cracked it and I'm not intentionally attempting to steal people's rights I see no problem in utilizing that and Allah Knows Best"
