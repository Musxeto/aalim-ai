alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we move on to hadeeth number 98 hadith of Abu Qatada may Allah be pleased with him and who would recite this hadith for us yes brother Abu Qatada reported the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wasalam used to recite in the first 2 rakaat of the her with surat al fatiha and to other surahs prolonging the 4-stroke are more than the second and he would sometimes recite loud enough the worse of quran for us to unity he used to recite in the first to occur of a service through the fatiha and to others who rose prolonging the first rocket more than the second and would recite al-fatiha in the last two rocket and he used to prolong in the first raka a father more than the second Muslim in this hadith okasada may Allah be pleased with him is describing the way that the prophet alayhi wasallam used to recite in the her answer and fajar and as we know that the recitation of the whore and answer is silent so how did they know that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to recite in these prayers there are two ways one mentioned in this hadith that the Prophet may Salam Salam have at sometimes recited the ayah loudly so that we can hear it and the other way was mentioned also in the authentic hadith when one of the tabi een came to a companion of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and asked him in the prayers that were silent such as Doha Nasser how did you know that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to recite the Quran it's a silent prayer and companion said by the trembling of his bee that we can see that from behind his back by the trembling of his beard because when he moves his jaws in the cetacean what happens to the beard it moves so if I'm reciting if I'm talking and there's someone behind me who's deaf he could tell that I'm talking how by the movement of my beard the scholar said this is one of the indications and the evidences that the beard of the Prophet re so Sam was very big to the extent that you can see it from behind his back meaning it's a little bit wide so whenever he speaks you can see it and also the Prophet Allah saw son used to recite aloud one of the verses or two this brings us back to the ruling we discussed before regarding reciting the Quran loudly in loud prayers or reciting it silently in silent prayers 'what's the ruling on it it is a Sunnah meaning if I come in Asia prayer and decide not to recite loudly the whole prayer my prayer is valid in if I decide to recite loudly insalata blower or awesome then the here is a silent prayer but if I decide to recite it loudly in doha Rosser my prayer is valid and it is part of the Sunnah that when you're praying blower or a sir to announce one or two is why because you know that a lot of the Muslims think that silent prayers are silent because there is nothing to do unfortunately as mentioned before people in remote areas think that as long as the silent prayer then you don't recite anything and that is why the a man when he's reciting it would be convenient when he says for example LM natural Holika saw a rock and then what on unco circulating water finally kaduk rock he raises his voice so that everybody hears it this is part of the son so that people would know that he is reciting the Quran and that he is not asleep and this was the Sunnah of the Prophet Elisha stamp now when it comes to the length of the prayers Abu Qatada may Allah be pleased with him tells us that the prophet sallallahu alaihi salam used to recite to Suez in the 1st and 2nd raka of a lahore and also in allah sir but making the first raka longer than the second record in another hadith if I'm not mistaken by Abu Haider houdry or a Buddha I mixed up he explained and described the way of the Prophet SAW in reciting in salat of the her and he said that salat al Assad is half the length of salat of the hook and we know from other hadith that's a lot of dough whore is one of the longest prayers of the day ya neva her and Roger we are unable to decide which is longer because we know for sure the Prophet used to recite between 60 to 100 ayah while in the her the authentic hadith goes like this the call for Lahore would be called and the Prophet would start array in salat WA Salam the first raka and one of us would go to his place to answer the call of nature to the Bakir which is outside the skirts a little bit far from the Masjid and then goes to his house to perform Moodle and then goes to the Masjid and find the Prophet in the first raka a man answers a coronation and goes to his house to perform model and then goes to the message on foot no cars no motorcycles nothing on foot yet he finds a prophet in the first Locker how long was the first record in seemly long how long do the people the Imams nowadays pray it it's one of the shortest prayers why because nobody is enjoying my beautiful voice why should I prolong it Allahu Akbar Allah Allah that's enough no the swing that is to prolong it this is the Sunnah of the Prophet Eraser Salam and the third and fourth raka are shorter than the first and second and in some narrations there are an indication a hint but not clearly stated that in the third and fourth raka he used to recite the Fatiha and another surah with it it's a hint but it's not clearly said how do you understand because he said that the lahore first two rakahs are so long the third and fourth are on the half of that an answer first and second raka are half of the third and fourth of lahore and the third and fourth of acid or half the first and second of assam meaning that the first and second of a sir is a surah with the fatiha then the third and fourth of Lahore was a surah also with the fatiha and what is the ruling we've stated this before we repeat it reciting surah in the first and second raka of the whore or of acid is a sunnah if you don't do it your prayer is valid okay what about the ruling on praying surah after 30 high in the third and fourth raka of both prayers it's permissible there is no problem so you can recite one surah you can search to Suez depending on the amount and it's better than standing without seeing anything because in the third record of the whore if I finish the Fatiha and the amount is still reciting something is still standing what should I do instead of just sitting there watching the people's backs and Sox's and heels and looking at the carpet and at the ants moving and in the flies this is outside the borders of prayer I'm not supposed to do this what you are what to do recite Quran I finished the surah shot another surah he said a searcher never ever stay in the prayer doing nothing because this is a prayer it's a place for you to get closer to Allah so gel to offer forms of worship to make the care to ask Allah for forgiveness and we notice from this hadith that the companions may allah be pleased with them we're so keen on detecting the Sunnah of the Prophet are so solemn and every Muslim should be like this every Muslim I for example and I'm not an example but I know you all are like this every time I want to do something I have to remember what is the evidence behind it so I can tell people easily when someone says ok why do you move your finger while you are in the shot I say because well Jeremy Allah be pleased with him said that the Prophet awesome whenever he sat for prayer for to jihad he used to point his finger index finger moving it supplicating with it so I have a hadith if someone says why do you put your hands like this if someone says why do you faster Asherah for example I have the evidence it adds a lot of value it increases your Eman when everything you do is backed by evidence because without knowledge without this proper evidence you'll be like a feather in the wind people come to you and say why do you grow your beard because it's a Sunnah then they say if it's a Sunnah then I can shave it no no it's not it's not as soon let's watch it is it washable Sunda the guy is confused he I don't know Hollis maybe he does not say I don't know maybe he fights with you because he thinks that you're trying to confuse his religion and that is why a lot of the Muslims without knowledge are a lot of the times arrogant they shout at people they curse people why because they are so afraid that they want to take their Eman and their belief that they're defensive and this is good because you're a man is like a jewel you're protecting it people are trying to take it from you but if you have knowledge you can put it in a safe box so anyone who tries to steal it from you I have knowledge I can protect myself but when you don't have a man when your man is so little or your knowledge is not there how can you defend yourself and that is why a lot of the times we fail to answer people's doubts and we when we fail what do we do we shout we curse and we fight and this is wrong this is a sign of weakness everybody can curse everybody can fight but you're not a gorilla you a gorilla just fights this is not a Muslim a Muslim always uses proof evidence and logic that goes under the Quran and Sunnah to explain his position and to explain his religion we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back and welcome back the following hadith hadith number 99 was narrated by jew bayer even Mottram may Allah be pleased with him this companion says that I heard the prophet of allah sallallahu wasallam reciting surah to pour in motherland prayer and we know that sort of the tour is not a short surah but it is not among the long sewers and this is what is known as Alma facile scholars say that there are long sewers Alma facile they disputed where Alma fossil starts and most likely it starts from surat al hajj or odd and it moves down to juzu 27 28 29 and 30 where you have the short surahs and they call this the short of Alma fossil and Cerato tour is among the long sewers of Alma fossil and the compiler is indicating the general mistake that a lot of the Muslims do though it's not a it's not wrong it's not sinful a lot of Muslims in Mallory prayer they only recite the short surahs over Mufasa however he the Prophet recited what the longer version of a muscle and in other hadith authentic we have the Prophet reciting surah al-araf chapter 7 which is one of the longest stories of the Quran in Maghreb so we learned from this that the Prophet Allah saw some sunnah is not to stick only to the short surahs having said that one should always go back to the basics what are the basics when you lead people in prayer always try to be brief and to have your prayer perfect because behind you there are those who are weak there are those who are ill and there are those who have needs they would like to attend after prayer so you should not postpone them as much hadith number 100 and it's in the same topic so and it's short that's why I'm reading it myself I brought the Azam may Allah be pleased with him and with his father reported that I heard the prophet of allah salallahu alaihe wasalam reciting in asia prayer with surah 13 no teenage among the shortest of all mufasal' and i have never heard anyone with a sweeter voice than him sallallahu alayhi wasallam nor better recitation and this goes without saying that the best of voices was Cheryl Mary Glee or share through the shrim or the prophet alayhi salatu salam it goes without doubt that the best of those who recite the Quran is the Prophet Ali salatu salam and then are those who you feel close to allah when you hear it some of the recitals you hear their quran and you enjoy the voice or you enjoy the clarity of the words coming out or you feel good when you hear it this is not a good recitation a good recitation is the one that makes you on The Stand Quran and it gets you closer to Allah and by getting closer to allah azza wajal we mean that you have this kosher you have this love and fear at the same time for Allah when you pray this is what we want in prayer so the prophets recitation Iceland by far was the best his voice was the sweetest of all and from this hadith we learned that Asia prayer though it is almost in the beginning of the night yet this does not mean that you should prolong it and people don't have anything to do let's spend the next hour in prayer no we will get to know that this is against the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam also we learned from this hadith that it is highly recommended that you beautify your voice with the Quran so when you recite the Quran some of the brothers just recite it without any beautification so hum the lower blood I mean over and over him malik you mean you are kind of saying what is this see no no no I don't want to be soft I don't want any melody to come in no this is definitely wrong but at the same time you do not think the Quran you do not use tunes of contemporary musicians or so to recite the Quran as if you are listening to a song but you recite the Quran in the proper way and manner that all the Imams have been reciting it since the time of the Prophet sallallaahu Salah until these days you have to know how to recite the Quran in a fashion that makes the people love the Quran as we've said before there are people who are repellant they make people run away from Islam and among them are those who give the event in some Masjid have been - I've heard a van so bad that it is unimaginable the sound is ugly the pronunciation is awful and the way he's doing it is horrible remember who was the man who saw the event of the law it means eight yet the Prophet did not allow him to give the iron he's the one who saw it in the dream and he told him give it to be loud but he complained he's a prophet of Allah and he yeah I saw it I should call it seed no he has a better voice so calling the Iran is essential you have a better a good voice it's not just to have a loud voice and leading the people in prayer also requires that you have a beautiful voice to call people to have kosher and salat we will take your questions yes brother second row nowadays in Bombay particularly there are certain messages which are known to finish that the Ravi there's a competition yes the Torabi gets over in 25 minutes the other gets over in 35 minutes so the 25 minute is more preferred by the Mossad Legion the situation is also like this the Imam also resize phosphorus where is the tranquility and the who shoe in that chair do you have to look for our Masjid that has this I don't know the message of mumbay so I cannot advise you ok all over the world there are people who pray to please the people so you will find that the message near malls and and markets they finish in 20 minutes you find message in remote areas where people are relaxed and cooled down they take an hour to finish their taraweeh I've been in Egypt and the first week of Ramadan few years back and one of my friends is a sheikh well-known chef one of the top three chefs in Egypt I had dinner with him and he told me that throughout Ramadan they pray eight hours taraweeh and I was it excuse me eight hours and he says this is this has been doing it for the past few years we're praying in my Masjid which is in my home so we have like 50 70 people we pray taraweeh all this long in a bra in Saudi Arabia there is a message in well-known Masjid they finished the Quran in taraweeh every three days and every night in taraweeh they recite 10 juzo so every three night they finish the Quran and I know Masjid elsewhere they don't finish the Quran except every four or five years every Ramadan day they recite a certain portion and then finishing the second Ramadan the third and the fourth so you look for the Masjid that you feel the tranquility and sometimes the track will 'ti does not mean quantity sometimes tranquillity does not mean quantity tranquility does not mean that how many Jews can I finish because you can finish the whole Quran five six times and you did not benefit anything the man is reading 160 miles per hour I don't know what is reading a lot I think there is an a you tube a clip a Ferrari Imam or something like this a man seriously seriously in Turkey I've seen it the guys praised like I'm included that's it good luck and it's not Allahu Akbar Allah Allah Allah bottom and the people are not catching his prayer and their prayer is invalid this is not praying this is playing it's not with an hour it's with an L so you have to look for the Masjid that follows the sooner that you get the soul of your prayer in not so that you boast with people masha'Allah I prayed behind any moment he finished five juicer or I prayed behind this imam of this masjid oh that masjid who used to be in a harem no I pray because this is between me and allah azzawajal where I find my heart and where I find the Sunnah is being practiced just when we studied that at least that last salat al limón like Marketo so it says that it is last salata so can we conciliate this at ease by it does not say that la rocca so in the initial in the last two silent well even if you play one surah fatiha it is accepted or in Zohar even if you pray once because it does not say about the raka it says about the Salah the negation is for the whole Salah meaning that if you do not recite al-fatiha in every rakah then your prayer is invalid not in what raka the brother is saying this hadith can we understand it in saying that if I recited fact had the first raka and the remaining three records I don't pray I don't recite it then my prayer is valid because the Prophet said last Allah there is no prayer valid for those who do not reset the Fatiha and he did not say that the raka is invalid if you do not recite the first hand this is not true the correct thing is like voodoo la ilaha lamella you do Allah whoever does not perform mudal his salat is invalid we don't say that one raka if i prayed three records and in the fourth raka I passed wind so would I say that my prayer is valid no because all connected together and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila or Salaam alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
