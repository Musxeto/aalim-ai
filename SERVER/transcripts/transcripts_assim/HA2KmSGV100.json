  "title": "Making up missed Sunnah Prayer of Maghrib - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "as for Maghrib see the son of Margaret is bound with Maghrib itself so after I finished the fault if I had a legitimate reason not to pray the Sunnah and I was trying to pray it before Asia is called for but I couldn't because I was so busy I was engaged I forgot then you can pray it after Asia but likewise if you are like our friend previously mentioned and you skipped it without any legitimate reason and now you want to make it up at the end of the day the answer is that I'm inclined that it is not permissible and Allah knows best"
