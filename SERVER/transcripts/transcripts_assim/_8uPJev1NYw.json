  "transcript": "second question is that after the Salah she makes drawn and she asks is this permissible and should I start making dua for myself and my family and then for others or can I do a mixture of both first of all making dua after every fourth Salah this is an innovation it was not reported by the prophet alayhi salaatu Senate so you can make dua before offering Salam in the Salah after the jihad and before the syrup make as many door as you want because the place of the vicar is after Salam the place of dora is while in prayer before Salam so this is the most authentic opinion and of course you start by making dua for yourself and your loved ones and then make dua for others because eventually you want to save yourself first and you want your door for yourself and your loved ones to be fulfilled first rather than the other"
