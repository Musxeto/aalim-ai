  "transcript": "uh from the us uh one question uh if i'm reciting quran and let's say somebody rings the doorbell can i stop in the middle of the ayah says is it permissible to um interrupt my recitation of a verse of the quran in the middle whether to answer the phone or to open a door well this is up to you is it haram no it's not haram is it inappropriate indeed it is because it won't take you more than five to ten seconds to continue the ayah so might as well do it but if someone says no i want to interrupt it here i don't want to listen to the end i want to do whatever i want to do this is not that this is not prohibited it's not haram it's not sinful but it is inappropriate"
