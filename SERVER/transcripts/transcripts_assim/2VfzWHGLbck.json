  "transcript": "Ali from kazakistan um uh I'm asking a question on behalf of someone else a single mother raised a kid in an Islamic way since his childhood with a sick carrot with both good words and explanations and P punishing when it didn't help trying every possible way but H son is now in his 30 days and he still doesn't pray or fast during Ramadan Etc now the question is not about the son it's about the mother after trying everything all she's left with is just to make Dua for him which she does in every prayer the question is at this point is the mother being held accountable for him not praying or fasting how old is the boy he's almost 30 30 no she's not accountable at all he's an adult and he will go to hell alone so all what she could do is to make Dua and to remind him uh diplomatically and nicely in a way that may benefit him but no she's not accountable because she did her due diligence she did what Allah ordered her and at the end of the day the guid this is in Allah's hands it's like saying is Prophet um sinful for his son dying as a cafir of course not he did everything in his possession uh uh to guide him and the son chose not to be guided may Allah protect us all"
