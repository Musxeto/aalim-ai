  "transcript": "m alhamd dear brothers and sisters in Islam last time we met we talked about the second migration of the Muslims the oppressed Muslims to abisinia at the east coast of Africa and the attempts of the pagans of the people of Mecca to send their envoys to convince the king of abenia to send them back again to their people that was a failure now the people had the permission from the King to worship Allah Asel in his country and they were the safe ones it was a safe haven and anyone that attacked them would be an attack on the king himself the king said that I would not accept bribes from you so that I would send your people with you as a Allah asael did not take any bribe from me when he restored my kingdom to me and the story behind that is asah the present King and Nashi his father was the king before him his father had only one son and this King had a brother who had lots of sons so the people thought that having one son is not good for the kingdom in in case some something happens to him so the brother assassinated his brother the king and he assumed power and asaha the son the legitimate Crown Prince was sold as a slave and he worked as a shepherd while the brother was ruling his sons proved to be unfit to assume power they were all uh Bad Boys uh not fit to assume the powers of a whole Kingdom so when he died they could not give the power to any of his sons so the people had to look for the legitimate person who should assume power they looked for him while he was caring for his sheep they bought him from his master took him immediately to the Palace put him on the throne and put the crown on his head and told him now you are the king of abisinia so he appreciated the blessing of Allah Asel of restoring his powers to him again and giving him his kingdom back and that is why he felt that it was his right not to be unfair or unjust to anyone that comes to him and that is why he was a fair King but when the king allowed the Muslims to apply their pillars of Islam in the Kingdom of abasa didn't he afraid that uh like this Islam will spirit in his kingdom on the contrary he wished that Islam would spread because because he himself became a Muslim he accepted Islam on the spot but due to the fact that he had was surrounded by priests and clergymen he could not show that and he could not ask his people to convert to Islam it was a free country you want to become a Muslim go ahead you want to remain Christian go ahead and that is why when he died the prophet sallallah wasallam was in Medina at the time when he died the prophet told his companion that we are going to perform uh uh the funeral prayer absence prayer the absence pray in his absence of course and he told them that your brother an Nashi has just died so he described him as a brother and he prayed the funeral prayer on his behalf in his absence which tells us that he was a Muslim so this fair and wise King did not was not afraid of Islam spreading in his country and by the way alhamdulillah now it is a Muslim country and all the countries around it it was not conquered by the sword only the spread of Islam went there by the name of Allah and by those traitors who spread Islam alhamdulillah the Muslims in ABIA stayed there for for a lot of years maybe uh 10 or more years in this Safe Haven they have enjoyed praying fasting without being freely freely without being oppressed going back to Mecca it was a different story altogether the punishment the torture the oppression was still going on and on and on it was physical it was mental it was in any means that the pagans could inflict harm to the Muslims we know that Abu laab the uncle of the Prophet Alam was among his fearest enemies he was one of the strongest people taking position against Islam he opposed it 100% unfortunately he had two sons he had and and they were married to the prophet's daughters umum anday and the minute the prophet s wasallam declared his message they divorced his daughters so this was mentally harmful for the prophet sallallahu alaih alh wasallam to see his loved ones his daughters being divorced because of the message of Allah but that that did not deter him sallallahu alhi wasallam from pursuing his call and message who was the cousin of the prophet and his son-in-law after that divorce started insulting the prophet Sall wasallam and in one incident he grabbed the prophet from his shirt tore his shirt and spit on his face but his spit did not reach the prophet Alat wasam and he said so many bad things about the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam that made the prophet raise his hand and pray to Allah saying oh Allah send him one of your dogs that was it and the pagans were so afraid when someone makes a supplication of Praise towards them especially in the mecca areaa soon afterwards left on a business trip with a caravan to the north of Arabia to a sham and at one night they were camping and they were hearing the sounds of lions and wolves it was night it was scary so they and he knew that his the the prophet's prayer is going to be answered and his companions were relaxing him it's okay calming him down there's nothing wrong don't be afraid he said no no no no I know Muhammad is in Mecca my he's my cousin I know him and I'm here miles and miles away from him to the north of Arabia and I know that he's going to kill me while he's in Mecca so his friends started making circles circles circles to protect him in the camp and he was in the middle and the center of that Circle and hours later comes a very big lion going and passing these circles and everyone is terrified they can is a lion and he went on and on he passed everyone until he went TOA and got his head off and everyone knew that this is the result of the prayer of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam of that person who insulted him and who attacked the prophet was am and it's been seven years since the prophet Alam declared his message and called people to Islam and when the pagans felt that they are failing in their strategy they cannot stop people from embracing Islam they could not uh uh bring the people back from abisinia when they thought that they were losing it and it's coming out of their hands they decided to assassinate the prophet Alat I want to ask a question why they aren't converted to Islam although they sated by Lon uh it was not onlya that should have proved to them that the prophet was honest and sincere there were so many miracles the Quran itself their dignitaries once they go and talk to the prophet Sall Ali wasallam trying to convince him trying to seduce him you want Power you want money you want women you want medication we'll give that to you whatever you want just leave what you have the minute the prophet read sallam verses of the Quran the man completely transformed the Quran is the biggest miracle and they all know we are told in the Quran that they know deep down inside that this is right but they just refuse it on the surface Abu jahal one of the enemies of the Prophet Salli wasallam said Muhammad we are not saying that you're lying but what you're bringing is lie he knows that he is not lying and he cannot accept this because of the arrogance he told them once in a meeting just simply say one word and all the Arabs and the non-arabs will be at your feet they will be following you they will be accepting whatever you tell them so they told him it's not one word that we will say we will say 10 words what do you want us to say he told them say just say that there is no God but Allah and then it they came back to their senses and say said to him you want us to shun all our Idols to disbelieve in our or all our Idols this cannot be done this cannot be we we are believers of it so their refusal is not because of disbelief it is out of arrogance they're so arrogant to the extent that they're not willing to accept the message of allaha and that is why they're trying to fight it they're trying they're going out of their way to fight it and to preserve and keep the powers in in Mecca everybody is coming in pilgrimage to worship their Idols what would happen if there were no Idols no pilgrimage pilgrims will come this is what they thought but they didn't think of the positive side which was that if you uh witness that there is no God but Allah that Allah will bring everybody in this to you and this is the case I think that we have a short break and inshallah we'll be right back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been Muslim for 50 years or 5 minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day our our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people better Muslims we want to serve Allah Almighty with all our hearts in the this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about Islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve Allah we'll have Studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk h.v so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you and welcome back the pagans felt that they were losing ground the Muslims a group of them have migrated to abisinia and they failed in getting them back people were reverting to Islam the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam was spending his time calling others to Islam and he would be uh he would get a positive response from some and a negative from the others and the people kept on increasing in their numbers so they felt that they were left with only one solution and that was to assassinate the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam once the prophet Sall wasallam knew of this his next of kin out of their tribal relations felt necessary to protect him though they were not Muslims but they felt that this is something that touched their pride and they were very proud people the Arabs at the time so the tribe of mutalib and Hashim as we know is was the leader of uh the pagans of the people of Mecca long time ago then he had ABD mana and from ABD manaf we have mutalib and Hashim who were brothers and from Hashim his son was ABD mutalib and then Abdullah and then the prophet Sall alhi wasallam so these cousins or these brothers and their cousins Al mutalib and Hashim decided to go into a small Valley that was known to be sh Talib and this part of Mecca was only for Abu Talib and those who were related to him so they went in there to protect the prophet sallallahu alaihi alhi wasallam for any attempt on his life the pagans did not like this so they decided that they bycott them in all means and they wrote a treaty a paper filled with Injustice saying that it is forbidden for anyone to sell them or to buy from them or to talk to them or to marry any of their uh uh to marry from them or to give them in marriage it was supposed to be a total bycott and they hung this certificate in the Caba the prophet Sall wasallam and those who were with him were stranded in that area for 3 years two to three years it was so difficult for them the people kept on hearing the cries of the children every single night because of hunger they did not have enough to eat they did not have anything to drink they surrounded them and made it impossible for them to go out and they prevented anyone from their relative who were outside who did not go in with them to send them anything and in one uh uh incident it was reported that the nephew of Khadijah may Allah be pleased with her the wife of the Prophet Alam tried to get a pound of flour to her and he was prevented by Abu jahal it was so difficult and they were so hungry to the extent that they used to eat tree leaves that were found wherever they want they can and you know that it's there nothing to eat one of the companions of the of the Prophet tells us about that era he said once I was urinating and I heard a strange S Voice under my urine to that extent and I looked and I found a piece of old leather of an animal I don't know what animal that that was so I took it I cleaned it I washed it and I cooked it and I ate it and it helped me days and days it helped me a week to stay alive and fit look at something he urinated on and it's a piece of dead uh it's a leather of a dead animal yet he had to eat it because he had no other choice it was really difficult time but all of this was for the cause of Allah and to protect the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam I think that Believers and begins in this days make the same in what sense instance in Sudan and Palestine the the other groups and people um haven't food haven't this is this is very true this is very true Muslims are oppressed everywhere in Palestine for instance I know families that may feed only on one onion the whole day I know families that would share with others the few vegetables they have and they are so happy they are So Satisfied while the the the West is so filthy rich to the extent extent that they throw the good things their goods their butter their milk and uh the sea just to get rid of it so it would not uh uh reduce its prices the Muslims in Palestine and I know this for a fact are suffering so much but no one from the international media is Honorable enough to go and re reveal these fact facts to the world countes in Africa in Africa yes yes in in Somalia and Sudan they are in poverty and no one gives a helping hand here it was the same case the pagans made it so tight that nothing came in and nothing go went out but there is always a light at the end of the tunnel never ever feel despair never lose hope in Allah because Allah subhana will send something or someone to assist and help even if he was not a Muslim and this is exactly what happened a group of pagans not from the first generation but from the second generation the youngsters who had relatives among those in the Talib they felt that this was unfair fair and they gathered once in secret and they started complaining is this fair is it fair that we sleep in our houses and we have whatever food and water we want while our countrymen our brothers and relatives are suffering and they were all of the dignitaries of quay but the second level so they were asking each other so what can we do and they came up with a brilliant idea they say they said that we will go and face the first generation our uncles and say that this is unfair and unjust and each one of us supports the other so they agreed the following day they went to the club or to the sh Place Dad where they used to meet and consult all the dignitaries of qur were there so one of of them stood and said this is unfair our families our relatives our uh cousins are suffering while we are here enjoying life this is unfair Abu jahal stood up and said you say lie shut up and sit down it is fair so one of the other supporters said no you are saying lie what what he said was right and a third one stood up and said yes what you said Abu jahel is wrong and what the two of them said is right and a fourth one and a fifth one and a sixth one they're all supporting so they were lobbying conspir it's not a conspiracy it's a good in the good sense but they were lobbying and Abu jahal sat down and said this is something that was cooked overnight this is a conspiracy that was made overnight and all the pagans the dignitaries agreed that this was unfair after 3 years so Abu Talib came out of the Sher and they saw him and there was strange him coming out he told them my nephew sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that Allah Asel has destroyed your certificate in the Kaa it was in the middle of in the Kaa it's closed and if he was telling lie I will give him to you and and if he was telling the truth then this is another in a series of truthful things that he's been saying so they went to the Caba they opened the door they went to take the certificate and to their surprise it ate the worm ate anything that had the name of Allah so the only thing that was left was the Injustice and the wrongdoing of quray to the Muslims while the name of Allah uh the good things were all eaten away so they have they torn the certificate or what remained of it and they allowed the Muslims to go out and practice their normal life this was done by the grace of Allah and it shows us that always at the end of the tunnel there is a a light and if you are patient Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala will support you I want to ask a question the pagans make a PO to the prophet him why we can't poot to the unbelievers the West for example botting is a very sensitive issue now they've by cotted the prophet Salli wasallam but the prophet sallam did not bycott them even when he went to Medina he did not bik Cott them it depends on your commercial uh uh uh um relations and what's good for you and what's not boycotting is acceptable in limited places and areas for a a justifiable reason but you cannot boycott the whole world and say buycotting so it there has to be a reason behind that you have another not the whole world not the whole world the uh the countries abused to the Islam insulted Islam almost all countries abuse Islam in one way or the other you cannot you cannot live in isolation and boycotting is not the only way to deal with people now the prophet Sall wasallam fought with the Romans fought with the Persians fought with the pagans but he never boycotted them he never told people do not buy Roman product do not buy Persian products on the contrary he used to wear some Ro Roman materials things brought to him from clothings brought to him from Rome this is a different story in some cases you may find it uh reasonable and it's it might be needed for you to boycott a country just to show them the gravity of what they have done and this was done for example in 1973 when uh uh uh the assault was done o on Egypt and we had had to bcot uh uh the west west from oil and and they felt the gravity of that but this is exactly what they're doing to us so if they buycott us then we can do the same this is a political decision it is not our decision to make I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program inshallah until we meet next time m m"
