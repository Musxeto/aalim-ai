  "title": "Adding Al Haj to our name after doing hajj, does it affect validity of one's hajj? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "sheikh my question was what is the ruling on adding the word al hajj to our name after we have done hajj and what about the reward of the one who does this while having an intention of showing off this is not permissible as it is a form of showing off of something that people do but specifically in this ritual so i fast every single ramadan why don't i call myself asam awesome it even rhymes beautifully or why wouldn't i say al-musa awesome because i pray five times a day why is it with hajj because this is the journey of a lifetime so people think that oh he went for hajj which means that he came back sinless and purified from his sins so so he's a better person than us so so if he says something we believe him and he wouldn't he wouldn't lie would he how would you know there are people who perform hajj every single year and they are the worst of muslims they are corrupt they bribe and take bribes and they lie and cheat and they do the whole nine yards does hajj impact their being good humans or not no their deeds do therefore it is not permissible for people to label themselves as hajj now if others call you hajj awesome and you don't like this and you try to tell them and they insist on it so be it but you don't write in front of your name al-hajj awesome and you do this and that does it impact the validity of the hajj it seems that it doesn't if they perform their hajj fully for the sake of allah if this intention of showing off came afterwards after it was completed it's sinful but they it would not affect the validity of the hajj allah knows best"
