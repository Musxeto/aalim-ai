  "transcript": "yaseen says um allah said do not love this life hereafter is better my question is how to remove the love of this life well i don't know where you got this from allah tells us not to be attached to this life and give it priority over the hereafter there has to be balance allah has made everything for us in this life and he allowed us to enjoy what is halal so he gave us spouses he gave us children he gave us wealth he gave us halal food he gave us halal entertainment and he tells us to enjoy without extravagance so your understanding that allah said that don't love this life is wrong the prophet himself islam used to send people to bring him sweet water he used to love to eat the meat of a shoulder of an animal he used to love water that was sweetened with some dates in it so all of these things tell you that loving the halal things that allah had made for us is totally legit what is not permissible is to give it priority over the hereafter or to be attached to it and not to pay any attention to your afterlife now this is negligence this is totally prohibited allah says in the quran but seek through that which allah has given you the home of the hereafter and yet do not forget your share of the world prior prioritization is the most important meaning allah gave us so many things with these things we should keep in mind the hereafter my house in paradise my faith in my grave so i have to cultivate all of this through working in this life having said that allah tells you don't put yourself in a prison cell and neglect what is halal no don't forget what is halal which is a portion of the vast majority of what you do for the hereafter and this is why when three men came to the prophet and wanted to surpass him allah in good deeds so they thought so one said i will fast and never break my fast the second said i will pray all night and never sleep and the third one said i will never marry women. so the prophet got angry at his son and he said i am most fearful of allah and most knowledgeable of him among you i fast and i break my fast i pray and i sleep and i marry women whoever chooses other than my sunnah is not from among us or is not from me so this shows us that you can enjoy life you can enjoy everything in it as long as it's halal it's not extravagance and your heart is not attached to it because then it will become your torment no your heart is attached to allah to jannah to the hereafter but this is something that is halal allah is giving to you allah has given us this tea to drink and it's halal should i say no i'm not gonna drink tea because i love tea and i have to deprive myself from it no this is something allah made halal allah knows best"
