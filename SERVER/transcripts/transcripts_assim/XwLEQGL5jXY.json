  "transcript": "says about his stepfather and we know that was anna's stepfather may allah be pleased with them and he was a wealthy man he had a lot of farms palm tree farms and his most favorite was was a farm known as bayur and it was close to the masjid of medina the prophet assalam used to always enter it and he used to like drinking from its well because it had sweet water anna says when allah the almighty revealed this ayah never will you attain the good reward until you spend in the way of allah from that which you love when this ayah was revealed recited the ayah and he said to him the most beloved wealth of my is by and it is for the sake of allah i'm giving it in charity because i want to attain the good reward that allah has promised so here you are o prophet of allah do with it whatever you wish instant reaction to a verse he heard instant on the spot he gave not a portion of his wealth the most beloved thing to his heart the most favorite thing to his heart wanting and anticipating the rewards from allah the prophet commanded that he says that's a very good thing you're doing that is a winning wealth a successful wealth and i heard what you said and i recommend that you allocate it among your kinship so the prophet gave it back to him telling him you know who is more needy of your kinship give it to them so abu talha did that and distributed it upon his kinship and again this hadith is agreed upon narrated by bukhari and muslim how many of us reflected upon this ayah which we had heard thousands of times who among us was moved by it like was moved and instantly reacted to it how many around us need food clothes charity and how much do we give from our own food clothes and charity to the poor yes we do give but is what we give the best of what we have or it's the worst that we're not using that we don't have any need for and if someone were to give it to us we would not accept it what is this you want me to wear this what kind of shoes they're three years old and you want me to wear it i would not accept such a gift or a charity yet this is the quality of the things that we give all what we see in our ummah today is attributed to our distance from the quran from reflecting upon it and pondering upon it and implementing it in our lives"
