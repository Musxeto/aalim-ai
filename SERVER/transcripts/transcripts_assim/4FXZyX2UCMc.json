  "transcript": "foreign number 96 in our beautiful booklet muslim the fortress of the muslim i seek allah's forgiveness and i turn to him in repentance to repeat this a hundred times a day now this is not from the morning and evening at car this is the general trend because the prophet used to allah command his followers to say it and say that i used to do this myself and the companions would count the prophet asking allah for forgiveness and repenting to him more than 70 times at one gathering so this is the minimum that muslims should do i seek refuge in allah no i want allah's assistance no i seek allah's forgiveness so this is direct astag for allah i seek allah's forgiveness and not only that i repent to him so what's the difference between seeking allah's forgiveness and repenting repentance is a broader term because it has conditions so you have to be sincere you have to have deep remorse you have to quit the sin you have to intend not to do it etc while seeking forgiveness can be said by the tongue for allah which may or may not accompany repentance but it's a vicar nevertheless when it is going side by side with your heart then it has the full benefit and the full impact because you're saying it with conviction and this is a beautiful vicar that we unfortunately have neglected throughout our days and night hadith number 97 the prophet taught us i take refuge in perfect words from the evil he has created to say this three times in the evening and as well three times in the morning and this is the most authentic opinion to say it in the morning and the evening what does it mean i seek refuge in allah azzawajal's perfect words what are allah's perfect words quran which is one of allah's attributes allah's speech and allah's orders these are all allah's perfect words why are they perfect because there's no fault in them and they there are no flaws in them this is from allah the almighty so i seek refuge and i take refuge in allah's perfect perfect words and this is a beautiful dua not only to be said in the morning and evening but also if one where to go to a new place so if you're traveling and then you set camp the prophet told us to say this dua and whoever says it would not be harmed by a reptile or by uh snakes or scorpions or or the likes and also when you set foot in a new accommodation for example a new house a hotel room you also say this dua as directed by the prophet sallam hadith number 98 a lot of the muslims think that offering salutation upon the prophet o allah sent praise and peace upon our prophet muhammad ten times in the morning and in the evening they think that this is authentic and whoever does this would attain the intercession of the prophet alaihis salat but shaykh al-bani may allah have mercy on his soul said that this is not authentic and that we should not say it moving on to a new chapter and this chapter deals with remembrance before sleeping hadith number 99 i'm going to bed you're not invited what should i do there is a process that we should follow people would say come on i'm tired i just want to sleep no no no no no islam all revolves on worshiping allah azza even when you want to retire to your bedroom so what should i do well the prophet alaihis allah whenever he went to bed he used to gather his hands like this and he would spit in them and this is dry spit not with saliva it's dry spit like this so the first thing you do you gather your palms you blowing them dry uh uh spit like that and then recite after that the last three cults bismillah and after you do that you wipe over the entire body as much as possible with these hands beginning with his the prophet used to do or begin with his head face and then all parts of the body he would do this three times so the this is the first thing beside the three coils wipe your face your head the whole entire body and then repeat this process again and then repeat it for the third time and this is part of the atkar of going to bed this helps protect you from any harm that may come to you while asleep insha'allah it protects you from nightmares and the likes this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you foreign [Music] foreign"
