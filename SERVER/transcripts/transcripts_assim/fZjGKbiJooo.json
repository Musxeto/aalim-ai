  "title": "Swearing in the name of Allah",
  "transcript": "we have an email from Brother Bas he says is it allowed to swear in the name of Allah saying I'll avoid such and such Haram actions what is the expiation for one who breaks such uh a vow first of all you are ordered not to do anything Haram so for example smoking is Haram it's harmful it kills you and it's waste of money and the smell is dirty and it gives you health problems and Allah tells you do not kill yourself so it is prohibited to smoke now someone tried to quit smoking and kick the habit he couldn't so in a moment of truth he says wall I will not smoke a single cigarette after today and couple of weeks later he fell weak and he smoked so initially is he allowed to swear the answer is yes you may swear to prevent yourself from doing something whether Halal Oram of course with Haram it's by default but if it gives you uh incentive then it's okay but what happens if someone breaks his vow and he does what he took an oath not to do in this case he has to give experation and the experation for breaking your oath is to feed 10 poor people from the middle of what you eat usually so do not buy them one single flat hamburger the norm that the jurors say is that you give half for each uh poor person which is equivalent to 1.25 kilogram of rice but if you buy a full meal a good normal meal then this would suffice yeah for example one says listen I'll buy two uh Falafel sandwiches Falafel is nothing and yes it fills them up but this is not the normal meal of the middle of what we usually eat so buy them some uh uh uh cooked rice with um half a chicken for example that would be uh a normal meal so you do this or you clothe them or you free a slave choose one of these three if financially you are uh incapable of doing any of these three then the second option would be if you're not financially uh uh able Allah tells you to fast three days a lot of the Muslims jump to fasting though they have money they think that okay I said W I'm not going to school tomorrow and then my father uh forced me to go so I have to give experation I'll fast three days no you have to feed 10 people 10 poor people and if you are unable then you may fast three uh days should be should they these days be consecutive in a row no you can split them inshallah"
