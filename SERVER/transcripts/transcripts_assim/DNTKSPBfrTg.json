  "transcript": "Zayn al-Din from the UK. Okay, how are you Sheikh? It's been a long time I haven't called. Alhamdulillah, you have only like 20 seconds, so make it quick. Okay, so one point. Is a father who is divorced from his wife permitted to deprive his children from their inheritance? No, he is not. No Muslim on earth has the ability or the authority to prevent any of his heirs, regardless of what they had done or committed, from the inheritance. Because this is something that Allah the Almighty has divided Himself, and no one can interfere with such a division. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website, and you will find counseling sessions, and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me, and let's speak about it inshaAllah, within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azza Wa Jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah. Al-Fatiha."
