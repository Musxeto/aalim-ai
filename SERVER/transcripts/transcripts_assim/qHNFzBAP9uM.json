  "title": "Ghusl or Wudu with a sensor that checks diabetes, nicotine or birth control patches, cast or bandage",
  "transcript": "omar says i have a sensor that sticks onto my arm to monitor my blood sugar levels it's much better and easier to monitor by diabetes or to monitor my diabetes i cannot take it off as and when i feel like to is it okay to do russell with this the sensor is usually placed in a person's shoulder or somewhere on his body which without any doubt constitute a barrier from water reaching it reaching the skin and we know that if there is a barrier that prevents water from reaching your body organs when performing wudu or performing russell that this is not a valid widow or a unless there is a justifiable legitimate islamic reason for that so yes when a person has a bandage on his arm or if he has a cast because of a broken limb or something he cannot remove that he cannot wash underneath it so wiping over it would do the job whether it's russell or wudu but with such senses or in other cases when you have nicotine patches or when you have contraceptives some women have a special plaster they put that prevents them from conceiving and then they ask about russell putting these things are not is not a necessity it is not like when someone is having a cast or a bandage over a wound that he must have it otherwise harm will get into it you can always measure your diabetes with the normal procedure that everybody does pricking your finger and and getting a sample and that's it yes this one is convenient because you just scan over it with the machine and tells you your diabetes levels but it's not a necessity hence you do not have the permission to have it on and have russell with it on because it prevents water from reaching your skin and a large ocean knows best"
