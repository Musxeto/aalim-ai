  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. So we know that when we pray, the woman, who is in front of us, she prays with prayer, if I understand correctly. But when we go to the masjid now for Taraweeh and sometimes when we go late for Isha, and we are trying to make up for the missed prayer, and we have women, you know, that have finished their praying, going in front of us, and children also, either male or female, between, you know, like 10 years old, does that break the prayer? If a woman, an adult woman, who had reached the age of puberty, passes between your feet and the position of your prostration, this breaks your prayer if you're praying alone. If you're praying in congregation behind the imam, in the congregation prayer, and they pass, this does not impact your prayer. Because the sutra of the imam is sutra for you. But if you're a late comer, and the imam gives salam, and you stand up, now you're on your own, you're an individual. If a woman wants to pass, you have to stop her. Even if you have to push her, because she cannot break the sanctuary of your prayer as such. If she insists, then your prayer is invalid, and you have to repeat the prayer, and Allah knows best. Boys and girls, by the way, don't fall under this category. Only an adult woman."
