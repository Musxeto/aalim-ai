  "transcript": "sumaya says is it permissible to combine the and the sir or Maghrib and Isha after coming back home from a journey or must we only combine while traveling first of all Gemma or combining or joining the prayers is not restricted to traveling it is permissible to do whenever there is a real genuine need for it so while travelling it's a concession from Allah it's a gift from allah azzawajal you can do that all the time and by traveling we mean that you are travelling from distance from destination a which is your hometown to elsewhere so as long as you've left the borders of your town and you traveling elsewhere you can shorten and combine until you return what somalia is asking about is that we have two types of joining the prayers either to make the latter prayer earlier or to postpone the first prayer and pray it later so we have a set of valoran ah so this is one set I can combine and then I have Maghrib and Isha and this is the second set I can combine badger cannot be combined with anything can I combine author and mother it no these are two different sets so Laura Nasir mother live in Asia two different sets one form of joining is to pray the latter at the time of the first so the event of Lahore has been called I pray the I finish it and then I pray uh sir afterwards one says check but the add-on of a sir is in two and a half hours from now so no problem this is joining the second way of doing it is the event of the has been called I don't pray the and I postpone it until the answer I then is given once the after stop event is given I can pray the first then after that I can pray uh sir afterwards same thing goes with mother I can pray Asia at the time of Maghreb or I can delay Maghrib and pray it at the time of Asia Somalia what you're asking about specifically is that let's assume I'm traveling from medina to Jeddah it's a four-hour drive approximately on the road MRIB is called the Sun had set and I still have two and a half hours to reach Jeddah should I stop and pray Maghrib this is an option you can stop Premal replicas and then prayer YCJA two Rakas afterwards because you're still a traveler but if you don't want to stop it's night time it's dark and you don't feel safe so you want to reach home agenda you can do that but I'll reach Judah at 10 o'clock in the evening way after Aishah I then no problem once you reach Jeddah you pray three records of MRIB is this Kobashi no it's not at all because you have the right to combine due to being a traveler but check now I'm not a traveler I've reached home yes you've reached home but you still have the option of praying mother it because while you were traveling you opted for the option of delaying MRIB with Asia and this is totally fine and legitimate therefore you prefer Iroquois moderate and follow that by for Rakas of Asia because you're not a traveler anymore so you don't shorten prayers so I hope this answers your question but one more point is that a lot of the people take joining prayers easily so people who commute from the city to the suburbs on work assignment or this is their job their routine they travel like 30 or 40 kilometres on and off they combine and this is wrong you have to pray on time you don't have the permission to combine because you're not a traveler and there's no hardship what is meant by hardship I could be residing in my own hometown but I have a placement test or an exam that happens once a year and I'll go into the exam at 11 o'clock a.m. before Lahore and won't be allowed out until 4 o'clock which is after us our event so what to do they will not allow me to pray in this case you have the excuse to delay the and pray it with dasa likewise someone who's a doctor who's a surgeon or a patient undergoing surgery and he will miss once a lot due to his surgery he can combine there's no problem in that but to do it frequently in every single day this is not permissible"
