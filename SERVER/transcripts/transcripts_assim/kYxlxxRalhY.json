  "transcript": "any marriage that is time bound as in the case of the sh marriage known as M this is not valid marriage this isn't a valid marriage and whoever participates in it would be actually committing Zena or adultery because the marriage did not take place the contract is a void and therefore it is not permissible to do it these are the types of temporary marriages that both of the parties the man and the woman agree on having a particular date or a par a particular period and after that the marriage is over this is completely forbidden now there is another type of temporary marriage where the husband intends to divorce without the knowledge of the family or of the wife and this happens with a lot of the experts who go abroad to work or to study so he has a three or four years or maybe six years a period that he studies in until he finishes his school or he has a contract to work in a country and he is unable to get his wife or he's not married but he marries from that country and usually they marry a Christian or they marry a Muslim from that country um and the people who give him their daughter they are thinking well of him and that is why they agreed to give him the daughter and after his studies are over he divorces her and goes back his uh uh to his country now some Scholars said that this marriage is accepted in the sense that as a contract it is valid if you look and dissect this contract marriage contract you would find that there is the proposal from the guardian he says I give you my w my daughter in marriage there is the approval from the bride to be he says I accept her marriage to myself and there is the presence of two witnesses the D and this what makes a marriage valid so the marriage as a contract it is valid however the man doing this intending this is sinful in Islam because he is cheating and lying the guardian of that woman would have would have never accepted giving his daughter or his sister to this man in marriage had he known that he would divorce her after two three or five or even 10 years he would never have accepted giving her in marriage to him so by hiding his intention he is sinful in Islam yet the marriages accepted um is correct and the children if there were to be children are legitimate children but the man is sinful in Islam and Allah Knows Best he"
