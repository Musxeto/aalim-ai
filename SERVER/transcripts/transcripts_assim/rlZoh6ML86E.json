we have the hadith number 158 which was narrated by an assembly Malik and the chapter we are studying is the chapter that deals with I then brother Mustafa narrated by Ellis bin Malik earlier law Allah is messenger sallallahu wasallam said this application made between the event and the karma is not rejected now we've talked about this hadith a lot last time we met I'd like to ask and I know that you know the answer to this but the question that a lot of people ask is why do we always make a van that is let me rephrase that why do we always make supplication and dua between a 10 and a Palma and we see it rejected it doesn't happen it doesn't come true so what is the answer to this question Mustafa there are certain conditions through which that must be fulfilled in order for someone to do add to be accepted for example that his food should all be hella and what he drinks should be halal and what he earned should be helped okay mrs. true the hadith and Muslim say Muslim were the prophets Allah sallam told us that there is this man traveling and he has dust on his hair and clothings and he raises his hands to Allah so gel and calls Allah with his names and attributes Europe Europe yet his earning is Haram his food is Haram his drinking is Haram and the things that he's wearing are also Haram the Prophet says so how does he expect expect Allah to answer his prayers so if we look at this hadith we find that the Prophet is a lot salam he's describing a man with things that usually are considered to be means for your prayer to be accepted such as traveling the Prophet told us that whatever person travels his dua his supplication is accepted and rejected among three of course the second thing that he has dust on his hair and clothings and then there's a hadith where the Prophet says Alice or Salam that there is a man who has dust on his hair and clothings and his hair is not calmed and he calls Allah if he says oh Allah I swear that you must do this Allah will answer his prayer and he will execute what he wants him what he wants Allah as I dread to do for him and the Prophet also mentions raising the hands and this is one of the things that Allah answered prayers to those who raised their hands and the evidence is that the Prophet says that is awesome that Allah spiro tejada if if one of his servants raises his hands Allah is so kind and allah azza wajal is so shy to reject these hands that are have been raised to him so he will give him whatever he asks for and finally the guy is asking Allah with his names and attributes by saying ya Habibi Yara and Allah whoever calls him with his names and attributes will give him yet because he had this obstacle he had this great hurdle the prayer would not be accepted because his earning food drink and clothings are all from Haram sources so this was rejected do we have any other comments Mustafa like to say that there are more than one form of a stage ever there are like three forms one of them that God will give this thing that he wanted in this life or he will sieve it lira for him in the afterlife or he will simply use it to just make something not bad that happened to him okay there is another hadith where the prophet sallallahu wasallam tells us that if a person makes blah allah azza wajal will make one of the three and I'll explain that in an example I say o Allah grant me one thousand euros I need the money for one the reason or the other so Allah Azza WA JAL providing that I am doing all what's necessary because there are manners of making drawn such as problematic yes how do I start my dua nor firstly we have to press all very good you have to praise Allah and secondly what do you do fatty for when when performing when making draw supplicating you praise allah and you mix a lot on the prophet RSS and you say Allah Allah Allah Muhammad because the Prophet tells us a la la Salem that all supplications are blocked unless you pray on the Prophet that is a Salam so it goes through the heavens but it's blocked if you pray on the Prophet that I saw Salam it's given way so let's assume that I've taken all the measures needed I did praise Allah and I did pray on the prophets of Allah Allah and then I started my supplication and I said o Allah grant me one thousand euros the Prophet says as a Salam there are three steps one either Allah will give it to you three choices and it's not my choice it's a less choice and he knows best so either he gives you 1000 euros and this could happen in in different ways you know of course it will not rain but it will come to you throw one way or the other you know someone that you've borrowed that bars from you ages ago he came comes back and give it to you or someone gives you credit for something and he rewards you you may inherit you may this you made that there are so many ways Allah delivers his risk to you through you know astonishing ways the second thing is that Allah will divert an evil thing that might have happened to you that that is almost the same cost for example I've requested Allah to grant me a thousand euro now allah azza wajal wishes and decreased subhanaw taala or decreed before that there should be this disease this illness this a form of bad thing to happen to one of your kids or to your wife or to your body Allah so gel probably would have decreed that you haven't an accident to repair your car and the car that you smashed into it would cost you a thousand euros by you praying to Allah to grant 2000 euros Allah so gel will save you the trouble and you will not have this accident that was supposed to happen to you so this is one one way of it the third thing the third choice is that you ask Allah for a thousand-euro Allah doesn't give it to you Allah doesn't divert it the rector bad thing that could have happened had happened to you what he saves it for you on the day of judgement so when you come on the day of judgment and you know that you have so-and-so good deeds and so-and-so bad deeds but you tend to see something extra on the side and when you ask what are these good deeds here doing here I didn't do them all I would tell you that these are the supplications you've made and we did not answer it then we answer it now so it's all depending on Allah's wish panatela choosing the best for us you know there are so many times that maybe if we are given what we ask Allah for then it would not be good for us that's why Allah delays it there are so many times we wish that Allah grants us this or that and it doesn't happen and 5 or 10 years later one discovers I remember a friend of mine that he used to pray so hard when he was a teenager that his father allows him to own a dirt bike you know dirt bikes and he was so crazy about dirt bikes he this guy was 15 years old or 16 years old and his father would refuse now after 10 or 15 years later on when this man became a father himself get married settle down you know cooled down because he was you know freaky freaking freaking out at the time when he was 15 or 16 yeah it was hyper after 10-15 years the guy recalls and says alhamdulillah now I realize if Allah would have answered my question my my my supplication and my father bought me that dirtbike I would have been dead now because I know that I would have done things that even Kevin Knievel would be able to do them I would do things that are out of the question but alhamdulillah Allah did not answer my prayers on that particular subject so you don't know where goodness is you don't know what's best for you and where it might be I believe it's time to move on to the following hadith hadith number 159 narrated by Jeddah may Allah be pleased with him I lost messenger sallallaahu Salim said if you if anyone says when he nears the event oh allah lord of this perfect call and of the regular player prayer which is going to be established kindly give muhammad sallallaahu Selim the right of intercession and superiority and send him the day of judgment to the best and the highest place in Paradise which you promised him he will be assured of my intercession on the day of judgement this hadith tells us what a Muslim should say after the event and you should ask allah azzawajal for the probe to the Prophet SAW solemn that he gains an Wasilla and alpha by Allah it's a place and a degree that only one is entitled to have it and the Prophet says salah salem that i hope to be that chosen one and he is the chosen one you remember we talked long ago about the intercession on the day of judgment and how the prophets of salaam intercedes to all humanity then he intercedes to the believers and so on so if you say this supplication after every dora that is if you say this application after every van then inshallah with the grace of allah you will be counted to receive the intercession of the prophet salallahu alaihe wa salem yet unfortunately not everybody recalls this as i said that there are so many supplications but every one of us is indulged in his worldly life he is indulged with his studies his effort to earn a decent buck he works 9 to 5 he does this he does that just in order to get by and forgets that allah azzawajal provides the risk forgets that we are here in a transitional period afterwards its hell forever or heaven for ever we have a short break and inshallah afterwards we will repeat the hadith and we'll try to comment as much as possible so stay tuned so this is something that you have to point out to the to them in the Bible something which is I think very rarely needed by the youth which is staying firm and the truth this is just one of the greatest examples for me of how to control your anger within the framework of being the cleanest religion the clearest jurisprudence and in the meantime the kindest religion to animals watch let's talk with Helene a minute as he interviews guests and discusses a variety of topics everything from youth issues to religious issues join us here on TV salam aliekum wa rahamtullah and welcome back just before the break we had the hadith of Jabbar may Allah be pleased with him on the supplication that a Muslim says after the van and we said that whoever does this receives what Mustapha either three of one things well if they're one of three things No Abu Malik the session of the prophet alayhi salatu salam who says its application after the Adhan receives the intercession of the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa aalihi wasallam and the interest there are different types of intercessions can you enter seat can we all intercede anybody has an answer well first of all Allah has to allow us or give us the permission to intercede no that's on the day of judgement yes I'm talking generally speaking can we intercede no no no yes we can can you give us an example like for instance from talking about intercession that is at the side of Allah so I'll give you an example so that we cut to the chase as they say the Prophet says Alice o Salaam that if 40 men pray the funeral prayer on a dead person they will have the right to intercede for him yes for ona Lihue so this means that by you performing prayer on the dead person Allah Allah will accept your intercession and it is said that those who fail to reach the level in paradise same as their fathers as in the sort of poor Allah says that their children will come to their level with intercession Allah will elevate their level and paradise so that they would be in the same level with their parents and vice versa the parents would be elevated to the level of their children this is because of the mercy and generosity of Allah as erosion as on the day of judgment we are told that there is the greatest or the major intercession of all which we've mentioned like ten fifteen programs ago when we said that all the people go to Adam Noah Abraham Moses Jesus and then finally to the prophets allah said l'm asking them to intercede so that allah azza wajal would relieve them from the hardship they are facing on the day of judgment so in some narrations though it's a week but people scholars use them sometimes they say it is so hard and horrific on the day of judgment that even the non-muslims the kafir says oh god relieve me from this position from the way we're standing even if you gotta throw me into hell throw me to help but don't let me wait and anticipate so this is the greatest or the major intercession safar - and ultimately there is another form of shiva and that is when the prophets of allah Hardy who is Elam intercedes to his followers to the people in Paradise to be elevated and great so if a person enters paradise in so-and-so great the prophet sallallaahu is Allah and to see it so that they are elevated and of course this is all by the permission of Allah as the origin another form of intercession is that the Prophet intercedes to people that they have been decreed to be in hell because they have committed certain sins now it's well known to you that non-muslims those who do not believe in the oneness of Allah will be thrown in hell forever for eternity there's no coming out period now those who believe in the oneness of Allah such as Muslims or the followers of Moses when there were no messengers but Moses or the followers of Jesus when they were following really Jesus and believing in the oneness of Allah as I said before Prophet Muhammad SAW seldom was sent to all mankind those Muslims they might have done few sins here there and Allah Azza WA JAL has judged that they must be punished in hell for a short period of time or a long period of time God knows maybe a year 10 100 years Allah knows so the prophet sallallaahu either set up intercedes to these people that Allah does not punish them in hell so they do not enter Hell at all so this is another form of intercession and also the prophet Salih Saleh intercedes to those who are already in hell so let's assume that Allah so gel is punishing this person in hell for 10 years for the sins that he has made the Prophet comes and intercedes for him so that he goes out of hell and straight to heaven even before he does his time and finally his intercession to his uncle what's the name of the uncle Fatih Abbas well a bus is in heaven in sha Allah Abu Abu Talib is in hell the one who supported the Prophet SAW said most but he refused to declare the Shahada so the Prophet SAW wasallam intercedes at the side of al-azhar jail for him so that he is the punishment is reduced and he's not punished severely for what he has done you remember Mustafa what is his Spanish punishment two stones or two pebbles that they're going to be Anna sandals that are gonna make his brains boil okay stones put into burning stones that is not normal stones burning stones that makes his brain boils out and and this is the least punishment in hell yet a boat Allah sees himself to be the most severe being punished so it's not a relief for him he thinks that no one is harder than he is getting punishment but there are so many many else being punished other than that this is the last hadith in the chapter that deals with Iran do we have any questions or should we move on yes there was an incident in the United States where a woman led prayer hmm and the person who who said van was also a female yeah so kind of female make it then yeah it's an American Islam so so that's the American version of it too if you go too far east maybe you find the Chinese version of Islam of something else you know calling for that van this is common sense it's been 15 centuries since the prophet time til today and all those who were calling for the Advanta men it's been 15 centuries till date and all those who were leading prayer worldwide I'm not talking about a hundred thousand or a hundred million or a billion I'm talking about an access of one point like what eight ten eight or nine billion Muslims and no nowhere we have heard that a woman leads prayer and don't be deceived by the titles you know dr. so-and-so or professor so-and-so if they don't know that the language itself they don't know Arabic and if you listen to the recitation of the Quran it's a joke now because it comes from America does not mean it's bad it doesn't mean it's good definitely we have scholars to go for and ask we have the Holy Quran before that and we have the whole it that the sacred and and purified Sunnah to cross-examine whatever allegation there might be for example it's very clear hadith narrated by Aisha Imani reported by Muslim and others the Prophet said salah salem whoever innovates anything in our religion is rejected so let's apply this to what this lady did in this mosque and apparently it's not a mosque so they tell me it's a place in a chapel or in a church because they tried to make to perform this prayer in a mosque and nobody accepted it so the only place that would give them a shelter and a place to do their stunts was a church and this tells you about the sincerity of those performing this prayer and those conducting it nevertheless now if you have seen I've seen the video clip and it was astonishing you know seeing this woman next to this man and seeing that woman in frustrating and and bowing in front of that man and I've seen the men you know looking instead of looking downwards looking sideways and just waiting for the right pause to gaze and enjoy looking at this is on Islamic and if you look at the Sunnah itself during prayer the Prophet says RSR Salaam if the imam makes a mistake men should say subhanAllah and women should say nothing it's not permissible for women to talk at all they should clap in this is prayer because her sound in the Masjid during prayer may disrupt and distract people so how come what happens if this woman becomes an imam and she says fear Allah oh my god fear Allah definitely fear Allah but not after listening to you yeah what you're doing is you're asking me not to feel alone solution and she menstruates so what do we do we give her a test a checkup before she performs prayers just to know if she's mister reading or not and and there's so many things Elijah tells us to lower our gaze not to look at women and the Sunnah is to look at the Imam while he's delivering the speech so what should I do one says she is old and what happens if we have a genius amount female mm that is 25 years old blonde with blue eyes that would be one hell of a prayer to follow this is against its logical you don't have to go through it and and say well we have now I heard that there is another one in Italy and a third one in probably Bangladesh or somewhere and they're all trying to destroy Islam with their religion but but with the way they're doing they'll not succeed Muslims will not look even at them the Prophet says I saw a sermon the hadith isn't those are the best rows of men are those at the front and the best rows of women are those at the very back and the best rows and the worst rows for men are those at the back and the worst rows of women are those at the front so the closer they are tied together the worst it is so I don't feel like we have to elaborate a lot on this I'm afraid that also this is all the time that we are allowed to have for this program so Charla until we meet next time fear Manila or Salaam aleykum or her to LA here over at"
