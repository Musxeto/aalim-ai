  "transcript": "[Music] alhamdulillah I do hope that no one would judge me on my speech abilities but the topic is of importance to every Muslim simply because a model family the ideal family in Islam is the main target of the enemies of of Islam if you have a good Muslim family this means that you are making an excellent Muslim Community and that is why as I'm talking out of experience maybe you may not be suffering as we are in the Arab world but we have vicious attacks against the Muslim family and the enemies of Islam go out of their way trying to corrupt the family because once you do this you manag to corrupt the whole of the society now in order to have and formulate a model family you have to work hard on the individual because the nucleus of a community is the individual and this is why we put a great deal on the family because the family is the one that's going to bring up a good individual or a bad one this Society we live in the prophet wasam described it as a ship and we have to maintain this ship floating and not only that but also sailing to formulate a model family the first thing we have to do is to take care of the partners the spouses so in order to do that you have to choose the right partner for you and in Islam we have a lot of evidences covering this and I will not go into it because it requires a lot of time I'll just give you bullet points and only signals and indicators to it and inshallah you know it I have done the last weekend a course on a quest for love that dealt with how to choose your spouse and the required characteristics in them so first of all as a man you're requested and instructed to choose a woman who has good characteristics such as she has to be Pious righteous God-fearing religious and this is the most important characteristic in your future wife whether she's beautiful wealthy or coming from a good family this is beside the point the most important thing is that she is practicing and by practicing we don't mean that she's wearing the nikab and the gloves a lot of the Muslims think that this is to practice Islam and so many who wear the nikab and wear the gloves do not pray on time do not observe their fast they are bad in character so you have to look at a holistic and look at it in a holistic way as to whom is practicing and who is not she has to have her modesty and Chastity because the prophet told usat that among the women of hell are those who do not so if you marry someone and she shows her flesh exposes herself or she is indecent then this would not make a good family she has to be satisfied with whatever Allah gives her and the most most of the men here are saying well we got that wrong for sure because unfortunately a lot of the women have this in them they lack this feature of satisfaction and content and this is why in the authentic Hadith when ibraim peace be upon Him came to visit his son is peace be upon him and he was married and he did not see him since he was like 14 15 years old he did not find him and he found his wife so he asked her how is life and she said life is horrible food is scarce we don't have water my husband is out all the time so he told her when your husband comes gives him give him my regard and tell him your father says change your doorstep so when is came and she told him and he told her that this was my father and he's telling me to divorce you go to your family the worst wife one can have is the one who's unappreciative never satisfied never content and then when he married again and ibraim visited him years later the second wife did not complain on the contrary complimented everything she had and ibraim said give him my regards and tell him tell him to preserve and to keep his doorsteps and when he came back is and she told him he told her this was my father it is extremely important for a Muslim family to have the content not only from women but also from men but this is not our topic we addressing the characteristics of the potential misses among the characteristics before choosing a wife the prophet tells us that the women of Jenna are those who are wud meaning that she's caring and loving so so you have to to choose someone who's caring and loving and I'm not telling you to go online chat with her and uh maybe go Skype so that you know her before marriage this is Haram so how would I know if she's caring and loving from her family from her friends they tell your mother they tell your sister that she is kind she is uh uh nice she does not flare out and she does not become angry she doesn't have any rap attacks Mah okay this is nice but to marry someone and end up in fights every single morning and and evening this is not advisable she has to be wud caring and loving wud she has to be fertile able to produce children because this is the essence of getting married she I can't go on Skype okay how would I know this she's fertile we're not married yet well Scholars say look into her family so if of course her mother is fertile look at her sisters her aunts her cousins if they mallah are a productive family this means that most likely she would be and do not get married to someone who does not as a first wife not it's not forbidden but it is not recommended thirdly the prophet Alat says that among the characteristics is that she is obedient among the blessings of Allah upon an individual is that he's blessed with a woman who would obey him if he orders her and who would please him if he looks at her so this is another characteristic she has to be obedient and the happiest husbands are those with obedient wives and the brothers are shaking their heads in disapproval saying we don't have this sh what are you talking about are you talking about from Jenna let's talk about humans no there are there are sisters come on don't be ungrateful you have jewels in your houses I know that and if I don't say this I would be beaten by the the sisters after I finish the talk no you have you do you do have this in your houses but you are unappreciative so the prophet tells us that among the best women are those whom you look at them they pleas you and this doesn't mean that she has to be shockingly beautiful because this is not the case beauty is not an essential thing in marriage if you marry a beautiful wife couple of days maybe couple of weeks and then you'll get over it you'll see the real character but a nice and obedient and and and righteous wife would always be pleasant to look at so when you go home you won't find find your wife with her hair untiy doing the afro maybe and with her teeth yellow with food in it and with uh smells of onion and garlic coming out of her and with her voice coming from the depth of of of of her throat saying how are you honey this is not the thing you want to have home a a righteous practicing muslima and this I know for for a fact would always try to look her best when her husband comes this is my comfort zone this is my safe haven that I always go to to relax from wherever is abroad and this is what I said to the brothers in and and and this morning's reminder when we go in the streets we find Billboards of models beautiful women smiling if I go into a shop the saleswoman is smiling if I go to the reception of the hotel the receptionist is smiling the coworker if you are may Allah help you working with with the opposite sex they're always smiling and and mashallah giggling when once you enter the house all these Smiles are gone down the drain Subhan Allah why is it why is it it should be the other way around so this is what you should try to look uh uh for for your wife does so to be inshallah future wife should honor your family pick someone that would honor your family you have one family you have one mother you have one father but you can marry as many wives as you wish so if she does not respect and honor them then try to make the right choice she has to take care of her his children and the prophet complimented sallallahu alaih wasallam the women of qur being soft-hearted to the children and being caring of their husbands so this is the wife you should look for and you could tell by asking about her there are girls that are so caring and loving for children it's an apparent characteristics in them everybody knows about this and there are who are negligent and don't like kids and don't like children and don't clean them well this is not the right person for you and she has to take care of his house you remember do you did Khadijah or not yet not here okay khad may Allah be pleased with her the wife of the Prophet Alat wasam what did jiel give her the Glad time Tiding he said to the prophet Alam khad is coming with food and drink give her the Glad Tiding and give her Salam from me and tell her that Allah has made a house made of pearl empty Pearl shell for her where there is no noise and there is no tiresome Scholars say why is it this for Khadijah because she never ever made the prophet workat wasam she was his wife she did all the work and not only that she would not make any noise in the house neither her nor the kids so whenever the prophet went into his houseat he did not want to leave and that is why Allah rewarded her with this big pearl made of of of a palace with these things in them so a good woman serves the house she takes care of the house the husband does not look at anything that is bad everything is tidy and nice and finally she you when you marry a woman try your best not to take a jealous one because the prophet Alat wasam once was addressed by anas may Allah be pleased with him and said oh prophet of Allah why don't you marry a woman from Al ansar from Medina he said they are extremely jealous and that's why he refrained from marrying from them and when he married um Sal when he proposed to um Sal may Allah be pleased with her her um Sal said oh prophet of Allah I have a lot of children and at the same time I am extremely jealous what did the prophet sayat as for your children they are mine as for your jealousy I'll supplicate to Allah and Allah will take it away so jealousy extreme jealousy is bad you don't want to marry someone when you are watching pornography God forbid or on the Internet or or or cyber chat or let's go video or whatever she says okay good night I'm going to sleep see you tomorrow no this is not a proper wife you want someone when you do something Haram she prevents you when you try to uh uh flirt with a coworker or with a neighbor or she stops you the one you do not want is someone when talking on the phone she says who are you talking with put it on on loud speaker swear by Allah put your hand on your right eye and swear by Allah it's a man what kind of jealousy is this no this is not jealousy therefore these are some of the characteristics you say it again five times these are some of the characteristics you have to choose in a wife but what about the wife what about the woman well the prophet Alat wasam told us what to choose in a man for our daughters or our sisters so the prophet saidat that when a person when a woman wants to choose a man he has to be first thing religious he has to be practicing and not every bearded brother is a practicing brother not Fidel Castro is not practicing not everyone with short th is a PR practicing brother how do I know yeah deal with him if I see a brother with a long beard and a short tho but he lies or he back bites or he cheats or he is useless and he envies people he looks down at people he thinks of himself as the best man ever to walk the earth is he a practicing brother no he's not so choose someone who's practicing how do you know visit the Masjid next door if someone proposes to your daughter and he looks practicing where do you live I live near Green Lane okay we go to the she who prays do you know this brother no this is how he looks I've never seen the brother is he practicing he doesn't pray fer what kind of a practicing brother is he she I always you find it difficult to wake up for for f okay what is too late so what do you pray uh usually because I can't pray it in the Masjid in in at work what kind of a Muslim is this this is not practicing you need someone who is fully practicing not only in his religious commitment but only o also in his character and that is why the prophet said that whenever someone proposes to your wife sorry eras this edit okay if someone proposes to your sister to your daughter who his religious commitment and his character you approve of you should give him in marriage so it's not only religious commitment also his character what do we mean by character he should be brave he should be generous the worst thing a sister could do is marrying a stingy person a misy person who doesn't pay until you take a pint of his blood this is difficult life is horrible and this is why when one of the female companions came to the prophet Al and said muan and Abu J both proposed to me so he said mu is he doesn't have a penny he doesn't he's he's poor by nature and Abu J he batters PE women he abuses women but Mar us may Allah be pleased upon them all so he has to be his character has to be accepted in the sense that he has to be generous he has to be tolerant never ever marry someone who has rage attacks never it's the worst person and I get a lot of these problems of men they confuse themselves with an AK-47 with a clash nikov when they're angry and your mother and your sister and your aunts they allik he divorces everybody he sees what is this and then after 5 minutes she I made a mistake what did you do I gave my wife talak 17 times three is on the house and the rest is on you what is this no you don't want to marry someone you don't want to give your sister you don't want to give your daughter to someone who gets angry quickly and is impulsive and may do something that he may regret later on he has to be tolerant he has to be among those who look the other way he shouldn't be an auditor because if you give your sister to an auditor every time say how much did you spend where is the rest where was this thing why don't you put it there he's going to make life hell for her no you want to choose someone who looks the other way even if she does a mistake or two he pretends as he did not see anything and life beautifully goes on he has to be as mentioned in the Quran he has to be strong and he has to be honest trustworthy because you are entrusting him with your honor with with your flesh you're in trusting him with your daughter or with your sister so don't throw them away to any one who comes and asks for them he has to be secretive in the sense that he does not spread the secrets of the house not that he has relationships and he's secretive no he has he has to be modest in the sense that I've I I've sat with men quote unquote so-called men who say what happens with them in bed my I did this with my wife oh that was fun and but the other thing wasn't and and I say this is the worst thing a man can do yes it's okay it's man talk it's not man talk it's animal talk men with dignity and horor honor refuse to go down this uh uh uh Road he has to be you have to look for someone who is fair and just and these two things fairness and Justice if a man has them W you give your daughter to him and fear nothing and that is why Al Hassan may Allah have mercy on his soul said give your daughter or your sister to one who is fearing Allah because if he loves her he will honor her and if he hates her he would not do her wrong wrong if I hate my wife I will not be unfair or unjust because I fear Allah if I do anything wrong even if I hate her guts even if she is ugly and smelly not I'm saying that she is but even if she's like this I will not do her wrong because I fear Allah and I fear that Allah may send me someone to mistreat my daughters my sisters my cousins in the same fashion and that is why I fear Allah I try to be as good as possible try to choose someone who dresses well and who has a good scent and smell not necessarily wearing forace or Gucci but someone who looks presentable and who smells normal because this will be with you till the end of time a lot of the sisters send me emails and complaints of the smell of the brothers mouths they don't uh uh floss they don't uh uh wash their mouths the prophet the first thing he used to do when he enters the the the house was to use the miswak to clean his mouth IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him he used to take real good care of himself and whenever his companions talked to him he said as I want my wife to look good I like to look good for her so it's it's a two-way Road try to choose someone who would honor your family who would respect your father and mother and don't take take a gangster who would maybe kill them in the M the following day choose someone who would respect them who would give them the uh necessary honor and try to get someone who is jealous do not get a man man who is not jealous because this is not a man the the the the thing first thing that stands out in the man is his jealousy and the first thing that stands out in a woman is her feminine side and her vulnerability and the more he's jealous and strong and she's weak and vulnerable they can have a good relationship but when the woman becomes a man and the man man becomes a with all due respect this is not a marriage seriously most of marriages do not continue because of this because you have a man in woman's clothings and you have something else in the Man's Shoes I hear now they have shoes for unisex so now how much we have 20 minutes okay now in an model family it is built on each party giving and doing his obligations without looking at his rights a lot of marriages fail because this is the other way around I want my rights and I demand them but I neglect that I have also obligations to give and do no no no let's not go there I want my rights she has to do this she has to do this she has to do this and at the same time she's asking for her rights as well he has to do this but he's not doing it he has to do all these things but he's not doing it and that is why we have problems in the houses no if you fear Allah if you're married for the sake of Allah do your obligations and your rights ask them from Allah they will come eventually if not all most of them but always fulfill your obligations and seek your rights from Allah the the almighty a model family how is it from inside they get married tough luck you have my condolences kalas they got married we chose the right spouse she chose the right spouse they're married now in the F in the house what is life like a model family has to have a lot and I mean a lot of love of compassion of caring not only between the spouses but between all the members of the family not only that they have to declare it we have a problem I'm talking about men because women don't have a problem with this in showing their emotions when was the last time you said to your wife I love you she I said it a week ago she said what do you want yeah of course after 20 years of marriage and you never say it and all of a sudden say honey I love you H you want to marry again no way I'm going to cut your throat it's not this we have problems with our emotions as men we we do not express the prophet was not like that he not only expressed it to his wives he expressed it to everybody may Allah be pleased with him when he embraced Islam on the eth year of Hijra he was very late so he went with the prophet for a few days and the prophet being being the prophet he treated him in a very nice way so he thought to himself ah the prophet is doing this to me because I am one of his favorite companions so he went to the prophet one day and said oh prophet of Allah who is it that you love most on Earth and he was expecting you but the prophet Saida the prophet did not hide it he said it to a man companion because everybody knew this and and said no no I meant from the men the prophet said abua meaning her father Abu Bakr then who Omar then whan and the prophet continued naming a number of and he was not in the list I said okay forget it the point is we have to declare our love to our wives we have to verbally say it because if we have this love in our heart houses the first to benefit are our children when they see this love in between between us yeah when was the last time you smsed a love message to your wife don't put obstacles and saying she if I do this she's going to think I'm I'm I'm I'm sming my secretary or something don't put obstacles do it once a week put it in your schedule when she calls give her sweet names honey how are you things that she loves because if you do this then your house will be filled with love now a lot of the Muslims houses I see nothing but criticism cursing and bad words you find the father when his guests come and the son is trying to give coffee or tea instead of saying mashallah this is my son he knows five J of Quran he's a man of the house what are you stupid giving the tea with your left hand give it with your right hand what a bad boy in front of all the guests what love is there what what do you expect from such a boy but if you have love compassion if you have caring if you have encouragement every time you see something wrong there has to be lots and lots of things that are right so keep on encouraging showing your love to your spouse the prophet Alam used to do this with AA a used to do this with him in theah he was lying in bed with her and she was so close to him you I know wah he spouses that live in separate rooms W he each one has a separate room of his own and when they want something Hanky Panky they they take an appointment but other than that each live in a separate room this is awkward and weird is sticking to the prophet Alam at night and then the prophet says leave me to worship my Allah Anda says prophet of Allah I love you but I love what you love and he started to pray and wept and wept and wept until all of his beard was full of tears she says this to the prophet and she does not hide it by Allah I love you Prophet of Allah and I love to be near you but I love what you love so go and pray we have to to communicate if we would like to sustain our model and ideal marriage our houses we would like to be Progressive and we'd like to go on and develop with our feelings now in the house in a model house you have to have a target an objective what's your objective in your house to have kids sh what's your objective in the house to have a warm meal what's your objective in the house to have a house where going to sleep on the street Muslims have a different objective what's your objective brother to please Allah Asel and you sister to please Allah Asel ah okay this is a very noble cause a very Noble objective and this is why our our marriages our houses are not built entirely on the pleasure of Allah the prophet tells usat wasam that the happy couple usually wake each other for night prayers and if the spouse does not wake up sprinkle little water on his or her face and pray two R if you do this in the middle of the night Allah will register you among those who remember Allah a lot two raas so our marriage is not for giving you your allowance or for cooking my food our marriage is based on pleasing [Music] Allah Allah says in the Quran protect yourself and your family from Hellfire so this is marriage this is the ideal way of having a righteous and practicing marriage a practicing house a practicing family do you know who is the one yeah but she's known to something more she is the mother of anas IB Malik the servant of the Prophet Alat wasam when her husband died the father of anas Abu Talha a man from the dignitary people of of Medina proposed to her but he was not a Muslim look at this smart woman she said the likes of you are never rejected but you are a cafir and I am a Muslim so if you accept Islam I will make this my dowy the man went thought of it and came back accepted Islam and they got married this is the ideal family we want look at their family strange [Music] um going to the Prophet this stranger who came from Mecca they believed that he's the messenger of Allah she'd never seen him before the minute she saw him she believed in him before he migrated she went to him and said oh prophet of Allah Ann Malik he is about 8 years old 9 years old my son he's learned he's smart you like him take him as your servant would you throw your child away in this fashion yes if you're smart and yes if the person is the prophet Alat wasam what did anas gain from that Subhan Allah he accompanied the prophet Alam for 10 years and once said oh prophet of Allah anas is your servant pray for him and the prophet said oh Allah prolong his life and exceed his wealth and his his offspring and forgive his sins four supplications very easy anas says by Allah I am over a 100 now so prolonging his life and my children are so many I have buried with my own hands more than a hundred of them children and Offspring grandchildren and great great grandchildren and exceed his wealth he says that I have Farms that produce twice a year when everybody else produces on only once a year as for the fourth which is forgiveness of Allah I'm praying to Allah that this is also fulfilled and we know that it is fulfilled and that an is in Jenna with the grace of Allah the servant of the Prophet look at this woman if you have a woman like this in your house what would you do I wouldn't leave Abu may Allah be pleas with him after he married her she got pregnant and she gave birth to a boy but this boy got ill for a while and every time he comes from work from this Farm how is he he's okay and while he was at work he died the infant died what did this woman do she cried her her head off she tore her hair she tore her clothes weeping on the sun no she told her family no no one tells him a word and she took care of the child put it on the corner of the house and covered it and she dressed well she showered she put all crams lotions everything the whole nine yards when he came says how's the boy she said alhamdulillah he's he has rested she didn't lie he has rested and she prepared nice food for him he ate and his stomach was full the then she flirted with him and she had what she wanted from him so he was pleased 100% And they went to bed and while they were in bed resting she said Abu our neighbors they borrowed something from someone and now that someone wants what he lend to them but they're refusing to give it back and he said no this is wrong when someone lends someone something and he calls it back he has to give it back he has no right to refuse immediately she said ask Allah Asel to give us better than the Calamity that be fell upon us your son is dead and Allah asael lent it to us and now Allah took what he what we borrowed from him he was outraged now after I'm full and you had what what you wanted from me he went to the prophet Alam and the prophet Sall wasallam smiled and said may Allah bless your night the narrator of this Hadith says that afterwards nine exactly nine months from that night she gave birth to a a child named Abdullah AB they say that he was among the best of the people of Medina and we the man who narrating this I saw seven of his offspring knowing the Quran by heart so Allah did bless their night because of the wisdom of This Woman This is the woman that we would like to have in our houses in our household we would like to have a righteous husband and a righteous wife this is our model family this is our ideal family but does this mean that there are no fights can can we have houses without any fights this is not possible maybe probable but not quite possible even in the best of houses you would find some sort of skirmishes not fights but here and there the prophet alhat wasam with AAA used to be upset with him sometimes imaginea being upset of the prophet of Allah this is normal this a how a man and his wife it has nothing to do with the messenger and the Servants of Allah it has to do with a man and his wife and the prophet said this I know when you are pleased with me and I know when you are angry he said this out of the blue they were happy so they were just chitchatting so I said I know when you're angry and I know when you are not she said how do you know that prophet of Allah he says when you are angry you say no by ibrahim's Lord and when you're happy you say no by Muhammad's Lord and she said yes prophet of Allah this is true I do not abandon anything except your name I love you but when I'm angry I do not call your name Fatima and Al may Allah be pleased with them also they used to have skirmishes the prophet came once to his daughter's house where is Ali she said he got angry we had something and we fought over something so he went to the Masjid so the prophet goes to the Masjid and finds Ali sleeping on the floor and he wakes him up and he says stand up the father of dust because he was sleeping on the the soil and he said this is the most beautiful name I would never ever trade it for anything this is his nickname may Allah be pleased with him Omar may Allah be pleased with him a man has a fight with his wife and he is so outraged of her character so he goes to Omar to complain Theif the CIF so he knocks on the door and they tell him wait for a second and all what he hears is Omar's wife shouting at him Omar's wife is shouting and he can hear that said I'm coming to complain to Omar he needs help more than I do so the guy goes away and then Omar rushes to the door and where's the man come what is it my brother he said well nothing nothing I had a problem but I think you need the help more than I do he said my brother this is my wife she cooks my food she bakes my bread she washes my clothes she she suckles and Bre feeds my children and she does not have to do all of that and not only that my heart is calm and I don't have to look for Haram when she's with me don't you think I should tolerate her as she is tolerating me W if we look at our spouses with this way we would live a beautiful life because then we whenever Shan comes to us and says do this or do that I said no she tolerates me my wife tolerates me I have a lot of shortcomings so if she cooks the food that is bad and half burnt and no salt in it I will eat it I will eat three or four uh bites of it and say may Allah bless you the food was excellent and I'm lying why because I don't take her out I don't buy her presents I am not kind to her I am not a perfect husband so I tolerate her shortcomings hoping from Allah that she tolerates my shortcomings and by this we would have the perfect house and allaha knows best I pray to Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala that he would fix all our shortcomings and that he would make our houses ideal Muslim houses mammad [Music]"
