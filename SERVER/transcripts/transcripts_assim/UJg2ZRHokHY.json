  "title": "Can we slaughter a Camel or Cow for Udhiya / Qurbani? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "you often say with a sheep with a ram but then you also say that we can offer ut here with livestock so can we slaughter a camel or a cow the answer is yes however due to the fact that a camel or a cow have more meat than a sheep therefore in islam what suffices through one sheep this is equivalent to one-seventh of a camel or of a cow which means i can offer one sheep for my house and my dependents but if i want to take part in a cow or a camel i can join six others so the seven of us would have one seventh of this cow or camel and this one seventh would suffice for a single sheep and not necessarily the whole seven are all offering here see we can come on the day of eight and two of us once two seventh of this cow for ut and the rest is being bought by an individual who wants the meat only he doesn't want to offer it here so he takes his five seventh to store in his freezer there's no problem in that and this is totally legit"
