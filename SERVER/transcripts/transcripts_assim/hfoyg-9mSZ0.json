  "transcript": "fan from Saudi Arabia is my question was what should we what should a do um if he receives the IM or does something the IM doesn't do for example he many people thought that the IM was going to do so when im said and went into went for so what and they realized when the said so what should they do in this case okay I will answer inshallah fan from Saudi Arabia he says there's there was a situation where the IM was reciting an Ayah with suud of recitation in it so he said the last verse ofah and he said so all the M they thought that he's going for sujud so they went for suud he the IM knowing that it's not mandatory actually he went for R so the IM was in everybody else was in when he said those in suud figured it out so now we're in a dilemma what should we do well the scholars say this negligence due to this mistake is forgiven so they should immediately stand up from their sujud and do though the IM went to to IM is standing up for saying and immediately afterwards go for uh rising up from ru and catching up with the Im so being late in a pillar or so is Forgiven for such a mistake and Allah Asel Knows Best"
