  "transcript": "Hemet from Kuwait's first question was about his son his son Mike most of the new generation now they are influenced greatly by hip-hop singers by movies by the Western culture which is the new form of invasion so he feels inferior he feels weak he doesn't know anything about Islam he doesn't know probably except al-fatiha and maybe and if you tell him do you know ayatul kursi he would not probably know it by heart so how would he feel the pride and the dignity among his peers is by doing something that no other one would probably do so he pierced his ear to wear an earring and most likely it's one ear only not both ears maybe next year he would do tattoos on his body unfortunately may Allah protect him and guide him so Mohammed is asking is this permissible answer is no the prophet salallahu alaihe salam cursed the men who imitate women and cursed them women who imitate men and the Prophet told us those who imitate the disbelievers or those who just who imitate a people would be among them so Muhammad your son is one of two either he's imitating women or he's imitating Kafar and I very much doubt that if you look at any of the scholars of Islam of the deities of the judges of the Imams of the Masjid you would find anyone piercing his ear no one does this except the kafir and even the bad sinful Muslims don't do this generally speaking so he is in great danger he should repent to Allah so chill and stop what he's doing and to be proud of his Islam before it is soon without him realizing he may think of other religions to be better than Islam we have"
