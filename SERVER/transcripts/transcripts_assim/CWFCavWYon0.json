  "title": "If we inhale smoke of a smoker, will we take from his good deeds on day of judgement Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if someone's no if someone smokes like near someone and harms them with like the smell and possibly dangerous effects will that person be given from the smoker's Good Deeds that's like he's hurting the other guy providing the other guy like you know is trying his best to like avoid it can you give example I did not understand your question like uh you're like like next to like maybe like uh like your father or something you start smoking and then like you start like coughing because of like you know because of like the smell and like how it's like really bad for your lungs so what are you asking about is your father sinful for that yeah no I'm asking like because like because uh he smokes like in the house like like right next to the room to me and sometimes like the smoke comes to me and I like I breathe in and like it harms me like my my lungs start hurting and I like you know it has a really bad smell as well okay so of course your father is sinful for that because smoking is Haram and if he intended to harm you he would be sinful for harming you as well whether you will take from his Good Deeds on the day of judgment or not this is in Allah's hands he's your father after all if he was a stranger I would have yes said probably you will take from his Good Deeds for harming you and harming the environment and harming himself and most likely he wouldn't care someone who's indulging in such a sin do you think he would care whether you take from his sins or not he's blinded by his sin now when I see people I was the other night a couple of nights ago I was with my uh relatives and we were discussing how prices spiked so one of the brothers was saying that how much is a pack of cigarette I remember it used to be like 40 50 years ago one real and the others laughed at him they said it ranges between 18 and 25 and the other one was telling me do you think this is expensive in the UK it's approximately something around like 15 or 20 pounds and that is outrageous who in his right mind would pay such money for such filth that's not natural you know if you give soft drinks or some juice to a five-year-old child it they would drink it and love it they won't won't vomit they won't cough they won't fall uh or faint but if you give a cigarette to a 12 or 15 year old child not an infant a 15 year old child who never smoked before and he inhales the first puff he would probably faint or go into a seizure of of coughing and and attack and his eyes would go red and Allah knows maybe he would vomit an manages to change people's nature so that this child who few years ago had this reaction now enjoys a puff of a cigarette after a good meal or while drinking coffee or tea and he finds this one of the marvels of this life to enjoy how shaytan changes and transforms their nature Purity into enjoying such filth subhanallah so people they change their nature they don't care if they give others their Good Deeds because they're blinded with their sin make Dua for your father and try your level best to give him jawah in a nice and diplomatic way"
