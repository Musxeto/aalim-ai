  "transcript": "Faizan from Kashmir Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Okay Sheikh So today my question is while jumping from one surah to another surah should we say Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim all the time? Okay, first of all Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim is a separate ayah dividing surahs and to be recited in the beginning of the surah so it is not counted from the surah itself Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim is not one of them though in some books of the Quran you would find Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim one and this is the only surah that has Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim one other surahs like Al Baqarah you would find Bismillahir Rahmanir Rahim nothing after that Alif Lam Mim one so this is different now saying Bismillah before each surah with the exception of chapter 9 surah At-Tawbah is a recommended sunnah if you say it that's fine if you don't and you skip it there is no problem in that Thank you"
