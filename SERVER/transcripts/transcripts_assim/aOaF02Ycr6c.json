  "transcript": "oh uh when i uh purchase eggs from the market and i and when i crack them open i find blood spots inside them and this happens very often you find what blood spots blood spots you're talking about eggs yes eggs okay um recently i researched it and confirmed that they are actual blood spots i would like to know is it permissible to consume uh such eggs with blood spots or remove that part only and consume or should i throw the egg as a whole no this is this is totally permissible to consume and to eat and if you cook it it will disappear there is no problem in consuming and eating such eggs in sha allah azzawajal such blood is negligible and forgiven simply because we are not obliged to slaughter an egg secondly even the steaks and the meat we originally slaughtered the animals off whether a cow or a sheep sometimes when we cook them we find little traces of blood this is negligible and it's halal the haram blood is the one that comes gushing from the animal when being slaughtered this is this is in some countries or let's say cultures they collect the blood and they may drink it and they may cook it this is haram this is najis this is totally prohibited in islam but what remains in the veins what you find in an egg a spot or two this is negligible and permissible to consume"
