  "transcript": "brother Abdullah from Nigeria was asking about the usual question and that is people pray with the Imam and the Imam offer wit in thewi but they would like to go back to their homes and offer more night prayer on their own so what to do because they have conflicting hadiths so they think one Hadith says that there are no two witters in the same night and this is Athen and another Hadith says that make the last of your night prayer Witter which means that if I'm going to pray in the beginning and then I'm going to pray at the end of the night I should only pray one Witter well the answer is very easy the prophet told us in an authentic Hadith that he who prays with his IM until the prayer is over Allah would record for him Allah would reward him as as if he prayed the whole night from Sunset until the break of dawn so usually your Imam prays for an hour an hour and a half maximum if you pray with him and offer W then you have been rewarded as if you prayed the whole night but what about if I would like to go and pray more in my home you have two options the first option is if the Imam is praying two ra plus one you pray with him and when he prays the last which is an individual W when he offers Salam you stand up and pray a second R and by this you have prayed even numbers so when you go home you pray as many as you wish and then conclude that with one ra as indicated by the prophet Alat wasam but if you're not sure that you're going to pray night prayer you might as well pray with the Imam until he's over from his and you pray wicker with him as well and if you go home you may pray as many r as you wish but do not repeat the Witter it's done so what to do with the Hadith where the Prophet instructed us to make the last prayer of the night prayer as Witter well this is the scholars say this is not mandatory this is not obligatory this is high highly recommended well how do you say this we know from the from fundamentals of that whenever an instruction comes from the prophet Alat whether it comes from Allah the almighty in the Quran or in the Sunnah from the prophet Alam an order means it's an obligation unless another evidence comes to reduce this obligation into recommendation likewise when the prophet when Allah says in the Quran or the prophet Sall wasallam says in his Hadith that you should not do something this is a negation so in when Allah or the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam say that you shouldn't do this don't do this this means that it is forbidden unless there's another evidence that reduces it to not recommended so the prophet says make the last prayer of the night prayer as Witter what to do about this well it's very easy in the authentic Sunnah the prophet Al used to pray two after the Witter and he sometimes he used to pray them sitting down so the scholars say from this Hadith we know and learn that the instruction of having the wit the last thing to be prayed at night is a recommended thing but it is not mandatory because the prophet himself Alat wasam prayed uh two raas after Witter"
