  "title": "Can we stop women from going to the Masjid as there is no barrier between men & women!",
  "transcript": "[Music] said not to prevent our women for from going to the masajid but I came across a narration where is said if the prophet knew what the women were doing then he would stop them from going to the Masjid and nowadays there are a lot of massages where they do not have a proper barrier between men's and women's section if any barrier at all where the women is completely unseen they're most likely seen by the men so can we or like prevent our women from going to the massage or can the Masjid Community prevent women from coming to their Masjid first of all said was not a rejection of the prophet's instructions do not prevent women from attending prayers in the Masjid that is what the prophet said Allah do not so when she said had the prophet seen what the women are doing today he would have prevented them is not a rejection rather it is a form of showing her grief of what the women are doing at her era compared to what they used to do at the time of the Prophet that is so no one in his sound mind would say okay the prophet said something but due to the change of times we're going to ignore the prohibition of the Prophet that Islam from a woman from uh not attending so we will overrule that no one in his sound mind would say this as IBN Abbas himself said may Allah be pleased with a man with his father stones and rocks are about to rain on your heads from the heavens stones and rocks and meteors and the and the likes would come falling on your heads I say the prophet said so and so and so and you reply but Abu Bakr and Umar said something else as if Abu Bakr and Umar can qualify to refute or reject the prophet's instructions this is outrageous nobody in his sound mind would say this thing therefore what mother Aisha said was only to show her grief and sorrow of how women had become at her error and if she were to see how women are doing today that would be a different story altogether secondly you say that the message in your community do not have a barrier well for your own information the Masjid at the time of the Prophet Allah did not have a barrier either men and women prayed in the same place but the prophet instructed that the worst of men's Rose are the last so the men should be way up front and the worst of women's Rose are the first so the men should be at the back to keeping as much Gap and space between men and women so that they would not interact or be able to see one another and to prevent fitna so the issue of barrier or having a chamber or a wall all of this is not part of the Sunnah if a community would introduce this just because some of the women may not be properly covered some of the men may not be righteous and Pious enough to lower their gaze to protect the women this is okay this is fine but it is not something part of Islam or part of the Masjid that we say we have to introduce so coming to your questions can we or can the committee or the board of the Masjid prevent them the answer is totally no totally Haram totally prohibited"
