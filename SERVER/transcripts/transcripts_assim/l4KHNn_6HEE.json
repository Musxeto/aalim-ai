  "transcript": "I was out of my city for two days. So the \nsecond day I was planning to come back. So   that day I prayed Fajr and Zhuhr in that city \nand in the back of my mind I planned to pray   Asr then leave that city. But due to some reason \nwe went outside but we got late and then started   to come back. On that journey Maghrib Athan \nwas called. After that Isha Athan was called so   I didn't have the intention to combine \nMaghrib with Isha. And also when   I asked my parents to pray they told me to pray \nat home. So what should I do in this place? When did you remember that you did not pray Asr. On the time when Asr was due Then you have to pray it immediately, you cannot \ndelay Asr at all. So if you did not reach your   hometown you should have prayed \nAsr two rak'as Qasr (Shortening). As for Maghrib, if Maghrib or the \nsunset took place while you're still   on your journey and haven't reached your home, \nthere's no problem in delaying it till Isha. If   you reach home after Isha was due and \ncombine Maghrib and Isha together,   praying three raka's then four rak'as Isha. there \nis no shortening if you reach your hometown.   The intention of combining is not \nnecessarily present when Maghreb is due.   If you don't want to pray it, don't pray even if \nyou don't want to intend to combine it because   you are a traveller and you have this \nconcession without any problem Insha Allah."
