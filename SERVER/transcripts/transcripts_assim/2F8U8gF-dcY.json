  "title": "How can we make dhikr, dua for sake of Allah alone when we seek it's reward or benefit Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "faizan from india says we know that we should make our dua only for the sake of allah but sometimes we anticipate other than that for example doing zikr we have in our minds that this is for protection who told you that zikr gives you protection allah and the prophet isa so you're not doing anything wrong who told you that if you connect to your neck kinship allah would prolong your life and would increase your provision the prophet has an authentic hadith so if i do this with the intention of worshiping allah but at the same time as a by-product i may get more provision is that wrong no there's nothing wrong in that insha allah"
