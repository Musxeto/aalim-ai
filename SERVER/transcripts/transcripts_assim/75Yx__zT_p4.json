  "transcript": "and Insaram from Australia. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Sheikh, I was wondering that if a deceased has left some debts behind, and he hasn't left any inheritance at all to pay off the debts from, and he has a wife and two daughters who remain after his death, are his heirs the ones who are most responsible to pay off the debts on his behalf? And would it be his wife or his children, or do any of them have any responsibility at all? Jazak Allah Khairan. Wa Jazakum. So, the question is clear. If a deceased dies leaving nothing behind, who's obliged to pay off his debts? The wife, or the two daughters, or if he had sons? The answer is none of them. This is an obligation upon the individual. The heirs are not obliged to pay off for his debts or for his mistakes. If he did not leave any property or wealth behind, then this is not their responsibility. If they are well off, and they would like to save their loved one, save their father for example, by paying off his debts, then Alhamdulillah, they are rewarded for that, but it is not mandatory upon them. And Allah knows best."
