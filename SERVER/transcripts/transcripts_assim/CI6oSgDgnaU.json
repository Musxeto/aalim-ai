  "title": "If Allah answers dua in 3 ways What's the significance of making dua in special times assim alhakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign prayer is answered like before breaking the first or on the third on the last third of the night Allah still responds in three these three ways so what's the benefit of making Dua on these special times when the prayer is answered compared to a day when it is normal on any irregular day so like I don't understand the benefit of like making Dua on a special time because the response would be the same in both cases that's what I'm confused when you make Dua to Allah you have no guarantees that Allah is going to accept your Dua in the sense that maybe you're not sincere maybe you're not uh present-minded because in the Hadith Allah the prophet said Allah said supplicate and make Dua to Allah with present-minded because Allah does not respond to someone whose heart is negligent and absent the prophet said he would not respond so whenever we make Dua we're not certain that Allah will respond to it because it may not have fulfilled the conditions if it did fulfill the conditions then making these duas at the Times where answering the Dua is most likely and highly such as between Adan and a Karma such as when breaking your iftar your fast such as in the last third of the night such as when it's raining such as when you hear um The Roaster sound in in the Fajr all of these are more more likely for your advance to be answered especially the first category which is oh Allah make it happen now so this is the difference that the more you select these recommended times the more highly your uh do I would be answered especially here in uh this world when you want whatever you want it to happen and Allah Knows Best"
