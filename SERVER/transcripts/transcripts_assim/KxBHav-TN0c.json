  "title": "He suffers from OCD in Purity & it has taken control of his life, , what to do",
  "transcript": "i've been wondering about this for some time because i i have i have adhd and the condition uh and basically for some time i've been wondering about why i've been having a hard time uh with purity and then i realized you know that this is close again i wanted to ask you about a confirmation about this uh because i often feel i often feel anxious and uh you know even scared when i'm but i'm purifying myself and that things and add objects and stuff and i i feel like i personally struggle with purity and it's also making me scared in life and it's taken away from my motivation you know to to do other worldly things and and i just want it all to go because i want to take the burden off and and you know and and can i just try and do what i can and and and take the batter off because okay first of all you're suffering from ocd and this is caused by shaytan missing messing up with your head with one mission and one mission alone is to divert you from the straight path get you as further as possible as far away as possible from allah azzawajal and from pleasing allah azzawajal apparently mission accomplished ask yourself am i more righteous and god-fearing than the prophet ali and his companions am i more righteous and knowledgeable than the prophet islam and his companions is there something special about me more than the 8 billion humans living on earth leave them alone the 2 billion muslims living on earth nobody's suffering what i'm suffering so why is this am i more righteous than them the answer is no and this is for certain why is it happening because you're opening the door for shaytan to mess up with your head everybody's urinating like in two minutes and that's it clean themselves and go out everybody makes wudu in 60 to 90 seconds so what's the problem what's your problem your problem is that you are inviting shaytan in and allowing him to mess up with your head though allah says in the quran the plotting of satan is weak how can such weak plotting overcome you this means that you're weaker than him then the deficiency is in you not in him not in islam definitely not in anything else you have to man up and live according to sharia and not according to your whims and desires at the moment when you're purifying yourself you're not following sharia yes but i'm afraid i'm doing this i'm do you're afraid is not part of sharia it's part of whims and desires so follow sharia and you will be in good hands insha'allah you"
