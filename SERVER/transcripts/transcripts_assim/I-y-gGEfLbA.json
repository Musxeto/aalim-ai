  "transcript": "emit she's saying what's the ruling on praying of women in a Masjid behind in a closed room where they cannot see the congregation the men or uh the Imam but they can relate to that either by his microphone and the speakers in that room in the prayer Hall of the women or by TV screens in a close circuit uh TV and the answer is as long as they are in the same Masjid and they can follow this through listening or seeing it this is totally permissible though closing it in this fashion totally not by putting on partition but totally closing it this is not the right thing to do and unfortunately wrong things may happen you know someone would get in and do things and men are not aware of what's happening in the uh uh ladies section and someone would Rob them or do something that is uh not correct she's saying"
