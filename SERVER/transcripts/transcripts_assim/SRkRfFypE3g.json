  "transcript": "sajid from bangladesh he says if a scholar gives me a fatwa and it's a wrong fatwa and i follow that fatwa would i be sinful the answer is if you are a layman and you trust this mufti and you think that he possesses the necessary knowledge the fear of allah and his religious commitment is accepted to you in this case there is no sin none whatsoever because you don't know any better if i go to a professor in medicine in a hospital and he says we have to do a procedure we have to operate on you i say okay you know best and he operates and i die would i be committing suicide not at all because he's trusted and this is something allah has decreed that is when my time ends in fatwa it's the same thing but if i know if i have knowledge if i have evidences yet i want to put the blame on someone else i know that smoking is prohibited and i love to smoke so i ask 10 scholars they all say this particular one says and he's a scholar but a bit twisted made the wrong decision maybe he was misguided i don't know i know i'm convinced it's haram but this particular person says well this is something that allah grew from the ground so if it's haram we're burning it and if it's halal we're smoking it okay i like his fatwa nah now i'm sinful because i know the ruling yet i needed someone to put the blame on and this would not help me in front of allah"
