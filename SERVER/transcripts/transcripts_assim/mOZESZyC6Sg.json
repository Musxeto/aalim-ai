  "transcript": "um his blessing on him may allah be pleased with him this hadith he said that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam says when any one of you enters the mosque the masjid he should observe two rakah of nafl prayer before sitting and this hadith was reported by imam muslim in the sahih now this hadith is known to be the hadith of the masjid the greeting of the masjid however a proper student of knowledge must be very careful when he uses or selects words why you will never find in the hadith of the prophet this terminology and this is what made a lot of the people insist on praying two raka's even if they had prayed sunnah fajr for example we know that the prophet said allah between adhan and iqamah you must not pray except two raka's off sunnah so if a person does not pray at home he comes to the masjid we find people praying two raka's the masjid and then two raka's sunnah fajr and this is wrong because the prophet did not say alas islam you have to specifically pray two rakahs as greeting the masjid he said you cannot sit before praying so any raqqas would do which means that if you pray sunnah and sit this is enough not only that if i come and the prayer has been established they've called for the fart prayer and i joined them whether it's whatever and we concluded the prayer do i have to pray two raka's no because i prayed something that is even greater and bigger and that is why jurors and fukuha sometimes say things to make knowledge easier to people my mistake those who come behind him think that this is part of the deen and i give you a clearer example if you read in any book of fick in arabic you will find that one of the things that are prohibited for a mushrim to do is to wear al-makhit is to wear threaded clothes sold clothes so a lot of the people come and ask shay what to do my watch is made of leather and there are threads in it so i definitely can't take it my belt has threads in it so definitely i cannot take it and i say where do you get this from all jurors all fukah say that you cannot wear something with threads and i say and challenge did the prophet allah ever said anything similar to that you go and research and you come back to me and say no so where did the jurors come with this description they looked at what the prophet said allah what did the prophet say when the prophet was asked al-islam what would a muhrim wear what should he wear the prophet did not list a wardrobe where the muharram should put on this would have no limitation likewise when someone comes to me and says what should i eat i say you can eat spaghetti macaroni pizza this is italian then if you move to american you have hamburgers and steaks and so on meatballs and if you go to saudi there is rice and there is kebab there is it would the list ever end no but if i answer him in something that is limited so i say you should not eat pork you should not eat dead meat you should not eat blood you should not eat something that was not slaughtered properly end of story likewise when the prophet was asked what should the mushrim wear the prophet said the mushrim must not wear the turbans the shirts the tarawilat or the trousers the shoes the baranes with something that looks like a shirt with a a hood on so he restricted that into five or six issues not to be worn by a mushroom the scholars sat back and thought what's the common denominator what's the common denominator all of these things are stitched so they use stitching in it and therefore anything that is stitched is not permissible for a muharram this is wrong if my echram the clothes that i wear for one of them was torn is there any problem if i stitch it not at all if i bring this big towel and i stitch it as a skirt is this permissible it's permissible the prophet forbade me from wearing what trousers and the things that may take the same ruling such as underwears known as to ban but other than that the sky's the limit so scholars when they went to this hadith they said this hadith is regarding tahiyat al-masjid and they concluded a number of rules and verdicts saying that it is not permissible to sit until you offer the haitian masjid and the haitian masjid has to be a separate salah which is not authentic which is not correct now the hadith of she entered and sat while the prophet was giving juma he told him stand up and pray indicates that it is mandatory otherwise the prophet isaiah was giving the khutbah of the juba he would not interrupt the khutba and he would not request the companion to go and pray rather than listen to the khutbah unless it was what unless it was mandatory and this is why scholars differed among them they said that okay what about if the person enters the masjid after fajr prayer and before sunrise we know that this is time of prohibition also after asir until the sun sets we know that this is a time off prohibition so what happens if a person enters this masjid should he abide by the prohibition and not sit but that is not to pray or should he follow this instruction to pray we have to conflicting evidences what to do if you remember first thing we try to combine if we're unable we try to know which one came first and the latter would be abrogating the first if unable we have to see which is stronger and more authentic one in the quran one in the sunnah we take the quran two in the sunnah one in the sunnah we take the sahih if not then we stop until we ask and investigate more maybe other scholars are able and capable of giving us an answer now also we have a number of rules that made some of the scholars confused such as they say whenever we have two instructions one saying that this is permissible and one saying that this is forbidden what do we always take what is forbidden we always overrule the prohibition why because it's always safer so when they say that when we have two conflicting instructions one prohibits and one says is permissible say apply the prohibition and in the hadith here it is prohibited to pray after asar until sunset and the order is telling you to pray before sitting down so which one we should we make forward some scholars say we have to take the prohibition so if i come after answer i sit without praying because praying is prohibited however scholars such as al-imam shafi such as invintamiya such as bimbas they looked at it from a holistic view so they tried to combine which is the highest degree of applying or resolving conflict between evidences why they said okay let's look at the prohibition do not pray is it a general instruction that has no specifics coming out from it or there are exceptions they said no there are exceptions give us example they said if the sun eclipse what to do pray so this is an exception from the prohibition if we have a funeral prayer what to do pray so this is an exception from the prohibition therefore the evidence is not general it has specifics it has exceptions let us look at the instruction whenever you come to the masjid do not sit until you pray two raka's does it have any exceptions scholars say no the prophet said pray all the way he did not exempt he did not specify any exceptions of that so the scholars say as long as this which has exceptions is conflicting with this that has no exceptions this prevails you understand this so now what prevails is the hadith that states that whenever you enter a masjid you should pray two rakahs before you sit down and this tells us that there is no exceptions any time of the day or of the night any time of the week 24 7 if you enter the masjid you may not sit down until you pray two raka's and when you pray these two raka's make them light and make them quick especially if they are a time of prohibition so one comes to the masjid before maghrib he prays two raka's of the haitian masjid he should not take his time like in ten minutes prolong his prostration no he should make it as quick as possible we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back so i believe that inshallah we have gone through the issue of tahiti masjid and we explained that it should be prayed any time of the day and night and we know that it is mandatory it is not voluntary you have to pray if you sit without praying you are sinful and i believe that the school of thought of imam abu hanifah states that you do not have to do it if i'm not mistaken also the school of thought of malik they say that it is not mandatory to pray it but from the hadith we learned that it is mandatory the prophet instructed the man who sat down to stand up and pray it and offer it only to indicate how important this prayer is we move on to hadith 111. yes brother zayd bin arkam reported we used to talk while engaged in prayer a man talks to the man next to him in prayer until this verse was revealed and stand before allah in devout obedience surah baqarah verse number 238 and we were commanded to observe silence in prayer and were forbidden to speak muslim this hadith relates to an incident that used to take place at the time of the prophet at the beginning when they're praying mandatory and obligatory prayers farida and congregation it was open for them to say and talk and chat so in the prayer a man would come and says what's happening oh is well how's the family alhamdulillah okay and they continue so it was normal to speak and talk and chat until allah azzawajal revealed this in arabic has a number of meanings we have the famous meaning that everybody knows which is it also means to prolong the prayer and the best of prayers are the long prayers as in some narrations it also means to not speak and this is what is intended in this hadith or in this verse because the prophet revealed it to them and he recited it to them which indicates the instruction of allah azza not to speak in prayer so this was at the very beginning and now we're commanded not to speak while praying however scholars differed a lot in regards of what is considered to be speaking so some of them said that whatever is more than two letters is considered to be a word so if someone says for example this is speaking but if you say ah or oh these are two letters this is okay and there is no authentic opinion uh or evidence to back this up whatever is considered to be speaking it is considered to be speaking so if i'm praying and i say to someone hey this is speaking i'm speaking to someone if someone while i'm praying says did anybody come and ask about me and i said yes this is speaking so anything that it comes out of your mouth is considered to be speaking what about laughing scholars say if it's a smile it is highly not recommended but if it is actual laughing you know you make sounds and you you giggle and you cannot control it this is definitely taking out the soul of the prayer so therefore it's even greater than speaking because it shows your lack of interest and disrespect to allah azzawajal while praying the following hadith is hadith number 100 and 12 and who will read it to us yes brother narrated abu hurairah and abdullah bin umar may allah be pleased with them allah's prophet sallallahu alaihi islam said if it is very hot then pray the juha prayer when it becomes a bit cooler as the severity of the heat is from the raging of the hell fire okay this hadith was reported by bukhari and other books of the hadith the hadith is tricky for us as believers the prophet is telling us that the severity of the heat is from hellfire one would say come on this is not logical how can it be from hellfire the simplest thing to say is ahi did you see hellfire nope you've ever visited it said nope so how do you dare and say that it can't be yes we know that it is from the sun and it is from the low air pressure or higher pressure or whatever all of this is things that do not go against what we believe we believe in what the prophet said in an authentic hadith the prophet said sallallahu alaihi sallam that hell complained to allah and said o allah i have eaten myself i have consumed myself due to the severity of the heat so allah azzawajal told hell that i will give you two breaths to breathe through and reduce your heat the prophet said and this is the severity of the heat you find in summer and the severity of cold you find in winter i always read this hadith and i was shocked i always thought that hell was hot now we learned that even the severity of cold is from hell and i could not understand this until i happened to get in touch and i've seen this when there was a slender of nitrogen and some of the nitrogen was released and someone touched that white material and he was severely burnt by it and i was shocked and i said is this hot he said no it is so cold that it burns and then i said subhanallah how does the prophet say something like this in arabia 15 centuries ago with no nitrogen or hydrogen or any of this sort and he says that hell's breath is the most severe cold you find in winter and they didn't have any winter the coldest it would have been probably let's say one degree centigrade below this is not sufficient to burn you to be burnt by such cold weather you have to be like really really below zero so subhanallah i've noticed this in front of me and i was not a very smart kid at school so you definitely recognize that chemistry and physics and etc i was very bad in them but when i saw it in front of me and when i saw that person get burnt so severely by this nitrogen i said allah was therefore this is something that is from the unseen this is from the rape we do not put these rules and regulations in our heads to it we believe them as they come the prophet is saying and telling us in this hadith that we should cool down we should delay the prayer how to cool down the scholars say that you must delay the prayer so instead of praying it at 12 30 in the middle of the summer when it's extremely hot delay it until just before assad prayer 10 15 half an hour before assa prayer because when it's three o'clock is it the same heat as when it's 12 30 it's much less so there are hadith where the weather was extremely hot and the companion wanted to call for the adhan and the prophet said cool down so he didn't half an hour cool down cool down until it was almost close to adhan until it was almost close to adhan al-assar then the prophet said now go on and call for that he called for they prayed to her afterwards immediately he called them for assad and they prayed after this is permissible they prayed the  on time as we know the time extends until just before the vassar now this can be applied only in hot areas so no one goes to cold areas and say well you would like to cool down you it's already cooled down mashallah someone wants to call the prayer in canada for example or in europe your your summer is our winter your summer is our winter the hottest it can get is 25 26 and you die out when temperature is 26 degrees this is the coldest we get in winter 26 degrees or 25 so this applies only to summer when the sun is extremely hot that can we apply to enter no because you cannot warm or heat the prayer because it's the cold weather is throughout the day and night i'm afraid that this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
