  "transcript": "there are a couple of questions on extreme cold i'll just uh take one can one make them if there is extreme cold cannot be performed except when there is lack of water to be used or there is a legitimate reason that prevents you from using water so if extreme cold mandates or calls for you to perform to this is between you and allah so i live in toronto canada and it's uh like 20 degrees below zero and i cannot make wadu i said why this is extremely cold don't you have heaters in your home hot water said yes but still cold no this is you you don't buy this do you but if someone is in the wilderness or in the open or in a place where there is no hot water and he cannot go to the masjid because there is no hot water either and there is no availability of water and he knows that if he uses water the moment he washes his face or his arms he's gonna get harmed or it's extremely painful really painful not you know the type of pain that children run away from them really beyond tolerance yeah in this case you can't perform it's between you and allah nobody's gonna hold the gun against your head here in this life but on the day of judgement you will be held accountable"
