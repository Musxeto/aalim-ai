  "transcript": "that's Allah said in my country many massages celebrating my Danny for mauli so is it sinful to take the Biryani from which from those massage which is celebrating if I heard the question correctly on the eve of the twelfth of some mosques some massage it they celebrate the birthday of the Prophet Allah while doing this they sit in the Masjid they make a congregation they throw a speeches and maybe sing songs and while doing this they serve food so is it permissible for me who do not I do not celebrate the maulid and I know it's an innovation is it permissible for me to go to the Masjid take a plate of Biryani or food and go out and eat it the answer is no why because going there and taking their food is part of endorsing their Innovation and confirming their uh celebration being part of it and this is not permissible if I were home and somebody knocks on my door and gives me a plate of Biryani and I know he brought it from the Masjid there is no problem in eating it because this is halal food the meat is halal the problem is joining them in their celebration and in their congregation while doing their Innovation this is not permissible and Allah Knows Best"
