  "title": "Family invites me to gatherings but not my father, he orders me not to go, what should I do?",
  "transcript": "If these celebrations are mandatory for you to attend, what are the mandatory celebrations to attend? Number one, a wedding celebration, a feast, or a Aqiqah. These are mandatory. So if you're invited to those and they don't purposely invite your father, and your father tells you not to go, you're not obliged to obey him. Because one of the rights upon a Muslim, over a Muslim, that when he invites him, he attends. And this is a religious and a legitimate invitation that you have to attend. However, no one who has honor and dignity would let this slide. So if it's your cousin, or your in-laws, and they invite you and don't purposely invite your father, you just don't go and eat their biryani, and say, oh, jolly good. No, Habibi. You stand as a thorn in their throat, say, why didn't you invite my father? If they say, wallah, we don't like his guts, he said, neither do I. I don't like your guts. You respect my father, you respect me. But I will not jeopardize my Islamic obligations because my father told me to. But next time, be careful. Because insulting my father is not something I would endorse or like. I hope this makes a logical answer."
