  "title": "Allowed to Brush Teeth with TOOTHPASTE while Fasting",
  "transcript": "say from Saudi yes sayam Alum my question is that like are we allowed to brush our teeth during fasting the prophet was reported to be seen brushing his teeth while fasting numerous times during the day and night so during the day while fasting of course during the night there's no problem in that therefore there is nothing wrong in brushing your teeth while fasting Scholars say that if you're using toothpaste you have to ensure that none of the mass of the paste is swallowed so if you just brush it and gargle your mouth Rin your mouth well and there's no residue nothing left from the paste and you spit it out there's no problem in that inshallah at all"
