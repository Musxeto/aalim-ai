  "transcript": "uh a question is is it allowed to give money to the Beggars regardless of the fact whether legitimate or professional beggar I have a weakness I cannot say no to anyone asking me please advise me thank you a lot first of all generosity is a characteristic of a Muslim and the most generous person on Earth was the prophet Alat wasam he never ever said no to anyone asking him even if he had need for that and also Allah has praised and complimented the ansar in the Quran when he said subh inah that they prefer others with what they have though they have need for it yet they give priority to others and they help others uh over themselves so this is a sign of great and good Iman now for you as a person when someone comes begs you if you do this if you do this because you are ashamed or you are uh shy of this person so you give him money for his continuous uh demand this is not for the sake of Allah but if you do this for the sake of Allah which so happens that it is your character to be generous and giving but it is for the sake of Allah then whether they're legitimate uh or professional Beggars those who are not in need but they're doing it just to make money inshallah you are rewarded for that Hussein"
