  "transcript": "San from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu How are you doing Sheikh? Doing great with the great of grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal Alhamdulillah Sheikh my question was if one hears the name of the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam while praying what should he or she do should they you know say it should they say the supplication the salutation upon the prophet while praying or should they say it after the prayer while praying a person should not offer the salutation upon the prophet when he hears his name especially when the verse of the Quran for example mentions his name or when Allah says that he and his angels offer salutation upon the prophet alayhi salam or you who believe offer salutation upon him we do not offer salutation while listening to the recitation of the Quran because we have to be attentive and it was not reported that the prophet alayhi salam ordered us to do so during salat yes if you hear his name outside of salat we offer salutation thousands of times per day sallallahu alayhi wa sallam because we love him and we know the great reward that Allah has placed for those who offer salutation upon the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam however because it was never reported to us that offering salutation upon him sallallahu alayhi wa sallam when hearing his name during salat it was never reported that he had ever done such a thing or his companions or the tabi'een we refrain from doing that and Allah knows best"
