  "transcript": "foreign what is it that you want oh i want a lot of things do you have the time to ask for all of these things don't go into details go into general things because allah is generous and he'll give you more than what you ask for there is a beautiful dua that the prophet alaihim used to say before he concludes his prayer now contemplate upon this it's so beautiful so profound so strong and few of us memorize it by heart the prophet used to say sallallahu alaihi wasallam by your knowledge of the unseen who knows unseen no one except allah so i'm asking allah by his attributes and this is how we praise allah by saying his attributes in the beginning by your knowledge of the unseen and your power over creation okay what is it that you want keep me alive so long as you know such life to be good for me and take me if you know death to be better for me inevitably we're going to die sooner or later but in this dua we acknowledge the fact that we're going to die and we ask allah to choose our death time to be at a good time and not to make us encounter calamities and tribulations and fitnah and torture and poverty etc so we're begging allah azzawajal and then you say o allah make me fearful of you whether in secret or in public and this is sincerity to be fearful of allah when in secret this is complete sincerity and i ask you to make me true in speech in times of pleasure and anger so i ask you to make me truthful because when i'm okay in a normal condition i usually say the truth but when i'm angry when i'm fighting with someone and disputing with someone this is where i may slip and say something that is not truthful and i ask you to make me moderate in times of wealth and poverty when i am poor definitely i'm going to be moderate i'm not going to buy a expensive toys and cars and things and live a lavish life but at times of ease and wealth this is when i need allah's help to be moderate and i ask you for ever lasting bliss and joy which will never cease what can be everlasting bliss and joy this can only be in jannah this can only be in paradise and you may get a glimpse of that in this life as most righteous people have this regardless of their wealth and poverty because they have content of what allah has ruled and decreed i ask you to make me pleased with what you have decreed and for an easy life after death being content of allah's decree is the highest level of happiness because you know that this was written 50 000 years before allah created the creation so whether you bang your head on the wall or you are quiet and content it's not going to change so better for you to be quiet and content and accept what allah has ruled so that you would have a reward at the side of allah azzawajal and easy life after death when death comes this is the end of this life and the beginning of eternity if you get an easy life then you are rewarded and favored and blessed by allah to be admitted to jannah i ask you for the sweetness of looking upon your face looking upon allah's azzawajal face is the ultimate of naim of favors and blessings of allah of endless gifts in paradise the highest level of reward is to look at allah azzawajal allah's face on the day of judgment not only that i also ask you for a longing to encounter you in a manner which does not entail a calamity which will bring about harm nor a trial which will cause deviation i want to long to meet you o allah ask individuals do you want to meet allah the vast majority would hesitate in answering because their logic works meeting allah means death i don't want to die so they may refrain or at least hesitate no i'm asking you to give me a longing to encounter you to meet you but i want to meet you after having a good life without entailing a calamity yes it would raise my level in gender but i don't know if i'm going to be patient and tolerant and not objecting so please don't let me be among those and i won't don't want any harm or trial which will cause deviation because i would like and i would love to remain steadfast on the straight path then you say o allah beautify us with the adornment of faith and make us of those who guide and are rightly guided what a beautiful dua wallahi if we contemplate upon it upon the messages included in it we understand for one hundred percent reality that our prophet allah is the messenger of allah because no one can formulate so much beauty in such concise paragraph the ideas behind it it's mind-blowing we know and we acknowledge that the prophet alaihis was given the concise of speech meaning he would say a couple of words that you need volumes to explain not because they're ambiguous but rather because they include so much wisdom that definitely is a revelation from allah and not from his own self this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave [Music] foreign"
