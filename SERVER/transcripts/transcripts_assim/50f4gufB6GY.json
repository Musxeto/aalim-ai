  "transcript": "know that there are rules about reading the Quran that is we should be in the state of woo before touching the book how does this rule apply to electronic devices I usually read the Quran on my phone or laptop also should we be in wo if we only recite from memory not touching or reading I'll begin with your second question you do not need to be in the state of Wu when you read the Quran or recite it from memory and a lot of the sisters especially from the subcontinent they come and say when we recite the Quran do we have to wear our hijab do we have to cover our hair when we hear the aan is it must that we wear the hijab and all of this is baseless these are baseless things you in your house are not o oig at all to cover your head when hearing the Adan or when reciting the Quran at all so this is baseless one would say oh it's best that I do it no it's not because now you're innovating now you're bringing something to the dean that is not part of it as for reciting the Quran and touching the uh um pdas or the mobile phones or the laptops to read the Quran from the it you do not require uh wo for that why because these characters these letters these words they are digital so once you turn them off they're gone they are not like the actual Quran which is written on paper and this requires wo and this is what the scholars say of course if you perform wo would I be rewarded definitely that is a plus and it is definitely more recommended uh to do than to recite it without but sometimes you're on the street you're on the bus in the train you are in a queue you're waiting uh for your appointment at the doctor's and you're not in the state of w and you have the Quran so instead of reading a magazine or chitchatting or watching the TV uh in the waiting room you do something useful and you recite the Quran from your electronic device without the need of making wo Andel Knows Best"
