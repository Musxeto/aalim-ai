  "transcript": "you have reverted to Islam and your family are still Christian okay so what's the problem and I'm practicing Muslim now okay what's your problem I don't know if that is the same no do oh your husband is still a Christian yes okay first of all alhamdulillah that Allah the almighty has saved you from Darkness into the light and from kufur into Islam this by itself would save you from eternity and hellfire and will award you a seat in Paradise if you manage to die on Islam and not change your ways now when you accept Islam you as a rule of thumb cannot be with a non-muslim husband so you have to give him dawa you have to call him to Islam and you have to tell him honey now I have accepted Islam in my religion in my belief I cannot be with a non-muslim husband so we have a choice we are at the fork of the road either you accept Islam and we can continue to live as man and wife and enjoy this beautiful religion together and continue to live our lives as a couple and end up in Paradise as a couple as well with the grace of Allah if you don't want to accept Islam I have no other choice but to leave you and leave my life behind because the moment I accepted Islam this is a full life transformation I have submitted my will to the almighty not to human beings not to man-made laws so whatever Allah wants me to do I will do it and Allah ordered me in the Quran and in the Sunnah and this is a consensus of all Muslims Scholars and non-scholars that a Muslim woman cannot be married to a non-muslim so you have the choice and give him few days to think it over no intimacy none whatsoever is totally prohibited for you because he's not Muslim if he accepts Islam alhamdulillah it's a win-win situation and may Allah Grant you the reward of him accepting Islam but if he is defiant and adamant not to change his religion then there is no other choice for you but to leave him on immediate impact and effect and move on with your life and I hope this answers your question uh"
