  "transcript": "so the questioner says does a small amount of water becomes that is impure if some impurity falls into it but its characteristics do not change this is a very long topic that was discussed in the books of jurisprudence of in different schools of thought and mainly the reason of difference of opinion is a number of evidences one the hadith that when the water is over two pots or jars it does not carry impurity because the amount of water is a lot and the other hadith is water is the water is and it is not rendered nudges by anything and a number of other hadiths that fall under the same guidelines so some scholars said that if the water is below the level of jars or pots big pots then it carries impurity regardless and some said no it doesn't carry impurity or it is not rendered as impure because the prophet said assam that water is tahor and it is not rendered not just by anything that falls into it now they all agree that if the water whether a lot or little if one of the three characteristics of it has changed by an impurity and a jazza then it becomes najis and these characteristics are the smell the color and the taste or the taste one of these three so if there is a lake is the the sea water the ocean water the nile the river this is not rendered as nudges because it's always running and no matter how impurity you put in it it does not change its characteristics because it's a lot but now the problem is if we come to a small amount of water and a tiny little drop of urine fell into it i'm not going to drink it of course but if i look into it and i smell it and i taste it but if so happens and there is nothing that has changed so all the characteristics of water remain as water it was not changed by this little minute impurity that fell into it this is the issue of dispute some scholars say no it is nudges even if it's not changed because it's less than two jars or two pots some and this is the most authentic opinion say that as long as the three characteristics did not change then the liquid is the water is still pure and we cannot describe it otherwise so this is the most authentic opinion of scholars now if you want to be safe you can easily avoid the the water that had impurity in it for certain but it did not change its characteristics if the amount is negligible so if it's like five six liters and you can dispose of that just to be safe and to be careful for your religion that would be okay but if you use that water because the characteristics are intact and not changed by an impurity this is the most authentic opinion and there's no problem on you in that you"
