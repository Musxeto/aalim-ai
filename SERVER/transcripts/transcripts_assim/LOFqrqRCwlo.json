  "transcript": "is praising someone sinful in Islam what if someone praises his or her brother in Islam for encouragement or out of love now you cannot answer this without details praising people depends on the impact it has upon people upon others so for example we find that the Prophet are in salat wa salam praised in many cases a number of his companions he praised abu bakr as you may have heard in the commercial during the break if we can say its commercial if it's a piece of information about abu bakr and how he was the most useful to the prophet as salaam through his wealth he praised umar for his strength he praised earth man for his generosity he praised so many companions of the prophet elisha a distillate or sauna may allah be pleased with them all so this is ok if we can guarantee and ensure that the person i'm praising heart would not be affected negatively but also the prophet has some witnessed a man praising someone in his face so two people were talking and one of them was saying o my friend you are the most pious the most generous the most caring and loving I've never seen anyone walk the earth like you and the other one was listening his head was probably growing growing like a balloon a soon to be burst out so the Prophet said I am said to the man who was praising him said way hakka laa dhwaja Terranova Eric meaning that you have slaughtered your brother with what you're saying because such praise would only be infested by Shaitaan by The Devil's putting whispers and ideas in me I'm like there someone comes to me and say Sheriff your so and so and so and I said a stuff for Allah inside I would say I'm more than that evening Joshi Allah have mercy and so said I went with a friend of mine to one of the messages in al kufan in Iraq and we went after midnight and the message was empty except for one person who was praying night prayer with a small candle next to him so I was whispering to my friend masha'Allah look how beautiful this man's prayer is so much submissiveness so much concentration it so happened that the man heard it so he concluded his prayer quickly and then he came to them and he said proudly you like my prayer what would you say if you were to know that I've been fasting for the past 20 years if New Jersey explains in his beautiful book side of heart he explained and says look at this stupid person this imbecile he has totally wavered his good deeds by exposing it in such a way you've deleted your good deeds by exposing it to other so when you are praised then the one who's praising you is doing you harm and this is why the Prophet said Alice all Salaam so to rob he was oh he'll murder him that you should take dust and whenever someone praises it throw it in his face because he's harming you more than benefiting you I don't need people to come and praise me therefore you have to be balanced and this is why when you want to speak about the third person so they were both of us are talking about Abdullah Abdullah is not there so I'm saying Abdullah is one heck of a guy he is masha'Allah righteous knowledgable and I have to add this phrase whether it was a key here a la la I do not praise him before Allah well la who has he bow Allah his is his the one who holds him to account why do I put this disclaimer so that I would not say something and it would be wrong as if I'm praising him before Allah so Allah knows who is righteous and who is not therefore you have to strike this balance and it's a very fine thread"
