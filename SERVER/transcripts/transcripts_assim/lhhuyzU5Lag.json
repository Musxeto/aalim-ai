  "title": "Build Up and dead skin on ears affect why wudu and Ghusl? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mackenzie from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu So when I was doing Wudu, wiping my ears, I noticed that a tiny bit of buildup from my ears had collected underneath my fingernail. It may have been dead skin cells or soap residue, I don't really know. But I was in the bathroom for a long time trying to get it all out, but it seemed impossible because it just kept coming off. And I don't know if I got it out 100%, but I gave up because my ears became sore and scratched up from trying to get it all off. And I wouldn't say it was a big layer because only a tiny amount would come off at a time. And I don't know or think that you could really see if you were to look in my ear, but I'm concerned about the validity of my previous whistles and Wudus because I know it had to have been there for some time. So does this substance count as a barrier in purification? No, it does not. And you're sinful for spending so much time doing all of that. And all what you needed to do was to just wipe over whatever there was and move on. Doing this excessively is answering the calls of Shaytan, and this is not permissible."
