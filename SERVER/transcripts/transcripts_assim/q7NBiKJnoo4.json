  "title": "How 2 uphold ties of kinship with deviant relatives? Should I treat them with kindness Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is what about when some of our family members are deviant and because we are obliged to keep our ties of kinship with them and sometimes sometimes they throw some really deep sugarhut and they bring some kalami stuff so that's my first question okay my second question is still in the same rhythm and it's the following so i have a family member he's my uncle and he's he's a chef so uh so-called um i'm not trying to undermine him he has knowledge but then i've seen i've witnessed with my eyes the type of rupiah that he does and i think i even called you personally some time ago and he does things that are not according to the sunnah so one time he came to my house and i was hesitant whether i should bring him some food and whether i should be kind to him or not and precisely at that day he was being kind to my parents and he was trying to ease the environment because i became practicing some time ago so my parents are a bit harsh on me sometimes so he was trying to save me so i was a bit hesitant should i should i be kind to him or should i cut him off is he a mushroom confused if you could shut them right here are you with me is he a mushrik kafir no no no no no no okay i will answer you inshallah so so hale uh is asking about how to honor relations of kinship when our relatives are deviant the issue of deviancy is very very critical and crucial to understand when you say that they're deviant a super sufi who worships the graves goes and prostrate to the graves and says and he calls this is shirk this is kufur this is blasphemous this is deviancy but a person who says maulit this is deviancy is it any close no there's no relation both are innovations but one takes you out of the fall of islam the other doesn't if someone insists on uh making congregational dua after far prayer so the imam and the congregation allah this is deviancy is it anything close to offering sacrifice to the deceased graves or visiting dhargas etc no so we have a big problem and this has nothing to do with houston we have a problem our problem is when the youth do not understand their akida do not understand what is deviancy that takes you out of the fold of islam what is not and this is pretty uh clear from your first question so the man or this relative of yours he casts a lot of shubu hat as long as he is a muslim and these shubu hat are within the fold of islam try to refute them try to reply to them if he says yeah why is this why is that why is a woman obliged to cover her hair a man doesn't isn't this is um explain this to me this is shubha but does it take him out of the fold of islam no he's an ignorant imbecile if you have knowledge you can easily refute that and answer it if you don't just smile and say amen to bella and don't engage with him in any argument or debate just simply smile and let him speak for five ten minutes and then he'll give up and feel silly but when you engage with him without knowledge ah now you're putting yourself in quicksand and soon you'll drown and take islam with you no no if you don't have knowledge just smile and say we have to ask uh the scholars yeah but why the scholar just smiles and hear him out and don't reply to him as for your uncle your uncle is visiting your uncle is wise your uncle is trying to soften things up which means that inshallah he's a good muslim but maybe he follows a different rookie than what you follow now i ask you a very important question which is is he a kafir is he a mushrik no in this case he's a muslim and by default you have to honor him you have to respect him you have to smile in his face if not because he's a sheikh because he's your uncle so you have to show him the due respect he deserves and prove to your parents that they're wrong in thinking of you what they're thinking but your hesitance in trying to think it over should i or shouldn't i honor him emphasizes and ensures the idea they have about you that you are extreme you don't know your religion yet you want to shove it down our throats when it is not even the right religion and then after three four months after learning it a little bit he said oops i did it again i'm sorry i i thought this and yeah apparently i was wrong so you start crossing out the boxes this was crossed and but then so oops i no i misunderstood sorry i was wrong i was wrong i was wrong this way whatever you say they're going to say you've been all always wrong like 80 you're wrong why would we trust you in the remaining 20 this is why do not and i repeat do not speak without knowledge you are putting yourself down a rabbit hole if you do that you'll be lost and you'll make others lost with you and backfire of your actions with your parents and their relatives is so damaging and devastating why because you are not representing your own views you say islam says sherhasam says i didn't say this don't put words into my mouth you said once in a video clip listen to the circumstances listen to the question if the question fits yours as a glove yes but you don't have the knowledge to make an analogy and say ah this seems like a similar question so i can cascade this to my situation nope laymen people who are ignorant must not do this you must ask a specific question according to your condition and not go fatwa shopping not go to islam q a which is the best islamic website and read fatwa and say hmm this looks like mine and you try to implement it on your case when it is not implementable and it does not resemble your case but it's your understanding and allah knows best"
