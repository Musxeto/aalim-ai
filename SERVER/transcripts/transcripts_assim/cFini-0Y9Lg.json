  "transcript": "asa from saudi he says what's the difference between praying and congregation in the masjid and praying in my office or in my gym or in the market there's a huge difference among the difference says is that every step you make to the masjid allah would elevate you one level in jannah erase one bad deed grant you one good deed among the benefits is that it is higher in reward when you pray in the masjid than when you pray elsewhere and this is clear in the hadith of the prophet assam that the prayer in the message is better than a man's prayer in his market where he sells and works etc so there's nothing that competes with praying in the masjid at all"
