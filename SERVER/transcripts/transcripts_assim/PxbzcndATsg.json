  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] Al and welcome back I believe we have a caller on the line uh my question is this um people who Fe that they're suffering from black magic and they go to some I'm not talking about magician I'm talking about goodma and some of these ulma say that they are Specialist or expert writing for you uh in order to make you get better uh question is why only certain people can write the what is it they they write is it if it's a Quran or had then any Alam can do it and is there any special knowledge from Quran or and only certain people can do it or any Alam can do it so that's the question okay I'll answer your question inshallah thank you first of all there isn't such a who would write an amulet or a and give it to you and say wrap it around your neck or uh wear it around your wrist and inshallah you will be cured whoever does this he's not aim he's not related to Islam most likely he's a shaman or he's a sorcerer or he is someone out of the culture of the people they think that he is someone of knowledge and he's not now you're a Muslim we Muslims come on we have the Quran and we have the Sunnah when people come and divert from the straight path that we pray to Allah 17 times every raak well actually every day and night in each raak we say guide us to the straight path and you find people instead of going to the straight path they are going 90Â° and some are going 180 degrees on the wrong direction in the Quran and in the Sunnah does it say right and emulate and put in it writings that we don't know of mathematical equations some of them put drawings some of them write Mickey Mouse or Donald Duck and you don't know you just wear it they say oh this is from the so and so do you have any evidence from the Quran andah that this is permissible no don't even look but you can have the option of looking there isn't yeah this guy is his beard is up down to his belly and it's white and he is like 90 years old so I'm a Muslim I'm not a freak I have Quran and Sunnah come on we are in the 21st century we have the Quran and Sunnah we abide by the Quran and Sunnah so those who write Hadith or Ayah and tell you wear this or put it in under your pillow or uh put it under your hat when you do this or that for seven days and don't open it and things would happen to you they are Sorcerers they are dealing with Jin they are not related to to Islam to Quran or to Sunnah at all so your question is quite logical why is it them only who do this and if you tell them okay come to if I do this man I'm going to be driving a Bentley I would be so rich because I would be fooling so many people yes you have to do this and this but you have to you know this amulet costs you ,000 and I would have people in thousands of them and by the way 90% of those who go to them have no black magic have no gin have no evil eye it's all here it's all in the mind I give you a tablet of salt and say take seven of those and you'll be better inshallah and you become better because you're thinking that it is medication it is not so those who claim to be and do these things identify them they're not if you go to someone he says yeah I'll do R for you I'll recite for you I'll get all the Jin out from you and he does strange strange things to you he's not if you take your wife to him or your daughter and he says you have to wait outside I have to be with her alone so that I can make and and I I may start to fly in the room he is an impostor he is a liar if he touches a woman if he puts his hand over her head or on her chest or on her back saying that I'm reciting Al Bak or whatever he is a liar he has nothing to do with Islam with Quran or with a with Sunnah because we have the Sunnah of our Prophet Alat wasam of his comp companions may Allah be pleased with them and none of them did any of this so either he's following a different religion then this is I cannot answer your question because it's a different religion or he's a liar and he's claiming that this is related to Islam and believe me it is not we"
