  "transcript": "Ammar from Tunisia Ya Ammar Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, I'm studying abroad for five years at least. So, am I still considered to be a traveler because this country is not mine? I'd like to know that in order to know if I can make Dua whenever I want to because the Dua of the traveler is answered. Jazak Allahu Khairan Wa Jazakuhum A traveler is a person who carries the label with him. So, he moves from one town to the other. He does not have a house to settle in. So, if I go to attend a conference and I spend two weeks in that country. So, I go from Calgary to Ottawa to Toronto to Edmonton. Three days, four days here, I'm staying in hotels. I'm a traveler. Even if I stay in that country for a whole month, I'm still a traveler. I shorten my prayers. I can't skip Ramadan fasting. I make Dua as a traveler because whenever they call my family, they would say, Oh, the Sheikh is traveling. For you, my friend, the moment you set foot in that country, you started to rent a house or an apartment or moved into a hostel or to the dorm and now you have your own room. You have your own bed. You have your own wardrobe. You put your clothes on in. You've settled down. So, now you're not a traveler anymore. You're a resident. You've settled. So, you have to pray on time. You cannot combine prayers. You cannot skip Ramadan. And when you go on vacation to your own country, it's the same thing. But you can shorten prayer and skip fasting when you're commuting between the country you're studying in and your own hometown because you are a traveler. But in both of the places, you are a settler and you cannot combine or shorten your prayers and Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best. Bearing in mind that du'a is not necessarily related to a traveler. You can make du'a between Adhan and Aqamah every single Fard. And you can make du'a at the last third of the night and when the rooster makes its call, you can make du'a. When it rains, you can make du'a. When you are in distress, you can make du'a. So many places that in the last hour of Friday, you can make du'a. These are blessed times and recommended for us to make du'a and Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
