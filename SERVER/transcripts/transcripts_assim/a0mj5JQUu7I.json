  "title": "Seek laylatul qadr on odd nights only? Listen to people they detected night of decree? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "is something that i have to strive hard will give me so this is the great and that comes from allah azzawajal now people would ask the question which deeds can i do on this night particularly and also yesheck knowing that allah subhanahu wa hid it away from us so does this mean that we have to seek for the night every night within the last 10 nights only on every alternate night which is the odd nights what is the best ad regarding now this is a big topic of dispute among scholars simply because each scholar looked at a particular hadith and clinged to it neglecting the other hadith so some hadiths reiterate that most likely it is the 27th of ramadan however we have authentic hadith that it was cited on the 21st at the time of the prophet and other nights also we have a hadith stating that you should try to detect it on the odd evenings of the last ten so people say oh okay odd evenings meaning the night of the 21st and by the way as muslims we know when we say that the night of the 21st meaning that tomorrow morning is the 21st so the night of the 23rd meaning that today is 22 at night it becomes the night of the 23rd so it's not today and for example today is 23rd in um ramadan in saudi it means that after one hour and a half when sun sets insha allah it will be the night of the 24th because the night precedes the day in islam and this is why on the last day of ramadan the 23rd uh the 30th of ramadan when the sun sets we call this night the night of eid though aid is tomorrow but because the set this is the night of tomorrow the night of eid now having said that those who looked at this hadith said okay if the prophet said detect it on the odd numbers of night this means that it's the 21st third fifth seventh and ninth however there is another hadith where the prophet stated said detected for nine nights remaining seven nights remaining five nights remaining one would say okay how would i know what is remaining if we cannot tell until the day of eight weeks because the month can be 29 and can be 30 depending on citing the crescent at the end of the month tamiya came to the conclusion that this hadith indicates the possibility of laylatul khadr to be in any of the last nights not only as we used to think in the odd numbers because if the month is 29 this means that the odd numbers are 21st 23rd 25th 27th and the 29th but if the month if ramadan is complete and it's 30 days then the odd numbers from the back onwards nine nights remaining this is the 22nd now seven days remaining this is the 24th and so on so this is more logical and this falls under the category that combines all the hadiths together which makes us aware of the whereabouts of nayla so we have to focus on both odd and even nice because we don't know whether the month is 29 or 30 days i hope i did not confuse you guys with this but this is the analogy and the explanation of sheikh al-islam in tamiya and chosen by sheikh even if i mean as well [Music] when seven remain five injured then this my dear brothers and sisters in islam as our honorable sheikh has explained it indicates to us that we should strive towards seeking out laylatul even in the even night would you say as well that besides the noble hadith of rasul allah some may also say that seek layla either how every night because it may be an odd night away but it may be an even night where someone else may be in a part of the the night itself that you desert yourself every every single night after because this is our south africa as an example we are one behind in then yourself saudi arabia and majority of the night for yourself it's an even night for us so can we look at it in that light as well here shift of course indeed you can look at it but to over analyze it is a trick of shaytan now one of the best ways of attaining laylatul is to totally ignore reports saying that oh most likely it was last night most likely it was the 21st so many people dreamt of it saw it the night had uh the sun the following morning was uh was yellow or red etc if you listen to these reports you will not be successful in getting a little cutter if you totally ignore it and do your level best as they say put the pedal to the metal and try your level best to excel every single night as if it's your last night wallahi you will get lailatul qatar's reward whether people like it or not alhamdulillah"
