  "transcript": "she I was reading a book about hypocrites uh uh in Islam and as I was reading it it it it it covers the different Hypocrites and the characteristics um and it seems that I cannot distinguish it's very hard to distinguish the Hypocrites from kind of like Muslims today because they seem to pray and stuff like this they seem to OB erve Islam in the most common way so I wanted to know how can we know do the Hypocrites themselves know that the Hypocrites hypocrisy is divided into two types major and minor the major hypocrisy is related to conviction and belief and uh Scholars Define it as a person who in on the outside looks like a Muslim prays fasts speaks behaves but inside he is hating Islam he's a real enemy of Islam collaborates in hiding and in secrecy to dismantle and Destroy Islam to the best of his ability such hypocrisy was found in Medina at the time of the Prophet Alat and some were known to the prophet Alat wasam yet he did not kill them he did not punish them simply because Allah told him to judge people but what but by what appears to us not by what's inside their hearts because this is only known to Allah so this kind of hypocrisy which is kufur can only be determined by Allah and this is why when abdah Sal died and he was the head of the Hypocrites the prophet Sall wasallam offered funeral prayer and then he was told not to pray upon the hypocrites and Allah that will never forgive them even if he prayed 70 times for them this is Major hypocrisy which renders the people who follow that or have this as a conviction in the lowest levels of Hellfire then we have minor hypocrisy and this is defined by Scholars as practical hypocrisy related to actions as in per the Hadith the signs of a hypocrite are four if he speaks he lies if he promises he breaks his promise Etc if he's entrusted with something he betrays the trust this is related to actions not conviction that particular individual is committing major sins and he's in great danger inevitably he will will be punished for his sins but admitted to Jenna at the end of the day as a Muslim a poor and weak Muslim a bad Muslim but still a Muslim so what you're seeing today is practical hypocrisy which is widely spreading unfortunately due to people's distance from Shar from the Masjid from the Quran and from being close to Scholars to learn from them and Allah Knows Best"
