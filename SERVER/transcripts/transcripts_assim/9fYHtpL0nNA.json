tonight the topic of today's lecture is balance in islam and this lecture or this topic requires a lot of time because it's not an easy topic a lot of our belief a lot of our conviction stands over the topic of balance allah says in the quran thus we have made you a just balanced nation and wasat in arabic means the middle and in this ayah allah says that we have made you among the fairest among the most just among the best of nations of all times so the word wasat means the best allah says if you read the ayat it says the best of them said though we would think that the middle one of them said meaning they are older than him and they are younger than him but the mufassirun says it means that the best of them the wisest of them so allah has made this a just nation which means that we have to be balance in everything we do why because the prophet told us allah his um will be divided into 73 sects and groups 72 are in hell only one would go to jannah may allah make me and you among those so which one are we talking about which is the favorite ummah of all that will end up in jannah and how can we qualify to be among them because what's the point of living on earth all these years striving working eating drinking and then ending up in hell 70 80 years on earth and then everything goes down the drain what's the use of that no we have to strive to be among the saved one that goes to jannah insha allah so which one is the saved one the prophet said in one narration it is the jamaa and another narration whomever is following my footsteps and the footsteps of my companions mallory peace with him what is meant by the jamaa ibn masrud may allah be pleased with him said whatever coincides with the truth this is the jamaa so whenever you follow the truth then you are among the jamaa even if you're alone and that is why allah described prophet ibrahim peace be upon him by saying that he was an um [Music] he was an imam he was a whole nation by himself though he had no followers because he was on the right path he was on the truth islam is a religion of nature and this is the beauty of our religion there's no extremism there is no philosophy or mystics or things that are supernatural we're allowed to get engaged into islam is a religion of simplicity [Music] it is suitable for the scientists for the physician for the engineer as well as the farmer and the shepherd and the bedouin in his desert the religion is one for all of them this is why if you engage in purifying your soul and training your net yourself you will elevate close to the level of the angels and if you indulge in desires and lusts pursue worldly matters you will go and descend to the level of animals so how do we know what's the criteria of figuring out whether we're balanced or imbalanced whether we are on the right track or we are astray how do we know because as i mentioned earlier in the hadith the ummah will be divided into 73 sects and this is very scary 72 of them are in hell how can i guarantee that i am on the right track and everybody else is not well this is very simple if you ask yourself you want to follow sharia or do you want to follow your whims and desires every single muslim on earth including the 72 sects would say we want to follow sharia now this is not the most important question the most important question is are you yes i'm speaking to you are you following sharia at the moment or are you following your whims and desires now this is the one million kuwaiti dinar question how do we know sheikh well shariah is crystal clear whatever quran and the sunnah say is good then this is sharia whatever quran and sin say it is bad then this is your whims and desires and likewise you cannot define who's balanced and who's not except through going to the quran and the sunnah otherwise you may resemble [Music] the hypocrites and there are many hypocrites among us may allah protect us look at the muslim world do you think that they're all practicing no they may have beards they may have short trousers and thoughts they may pray in the masjid but there is an amount of hypocrisy in our hearts that increases and decreases how do we know by going back to the quran in the sunnah unfortunately we always consider ourselves to be the benchmark of everything the whole world revolves around us we define what is right and what is wrong allah tells us about the hypocrites who used to criticize whomever comes to the prophet alaihis salat was salam's gathering and who whomever gives in charity they used to criticize or ridicule them how allah says those who criticize the contributors among the believers concerning their charities and criticize the ones who find nothing to spend except their effort so they ridicule them allah will ridicule them and they will have a painful punishment how is that when a companion comes to the prophet with huge amount of wealth unable to carry it and puts it in front of him and says oh prophet of allah this is charity for allah and for the prophet the hypocrites look and say to another look at this show off he's showing off everybody and trying to convince them that he's doing it for the sake of allah and when some poor person comes with few dates and puts it in front of the prophet islam and says oh prophet of allah i have nothing in this world except these few dates and i'm giving them for allah and his messenger the hypocrites ridicule and say look look at these few what will allah do with these few dates what a stupid man he is so damn if you do damn if you don't if you give a lot you're criticized if you give a little you are ridiculed why because the hypocrites think of themselves as the center of the earth everything revolves around them [Music] and this is a big sign of hypocrisy if we're driving round down the highway and somebody passes us what will we say look at this reckless person he's driving like a maniac he thinks that he owns the road and after a few minutes if we meet someone who's driving in the middle of the road slower than us we honk him and we flash him with the high beam and when we pass him we insult him look at this stupid man he's driving as if he owns the road so what is this the first one was too fast this one is too slow who's the best one i am whatever i do is the balance is the right thing and this is a big problem among the muslims they define things not by what is right and wrong in the quran rather by what they are doing so either it's my way or the highway which is not the right concept balance in islam means that you have to be fair you have to be just and you have to be wise the scholars define al-hikma wisdom is to place everything in its right position in its right place this is wisdom to put the right man in the right place and likewise being balanced is to know how to utilize things because the moment you have this imbalance you get things out of proportion the prophet was said once and the same advice was shared by salman may allah be pleased with him to his brother abu dharda when he visited him once and he forced him to break his fast and to sleep most of the night and then when it is before fajr he woke him up and they prayed their tahajud and witter and then he gave him his advice what did salman say salman says said to abu dharda your lord has rights over you your body has rights over you your family has rights over you in another narration your guest has rights over you so give each one its due right when abu dharr went and said to the prophet allah what what his brother salman said to him the prophet said allah is said the truth what does this mean it means that islam promotes balance because whenever there is imbalance then things would be chaotic balance means that you do not live and strive only for this life as if there is no hereafter which must most of the muslims are doing at the moment most of us live to eat drink mate gain money and enjoy life as if they are not going to die or be resurrected or enter heaven or hell all what we care about is our desires other muslims may go 180 degrees the opposite way by doing what by leaving work not caring about their health only interested in as they claim worshipping allah sitting in a masjid where people give them charity donation and provide for them while they are begging people and both ways are not the way of islam islam is the middle path it combines between this life we're living in and the hereafter and this is what allah said in the quran crystal clear and in black and white but seek with that wealth which allah has bestowed on you the home of the hereafter and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world and do good as allah has been good to you this is the balance we're looking for and the beauty of the religion of islam and no other religion shares this with islam is that islam is suitable for every time and every place while extremism cannot go on for sustainable time it can go on for a little while but then you have to break down the middle path being fair being balanced can go all the way with you till you die and this is what satan our staunch enemy is trying his level best to create that is the imbalance why satan has been with us since the beginning of humanity his first victim was prophet adam peace be upon him until date he's been actively working to deviate us from the straight path and to take us with him to hell fire his resume is this big billions of pages he knows exactly what goes in our minds he knows exactly how to make us fall into his traps if you are keen on religion he drives you to extremism he makes you make the wrong decisions and if you are lagging behind and not that strong he bombards you with desires and lusts until he takes you out of the fold of islam that is why this is extremely important and the hadith of the three companions who came to the prophet and they asked his wives about his lifestyle about his daily routine and when they told them these three companions said this is too little the prophet salallahu salaam has been forgiven all of his sins previous and upcoming he's not like us that's why he's doing little work so each one of them took a vow upon himself one said i will pray all night and never sleep the second one said i will fast all day and never break my fast the third one said i will avoid marrying women and live a life of celibacy when the prophet heard this allah he was outraged he was angry and he came and gave a speech to the people and he said i sleep and pray i fast and i break my fast and i marry women whoever chooses a way other than mine is not from among us this is the balance that the prophet is bringing us back to the issues of balance and and the venues of balance are huge and many when it comes to our feelings there is a balance between hope and fear as we know these are two wings each and every muslim must have hope and fear if there is an imbalance the bird will not be able to fly and it will be tilted and it will fall down this balance is portrayed in allah be pleased with him when he said if someone were to call upon the people all of you are in hell except one i would have wished to be that one this is hope and if someone were to shout all of you people are in paradise except one our the feared that i might be that one this is the balance we're looking for the muslims are balanced in their conviction in their apida so they are in the middle path between the hawari the extremists who give fear to everybody and the leftists the liberals from the murjiya who say that no matter what you do allah will forgive you even you fornicate even if you drink so abandon everything as long as you have iman do everything you want and you're forgiven islam is in the middle path of the of these two balance is to have a broader view of things on one hand we have the blind followers oh i am a shafiri like our brothers in indonesia for example or i'm a hanafi like our brothers in the subcontinent and they are so blind that if you show them a verse in the quran or a hadith from the sunnah they would say oh no no no but imam shafer he says otherwise or imam abu hanifah says otherwise we follow that this is unacceptable in islam and on the other side of the spectrum you have people saying that all schools of thought are trash we don't follow anyone they are men and we are men so we can apply whatever we believe and follow whatever we believe even if we don't have sufficient knowledge in the quran the sunnah and this is also wrong we have to be in the middle respecting schools of thought taking what coincides with the quran and leaving what is not part of it part of being balanced is to be easy the prophet advised his two companions by saying make things easy and do not make them difficult give glad tidings and do not put people off cooperate and do not differ what a beautiful advice some people may be imbalanced in thinking that taking himself by force pleases allah so you get sick people exempted by allah in the quran and in the sunnah not too fast insisting on fasting which leads their to their death or people exempted by the quran and sunnah not to perform insisting on washing which may lead to their death or at least to be harmed the middle path is also in spending money in the cause of allah and this is why allah says and let not your hand be tied like a miser to your neck nor stretch it forth to its utmost reach like a spend thrift so that you become blames worthy and in severe poverty allah tells you don't do neither one be in the middle be balanced and we can go on and on and on giving examples opening your eyes to see that whoa my way is not necessarily the right way because i'm not always following the quran and sunnah sometimes i may follow the whims and desires that go into my mind and this is why it is very important for us to follow the middle path and to be balanced even in our own choices lots of the brothers and sisters youngsters and i see that every day a lot of the time a lot of the imbalance comes from their insistence that i am right and everybody is wrong and they would never retract or back off even when they discover they're wrong may allah have mercy on his sword was a very wise man he used to say my opinion is correct with the possibility of being wrong and my opponent's opinion is wrong with the possibility of being right so he never closes the door by saying my way or the highway he rather leaves a room for retracting and correcting himself so how can we balance how is it possible to be balanced this is not an easy question to answer because it is a way of life you have to learn the quran the sunnah and how the self used to interpret the quran the sunnah and understand it so knowledge is the most important reason and cause for being balanced and just unfair abandoning innovation whether small or large you have to stay away from that among the things that help you to be balanced intellect which allah may bless people with a lot of non-muslims by the way recognize truth because of their intellect and their ability to reason among the reasons for balance in islam is to be patient and not to be haste a lot of harm is reflected upon our dawah when we haste when we are impulsive when we want to do things and act upon these things without studying it without following what pleases allah and what doesn't now this brings us to the conclusion of this short talk is being a balanced nation a choice do we choose it to be able to solve our problems no being balanced is not a choice though it carries the answer to most if not all of our problems it's not a choice because it's an instruction and an order from allah azzawajal it is what allah subhanahu wa chose for us and we have no other alternative to it and it is what allah and his messenger ordered us to fulfill and to do and allah azzawajal knows best i pray to allah subhanahu wa ta'ala that he makes us among those who follow the quran the sunnah with the understanding of the self and to be among those who are just and balanced and following the right path which is the middle path allah you have shared with us and um [Music] may allah bless you and now we are in the question and answer session so uh but before i perhaps i want to give a summer summary for a while so when what i can conclude i could get from surat al fosus 77 which the meaning is rather seek the reward of the hereafter by means of what allah has granted you without forgetting your share of this word and be good to others as allah has been good to you do not seek to spread corruption in the land for allah certainly doesn't like the characters so i think that's the summary for in about our topic and if i may conclude against sheikh so actually islam itself is already balanced yeah so there is no balance in islam but actually balance is an islam right yes islam is the balance but the problem is in each one of us interpretation of islam so i say right because islam says right you say left because you think islam says left and each one of us start to fight claiming that this is islam and this is why 73 sects have been divided each one claims to be on the right path on the right track none of them is except one which one the one who follows the way of the prophet is this is why we claim to be the luckiest of all why because whatever we do we don't justify it because says so mean no we justified by saying allah others fail to do this they say no no no our sheikh says so our leader says so okay what does allah say i don't know okay do you know arabic no do you know the quran no do you know the sunnah no then how can you claim no no no this is islam no this is not islam this is your whims and desires this is why yes islam is the balanced religion but by whose interpretation by the khawarij who kill people and blow up civilians and innocent people thinking that everyone is kafir i can kill them or by the interpretation of a playboy who goes to nightclubs and drinks whiskey and play gambles and eats ribba and says no no everything is kosher and everything is halal [Music] we have several questions from the audiences so brothers and sisters who want to use mass indonesia but if you want to use english immediately simply raise your hand and then we will choose you and you may open your microphone okay so there is muhammad bs tour first so we'll let you to unmute and you may uh you you may turn on your camera so we can see you and you are giving the questions please brother muhammad bias tour please turn on your camera okay you may introduce yourself and where you are from and please give the question directly to check is [Music] on the chat because your voice was very low before okay but perhaps we will move to the next questionnaire sir is that okay [Music] please turn on your microphone yes can you hear me yes yes we can hear you okay i have a question how muslim to use intuition in the right place okay for the question so is that clear the question yes intuition is something that some people are blessed with such as may allah be pleased with him the prophet said allah if there are people who are given inspiration to know that what is right what is wrong then umar is one of them and it's in arabic if there are those who are inspired and they have this intuition however intuition is a level below a sadiq that is why abu bakr sadiq would never acted upon his intuition rather acted upon the evidence the quran and the hadith of the prophet islam so he was better allah be pleased with him also acted upon the quran but sometimes he may get these ideas and he acts upon them and sometimes they become right as in a number of cases now this may not come except to those who are abiding by the quran and the sunnah to the extent that it becomes natural for them to know what is right what is wrong so many times people let's assume me for example though i'm not this is an example i don't say oh shikhasam has intuition he knows allah things and he has a good connection with allah no no it's not like that i have knowledge and quran in the sunnah sometimes i may come to an issue that i don't know what is the answer to it i have a gut feeling and i don't have any close scholars to ask or contact and i have to make a decision immediately what to do i follow my gut feeling and after i do that i call one of the scholars of mine and say this and this and this happened and i chose this opinion was i right and to my surprise the sheikh says you made the right decision that was correct this is intuition which follows the quran the sunnah not someone who comes and says um i think i'm gonna beat this man and punch him why i have a feeling he's not a good muslim wait wait wait wait wait this is not intuition these are whispers from shaytan so intuition like having the sixth sense sense uh i can predict things i can know the future i can all of this is nonsense but intuition that is like a gut feeling that tells you that most likely this decision or choice is the best and i don't know but i hope and pray to allah that he would guide me and it comes true that would be valid intuition and allah knows best okay so that's the code the answer i hope uh bro brother ali ali right um ali so i hope the answer is clear for you right and another question we got from the brother from muhammad p.s tour that previously in the first questioner so his question is could you please give practical advices for muslim men to strike the right balance in their daily life now again this requires another six or seven lectures because it is not a practical thing to give however the balance is that instead of spending 10 hours reading books of tafsir and revising the quran and studying lectures while neglecting your wife and your children and your work and going to the gym you reduce that into five hours a day spend one hour in the gym spend two hours with your wife and children and maybe another hour connecting your kinship calling them visiting them and the rest is to work in order to gain money and to put food on the table this is the best way of striking the right balance because i can be one of the best businessmen on earth it would require a lot of hard work a lot of time but it would cause me to neglect my wife and children to skip prayers not to see any of my kinship and to increase my levels of cholesterol blood pressure diabetes and heart problems i can be one of the best athletes i'm a i used to be not now now i'm too old i used to be a very highly decorated badminton player squash table tennis i have trophies i have medals alhamdulillah to back this up but in order to pursue this i would have needed to spend four to five hours in the gym neglecting prayers neglecting working uh for my company neglecting seeing my children and neglecting a lot of social activities i can be the best father and husband spending 20 hours with my children playing with them uno is spending quality time with my wife taking them out having dinner playing and making them happy but neglecting my health neglecting my work and so on and none of those is the happiest man on earth the happiest man on earth is the one who strikes the light balance he prays five times in the masjid he offers and he finishes the quran once at least a month he offers monday and thursday fasting he connects to his next of kin he works nine to five and excels in his job and he's promoted and he does an excellent work he invests whatever money he can in small investments to diversify his income he spends quality time with his children teaching them quran and how to pray and giving him half an hour of advice every day while playing with them his wife loves him and adores him because he's always there for her defending her caring for her showing her his love and emotions this is the happiest man on earth and allah knows best oh mashola so i think the answer is totally clear and those all are the examples yes for us to do in our daily lives and the next question perhaps i we still have like 10 minutes check before we enter the meeting and i think i will give the opportunity to bro adam fahmil because he has the same name with me at them please um turn on your microphone and give your answer i'll give you a question i hope you have a different question yeah thank you adam for having me and i have a question maybe out of topic as a young person sometimes the spirit of learning religion and doing good is very high care and however at some point this spirit suddenly dropped drastically we call it a procrastination i think and um uh please give your advice so that when this phase of the demoralization occurs we can continue to worship and avoid the disobedience thank you jesus [Music] this is human nature my friend adam we are humans all say that iman fluctuates it goes up and it goes down so one day you wake up in the morning feeling that oh i'm so full of iman i can conquer the whole world and one day you wake up and say i'm so full of bs i don't know if i'm a muslim or i'm not why is this because iman increases with good deeds an iman decreases with bad deeds and the muslims nowadays unfortunately are so into sins that they don't notice every one of us allah looks practicing you don't know what goes in his heart i do a lot of counseling alhamdulillah and i sit with muslims you'll be shocked when you see the amount of practicing muslims who watch pornography how is it possible you will be shocked to see the amount of practicing nihabi women who flirt with men in their workplace with their cousins and this shows you that the muslims have a big problem when they do not walk the talk they have a dual personality dr jekyll and mr hyde so now we are attending a lecture we are increasing our iman we're trying to get closer to allah after this one hour how do you feel oh bhagos bhagos masha'allah very good i am alhamdulillah excellent what is the time oh now it's nine o'clock uh it's nine maybe ten in the evening okay we finished the lecture what should we do um let's watch netflix what oh no no no let's watch uh uh a soap opera maybe um avengers what are you doing you were just close to allah is it come on this is part of the balance what are you crazy you didn't listen to the lecture you have to have one hour for allah one hour for shaytan and this is why we have a problem when i travel to kuala lumpur sometimes you know out of curiosity i turn on the tv and i see some variety shows and i was shocked once to see a woman from indonesia which is the land of my grandfather i'm from indonesia originally so i see a woman from indonesia wearing the full hijab masha'allah and carrying a guitar playing in front of a panel of men and singing and everybody's masha'allah happy what is this he's a hijabi woman singing and dancing in front of nan maha men where is islam no this is the balance sheikh no no this is not the balance this is the 72 sects unfortunately this is not the way of the prophet is this is not the way of the quran and the sunnah so your imbalance and feeling of iman and then going down wanting to learn the religion and to be a scholar in a day and all of a sudden you feel that you're a hypocrite this imbalance comes from sins when you don't have the right companions and most people i talk to who are seemingly practicing when you ask them do you have righteous friends says no who do you have he said well i listen to your lectures sheikh he said okay but my lectures are not enough i have to be with you we have to walk to the masjid together we have to sit half an hour and speak and check on you and see and hear from what you have to say and do so i can evaluate and say okay watch out i can sense that you have bad things growing in your heart but when you listen to my lectures or to someone else's lectures and after two three hours you gain knowledge but then spend another two or three hours watching youtube or instagram or snapchat or spend your time on twitter and social media your iman takes a plunge it dives down so you need to fix it nobody can fix it up for you no one can come and hold your hand and say like children come come i'll drag you with me you have to seek allah's help and you have to draw the line before it's too late and allah knows west oh my wow that's so clear i hope uh braden can get the conclusion from the question from the answer from sheikh and unfortunately we still have three minutes check is that okay for one more question for the last one sure sure no problem no problem okay um i will try to pick a question from zoom chat uh i hope um okay there is um a question here um okay the conclusion of the question is like this um she has tried herself to uh to wear the clothes like sharia unfortunately perhaps the the the way he does the way she does uh is not aligned with the other and sometimes it makes uh the people said like this you only wear like the sharia without uh right and adapt so she might um a bit confused with herself so what should she do okay basically this is one of the oldest traps and tricks of shaytan number one question is there anyone perfect on earth other than the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam yes or no no no nobody is perfect except the prophet this is where shaitaan comes to me and he says oh you're a celebrity everybody knows you you're a huge uh uh superstar people love you you're a chef but they don't know what you do they don't see what you do when you're alone so you're a hypocrite and i say to myself when i hear these voices then what should i do so the voices say you have to be fair and truthful to yourself shave the beard why he says because when you shave the beard nobody would say that you are a practicing muslim and you lie or you cheat so i think to myself hmm he's right and this is where shaytan wins because you don't have knowledge you see lots of us have since and this is totally normal what yes it is totally normal this is human nature if i did not have sins i would not be human the prophet said [Music] every single son of adam is sinful every single one of them the prophet goes on to say [Music] and the best of sinners are those who repent so if we repent to allah azzawajal then we have fulfilled our obligation but to obey shaytan like this sister is saying so yes she's abiding by the full hijab she's a nikabi yet she may be rude she may lie she may be a little bit loud when we sh when she speaks to her parents or so shaytan comes to her and say being loud and being disrespectful to your parents is a major sin and you're wearing the hijab and then and you think that you're a good muslim you're the worst of muslims and she says yeah you're right so what to do so instead of shaytan telling her you have to fear allah you have to be respectful to your parents you have to be polite you have to be kind you have to avoid lying instead he says no add to this taking off your hijab and not wearing islamic attire so instead of having only five sins he says add another one and why do you pray leave prayer so he's dragging your feet little by little until you become a full-fledged soldier of his my advice don't listen to him keep on abiding by the hijab and by the islamic attire because this pleases allah but at the same time try to fix the bad things in your character and to perfect yourself so that allah would love you more and more sure this is so enlightening uh even though i'm not the aha i guess i'm the man but i got the point i mean like yeah i hope you don't wear the hijab though yeah of course no no no no no i mean like i get the point so we instead of uh listening to the shaytan we should change the to be the better one yes instead of yeah correct how much yolo and um unfortunately uh there are still many questions check and i'm sure
