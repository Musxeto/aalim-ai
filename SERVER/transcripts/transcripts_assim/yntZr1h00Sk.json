  "transcript": "camel says we know that 40 days of prayers would be void if a person drinks alcohol what about a person who takes drugs does the same ruling apply to him and should he not pray for 40 days because they won't be accepted anyways the answer is yes consuming intoxicants whether alcohol alcoholic drinks or drugs cocaine marijuana heroin meth whatever crack all of these fall under the same category of intoxicants and whoever consumes them his prayers of 40 days won't be accepted but if he does not pray for 40 days he would become a kafir he would leave the fold of islam for abandoning prayer you won't be rewarded but you're compelled to pray it on time"
