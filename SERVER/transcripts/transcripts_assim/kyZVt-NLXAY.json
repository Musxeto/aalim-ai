  "title": "Was the book Al Kabaer written by Imam Al Dhahabi & does it contain every major sin? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign first of all the scholars argued about the book being authentically written by zahabi as we know Imam is one of the great Scholars of Islam and he was not a scholar like any other scholar but he was specifically a great scholar in Al Hadith and his books on a Regal on studying the chain of narrators of men and criticizing them and what he had done are well known to students of knowledge so when you look in the book and you find many weak narrations you would think to yourself that it's not possible that such a great Imam as in the caliber of a dehabi would write such a book and include such weak narrations secondly there is limiting and restricting the number of khabar to such mentioned in the book is also debatable the cousin of the Prophet Allah be pleased with him and with his father was asked are the major sins seven because there's a Hadith where the Prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam said avoid the seven sins that would throw you in Hell Fire something that is catastrophic major so he was asked are they seven in number and he said they are closer to 70 rather than seven so you cannot limit them in a specific number or in a specific as mentioned in the Hadi in in the book you've just mentioned of Imam zahabi because they are there are many other than what was mentioned and some of what was mentioned might not also be authentic and Allah Knows Best"
