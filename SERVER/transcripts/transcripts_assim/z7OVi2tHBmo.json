  "title": "Zakat on Gold that is Used (for Women) & Husband Paying the Zakat of His Wife",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Kenya. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wabarakatu So my first question is I got married last year \nand my wife has gold so some of the gold she's   wearing and some of the gold she just puts in \nthe cupboard for maybe weddings, during weddings. So the question is when one year has passed \nsince we got married since she doesn't have   a job or anything so does she give this gold \nin terms of zakah and how will she give it? Okay first of all it's an issue of dispute whether \ngold that is used must be Zakatable or not. And the most authentic opinion, and this is \nthe choice of Sheikh Ibn Baz and Ibn Uthaymeen   and all of our scholars, is that \ngold whether used or stored,   whether it's part of jewellery or in gold bars \nor whatever, it's all Zakatable, gold and silver. and the evidences from the \nQuran and Sunnah backs it up. Secondly, who's obliged to pay for the Zakat? The answer is the owner of the gold.   You as a husband are not obliged to \npay for it because it's not yours. But if you do it out of goodwill   and being charitable and kind to your wife, may \nAllah reward you, this is a rewardable charity. So if your wife does not have \nthe money, she doesn't work,   if she has gold that had reached the Nisab \nwhich is 85 grams of 24 karat gold or more. This means that she's rich and she's obliged \nto sell some of that gold to give Zakat on it. So even if she doesn't have cash she has \ngold. Sometimes I get weird questions,   a woman says I have gold that is almost half a \nkilo, half a kilo? she's almost a millionaire   and she says I don't have cash so can I \naccept Zakat? Of course not, you are rich,   you have a lot of money in this gold, you have to \nsell some of it and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
