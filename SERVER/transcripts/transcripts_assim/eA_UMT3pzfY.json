  "transcript": "Hamza from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, unfortunately there are some people who consider staying away from sins as being extreme in Islam. For example, someone is asking us to help them do a sin, and when we tell them that Allah forbade it, they start calling us extreme. How do we approach such people, especially if it's our family members, and we need to be kind towards them. Please advise. BarakAllah Wafikum Sheikh. Wafikum BarakAllah. Akhi, this is part of the territory. It comes with the territory, in the sense that the more you become practicing and following the sunnah and following the religion, the more enmity, hatred, and hostility you will be facing from others. And the biggest example is the Prophets of Allah and the Messengers of Allah. Have you heard of a Prophet or a Messenger who had everything going on, no trials, no fitnah, no enemies? No. This is the sunnah of Allah in this life, and this is your test. So all what you can do is to be tolerant, to be patient, to be diplomatic, and to keep your cool. You cannot face hostility and abuse, especially from loved ones and relatives, with similar hostility and abuse. And I always say this, and people are not very pleased with what I say, but this is the universal truth. If a dog barks at you, would you fall on your hands and knees and bark back? Of course not. He's a dog and I'm a human being. So you have to ignore, smile, do not defend yourself, do not argue with people when they accuse you of being an extremist after you've shown them the evidences in the Qur'an and the sunnah, yet they are not willing to accept it. What can I do? If someone in the middle of the day, you say this is the sun, he says no, it can't be the moon. What do I do? Do I prove it to him? Do I show him charts and NASA latest articles? I just said, yeah, maybe, and move on. Life is too short to waste and spend with such people who are defiant, who are resisting submitting their will to Qur'an and sunnah. I'm not telling you obey Sheikh so-and-so or follow scholars so-and-so. I'm telling you, Allah says, and the prophet says, if you have a problem with that, you have a problem with your Islam. I can't help you. You're an adult. So I'm not going to waste my time any longer with such individuals."
