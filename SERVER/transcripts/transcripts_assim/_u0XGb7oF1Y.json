  "title": "Was funeral prayer not prayed for the Prophets, Funeral Prayer of the Prophet ﷺ‎ - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "next question is that is it true that funeral prayer was not prayed for the prophets because they were innocent the first question is i don't know about the previous prophets of allah azzawajal because unless we have evidence from the quran or from the authentic sunnah we cannot speak out of thin air and say yeah yeah yeah musa peace be upon him his funeral was attended by ten thousand jew how do you know sheikh yeah i know i know i know you guys don't know i'm i graduated from prestigious university what do you have no this is not acceptable we have to have evidence from the quran from the sunnah what we know of is our prophet muhammad and we know that funeral prayer was prayed by almost all the companions but they prayed in twos and threes because his house was very small he was buried in his house so they used to come two or three people pray funeral prayer and leave and the other uh patch comes afterwards and this went on for about nearly two days then he was buried alexa so the concept of not to pray for prayer because their pure is totally baseless and has no foundation when we offer uh a salutation upon the prophet sam to raise his status and uh to do what allah has told us to do he is pure why should we offer salutation upon him so this is a form of ribada and likewise praying feudal prayer at the time was also a form of abandon that was done and it is the consensus of all scholars of islam and it is sufficient that all the companions did it and no one had disagreed with it and allah"
