  "transcript": "[Applause] oh [Applause] alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters welcome to lessons in F and today inshallah we're still talking in the chapter of nification of evolution of uh Hadith that we have now is uh 64 and brother Mustafa will read it for us please narrated Ali ABB may Allah be pleased with him I was one whose Medi flowed dreadly and asked mikad to ask the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam about it he said one should perform Abol in this case okay now what isi Medi is preal discharge it's a fluid that comes from the private part after uh intimacy sexual intimacy if someone sees something watches something and makes his sexual desire arouse then he would probably have this form of discharge and Scholars say discharges are divided into four categories and as we stated earlier that all discharges are nullification nullificator of woodo anything that is discharge from the private part nullificator is urine and there is what we call Medi urine is known to all so there's no need to describe it Medi is a sticky thin white fluid that usually comes out after intimacy or after watching something that makes the sexual desire uh uh uh active thirdly we have something that is called wedy w a d i wedy and wedy is a thin yellowish fluid that usually is discharged in cold areas when it's freezing or when someone carries something that is a little bit heavy it comes out and again this is one of the things that nullifies your woodoo and finally the fourth thing is Sean Al manyi which is the origin of mankind and by discharging it uh a person is in the state of sexual impurity he it's not enough it does not only nullify your W no it it requires that you perform a total bath whenever it is discharged whether it's dischar charged while sleeping or through uh intercourse this Hadith is narrated by Ali Talib the cousin of the Prophet Alat and at the same time the son-in-law of the Prophet alhat wasam his wife was Fatima B Muhammad may Allah be pleased with her and if you notice that Ali did not ask the mess messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam directly he asked Al to ask the prophet as if it's from the himself and why was that because he was embarrassed he was shy to ask the prophet alham and by the way a person who has this Mei discharge is considered to be physically strong because it's a sign of fertility sign of uh productivity so uh uh he was and and and Ali was of course one of the strongest men around at the time when he died he had four wives and nine Maids nine slaves uh Ali may Allah be pleased with him was embarrassed to ask the prophet Alat because he's the father of his wife had he been someone else it would have been easier for him to ask as he said as he asked alad may Allah be pleasing with him to convey his uh a question but not to report it through him and this tells us how we should treat our in-laws if a person has a wife he should be very discreet with her parents with her uh uh brothers and sisters he should not disclose these intimate and private things he should not also uh uh uh be harsh on her in front of them he should not complain all the time in front of them and we always face lots of problems similar to this we always get complaints from sisters complaining that their husbands abuse them and mistreat them in front of their parents and this gets the parents depressed if you were a parent and you saw that your son-in-law treating your daughter in a bad way you wouldn't feel good about it but your hands are tied you can't do anything else because you don't want to destroy your daughter's marriage so this is a lesson that we should all learn when we treat and deal with our wives we have our differences yes but whenever their parents whenever her parents are present whenever her brothers are present I should always respect her and try to show how much I love her though this may not be the case that I love her that much but I have to pretend so that I would make them feel happy about it remember that the father gave you the most precious thing in his life his daughter he gave her to you in marriage so so as a token of Goodwill you should not return this gift by abusing or mistreating his daughter you should honor her coming back again we come to the description of Ali may Allah be pleased with him he's asking to ask the prophet Alat what is the case should I perform total bath the answer was no all what you to do is perform Evolution the dispute among Scholars some of the scholars say that the prophet did not order him to wash his private parts he did not W order him to uh wash his uh underwear but in other versions the order was there to wash his private parts and that is why they've differed in opinion some say you don't have to wash all what you have to do is perform Evolution and whatever was discharged it's pure the authentic verdict is in accordance to the Hadith that the prophet says you have to wash your pro private parts and this is the natural and logical thing that this is a discharge and we've stated that disch any discharge is NIS and uh uh does nullify your wood with the exception of many and we will come to explain this inshallah many is not NIS but we will come to explain this in following Hadith inallah but all that comes out nullifies your woodo nullifies your Evolution you have to perform wo again and uh if this Medi is in contact with any of your underwear of your body you have to also wash this so that you will be able to pray again uh if we don't have any questions I think we should move on to the following Hadith narrated Isa the prophet Sall alai wasallam kissed one of his wives and went to pray without performing fru now this Hadith is disputed upon some of the scholars say that it is not uh authentic but it is inshallah authentic as authenticated by uh IM may Allah have mercy on his soul the the wife of the Prophet tells us that the prophet Alat may have kissed one of his wives and went to prayer without performing Abu okay what's the reason behind bringing this Hadith it's simple the shaf school states that if you touch a woman whether a relative a Maham or you are automatically have nullified your W and the reason behind this is their understanding for a verse of a verse in the Quran which says and can mean to touch and also can mean to have intercourse so IM shaf may Allah have mercy on his soul may Allah be pleased with him one of the leaders the imams of the four schools of thought in Islam and uh uh can we have uh Muhammad Akbar can you please tell me what are the four schools of thought in Islam do you know I didn't understand question uh IM Shafi well can you bring them by time sequence oh firstly uh Abu hanifah IM Malik Malik muham and finally and finally ahed Ahmed Muhammad hamal may Allah have mercy on them all they are all the the uh four schools the major four schools of thought in Islam Abu IM sha said that anytime you touch a female then you're W is nullified whether accidental or intentional and this Hadith states that it does not nullify your W and the scholars have different opinions some of them say well it depends if you touch a female with desire then it nullifies your Woodle if you touch her without a desire then it's okay and the authentic uh uh uh verdict is that if you touch a female with desire and she's a m to you a wife then this is okay and does not lfy you w if you touch a stranger a foreigner to you an UNM woman with desire your woodo is still intact but you have committed a major sin this is a sin shaking hands touching this is a sin because she's not related to you and if you touch a stranger or a un stranger without any uh uh uh sexual intention then your woodo is still intact and when does woodo becomes nullified if something comes out if a discharge comes out then this nullifies your wood whether it's with touching with a desire or without a desire whether you're touching a relative to you a Maham or anah to you this is the most authentic uh uh opinion of all Scholars and the Hadith backs it up you don't kiss your wife without a desire so the prophet kissed his wives and prayed without performing Abol we have a short break so stay tuned and we will be right back [Music] inshallah [Music] [Music] Salam alaykum and welcome back the following Hadith brother F inah will read it for us narrated Abu may Allah be pleased with him Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said if one of you feels disturbance in his stomach and doubts whether he has release some air or not then he should not leave the musk unless he hears its sounds or smells its order Abu pleased with him was one of the companions of the Prophet does anybody know what he his real name Hamza ABD s he's from the southern part of the Arabian Peninsula and he was one of the companions that reverted to Islam late so the time that he accompanied the prophet Alam was approximately three and a half years to four years he reverted to Islam on the day of which was on the seventh year of Hijra yet he is the largest narrator of Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam and he explains that you the companions used to go to the markets and sell and buy to you know feed yourself and your families I on the other hand used to accompany the prophet Alat providing that I find something to eat and drink and that is it I used to be with the prophet Alam as long as I have something to eat and drink I'm not looking to buy or sell or do any of these things because I wanted to gain knowledge and that is why he is the most of all companions that narrated hadiths of the Prophet Alat wasam now in this Hadith the prophet states to us indirectly that passing gas if you pass wind then your wo is nullified now you are either certain or you are in doubt if a person is certain that he had has passed wind then he should perform wood this is logical in some cases Satan comes and Whispers in one's ears that he has done something well where you didn't do actually anything at all so what's the verdict in that it's very simple the prophet tells you if you have doubt you're not certain whether you're praying or outside of prayer if you have doubt that something has come out do not consider it as a fact because this doubts these doubts Satan Builds on them and starts to magnify them until a person is obsessed and this is the case with a lot of Muslims they have obsessions regarding the impurities and so you find someone going into uh uh the toilet to answer the call of Nature and would probably stay there for half an hour what are you doing said well I'm trying to purify myself purify yourself you if you making a surgical uh a surgery then you'd have finished by now so and you find people urinating and still they think that no I'm still there is something left maybe I may there drop or two so the you you hear them coughing and maybe some of them jumping in the toilet and doing exercise what are you doing said well I'm trying to purify myself this is wrong this is not natural this is satanic it's from Satan he's coming he's Whispering he is confusing you he wants you to be obsessed and once you're obsessed with this idea then your whole whole life is ruined because you start to doubt everything you do ah this is a njasa no it's not let me smell it let me taste it let me take it to the lab can you analyze this all of this is UN Islamic Islam is the religion of easiness there's no complication in it we make life difficult we complicate things it shouldn't be the way thatan Satan wants us to believe in so we have a rule in Islam and this rule applies to everything single thing in our lives the rule is certainty is not changed with doubt if you're certain of something then this certainty is not moved or removed by doubt let me give you an example I perform Evolution I come to this classroom I know that I have performed Evolution before I went out of my house after 3 or 4 hours is prayer time I think okay did I go to the toilet or not not did I pass wind or not what is certain the the thing that I'm certain of that I have performed W I have performed ablution before I left my house what's the doubt the doubt did I nullify this wo or not so this doubt has to be Cast Away it has to be thrown out and only the things that are certain remain and what is certain that I have performed Evolution so I pray without renewing my Evolution let's reverse it I went out of the toilet after urinating I've answered the call of nature I urinated I came out an hour later it's prayer time I'm certain that I've urinated but did I perform M or didn't I this is doubt I'm not certain the thing that I'm certain of that I've nullified my my woodo by urinating now the doubt is did I perform woodo or not I have to throw out the doubt which remains to be that I have nullified my woodo I have to perform woodo again so I think this is understood anybody has any question yes I yes uh let's begin with fatty please what if someone is very very doubtful to the extent that he just he's so doubtful and he's nervous that he nullifies his woodo on purpose so that he can go perform Evolution again now this is a very serious issue it's really serious don't think of it of well this guy's crazy what he's saying he does this on purpose no this is true a lot of Muslims have these obsessions and the funny thing is a group of men came to I Abbas Allah be pleased with him the cousin of the Prophet one of the scholars of Islam and they said IB Abbas we have a problem say well come on shoot they say that we met with the Jews and Christians and they're mocking us they're laughing at us they say you Muslims have obsessions and you whisper in your prayer you have you know Wass while you're praying you're not having 100% cont uh uh contemplation and concentration in prayer while we the Jews and Christians don't have any problem when we pray we are 100% focused so IB Abbas said it's true to their surprise he said that's true so when they wanted to know why he said what would Satan do with a heart that is empty now if there's a burglar and there's a house full of jewelry and full of nice things to steal and Rob from and there's a poor man's house that has nothing at all probably if he goes in if he breaks in he's going to put some donation for the guy try to buy something I feel sorry for you what which house would the burglar choose to steal the wealthy house the rich house and this is the same case with Satan now Satan wants to whisper to a Believer which one he would go to he would go to the Muslim because he knows that his heart is filled with faith and IM and belief okay let's change this let's make him obsessed with Purity let's make him obsessed with jealousy so you get you get some guys obsessed with jealousy they're jealous from uh they're jealous for their wives so when they leave home they put a a recorder or they tap the phone or they uh uh hire a private eye to monitor his wife's movements and this is all un Islamic life is not that difficult don't make it that difficult so this this obsession is the result of Shan if you follow it it will destroy your life because you're going to spend all of your life trying to think am I pure am I not pure and this would cause you to be mentally and physically ill chronically that is especially in the in the sense of wo I remember once I performed prayer in an Arab country and I joined I went for ation and there there was this guy next to me rubbing his hands like as if it's you know he has some sort of chemicals on it and he's clean and I finished wo and I waited watching this guy and this guy is doing it so strongly it wasn't natural so I joined the congregation and I saw the man coming next to me joining the congregation and in the middle of the first ra he said and went again to perform W and after two raas he came in and and he performed Salah and he broke it and it took him an hour to an hour and a half because there was a lecture afterwards and the guy ke kept on going to the bathroom and coming and Performing woodo and you can tell by looking at the man that he is obsessed it is us who bring this to to ourselves have faith in Allah have faith in what you're doing you are a sane person don't convince yourself that I'm insane because if you do you will be so what do I do with the feeling that I'm dripping don't you're not dripping because it's a it's a dis it's an illness if you have a continuous urination dripping this is an illness that uh uh a doctor a physician could diagnose and give you a cure but if you don't then it's all in your mind certain things are not removed by doubt so if you don't hear a noise when you're praying that you've passed wind and if you hear the noise everybody else would hear it but you'll be in trouble and if you don't find the odor you don't don't find uh the bad smell then this means that there's nothing coming out now again I'm talking about the doubt but if a person does Pass Wind and he's certain of this and the amount that came out was so negligible that there's no odor and there's no smell should I fool myself and say I didn't find any odor and I didn't hear any noise no if you're certain then you're certain but if we're talking about the obsession we're talking about the doubt that comes on and on I think uh this wraps it up and uh this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time oh [Laughter] a"
