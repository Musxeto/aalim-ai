  "title": "I have an incurable disease, can I donate my body to science so they can find a cure? AssimAlHakeem",
  "transcript": "um i have a question about uh so my question basically is uh i have a i have a rare autoimmune disease that occurs in only one man in every 1 000 men where my immune system attacks a specific organ in my body uh doctors have told me that there's no cure and that i have to be on medication for the rest of my life otherwise i could go into a coma and die i'm content with my illness and honored allah is testing me in this manner my question is after i die is it permissible for me to donate this organ to doctors and researchers so that they can hopefully find a cure would have with the help of allah so that someone in the future who has a similar illness as me can benefit from it as for uh question that he has a a rare immune deficiency illness that has no cure and he is content with that may allah reward reward you immensely for that but as for your part that there is no cure for it this is a lie we believe that allah did not create an illness except he created a cure for it let it be those who know it or those who don't know it so everything even cancer even diabetes everything on this uh planet has a cure except death this is the only thing that has no cure so i would highly recommend that you try a traditional medication the black seed hindi honey etc and there is nothing at all wrong in going the extra mile and trying to drink a mug of camel's milk mixed with a cap of a bottle of camel's urine and this is a prophetic hadith backed up by numerous scientific researches done here in saudi arabia in australia and also in america to my knowledge and i have a personal friend of mine who used to teach chemistry when i was a teacher back 30 40 years ago and he had intestine cancer and he got a portion of it uh cut off through a surgery and the doctors say it's hopeless you're gonna die in two to three months we can't do anything it's spreading like hey uh fire so he saw some of these researches and started applying these uh medication through camel milk and urine and within four to five months it disappeared from his body and that was about eight nine years ago and the man is fit and healthy and he is into research and giving people whatever information he has on this so you give it a try and insha allah i'll bill you after inshallah you cured as for his question uh is it permissible for me to write in my will that i want to donate my organs so that scientists would study it and maybe find out a cure this is an issue of dispute some scholars say that this is permissible i'm inclined to say that this is totally prohibited the body is not mine or yours it's allah and it is disgraceful for muslims to abuse or to autopsy or to open or even break the bone of a deceased muslim it's totally haram in islam so i believe that this is not permissible if they were to find cure through other means or doing such experiments on non-muslims bodies they can be my guest but muslims no they cannot um uh work on their bodies after their death because their bodies are sacred must be taken care of must be buried honorably"
