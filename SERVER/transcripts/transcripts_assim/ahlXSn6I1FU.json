  "title": "Women coloring their nails with Henna | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abdul Basit says is the hadith authentic a woman gestured from behind the screen with a letter to the prophet alayhi salaatu some in her hand the Prophet would through his hand and said I do not know whether it is the hand of a man or a woman she said there is Aisha may Allah be pleased with her it is a woman he said if you were a woman you would have changed your nails meaning with henna clarify please this hadith is disputed upon whether it is authentic or not and Cheryl Barry may Allah have mercy on his soul if I recall correctly graded it as Hassan in one spot and he graded it as weak in the Eifel jammer and if you go and look at other scholars of hadith you would find that the vast majority of them graded it as not authentic it's very weak some of them said that it does not befit the way of the Prophet as of Salaam speaking to a woman and it goes against the teachings of Islam because we know that Islam prohibits a woman from adorning herself in front of nan Muharram so the Prophet here if the hadith is authentic is calling women to wear henna to adorn their hands and this definitely goes against the Sharia and destructions of the Sharia therefore this hadith is not authentic analogical knows best"
