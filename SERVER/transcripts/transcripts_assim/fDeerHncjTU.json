  "transcript": "and muslim that anas of malik narrated may allah be pleased with him that three of the companions of the prophet allah is to his homes to his houses and they asked their mothers the mother of the believers the wives of the prophet sallallahu salaam about the forms of worship that the prophet are islam used to offer when he was at home so when the wives of the prophet alaihis told them about his routine they thought it was not much and they said to one another this is the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi allah has forgiven his previous and coming sins so no matter what he does allah has forgiven everything for him but we are not like him so one of them said i shall fast and never break my fast meaning each and every day he would fast and he would not skip a single day the second one said i will pray all night long and i shall never sleep at night the third one said i shall remain celibate and i will never marry women when this reached the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he summoned them and he asked them are you the ones who said so and so when they said that they were the one when they conceded the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said to them i fast and i break my fast i sleep or rather i pray at night and i sleep and i marry women and i am most fearful of allah and most knowledgeable of him than you whoever turns away from my sun is not of me this beautiful hadith illustrates to us the mercy of the prophet and it sets the foundation of our religion so that we can learn how to practice islam as it was revealed to the prophet the mercy of or the mercy for mankind so the first thing that we benefit from this hadith is how the companions were so eager and how they were so keen on getting closer to allah they did not have enough they were not satisfied by what the prophet used to teach them in the masjid rather they wanted to do their homework they wanted to investigate more so that they would have an edge over the others and get closer to allah azzawajal quicker and faster this happened a lot when the immigrants left their wealth and families from makkah to medina and the people of medina the ansar were in their homes and farms and wealths so these muhajireen came to the prophet and complained that they pray like their brethrens they fast like them but the ansar have money to give for charity so what to do so the prophet told them how to say allah 33 times alhamdulillah 33 times allahu akbar 33 times and to complete the 100 and this would equal what your brethrens from the ansar spent in charity so they were keen on finding a way to reach allah azzawajal and to get closer to him also we find that in this hadith when the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam heard their statement he did not judge them he did not give a verdict against them rather he summoned them he called them to come and he addressed them what he with what he had heard so that they would have the ability and the chance to defend themselves and this is a great lesson to us when we hear something from any form of resource when we hear we hear a piece of information we should not act upon it until we verify it this is why allah says in chapter 49 verse 6 if i'm not mistaken yeah less religion someone who is not a true believer a sinful person whenever he brings you a piece of information make sure that it is correct before you act upon it so it is not permissible to just act upon hearsay act upon rumors gossips this is not permissible allah would hold you accountable for that the prophet is illustrating this to us through his actions did you say that once they acknowledged then the prophet alison gives his advice and we can see that these men only wanted goodness no one doubts this they were not showing off they were not doing what they're doing for the sake of people their intention was good however it is extremely important in islam that your intention coincides with the action that is approved by the quran to have a good intention while your action is wrong this is rejected because there are two conditions for any act for any deed to be accepted by allah the first condition is sincerity so who are you doing this for and why he said i'm doing it for the sake of allah okay then sincerity is there so when you spend money in the cause of allah who are you spending it for i'm spending it for the face of allah i want allah's pleasure on me okay then this is the first condition the second condition which is important which allah would not accept your deeds without it is that your deeds should be coinciding with the sunnah meaning that if you innovate something though your intention is good but by innovating allah would reject the whole thing regardless of your sincerity or not and the evidence is so many verses in the quran where allah says those who believe this is sincerity and do righteous deeds and this is coinciding with the sunnah of the prophet allah also says in the last verse authentic deed and he should not associate others with allah so sincerity and following the sunnah of the prophet alaihis if we can manage to apply this in our lives we can clearly see what's right from what's wrong so if someone does an action that is not part of the sunnah and he says my intention is good said sorry no can do this is unacceptable if someone says i love dawah and i'd love to do it for the sake of allah say good job keep up the good work but if he goes and intermingles with women nan mahram and maybe he dates one of them for dinner or takes her to a pub or whatever and his intention is pure to call her to allah definitely allah would not accept this from him because he is disobeying the instructions and the commands of allah and he is not following the sunnah of the prophet therefore these three men had good intention but their deeds were totally inappropriate one said i shall fast and never break my fasting i never skip a day and this is haram it was the prophet who said allah he who fasts the whole year will not fast meaning allah will not accept his fasting it's a religion of balance the other one says i will not sleep at night i will keep on praying from isha until fajr but this is not human you need to rest your wife has rights over you yet they're doing this out of their good intention the third one said i'd like to live the life of a monk and i'd like to live a life of celibacy no marriage and this was not an isolated incident a great number of companions requested the permission from the prophet allah to be castrated and the prophet did not allow them to do so among them is one of the great companions of the prophet saw adi and other companions said if the prophet hassam were to have permitted him to do so we would have all done it not because they do not love women this is something natural and they are the best of men and they are the fullest of manhood but they felt that this desire would distract them from worshipping allah azza so what was the solution the prophet first of all highlighted that he is the most among them who fears allah azzawajal so no one fears allah more than the prophet and no one is more knowledgeable than him however your allegation that you have presented of your good intention is not correct because i who fears allah most fast and skip fasting i pray and i sleep at night and i marry women and this shows you the balance in our religion the prophet salallahu salaam was approached once by amr may allah be pleased with him hamr had a son one of the narrators of the hadith his name was abdullah ibn amras may allah be pleased with them both and he got his son married to a woman from quraish from a respected family few weeks later he went and visited his daughter-in-law so he asked her how is abdullah with you if you have any complaints and a woman being masha'allah a righteous and from a good descent she said abdullah is an excellent person he fasts all day long and he prays all night long masha'allah is righteous understood the message the woman did not want to complain about her husband but she portrayed his relationship with her if he fasts all day long and prays all night long he has no time to have intimacy with his wife and he's a newlywed so um went immediately to the prophet alaihissalatusam to complain the prophet asked abdullah to come and ask him a number of questions how many days does it take you to finish the quran in prayer there is he said i finish the quran once a night so he completes reading the whole quran once every night so the prophet told him don't do that complete the quran in one month and then in 20 days in 10 days in one week then he asked him how do you fast and he said i fast every single day the prophet told him don't do that fast three days over every month and he insisted on increasing him so he told him fast this much fast it's much until he told him fast one day and skip one day this is the fasting of dawud peace be upon him and there's nothing better than this at the end the prophet told him a statement and this statement is exactly the same statement that salman al-pharisi advised his brother abu dharda when he met him with a similar situation what was this advice this is the concept of balance in our religion the balance that most muslims seem to have neglected or turned away from the prophet said al-azham and your guest the social life has a right over you and your body your health has rights over you so give each one its do right this is the concept of balance that the muslims lack you can be a good businessman and earn a lot and make a fortune but if you do not strike the right balance you will lose your family ties you will not see your uncle's aunts mother and father maybe you will not be able to see your wife and children because you're always busy in meetings and traveling i'm making money for you you will skip lots of prayers and miss them because i have a meeting i i'm unable to pray friday we we're traveling we're doing this we're doing that no legitimate excuses and probably with all the money you have you are diabetic hypertension patient you have so many illnesses and diseases because you've neglected taking care of your body and most likely all of these develop at the same time you could be an excellent preacher or a student of knowledge or a scholar but again if you fail to strike the balance you will have the same problem and among them you would not have money because usually being a scholar or a student of knowledge this doesn't pay most of them do it for the sake of allah and usually they don't have time to assume high positions in companies and to work and at the same time have the time to give dawa and to pursue knowledge you could be an excellent sportsman fit like a bull but again your family ties your religious commitment and your income would not be that good you could be an excellent family man loved by his wife and children spends 24 7 with them takes them out pays everything he has so that he makes them happy but again there is this imbalance the only way to get this balance correct is by striking the right balance in islam and this is how we look at the whole world you have to work out to be strong allah says prepare yourself whatever you can from power from uh horse riding from archery whatever you can do to prepare yourself for jihad without a healthy body without the stamina you won't be able to do this you have to balance your religious commitment no matter what comes in the world you always have priorities my five daily prayers my night prayer my witter my days that i fast every month my portion of the quran that i should finish every day so these things you don't compromise you always maintain and observe your social life your children have rights over you your wife your next of kin your kinship you have to connect to them so that allah would not curse you and be angry with you and also your business your wealth these things prevent you from stretching your hand asking for charity from people so you have to take care of your finance of your business of your job it's a collective thing and this is what the prophet is trying to teach us through his companions now after the prophet had said this to his companions he made a statement and this statement any muslim whether he is a shia a sufi a salafi he is from the extremists the fanatics the isis from uh whatever if he is a true muslim he should follow this statement the minute he says yes it's a true statement but the minute he says but you know that he is deviant he is not part of allah and he is definitely not part of the saved sect among the 73 which the prophet said alai salatu my ummah will divide into 73 cults or sects all of them are in hell the prophet is telling us that his ummah will be in hell except one and the prophet explains those who follow what i am doing and my companions so those who are on the same footsteps they are the saved sect so what did the prophet say a statement that even the children on the streets memorize by heart whoever turns away from my sunnah is not of me and this is a serious warning you have to judge your actions are they in accordance to the sunnah of the prophet how would i know sheikh ah you can know by learning but if you are ignorant if you are an imbecile and you refuse to read the quran and learn the sunnah the whole of the sunna and you insist on cherry picking what you like and you follow that and implement it even if there are ample evidences that what you're doing is wrong in this case then you are not of the prophet whoever turns away from my sunna is not of me now how can we apply this well simple we find journalists writing essays writing articles writing lots of things against islam condemning hijab condemning niqab condemning extremism and this is an a a very serious issue everyone nowadays is calling for moderation even kafir are calling muslims for moderation this is weird so you get calls from obama you get calls from holland you get calls from cameron you get calls from putin saying we have to be moderate we have to be moderate as muslims you teaching us our religion well excuse me you're in the wrong place but they are right we have to be moderate however the moderation is measured only by the sunnah of the prophet saw not but what your intelligence tells you not by the cia or the kgb or the mi5 or whatever moderation is done through the scholars of islam who interpret to us the quran and the sunnah of course not to any tom dicker harry who is hiding in a cave in torabora or underneath a tunnel in iraq or in syria explaining things to the muslims as if he is great scholar of islam and he is a perfect imbecile no so when we come to someone misbehaving we have to cross examine what he's doing by the sunnah for example someone goes into a shrine a temple a church a synagogue a masjid a shopping mall and blow and blows himself up killing others let's see is this part of the sunnah whoever turns away from mason is not of me now did the prophet ever arizona approve of such an action of killing children of killing women of killing non-combatant if yes prove that to me if no and i know you will say no but then you are deviant you're not of the prophet alaihis likewise these liberals these secularists they come and say we have to be moderate we have to change islam we have to do this in accordance to what religion you want us to be moderate this is islam said yes but chopping off the hand of someone who steals or killing someone who kills others or flogging someone who slaunders or consumes intoxicants this is barbaric said masha allah who decides what's barbaric and what is not is it the united nation so what do you think of what had happened in nagasaki and hiroshima or in world war one world war ii or what happened in afghanistan and iraq this is um okay or you're afraid of classifying it as barbarism and barbaric acts so the topic is quite long maybe we will uh explain it a little bit more later on inshaallah but it is extreme and important that you know how to judge your own actions don't judge me look at yourself in the mirror and see do i fit the rule that the prophet said whoever turns away from my sunnah is not of me are you of him or are you of someone else we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we'll be right back alaikum and welcome back the lines are open for you to call and post your questions if you have any uh yesterday abdullah from saudi arabia asked two questions and i did not have time to answer them so the first question was what is the ruling on plucking eyebrows and the answer to that is the hadith of abdullah bin masrud may allah be pleased with him when he said that the prophet sallallahu salaam said may allah azzawajal curse the women who pluck eyebrows and the women who got get their eyebrows plucked may allah curse those who make tattoos and women who make others do tattoos to them and so on so this hadith is in the sahih and it is crystal clear that it is a major sin to do this for women and it is even worse for men because usually only women do this and there is an alternative for plucking alhamdulillah and that is bleaching so using bleaching as a method of hiding any extra hair this is a a permissible alternative and it prevents a person from falling under the curse of allah azza from saudi arabia mute your television please and listen to me from the phone um yesterday i called two questions alhamdulillah you cleared my misconception about the parents of the professor forgive our parents and admit them in general for those insha'allah and another question i ask is about giving zakat to someone who is careless and all that and he's having waiting for his children yes then you told me i can give and help in in doing the things instead of giving him the money but the problem now my question is he the wedding will be after ramadan and maybe end of july but my zakat is due now what should i do how do i do it so that my date of the card does not pass if this is the case give it to someone else don't give it to him i can give it to someone else to hold it until uh no no no no you give it this is one option but the best option is to look for someone who is needy other than this person and give it to him and allah would take care of that person and his daughter's wedding no because this is my brother-in-law and he's asking his brother for help so he'll have to give him also from if if this is if this is the case then you have to assign someone in your country to take the money of zakat on time and to buy the things they need and not to give them the cash money as soon as possible and inshallah this does the job okay okay abdullah's second question was the ruling on borrowing money from someone who whose income is haram and i specifically if i recall correctly asked him because this is a misconception among people money is haram in two ways either because the actual money is haram or because the way it was earned so if the actual money is haram you cannot benefit from that and you cannot borrow that or accept it as a gift for example someone steals a watch and you know that this watch is stolen and he comes and gives it to you as a gift this is not permissible this is haram but if someone works in a bank and he gets his income through usury or he does a certain job that is haram and he's got his income his income is haram on him but if he gives it as a loan or as a gift to someone else this is halal for the recipient and allah azza knows best i mean from bahrain my father my father before his death has put the property on my elder brother's name after my father's death my elder brother didn't refuse to give us part of the property and now he is also dead and his wife is also refusing to give it to us and she is telling that she will give it to the son of her brother now is for shariat is it haram or halal that she can keep this property or can we make a case in the court to take our share because it is our father's property and my brother also doesn't have any children okay i will answer you inshallah uh normina from saudi yes yes your question yeah i have questions um i have i have planned to go for umrah and then ma i have planned to go umrah for my grandfather and my grandmother can i go umrah can i make niyah for them both of them in one time okay any more questions no marshall you're welcome um okay as for abdullah's question this usually people ask how can money taken from haram source uh be acceptable for us the intention affects the money so if it came through one means or source and then it was given to another person this changes the whole thing for example the jews at the time of the prophet alaihissalam as described in the quran their income was from usury from interest from riba and from extortion from embezzling people taking their money unlawfully through their crooked means and we know this from the quran and until today however the prophet hassam was once invited by a jew woman to eat for a meal and he went and ate now no one would have said why didn't the prophet alissam ask her about the source of the money she bought that sheep with because the no matter what the source was it is halal for us she paid for it and we take it and it becomes halal for us likewise bharira when she gave the prophet salaam something that was given to her as a charity and the prophet does not eat charity but the prophet alaihis accepted it and when mother said o prophet of allah this was a charity given to barira he said yes it is a charity to her but now as she is giving it to us it becomes a gift and the prophet eats gift ashtray from uh qatar yes i am from uh qatar but i actually am from indonesia uh actually i have a trick question the first two question it's from uh two and a half months ago that you gave a lecture about adoption of child about breastfeeding and my question is because in indonesia many of the mother like they are pumping their milk and they give it to other baby is it like is it is it okay or not and whether other babies become their children or not and you said about um after five times of suckling and they become their own child and they become their mahram but the thing is what what kind of five times of suckling is it from one breastfeeding or just one group or i i don't know but maybe you can explain it okay any more questions yeah and the third question is about yesterday you explain about the dollar if we bought uh if you buy a dollar and then we wait until one or two months or maybe later on and we sell it and we get a benefit from it and how about if we buy a stock and uh for example myself i bought a stock from indonesia exchange and it's a ha it's that on the sharia but i don't know whether is it hard or not because you said it yesterday you have to keep it in your hand you have to see it the the the thing itself that's why i don't know whether is it good or not okay any more questions and yeah um no that's all thank you very much i really want to say thank you to you and all the crew and all the people who are contribute to this program and this channel it's really helped me a lot and also other and to you as well yeah thank you i'd like to ask you two questions yes first i'd like to know about the quality of fasting how my fasting is accepted by allah and another thing i'd like to ask is that defending oppressed people is part of islam although i'm i i'm a sunni i see some cruelly toward the leader of shiites being in jail by saudi government and it's your responsibility to defend such scholars rights what scholars what scholars what scholars excuse me what scholars i don't understand i don't understand either what what are you talking about yeah i told you uh the leader uh that's that's the responsibility of all muslims to defend the upright people okay the who and uh as i told you the leader of in saudi arab in saudi arabia i don't know what you're talking about but anyhow i will address your question inshaallah alfaro from nigeria mute your television and listen to us from the phone please what can i do for you yes i want to know ajito that if you are saying let's say now i'm in nigeria or you are in london you can take your sahur and his car descend with those in master well you have different time and different weather so i don't know how different okay you can take the soho i understand people the same time while they are doing their own okay any more questions more explanation about this uh salati tell me last year you said yesterday okay i think we've lost el faro uh seven mayasa from saudi okay mute your television and talk to me through the phone please yes what's your question yes i want to ask questions because regarding business about gold yes because someone who wants to credit about gold and i'm selling it i want i'm going to store like for example they want to make credit a necklace like for example worth 1000 real and i want i want i go to store and i make a profit for 200 years like for example and they will make credit for me for three months uh let's i will let them pay for three months for 400 reals like this maybe uh the the the i will buy the gold 1000 real i will make profit for 200 years and i will give the the credit for for 400 years for three months is it permissible or not okay or not i will answer your question inshallah thank you you're quite welcome amin from bahrain says that there is a problem with uh distribution of uh the wealth that their father left before he died for one reason or the other he transferred the property deeds to his eldest son and when he died this eldest son rejected the rights of his siblings in inheriting their father and he claimed that this is his and he refuses to transfer it back to them or distribute it to them and when he that is the eldest brother died now his wife doesn't want to give it to them is there any way that to solve this no there isn't as long as it's in his name he has legally the right to take it unless you have evidence that your father left two witnesses saying that i'm doing this so that the country would not confiscate it from me or that we can get alone and build on it but actually it's mine it's only theoretically and on paper that i'm giving it or selling it to my eldest son if you can do this through court yes you definitely go ahead and sue them because what they are taking and your sister-in-law what she's doing is eating money and wealth of someone else and this will be hellfire in her stomach and in the stomach of her husband who has died already because even if she gives the land to them i don't know whether allah would forgive him or not most likely he would not because he died insisting on that sin and depriving his brothers from their right uh irish from saudi okay yaseen from morocco yes i just want to ask you you know is it permissible to pray and now i feel after the prayer okay any any no offense this is the first question can i ask a second question please yes sir yes uh you know what if i prayed uh on twitter before i am is it permissible too okay any more questions thank you so much i really appreciate that you're welcome uh normina from saudi arabia she says that can she make double intention for her rumrah so she wants to make umrah for her grandfather and her grandmother at the same time the answer is no you can only make an intention for hajj or umrah on behalf of one person at a time and the evidence behind this is when the prophet heard someone say ali salaam saying so the prophet asked him who is subrama he said a friend of mine the prophet told him did you perform hajj on your behalf before he said no said then this is not valid had it been valid the prophet would have told him to make intention for himself and for subrama as well but this was not valid we have uh nuha from saudi arabia and to you as well um i just wanted to ask about intentions um i do i have a lot of intentions where i would like to you know give part of my salary to the poor or you know to make you know the biha but in the end i don't fall through i just want to know what is the implication of this okay yeah just beneath there but then i get caught up with you know the you know i'll answer your life i'll answer any more questions thank you no thank you so much from oman yes if a person was not practicing and did not fast for four or five years consecutively because he was not practicing at ignorance then then he becomes practicing does he have to fast for those uh five years or so that it is not passed okay this is my first question and second is is there any physia to be given by the parents of a seven-year-old girl who fasted for the first time and she broke the first a few minutes five minutes earlier before the extra time she's seven years old and she broke her fast yeah before five years five minutes before they start okay any more questions no no okay i will answer inshallah estrella says that in indonesia there is a habit of people you know uh sucking their milk and giving it to the needy ones to children so does this make the children their uh sons by suckling by breastfeeding the answer is yes because whether the child drinks straight from the breast or from a cup or from a bottle this is not affecting the what effect what's affecting is the actual milk however we know that it has to be five sucklings so how can we measure this by giving the bottle to the child and it suckles it until it leaves it by itself so this is one meal at one opinion of scholars some of them say no it should be filling so if the child takes the bottle and leaves it in two seconds and then takes it another time and leaves it and he does this five times in less than a couple of minutes some scholars say that this is sufficient for him to be a son and a maharam but this is not the most authentic opinion the most authentic opinion is that he takes it drinks what is considered to be a meal so it's like a minute a minute and a half and then he's had enough he doesn't want any more this is considered to be one suckling you repeat this five times and he becomes a mahram and her second question was about buying dollars which we answered yesterday and similarly similarly is um where was i uh mayasa from saudi arabia now both of them the question is related what i meant yesterday was that buying gold with gold or gold with silver or gold with currency or currency with currency now because these three things gold silver and banknotes currency have the same ruling the prophet told us a specific hadith where he mentioned six types six categories so he said the habit gold buy gold silver by silver he says that you can exchange gold buy silver or silver buy gold money buy gold uh silver buy money this exchange not the same thing see gold by gold it has to be the same weight and it has to be simultaneous exactly the same nobody does this because what's the the logic i give you uh 10 grams of 24 karat gold and you give me 10 grams of 24 karat gold it's the same thing so the profit is telling us that no fluctuation you cannot give 9.99 in exchange for one this is not permissible it has to be exactly similar in weight when it's gold with gold or silver with silver or dollars with dollars or reals with reals now if it differs it changes if it's gold with silver or money with gold then this is okay providing one condition that it is simultaneous i give you the money and i take the gold at the same time there is no delay not even by one minute not even by going to the bathroom and coming back this is not permissible take and give now this is as mayasa as question is clear what you're doing is totally prohibited and riva you cannot sell someone gold in installments you cannot sell someone that a gold you bought for a thousand reals and they'll pay you for it after half a day give you the cash money a thousand reals this is prohibited let alone to make a profit after two months this is total riba what to do you buy the gold you have the gold in your possession they want to buy it cash even if you bought it for a thousand reals this necklace i bought for a thousand rails it's my possession it's mine they come and i sell it to them for five thousand reals cash they give me the five thousand i give it to them no problem you made a profit it's simultaneous give and take as for uh astria's question buying stocks is not under the same six categories so if the stocks you buy is halal and you are actually buying a stock in a company that has halal uh transactions a company that sells dairy product they don't finance by riba no problem to buy your stocks today and sell it after a year with a hundred percent uh a profit no problem to buy it in installments because this is not gold versus currency this is currency versus a commodity a car a house a property you can buy it cash you can buy it in installments you can make profit of it later on so i hope this answers your question mustafa from turkey he says what kind of fasting is accepted at the side of allah and i don't know if his question was uh to pull my legs so i can hear his second question which is about prisoners and scholars being imprisoned in somewhere i don't know maybe he's talking about torabora or something else i don't know what he's talking about we have no scholars with the grace of allah imprisoned and they're all around us and they're all teaching in the haram of mecca and medina in qasim and riyadh and everywhere we you wherever you look in saudi arabia we have alhamdulillah scholars teaching without any problem as is for his sec first question what kind of fasting that is accepted that allah azza it's the fasting that you stop saying lies it's the fasting that you stop sinning it's the fasting that does not include any cheating or deceit or killing of civilians or trying to undermine peace in peaceful nations this is part of it uh ofaro from nigeria says why don't we say bismillah in the beginning of chapter nine surat while all the other 113 surahs of the quran we say bismillah this is how the sunnah was this is how we were taught by the prophet and the consensus of all scholars that surat does not begin with bismillah either because it is a surah that describes the hypocrites and threatens them and warns them and hence it would not be appropriate to begin with the mercy and compassion of allah azzawajal to them where allah is threatening them or because this is how the prophet taught us some of the companions took it after him he said that he's heard someone saying that we can open our breakfa fasting according to mecca time so if you're in nigeria or in canada he heard someone say that we can uh break our fast and start our fasting in accordance to mecca time this is baseless and this is totally bogus has no foundation none whatsoever allah orders the muslims in the quran to fast from the break of dawn until the sun set so if your country has a break of dawn and you can see the day time and then it has a sunset and you can see night time regardless of the length of the day you must fast according to that location yaseen from maghrib says what's the ruling on praying voluntary prayers after the time between sunrise and just before 10 minutes from zuhr it's a time for doing good deeds so you can pray as many as you wish after duha even a thousand rakaa without any problem and likewise if you pray witter in the beginning of the night this does not prevent you from praying praying to hajjud at the end of the night but do not repeat the witter because the prophet said there are no two withers in one night abu hurairah said our prophet assam advised me and instructed me to perform winter before i sleep and we know that he used to pray night prayer afterwards so this is permissible and there's no problem in that noha says so many things i intend but i do not do so am i sinful no as long as the intention is in the heart you did not say it and you did not act upon it you just want to say okay tomorrow i'm going to take a thousand reals and give it to my poor neighbor and tomorrow comes and you change your mind there is nothing wrong in that at all it says a person who did not fast for four or five years and now he's practicing does he make up for these missed days two things if he did not pray at all then he was not a muslim he doesn't have to make up for these days secondly if he from night time so tomorrow after half an hour there is fajr adam and i intended not to fast this day this coming day then i cannot make it up because i intended not to do it on time and hence it would not be accepted from for me but if he started to fast and then broke his fast he should make up these missed days uh seven-year-old who broke her fast few minutes before uh the adhan may allah shall reward her and reward her parents there is nothing wrong but there is no expression nothing wrong on her or on you as a family this is all the time we have until we meet you next time same place same time beyond and blessings"
