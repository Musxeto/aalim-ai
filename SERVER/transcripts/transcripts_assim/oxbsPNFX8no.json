  "transcript": "from Bangladesh. What is the ruling on a person whose heart is filled with the love of Allah, filled with the love of Islam and he has nothing against Islam but sometimes uh something may come out of his mouth uh due to slip of tongue or unintentionally which may constitute of Kufur joking about Islam. So is this person simple and is he out of the fold of Islam? Yes, he is out of the fold of Islam. It is unimaginable for someone who has his heart filled with the love of Allah and of Islam that he has this slip of tongue. This is totally unacceptable and it is something that takes him out of the fold of Islam."
