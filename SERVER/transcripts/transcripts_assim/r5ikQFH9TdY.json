  "title": "If I feel the Covid Vaccine is not safe & refrain, would I be accountable for not going to Hajj",
  "transcript": "we have a very good reason to believe that the covet vaccines are not safe and so we don't get the vaccine and as a result we are not able to go for hajj or to the masjid for the daily salah and jungle like will we be sinful so what takes precedence that's my question okay i will answer inshallah from canada he says if someone is genuinely believing that the covet vaccine is harmful it's deadly it would make you impotent it would not bring whatever conspiracy theorists say and claim if they genuinely believe that would that be a legitimate excuse not to go to hajj the answer is yes see the only one who can question you is allah azza and on the day of judgment if you genuinely said o allah i didn't go to hajj because i had to swim a pond with 300 alligators and sharks in it if they can exist or coexist so i didn't go for hajj because of that do you think allah would punish you no allah will exempt you because this is harmful so if you genuinely believe that it is harmful you have all the right to skip hajj and you won't be sinful for that personal advice take the vaccine why do you say this sheikh maybe there is a conspiracy i took the vaccine four months ago both shots alhamdulillah and i'm still kicking and the bunny energizer bunny is still kicking so don't listen to conspiracy theorists simply because at the end of the day you're gonna have it you're gonna take it i go to hajj i go to umrah i go to the masjid al-haram i go to medina i travel i have no problem with with the grace of allah but if you keep on insisting no no i'm not going to take it you're the only one who's on the losing end and allah knows best you"
