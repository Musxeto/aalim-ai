  "transcript": "the netherlands he says what's the ruling on working as a legislator a lawyer a judge in criminal law legislating is something that only allah can do in the most authentic opinion those who legislate other than the sharia they are disbelievers so you must not get involved in legislating being a lawyer in the lands of the kuffar may require that you study law while abiding by your belief in sharia being supreme and may make you or force you um used man-made law to make what is right right and to falsify what is wrong so i living in europe someone takes my money what to do i have to go to court i have to file a case against him so i need a lawyer when you are when you are my lawyer and you see the evidences and you are confident that i'm telling the truth and i have a just case then you may follow the law of the land in order to get me what is lawfully mine there's nothing wrong nothing haram in that yes the proceedings the way we go uh to the court and and file for such a case may differ than the sharia court the result is that i get my rights not anything extra so if someone took 10 000 euros off me and i go and sue him and the court says that he has to pay me 200 uh thousand euros for example compensation or something more than what i deserve islamically i can only take the ten thousand that is mine and the rest i have to and i'm forced to return it back to him and this is what this sharia law is all about so if this is the case yes now working in criminal law usually this involves investigation interrogations uh forensic examinations these things are okay so you need to know the culprit you need to know who's a criminal to indict someone but when it comes to punishment of xyz crimes that have prescribed punishment in sharia but it's different in their law you cannot get into that because you would be helping in legislating something or ruling by something that is not according to the sharia and allah knows best let me you"
