  "title": "What About the Hadith, The Prophet ﷺ foresaw that  a woman would travel without a mahram",
  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. I have four quick questions. Four is a lot. Even for Huda, four is a lot. Make them two. Okay, no problem. JazakAllah Khair. So, I came across one adding about the Prophet ﷺ said to Adi that if you live long enough, a woman would travel from Al-Ira to Mecca to do tawaf. And this adit is in Al-Bukhari. So how do we reconcile this adit with the adit that a woman cannot travel by themselves? Because I thought like you can travel if it's safe, but you cannot if it's not. Okay, first of all, the hadith Umm Amina is referring to is authentic. And the Prophet ﷺ said to Adi Ibn Hatim Al-Ta'imi, Allah be pleased with him, that soon you will see a woman, dha'ina, travelling on her own from Yemen to Hadhramaut, or from Hadhramaut to Mecca, or from this area to that area, different narrations, fearing no one except the wolf on herself, or something similar to that, as the Prophet ﷺ had said. And she's asking, how is this possible when we know that the Prophet ﷺ prohibited women from travelling alone without the companionship of a male mahram? First of all, the Prophet was giving us a prophecy, alayhi salatu wa salam, of what would happen in the future. Not that he is approving of it. When the Prophet tells us that Ad-Dajjal, the Antichrist, the imposter, would come and do heinous things in the world within 40 days, that's his lifespan on earth, did the Prophet ﷺ endorse his actions? Of course not. They're heinous actions, they're kufr, they're blasphemous, but he was telling us a prophecy of what was going to come. So, this is one of the logical answers to why the Prophet told us about a woman travelling on her own, alayhi salatu wa salam. Secondly, the Prophet has said in numerous hadiths, a lot of hadiths, and directed us and told us and taught us about the prohibition of a woman travelling on her own. So we don't need to come to an isolated incident as such, talking about a prophecy in the future, and try to bend evidences to justify that women may travel alone. The ruling is fixed till the Day of Judgment, so we have to stick to it because this is what Muslims do, and Allah Azzawajal knows best. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
