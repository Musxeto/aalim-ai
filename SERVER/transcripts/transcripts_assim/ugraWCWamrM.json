  "transcript": "question is from brother abdullah can we pray behind an imam who follows the bandi school of thought you can pray behind any muslim who does not nullify his islam the prayer is valid but if a person reaches a level where his islam is compromised then prayer praying behind him is not accepted now having said that is it wise to pray behind an innovator if there is no one else that i can pray behind i am in an area where there is only one masjid and the imam is diobandi and ubandi are an innovated sect but not kuffar they are tabliris and they have innovations but that would not reach the level of kuffar inshallah unlike if we go to extreme brelvis they they have things that may take them out of the fold of islam if they think that the prophet islam was created from allah from allah's attribute and that he knows the unseen and that he is hazard nazir seeing everything controlling everything in this universe this is shirk so if a person who's dubandi who does not uh descend to the level of shirk or kufur he thinks that it is okay to give dua after congregational do after salah he throws amoled every year uh this is what he says and and does mainly innovations like that yes prayer behind him is valid and allah knows best you"
