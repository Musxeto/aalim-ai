  "transcript": "Qul Hathihi Sabeeli Ad'u Ilallah Duda from Tanzania? Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Did I pronounce the name right? It's okay, Duda. Okay. What can I do for you? Okay, so someone with gas inconsistency had the urge to pass wind but they continue to pass, to do their wudu. And the moment they wanted to suppress it, they passed wind. But because they have inconsistency, they continued with their wudu. Is their prayer valid or should it be repeated? Because it was yesterday's maghrib. No, if a person has incontinence and wudu, the moment the sun sets, they're entitled to make wudu even if they keep on passing wind through making wudu. Because this is their excuse. This is something beyond their control. So their maghrib is valid without any problem. Muhammad, yes? The doubt they have is because they were late to suppress the wudu. And they feel like maybe if they suppressed it earlier, it wouldn't have passed. They have wind incontinence or not? They do. So this is something that comes out uncontrollably and they fail to find a window of 10 minutes to pray without passing wind, correct? Yes. No problem. The prayer is valid. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
