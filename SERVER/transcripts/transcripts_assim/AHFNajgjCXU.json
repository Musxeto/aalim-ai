  "transcript": "says is it allowed to do bike insurance because in london bikes are always stolen it is a great loss for the owner insurance as we've repeated before many times is a form of gambling you pay 200 quid 200 pounds to ensure your 3 000 pounds motorcycle a whole year could pass nothing happens your 200 goes down the drain someone steals your motorbike once twice three times and every time the insurance company compensates you with a new brand new 3 000 pound bike is this halal the answer is no this is gambling it's like buying a lottery ticket you may lose a pound and you may win a hundred thousand and hit the jackpot now this is the same with life insurance medical insurance property insurance and uh car insurance however if the government the authorities impose this mandate this fine those who do not take such insurance in this case out of necessity it is permissible for you to apply for such a policy and if the bike was stolen and they provide you with one no problem availing uh what they had given you because you were forced to give them and pay them and not of your own will and allah azzawajal knows best you"
