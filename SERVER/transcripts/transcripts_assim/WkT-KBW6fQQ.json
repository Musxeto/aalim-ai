  "transcript": "umum says one of my favorite hobbies is to apply mahindi mendi is which is a natural substance that women apply on their bodies men may dye their hair to change the whiteness and the color of it with it and it's a natural substance found in nature used as d eye and use as a form of decoration on the body so umathum says so I used to apply Hindi and take videos of it and upload it on YouTube My doubt is is it permissible to show our hands in videos or is it haram I thought hands do not come under meaning hijab so I want to clarify whether it is Haram or not yes it is an issue of dispute whether the face and hands of a woman are part of her because she should cover from head to toe or the whole body of a woman is must be covered with the exception of the face and the hands so it's a an issue of dispute among Scholars I as you probably know I'm inclined to the opinion that says that a woman must cover from head to toe including the hands the evidences are many but this is not the time to discuss them now having said that even those Scholars that say the face and the hands of a woman is not a and she may EXP exp them in public they say these Scholars that it must not be adorned so a woman wearing full hijab uncovering her face and hands cannot put makeup or Adorn herself because this defies the purpose of hijab even though they say that it is permissible for her to expose her face likewise having mahindi on your hands and showing it in videos this is not permissible whether it is or not because it defies the purpose of hijab and it adorns a woman beautifies her and people are not in the same level of righteousness and fearing Allah so there might be men out there who are tempted by these beautiful soft skin hand with these decorations on them and I've stated this before if you would like to commercialize your job you can use seven-year-old children so girls of seveny old can have their hands adorned like this and exposed and maybe even their faces and B because they don't have a specific at that age seven years and younger so you can use your decorations on their hands and show them normally on videos an extra bit of advice I've noticed among practicing women specifically that they have the tendency to become famous to become recognized and well known so I know of sisters who want to spread their art of mahindi as um umum stated some of them wants to show their cooking abilities so they make videos on cooking some of them would like to show their Art of Photography landscape so they make blogs Instagram posts or even YouTube channel uh uh clips and so on unfortunately most of those who are engaged in such activi fall in the Trap of thean we have a saying in Arabic in the first phrase meaning to be famous and known in the second phrase means the back of an individual the spine of an individual so the love of being famous and exposed broke the spine and the backs of those people why because we've noticed that people want to be famous in any way so they do stunts some of them may jump off a plane some of them may use bunge jumping some of them may um sit with a lion or or swim with sharks and photograph this and have it on their social media just to be famous and this is a dangerous thing because it leads people to be distracted from their Daw from their uh private life and sometimes from their Chastity we've seen people exposing their lives on Instagram on Snapchat showing the whole world that this is my house this is my son this is my girl I do this I do that we when we play together when we eat this is new food this is a new restaurant and they don't have any privacy anymore and not only that it becomes their purpose in life so even women who were fully start to Adorn themselves with the so they try their level best to maybe um okay this is one of the alarms that I have to interrupt so excuse me uh apologies so they start to compromise their hijab and start to care less about their Nik and little by little documenting their photos with their husbands with the children little by little showing a bit of their hands a bit of their faces until they take the nikab completely this is how Shan works so I urge our sisters to be careful and to watch their hearts don't let Shan drag your feet and also the brothers don't let the number of viewers be your target don't just want to post something on Twitter or Instagram or SnapChat or YouTube just to draw people to watch you and if you don't have anything beneficial maybe just photograph yourself uh on a Hilltop with the sun uh uh setting behind you that's a nice scene what is this have a life and be dedicated to what you do seek Allah's pleasure rather than seeking the number of viewers uh if you want you need to succeed insh for"
