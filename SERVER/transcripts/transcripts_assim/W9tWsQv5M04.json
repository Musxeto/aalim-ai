  "transcript": "Oh slather him hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen o solo la salle de mubarak rbd he or Azula he nabina muhammad in Wadi he was laughing at me imma bad assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh today we shall start inshallah studying the chapter that deals with solitude house or the prayer of fear and as we know that this prayer was mentioned in the Quran in surah an-nisa where allah azzawajal describes to his prophet what to do when they are in times of fear and facing the enemies how to pray and this prayer is a clear indication that the prayer in congregation is mandatory upon every individual because if it was not mandatory then it would have been easier for people at times of war to pray each one on his own but because congregational prayer is mandatory it was mandated also in the state of fear and the prophet alayhi salatu salam prayed the prayer of fear in a number of different formats depending on the location of the enemy whether they are in the direction of the Qibla or behind the Qibla also depending on the severity of the fear if the fear was extreme or the field was light depending on if there are skirmishes or not if there is any fighting or not and the scholars reported a number of different ways of praying it even has them said that 14 different ways of praying it are authentic amendment now he says they are approximately 16 and even Anatomy says they are 24 and even acclaim after scrutinizing all of these said that they're either six or seven this is the most authentic opinion but because of the number of different narrations whenever there is a slight difference they would make it a separate prayer we have three hadees i believe with us in this chapter the first hadith number 152 narrated of the law Abner almond evening haha rajala one who the messenger of allah sallallahu ala seldom let us in prayer during the days when he met the enemy in battle a group of the Muslims stood up with him in prayer when the other group were facing the enemy so he led in prayer those who are with him one raka they went to stand guard while the others came forward to pray with the prophet sallallahu wasallam so he led them in one raka of prayer then the two groups completed in turn the remaining raka in this prayer we see that the prophet alayhi salatu salam led two rak'ahs a prayer of two rak'ahs normally he did not give any attention or special care for those praying behind him one group stood guarding and the other group prayed with the Prophet the first record show the Prophet awesome great one Drucker finished his draka and stood up for the second once he stood up for the second record the group that prayed with him the first left and took their guard the other group who did not pray came immediately and joined the prophet alayhi al-salam in his second rocker the Prophet continued his second Rocca and finished his prayer and offered salam and then each group continued their own records on their own each group continued the remaining raka on their own now this format the Prophet did not do anything extra to the two parties he prayed to normal Rocca and they themselves prayed want Rocca and completed it afterwards though there was a big gap the first group offered the second Locker after the Prophet eyes I'm concluded his prayer believing a very big gap going in the direction other than the tabula moving carrying the arm all of this does not affect your prayer when you praying the prayer of fear now we have another format and this is an hadith number 153 yes brother from yazid in the room and from solid Nicola even a Jew bear from one who prayed along with the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam the prayer on the occasion of total recall fear prayer a group of Muslims lined up for the prayer with the Prophet why the other group faced the enemy the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam let those who are with him in Oaxaca of prayer and then remain standing while those with him completed the prayer individually then they left and lined up facing the enemy while the other group came forward and the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam led them in prayer completing the rocket that remained for him then he remained in the sitting position by those with him completed the prayer individually then he completed the prayer with a slim the one who prayed with the messenger of allah sallallahu ala assalam was the hull evening a biet ma al bokhari hot ma ok that Solomon hawaa team to jubei he is reporting this from a companion who prayed with the Prophet that is awesome now the prayer is different here the prayer the Prophet is trying to prolong it so that each one of the groups can finish his prayer with the prophet or at least have something to do with the Prophet so the first format would be the Prophet would pray the first record alongside one of the group with him and then after he finishes one raka he stands up for the second and he prolongs his recitation the first group who prayed oaxaca completes the second raka concludes the prayer goes to the watch and the prophet is still in the second record they finish their prayer ahead of the Prophet that is awesome huh they prayed with him how many records one when he stood for the second they stood for the second and finish their second and offer the teacher hood offered the Salam then took their arms and went to the watch the second group came and prayed with the Prophet array salatu salam their first raka which is the second raka for the Prophet understood when the Prophet sack for the tisha hood he prolonged history hood so that they would stand up and pray their second raka bow raised their heads on bow and prostrate prostrate again and then offered the Shahada with the prophet and then the Prophet would offer salaam and they would offer salaam with him and this way he was fair with both he was fair with the first group who prayed from the beginning a full Drakkar with him and he was fair with the second group who prayed a full record with him and offer Salah the first group managed to get the Kabir the second group managed to get the salon so this is one way of doing it again we move on to the third way which is hadith 154 yes from Java dibna blood and sorry who said I witnessed along with the messenger of allah allah allah salam salatan hope he formed ourselves into two ranks rows of frills one leg behind the messenger of allah with the enemy between us and the qibla the prophet said a long workbook and we did likewise then he bowed and we all vote then he raised up his head from his body so we always our heads from Bali then he went down into prostration and the road that was behind him also frustrated while the road that are standing remain standing facing the enemy so when the Prophet completed the prostration and the low which was with him stood up the rail rank of the Muslim made frustrations hood up again and then came forward while the first row went back here the prophets allah allah salam performed bowling and we all bought then he raised up his head from the bobbing and we always have her head then he made prostrations he and the road that are just behind him that had previously been delivering in the first raka when the railing stood up facing the enemy when the prophets allah allah salaam completed the profession along with those who are just behind him then the reading of the Muslims made prostration and then the Prophet proclaimed that the slim and we all did likewise sahih al-bukhari this prayer is when the enemy is facing us so the Prophet erase salatu salam praised normal prayer two rak'ahs they all pray together they bow together they say some Allahu Liman Hamidah together and then the profit goes for frustration him and the row behind him but the second row remain armed and waiting until they finish their sujood they stand up and the first row that offers to you to the prophet alayhi salatu salam retreat of course the second row offered their teacher hood when days guys stand up so once they finish they retreat and they take the place of the second row and the second row takes the place of the first row and they offer the same the first row offers the second Locker with the prophet and with the salute of course they all bow together but when it comes to suit the row that is behind the Prophet is the one who does it with him and likewise when the Prophet is in the jihad position the second row who did not offer salute as they were sitting they offered their see Jude and then they offer their to shower together and they offer the Salam together we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right assalamu alaikum and welcome back nowadays one would say shake this is difficult because the arms and the weaponry and the format of the army is far different than how it used to be at the time of the Prophet that is the latinum actually it's not that different because at times you have to stay on guard and when you stay on guard you have battalions and you have different groups and these different groups are not engaging in war 24-7 maybe they would fight a couple of hours and rest of the day so the time they were resting when they pray this can be applicable but if it's a case of bombing and firefighters and combat that is in the city and people are so afraid to be shot or killed in this case scholars say once the fight is on it is permissible to pray in any way individually alone while walking while sitting while standing while jumping with your back to the Qibla all of this does not affect because when there is real true combat and fighting and firing then in this case you pray in any way or any form it is possible for you to pray because your life becomes a priority rather than wasting your life for something that Allah so jeal has given you permission not to do it but when talking about normal situations where you have guards and you're guarding the area but there's no actual combat you're afraid that there might be actual combat in this case yes you may choose whatever suitable way of the prayers of fear do you have any questions before we go on to the following chapter yes brother sound lacoochee salam hit last time we met we were talking about prayers offering is it correct that the masala should be outside the residential area and people going there should walk barefoot it because I have seen it once as for walking barefooted there isn't anything part of the Sunnah of such the Prophet that is salatu salam generally told us that either walk wearing your sandals or walk barefooted but don't wear a sandal in one foot and walk barefooted one foot this is the way of Shaitaan this is the way that Shaitaan wears his sandals but there is no indication or no preference and going barefooted to anywhere nowhere in Islam that it tells us walk barefooted yes the Prophet sometimes walked barefoot it but this is not part of the sooner that he has told us to do it maybe it was something he wanted to do resting his feet probably or else as for the muscle is the Sunday's the masala to be outside the buildings and this was applicable when you had few people this is still applicable in villages or in small towns but in big cities to go outside of the city borders this would probably mean that you have to drive for about two or three hours at least and this would not be possible if you know that a trade is about an hour after pfizer so if you've got a professor and end up going on reaching the masala which is three hours drive you will probably play the horn said so it is permissible to be prayed within the buildings within the houses but in an open area and a large oval knows best thus allows that we just spoke about are we supposed to offer them loudly the imam supposed to recite loudly or quietly that's number one and number two question is we spoke what sacrifice in India there is a belief i don't know if it's from hadees or an that the sacrifice will be used on the surat we have will be sitting on the sacrifice and helper stickers from the set up can you please explain us about them as for the second question there is nothing to state that your sacrifice will be waiting for you at the salat at all it is the Prophet eres la Tasha ramp who would be waiting for you at the Surratt and he would say rugby seldom seldom and you will pass and your sacrifice has nothing to do with passing the salat as for the first question is the prayer of fear to be recited loudly or silently it depends on the time so if you praying la hora saw you praying it silently it's not at separate Sabha thus a lot of fear is not a separate Salah it is the five mandatory prayers to be prayed so if it's Roger it's going to be allowed if it's lower also it's got to be silent if it's Mallory benatia it's gonna be allowed as well excuse me sick sorry the cell of the Eclipse as well the Eclipse solar eclipse is loud all the time though is during morning or evening it is always allowed harmonica hm my question is that besides the cloak in serato is this car we turn the cloak so is there any authentic hadith of turning the hands while supplicating there isn't any authentic hadith to my knowledge on this people say that some scholars mentioned this in their books saying that when you ask Allah for forgiveness of a mercy of something that is good you open your hands likewise but if you want a logical to protect you from a calamity from drought from earthquake and there they say that there is the similar to the Eclipse prayer even if there is earthquakes or volcanoes or a thunderstorm that is fearful and it's it's hazardous it is permissible to pray as well for it similar to the klipsch until it goes so they say that when you want a lot to protect you from something you do this but there isn't anything to my knowledge from the authentic sooner it's mentioned in the books of FERC but it is not backed by an authentic hadith and if there is an authentic hadith then it is our math have to follow brockman sake regarding the prayer of fear bodies at the time of Jamar the fighting is going on so is the prayer of Jamar what what is to be done like pretty legs or what most likely feel prayer takes place at the Battle time and when a person is in battle usually he is traveling and therefore jamaah does not happen when people are traveling on the road or off-road we know we did not mention this but Jamar cannot be performed except in towns so bed wins who live far away from the town in the tent they do not pray juma and those who are travelers in the middle of the road let's say we have a caravan of six or seven cars or buses and we have like 50 or 60 people traveling together for Hajj and it's time for jummah and they're on the way to Mecca we tell them stopped and offered ama prayer no yama prayer is only to be performed in cities and towns and villages where people reside when people are not residing and that is why if people are living on an oil rig off shore and they are drilling or they stay there for three four months do they pray jumma there is no it's not a place of residing it's not a village so I hope this answers your question SRAM aleykum Selam last time we were talking about the book of Shelah cooler Eden so like when we pray fajr salah on the day of Juma so that time it was a soon enough Prophet Muhammad peace upon him to recite a specific surah like surah surah Hajj dancer at the heart so is there any specific surah to be recited on the day of her head on the day evade it is prescribed as the authentic sooner to recite surah kahf and surat al comer thoughtful quran majeed and sir dr. ibatis I 21 shackle comer or the other alternative is to recite surat with allah and so to russia as you do in the friday sermon yes now we have been discussing about salat al hawla telugu soup and salad Laden is there any specific to our which is to be inserted during the Salah there isn't any specific grant to be recited in the prayers themselves but for for example and it's the scar there is a number of duas that the prophet used to ask allah azzawajal to give and they are quite long and they're quite difficult even in arabic because it is strong language but it all revolves on asking allah azzawajal for pure water that is enough for the crops and that would even feed the animals and the people etc and the Prophet is asking for that but other than that the fear prayer the hosue the eclipse we don't have any specific door for them islamic terror what if we end the Salah of the eclipse before the Eclipse has been not over so is there any issue that's a good question what happens if the Imam ends the prayer thinking that the Eclipse is over and he concludes the prayer and he goes out and the eclipses not over does he pray again the answer is no if he believed and thought that the eclipse was over and he concludes a prayer you cannot pray again and that is why it's better to be safe than sorry prolong it even if the eclipse was over keep on praying until someone comes to you and tells you that eclipse was or if you feel that the Eclipse is over and you conclude your prayer this is sufficient slough Creek I want to ask that during salak elusive if during your grip the eclipse arises due and due to which we start we do not pray I'm a grip and first we start with a solid Rousseff and it the Eclipse is long a bit long and we have the fear that will miss the time of Maghreb so should we conclude our Sala with regard to your question you should have started with Margaret because Margaret's time is very limited and as stated before you could not get closer to Allah with any form of deed more and better than what he has obliged and made mandatory upon you so you should have started with maghrib and then went ahead with the Eclipse this is all the time we have until we meet next time for Manila Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Oh"
