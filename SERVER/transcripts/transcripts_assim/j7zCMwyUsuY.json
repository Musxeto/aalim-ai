  "title": "Following the Hanafi Madhab",
  "transcript": "apparently he's asking about following the Hani and in things that may go against the Sunnah and he says would I be losing the rahma of Allah the mercy of Allah because I'm not abiding by the Sunnah or uh I'm not following other schools of thought that follow the Sunnah in this particular issue because he heard from his Scholars that this is not permissible he has to stick to his uh and I think he mentioned something about the timings of and prayer and maybe F prayer as we know that there is a difference between F and in the Hani mhab than the rest of the MBS so uh in a nutshell we as Muslims are ordered to follow the prophet Alat wasam now this requires that you have knowledge of the Sunnah of the Prophet Alat wasam and whether it is authentic or not and you have to know whether it is is abrogated or not so this requires that you may have to have some knowledge of the fundamentals of so that you can apply this and you have to have a bit of vast knowledge of the Sunnah as a whole so that you don't take something that has been generalized or had been uh specific in another uh Hadith so if Allah tells us that do not eat the dead meat and then you are stranded and you say I cannot eat dead meat said no Allah said and told you that if you are in a distress in a necessity it becomes mandatory for you to eat from it so that you would not die so in essence you as a Muslim you're supposed to follow the Quran and the Sunnah however not everyone is equipped not everyone is uh capable of understanding the Quran and Sunnah by themselves so so those who are unable they must follow a school of thought they must follow a scholar that they trust not only his knowledge but also his moral conduct his uh um commitment his uh uh piety and being righteous because there are so many with phds and with uh uh lots of knowledge but they don't fear Allah or they have bad character they slander they talk foul language they uh um maybe dealing riba so so they're they're not walking the talk no you should not follow those now when we come to someone who's Layman he says I have no idea of which is right and which is wrong we tell him stick to your maab so if you're a devoted hanfi remain to be devoted hanafi until you are able to differentiate as for the time of this is a very big problem because we know that thei maab they postpone And Delay by approximately half an hour to 40 minutes from the actual time and they have evidences of their own which are contradicted by other evidences from the Sunnah and yet they abide by it and this is not a problem when it comes to because ass's time can be a little bit flexible in the sense that you can pray it in the beginning of the time in the middle of time just before the end of the time of the problem is that when you decide that the appropriate time for is in the middle of the time and someone who did not pray knows that the end of the prayer is the beginning of ass prayer this means that this person has prayed not in its time he prayed it in the beginning of the time the actual time of which means that his prayer is invalid so this is a very dangerous one should pay attention to and Allah Knows Best"
