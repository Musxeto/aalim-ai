  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Sheikh, I have a question about a hadith that I recently read. It can be found in Sunan Ibn Majah. Hadith number 4171 where the Prophet ﷺ says, وَجْمَعَ الْيَأْسِ عَمَّا فِي أَيْدِ النَّاسِ or give up hope for what other people have. And I was wondering, can you give some clarification of what does that mean to give hope in what other people have? JazakAllah Khair. Akhi, it's human nature. If I know you and Abdul Rahman is a wealthy man and he has a lot of money, so every time we meet, I keep on hoping that maybe he's going to give me his mobile phone or maybe he's going to say that, okay, I have an extra car, take it. Or maybe he's going to say, I'm going for Umrah. How about if I invite you and I pay for your expenses? So my heart is always yearning and looking for what you have or what he has or what others have in their hands, what they possess. This is a huge deficiency in a Muslim's heart. He should not hope and wish from other than Allah Azza wa Jal. One brother came to me and says, Sheikh, every time I hear about people winning the lottery or the jackpot or winning a car or winning a free ticket, I feel a little bit sad. I wish I was that person. This falls under the same category. Why did the Prophet say, four categories of people would be exempted from the 70,000 to enter Paradise without accountability or torment? One of them is those who do not go to others and ask for Ruqya. Because your heart is connected to them, your heart is looking to their abilities in healing and curing you with the grace of Allah. I know it's Allah Azza wa Jal who cures, but my heart is totally in the direction of those people. And this takes you from the full trust and reliance on Allah. Likewise, if whenever I'm around a billionaire and I keep thinking that maybe he'll throw me a bone, you're a dog with all due respect and excuse my French. Because you should have dignity and honour and be grateful to what Allah has given you. Look only at what Allah gives, not at what people possess in their hands. And I hope this answers your question."
