  "title": "After getting married should a woman obey her parents or her husband? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Firdaus says what should a woman do if she has to choose between obeying her parents or her husband well in the beginning before marriage a woman is obliged to obey her parents so your father has a priority over you that you obey him as he is your guardian but when a woman gets married her guardian becomes her husband and allah azza wajal ordered the women to obey their y22 the way their husbands and Allah described men to be guardians by saying a resolute communal and Misa so Allah favored men over women because of that they are guardians to be obeyed and because of the money they provide for the wives they must be obeyed if we have a conflict of interest a wife sitting in her husband's home her father calls and says I'd like you to come with me to such and such place or I want you to travel with me to such-and-such City she asks her husband and the husband says no I don't permit that and I don't allow you to do that so now she's at a crossroad should she obey her father while disobeying her husband or should she obey her husband and stay back while disobeying her father there is no difference of opinion to my knowledge that she must obey her husband because the status of a husband over everyone else is so great to the extent that the Prophet said alehissalaam if I were to order someone to prostrate to another I would have ordered a woman to prostrate to her husband and he did not mention anything close as this regarding her father so yes she has to be dutiful to her father she must be respectful and obedient as long as it does not go against her husband's commands and instructions but if it does then her husband has the priority and even if her father curses her does not speak to her by Cotts her she must make that clear to him and to her mother that she has no other choice but to obey her husband as allah has commanded and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
