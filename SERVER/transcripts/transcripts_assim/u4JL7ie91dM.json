  "title": "Husband gives time to his family rather than his wife & kids, is this fair? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the next question is from a sister I'm asking on some on behalf of my friend after coming from work I spend one hour with my wife then my sister calls me daily from India and we talk hours till late nothing important but just here in there chit chat on the other end my wife gets upset and complains I do not spend enough time with her and with my toddler daughter I think my presence it is enough for them am I wrong about it this is something that I cannot answer you now out of experience and all married people know that usually the sky is the limit when it comes to spending time with the family so if you spend half an hour with them per meal breakfast lunch dinner and maybe half an hour in the afternoon they would say this is not enough if he spent three good hours a day giving them quality time Church I think joking talking about religion advising them they said well you spend all the time speaking and preaching the Deen we need you to sit with us if you take them out and they have fun and consume six hours maybe in in this outing maybe then they would say okay that's good but we need to see you at night don't don't don't forget so out of experience we can never get enough the family can never get enough from us now for me as a dairy I'm a total different story because I think my wife gave up on me 35 years ago I've been married for 37 years ago so I think two years after marriage she said tell us forget it I'm married to I'm a widow already because this guy is always on the leave he's traveling now hamdullah maybe this was an evil eye covered 19 I don't travel in a mortal frame now I'm being suffocated and all there is a like me I don't know what Mufti is doing if everybody's not traveling so whatever tide we spend with our families they demand more and this is their god-given right he imagined and remember that your wife is sitting between four walls 24 hours seven days a week while you when you think that oh I also have responsibilities I go to work I have to earn money I have to pay for the rent I have to care for the kids schools and all what she does is just sit home relax watches TV answers whatsapp messages etc she's not doing anything okay it's not the other it's not like this if you manage to reflect on the lockdown that you had to spend in your home you would appreciate said well why I don't know how women sit behind these or between these four walls for so long I went crazy seriously just after one or two days I had to fool the authorities and download apps saying that I'm jogging that I'm shopping that I'm breathing that I'm swimming that I have a medical emergency every single day just to leave so we have to be fair now the best way is the way of the Prophet Arizona which is balanced when it came to arribada he was he was the role model he used to pray a night prayer until his feet were swollen one narration he was embracing Aisha at bed and he said to her Aisha let me go and pray to Allah and she said to him o prophet of allah by allah i love you but i love what you love as well which is prayer so she she let him and he started to pray elsa for four or five hours yet he managed it managed his time well so after fajar he used to go and visit his companions teach the ignorant solve their problems until the hurt time then he goes back to his house to retire for a few moments and rest and then after a sir he visits all of his wives together at the same time checking on them and then he if there is a need to go somewhere else to attend an invitation he had the full package our problem is that we do not have Baraka so whenever someone says chef I'd like to have you for dinner oh I don't have time well I have so many things on my plate so someone says okay sure can you come to our Masjid give a lecture well I have so much on my plate when people send this messages or questions I have so many questions to answer we don't have Baraka in our time and this is why we put obstacles all the time and we feel protected behind these obstacles so my wife says come and sit with me so you know I have 150 questions I have to answer on my website and then I have to answer a few questions on Twitter and then I have a lecture to prepare and then I have adults in this country or that country through zoom or through this or I have so many things so she says okay may Allah help you so even if I'm doing what I'm doing there still is time if I may I put my mind to it but I don't want to so my my answer to the brother would be okay try to utilize your time alhamdulillah now we have 4G in some countries I last time I was in Kuwait they had routers of 5g so maybe now it's much faster you can invest a little bit of money you're commuting from work to home from home to work while doing groceries this is what I do I put on my air pods and I utilize my time while shopping I'd spent maybe 40 minutes 15 minutes shopping so what do I do I spent an hour walking every day just to try to fight aging which nobody can fight but this is what the doctors say what do I do I put on my headsets and I have my mobile I can call my relatives next of kin in Dhahran in Riyadh in the stage in UK and whatever I was happy walking I'm not doing anything progressive but talking connecting your next of kin listening to lectures benefiting from your time would definitely when you manage your time help you with your wife so when you come home I did all my chit-chatting with my mother with my sister everything is fine now I'm totally free to do whatever my wife wants me to do I can answer emails I can check what's up messages but it would be as tense as calling my mom and sister because whenever you do something with your family usually your spouse has these two horns coming but you don't see them she becomes aggressive oh he's talking to my in-laws they have humiliated me in the past they have oppressed me in the past they did this they did that when was that it was 35 years ago sure but I still remember inaudible oh it will go with you to the grave so this is how people are made of so accept them with their faults and shortcomings but try to be a better manager and Allah knows best"
