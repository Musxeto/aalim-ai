  "title": "Stand up comedy and impersonating others assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Among the things that the Prophet hated, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, are things that most of us enjoy and that is stand-up comedy, imitating people, impersonating people. The Prophet said, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, when Mother Aisha mimicked someone, impersonated someone, he said, I don't like that I have so and so of worldly wealth and I would impersonate a person. No, I would never do this. And he also commented on a word Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, said about Mother Safiya, that she's short, she's this. So the Prophet said, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, you've uttered a word so bad that if it were to be mixed with the water of the oceans, it would have mixed it. This is a sinful act that you had done because this is backbiting and it was only said so that it would reduce the status of that person in my heart. That's why you're impersonating him or making fun of him or backbiting him."
