  "transcript": "aisha from singapore it would be good if uh you know you could explain to me on the correct way of performing busul because i have daughter i have a daughter who has just turned into a young lady and i would like to teach her the correct way because i'm not so sure whether what i've done is it the correct way thank you so aisha we've answered this question many times but insha allah for the best we will do it again russell is divided into two types both are valid the reason for doing russell is to uplift a state a muslim is in which is major ritual impurity either resulting from getting clean after menses and this is for women or resulting from being in the sexual impurity state resulting out of intercourse ejaculation nocturnal emission etc so how to uplift this major ritual impurity so that i can pray you can perform russell russell is or has two ways one the sunnah which is done in steps the other form of russell is the russell that suffices that does their job but it's not according to the sunnah so the other way which suffices which most people do is to open the shower and rinse your mouth like in woodle rinse your nose like in woodle and then wash your entire body so the whole body is soaked washed with water running water and this takes like 60 seconds two minutes maximum three minutes i'm not talking about using uh soap or shampooing no no just washing yourself with water similarly if you just dip yourself in the river or in the ocean rinse your mouth and nose it's done so this is number two you can pray now number one which is the sunnah the prophet salam way of doing it was to wash your hand three times then wash your private part then you wash your hands from whatever had gotten to it from your private part then you perform your wudu normally and either wash your feet at the end or leave it at the end of the hustle choose either one then you put three scoops of water in your on your head and rub your scalp so to ensure that water has reached it then pour water over your whole body so that ensures that the water has reached every part of your body wash your feet and that's it this is the proper russell so i hope this answers your question you"
