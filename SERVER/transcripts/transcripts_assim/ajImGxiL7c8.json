  "transcript": "Saad from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So the problem is with the imam, like I already told the imam a very common problem that many imams do I guess, I told him that when he says Alhamdulillah there is a raw sound so it's like Alhamdulillah, but he thinks that he doesn't do it so either I'm getting miswah or there is really this problem and the and... Did you ask others? No Sheikh. Then what's the benefit? It's your word against his. If you come and ask me and say you're Sheikh Asim, you say this and this and I said no I didn't say this, so it's your word against mine, you have to bring proof from others. So ask the congregation, does the imam say Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen, does he insert a raw? And if everyone says duh, no, then you have a problem. And this is the best way to identify whether you have a problem or your imam has a problem. If all of them acknowledge, in this case you have to refrain from praying behind such an imam."
