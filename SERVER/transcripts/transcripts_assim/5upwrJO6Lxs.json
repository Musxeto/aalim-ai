  "transcript": "well do from Hana says can I speak to my fiancee we're not married yet the answer is no your fiancee is a stranger to you ma'am doing she's not your wife she's not your muharram if you have a sister and someone proposes to her and you like the suitor and the proposal you accept you designate the wedding or the marriage contract to be written after a couple of months in these couple of months they're total strangers they're not allowed to speak to one another because so many times such an engagement is broken maybe he sees another woman that has more in her than he wants in your sister so he breaks the engagement and moves on to another woman and by this all what your sister was doing in the previous weeks or months was Haram because she was communicating with a nun Muharram with the total stranger and so many people get engaged and break their engagements 5-6 times but they had an affair or at least they had communication with their supposedly future spouse which did not work out so Islam cuts all the means for Haram and tells you okay you are allowed as a fiance as someone who's proposing to have an initial interview where you go meet the father sit with him and then he allows his daughter to come you sit together in his presence you speak for an hour you look at each other try to know one another's personality and get attracted to we have the green light engagement is done but not the marriage once the marriage takes place then you can do whatever you want to do"
