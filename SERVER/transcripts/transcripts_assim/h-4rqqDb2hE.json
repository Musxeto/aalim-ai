  "title": "Family eats haram, if they shake my hand or touch things will things become impure? #assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is Regard in regards to Purity as it causes me a lot of worries so basically what I want to know is um if my family members unfortunately consume njasa and like a few seconds after with they shake me the hand or they touch other things does what is the ruling on that because it's a causing a lot of har because I think it's n just because they touched it and they ate NASA like yes okay first of all the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam lived in Mecca for 13 years surrounded by Idol worshippers who consumed nothing but Haram meat and NASA yet he used to sit with them intermingle with them shake hands with them and not wash his clothes wherever he sat or wash his hands whenever he touched a door knob or shook hands with a non-muslim which means that Islam is based on ease and simplicity and this is always the question I ask those who come to me for counseling sessions is Islam a religion of ease and simplicity or is it a religion of hardship and difficulty they all without thinking say it's a religion of ease and simplicity then I go and ask them what you're practicing in your life today is it ease and simplicity or hardship and difficulty they all agree it is hardship and difficulty which means that you're not practicing Islam simple as that so do not pay any attention to what they eat or what they touch if you don't see with your two eyes with your own eyes traces of NASA that you are 100% certain of I don't think anyone in his right mind of your relatives would eat uh pork chops and with the all the grease in his hand would touch utensils and the the refrigerator and you can see traces of such fat or such grease on these things Nobody Does this so let go of your Whispers of Shan because he's trying to introduce hardship and difficulty in your life"
