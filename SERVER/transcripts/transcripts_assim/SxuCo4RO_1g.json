  "title": "4 rakat Nafl with ONE Salam? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Fouad from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. One of the opinions that I have known that four units of naql prayer with one salam is not valid. I don't understand what you're saying Fouad. I have knew that four units of naql prayer with one salam is not valid according to one opinion. But there is another hadith that states that Muazzin bin Jabaluddin Nafu'anfu used to lead his tribe after he has completed his prayer of prayer of salallahu alayhi wasalam. So his second prayer must be naql prayer which he was leading with one salam obviously. So how to actually summarize this? Wallahi akhi, akhi I don't understand your question because you're talking in a crossword way. So you're saying la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la I can't understand this when it goes up and down. But if I may try to use some logic, if you're asking about the ruling of Muadh ibn Jabal leading his people in prayer of isha, this is permissible because it's voluntary for Muadh and an obligatory isha prayer for the followers. And he prayed four rak'ahs so that he would not confuse them and this was for teaching purposes because they did not know the Quran. So he used to pray with the Prophet and then lead them in doing this and this is permissible inshaAllah and I don't know if this answers your question or not. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. So if you're not able to afford it, you can apply for one free session. So if you're not able to afford it, you can apply for one free session. If you're not able to afford it, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will give you Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
