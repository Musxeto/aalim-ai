  "transcript": "and if you make a survey around the world you'll find that the people's knowledge about the prophet alaihis is less than point zero zero zero one percent and this is shocking to see so much ignorance about the most influential person to have ever walked the earth and this is not said by a muslim it's also shared by non-muslims so who was the prophet beside being a messenger and a prophet of allah as the muslims claim what was he like sad even asked mother aisha the wife of the prophet islam and she said o mother of the believers tell me about the character of the prophet alaihis islam she said don't you read the quran he said yes i do she said then the character of the prophet alaihi salsam was the quran what does that mean imam now he says this means that he acted in accordance with the quran adhering to its limits following its etiquette paying heed to its lessons and parables pondering its meanings and recycling reciting it properly this is how your character becomes the quran let's look at those who described the prophet what did they say they said that he was the most forbearing among the people the most courageous the most fair and just and he was the most chaste among the people never ever in his life touched a woman who's not his wife who's not his mahram who's not his right hand possession the prophet alaihis during his day time used to fix his sandals patch his garments serve his wives and he was the most bashful of all people he would answer the invitation of the rich and the poor the free and the slaves and he would accept any gift even if it were as little as a drink of milk yet he would reward those who gave it to him with something better he would never eat from charity because he was a prophet yet he was never arrogant or too proud to accept the invitation of a poor person or a slave he would become angry only for the sake of allah and not for his own sake he would execute what is right even if this brings harm to himself and to his companions never ever in his life did he ever beat a woman or a child he used to starve days because he did not have food and he used to tie a stone on his stomach he would not be too proud to eat anything that is halal even if it were the hoofs of a ram or some barley with stinking ghee that was presented to him whatever invited to a feast he would attend he would visit the sick he would follow the funerals and he would walk alone between his frozen enemies without anyone guarding him he was the most humble of people he was he was filled with tranquility without any arrogance he was the most eloquent and given the concise of speech without prolonging his talks he did not care for anything in this life in this world whatever he found he used to wear sometimes walking in his sandals sometime walking barefooted sometimes he may walk without a cloak or without a turban or anything on his head which was custom among the arabs he used to be so humble that he could not care whether he's wearing something on his head or not he would ride whatever there was available without any arrogance without any pride without showing off so he would ride a camel he would ride a horse he would write a donkey a mule and if he found someone who needed a ride he would also invite him to ride behind him he used to love beautiful fragrances and used to abhor and hate any foul smell nobody ever smelled anything foul from him he sits with the poor he eats with the needy and he honors people for their character and any of his next of kin he would be kind to them he would connect their kinship without preferring them over someone who's better than them whenever someone did something wrong and apologized he would accept his apology he used to joke with his companions but never ever lie he would joke saying truth he would laugh or let us rephrase that he would smile without breaking into laughter and he would see people play lawful games and he would approve of that and he would not reprimand them for it he would raise his wife as reported a number of times and he would play with them his time was always filled either with something for the sake of allah or something for the betterment of his life never ever he was idle doing nothing he would never look down upon a poor person for his poverty he would never resent a sick person for his illness and he would never fear a king for his kingdom he's forgiving he forgave those who killed his uncle hamza and who killed his companions and mutilated them and set them all free he encourages his companions to forgive and to pardon as he did with abu bakr may allah be pleased with him when his cousin masta slandered his own daughter abu bakr's daughter who was the wife of the prophet alaihi salatusam he slandered her yet the prophet encouraged abu bakr to forgive him he would be in the most sacred place of all in the masjid and a nomad comes and urinates in the middle of the masjid his companions want to beat him up the prophet says leave him leave him after he finishes he calls him and he advises him in a very kind and gentle fashion he had nine wives at a time and they were so jealous they caused a lot of headache and problems for him yet he never faced the jealousy with other than love compassion and mercy and he was always just and fair between them all when he spoke the words came sweeter than honey he was easy going nice person to be with never rude never aggressive never saying foul things he was proud without arrogance he was strong without violence he was merciful without weakness he hears aisha swearing and cursing the jews for saying bad things to the prophet and he reprimands the jews and he says to her allah does not like someone who uses foul language aisha she said don't you hear what they're saying oh prophet of allah he says yes i do hear they make dua and supplicate against me and i say alaikum so allah answers my supplication and does not answer this and he does not have to go out of his way to show them that he had heard what they said and that he knows what they intended so this is in arabic known as the rafal which is in english looking the other way and the prophet islam did a number of incidents this way so that he would not pick up on people why did you do this why didn't you do that like we usually do he was asked once oh prophet of allah the servant who's a slave working for us how many times should we pardon him per day so the prophet said allah you should pardon him 70 times a day 70 times if your servant makes a mistake move on pardon it look the other way we hold a court healing for our servant or a driver or a maid if they ever make a mistake that's why ana sibley malik may allah be peace with him accompanied the prophet sallallahu for 10 years never ever the prophet asked him why didn't you do so and so for something that anas did or ask him shouldn't you have done so and so for something he did not do he would always move on look the other way and not stop and question anas for everything that he did or he did not do now if we were to take the rest of the night just stalking and speaking about the prophet salallahu virtues and beautiful attributes and how he lived and how he communicated with his people it wouldn't be sufficient the whole night wouldn't be sufficient"
