  "transcript": "Sandman says what are the sunnah ways and the procedures of offering sacrifice for Eid al-adha first of all as Muslims we have two reads either the filter which comes after the month of Ramadan the first day of Shawwal that is one day and then we have Radle Abajo which is four days the tenth of the ledger the eleventh the 12th and the 13th of the hedge are known as a yama - repo these four days we are allowed to slaughter a sacrifice if we're not going for Hajj so those residing in their hometowns if they did not go for Hajj once they pray and offer their eat prayer after the eighth prayer is over this is the time of slaughtering it begins from just after the prayer of eight until just before the sunset of the 13th of the ledger that is the fourth day so if someone slaughters before read prayer it is invalid and if someone slaughters after sunset of the thirteenth it is invalid as well it's not considered to be over here it's considered to be just a normal meat that is slaughtered it's not a sacrifice so what are the Sunnah is the Sunnah ways is first of all to select something that is representable now you are offering a sacrifice to Allah Azza WA JAL you don't choose the cheapest and it surely can't be done with something that is considered to be defected so one I'd sacrifice limping sacrifice totally sick or totally thin out of hunger is not accepted there is an age limit so the minimum of sheep is six months and the minimum of goats is one year the minimum of cows is two years and the minimum of camels is five years so coming back to cell man's question this is the time of slaughtering and this is the age of the sacrifice what to do with the meat the companions of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us that the best thing to do is to divide it into three parts one part is to be given to the poor and needy as a sadaqa/charity the second part is to be given to relatives and neighbors as a gift and the third part is to be consumed by you and your family so this is the recommendation of the companions of the prophet alayhi salaatu sir if you give a little bit more here and a little bit less here this is no problem insha Allah as what gel can we give from the second part which is a gift can we give it some of it to non-muslims if we have non-muslim relatives or non-muslim neighbors that's raised yes there's no problem in that at all insha'Allah"
