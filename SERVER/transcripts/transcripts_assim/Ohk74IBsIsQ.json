  "transcript": "Arik from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, my question is sometimes when you go to pray in the masjid, we found that while we're praying, I found that the people who are standing right to me, maybe he's standing a couple or one inch in front of me and the people left to me, he's standing one or two inch behind of me. So in this case, what should I do? In this case, try to stand in between them. You don't distract yourself by monitoring those on the right, on the left, and what is your position which makes you heedless or losing concentration of what the imam is reading. So you forget what the salat is all about and concentrate and focus whether I'm standing in the line, I'm a little bit forward, I'm a little backwards, I have to go to the right, I have to go to the left, and you forget the khushuur and the contemplation of the salat. And this defies the purpose of salat. Focus on your salat and if they're a little bit forward and someone on your left is a little bit backwards, it's okay. A difference, little difference, does not make an issue Insha'Allahu Azzawajal"
