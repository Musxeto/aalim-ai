  "transcript": "The next question is, I am a Bangladeshi student and planning to study in Bangladesh. I follow the veil properly but there are no educational institutions which have separate boys and girls. Can I study in an only girls institution with male teachers? Yes, no problem. As long as all the students are females and the teachers are male, this is done. I teach male and female with partitions, with proper hijab. There is no free mixing. The problem is when you have free mixing with the students, sitting next to each other and flirting or socializing and chit-chatting, this is problematic. But when the teacher is a male teacher and just giving his material and the women are properly covered or some of them are properly covered, you are definitely properly covered and you don't flirt or mix or socialize with the teacher. There's no problem in that shop. you you you"
