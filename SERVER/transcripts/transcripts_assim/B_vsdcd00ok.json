  "title": "Eating Suhoor DURING the Athaan as he did not know the ruling, is fast valid",
  "transcript": "Dayan from the Emirates. So my question is, I know a brother that he was actually eating in Suhoor while the adhan was being called and he did not know about the ruling. So is this fast valid if he was not, if he didn't know about it? Like what should he do? See, when it comes to Suhoor, Allah Azza Wa Jal told us to refrain once we are certain that the break of dawn has come. And in the hadith of Adiy Ibn Hatim Al-Ta'i, may Allah be pleased with him, he thought that the way to recognize the break of dawn is by tying two threads, one black and one white, in his home until it was sufficient light outside to recognize which is black, which is white. So he kept on eating and that was probably like 20-15 minutes after the break of dawn when it's light outside enough to recognize the color. And the Prophet said, Ali S.A.W. No, this is wrong. Your understanding is wrong. What is meant is the white thread of the break of dawn from the black thread which is the whole night. But the Prophet did not order him, Ali S.A.W, to repeat the fast, which means that if a person keeps on eating and drinking because he's not aware that the dawn has broken, and it's time to refrain, or he did not have the knowledge about it, we say that his fasting is valid, insha'Allah. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
