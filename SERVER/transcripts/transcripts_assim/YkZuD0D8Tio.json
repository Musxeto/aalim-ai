  "transcript": "the next question is from brother david at facebook his question is allah created good and evil both so whatever so whatever happens in our life if the evil happens is it not allah's will the issue of will brother david is divided into two types there is a legislative will and there is a universal will what does that mean see it's a long topic but if you read the quran and if you read the sunnah you will find that allah azzawajal orders us to pray to fast and to do righteous deeds and at the same time he prohibits us from doing shirk and from doing sins and tells us that these are abhorred to him these are legislative will meaning that these are the things that allah loves us to do and he loves us to refrain from that is sins yet this is not necessarily what's going to happen because lots of us would defy allah's orders and not do what he mandates or fall into what he had prohibited so this second or latter one is the universal will allah wants abu bakr to become a muslim and wants pharaoh to become a muslim this is legislative it might happen it may not happen but what allah decreed to happen it has nothing to do with what allah loves it deals with allah's wisdom allah's knowledge allah's power so we end up having abu bakr accepting islam so the universal and the legislative will has been fulfilled while in with pharaoh the legislative will was not fulfilled because he chose to disobey yet the universal will was fulfilled so whenever there are hurricanes volcanoes earthquakes catastrophes wars atrocities is it part of allah allah's legislative well or a universal will the answer is part of the universal world allah does not want people to suffer and allah does not love people to have wars but part of the legislative action and will of allah part of the universal action and will of allah is things have to happen people have to die calamities must take place without night we cannot value the daytime without illness we cannot value health and without kufur we cannot value the blessing of islam and allah knows best"
