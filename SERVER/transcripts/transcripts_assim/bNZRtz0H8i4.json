  "transcript": "Amir from Tunisia. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. Alaikumussalam, who are you? Assalamu Alaikum, I'm Farid. we've been waiting for you. Yes Farid, what's your question? Oh okay, I have a question. A brother of me, he has a TikTok account and he wanted to repent and he already deleted his videos but he saved and liked many many videos like he saved like over 1,000 videos and over 100 videos liked but he wanted to repent so there's the option he can just delete his account but the like and the save of the video remains, so do we have to dislike every single video or just repent and delete the account? No, it is sufficient to delete the account and leave this evil platform once and for all. You don't have to go because if I tell you to dislike everything you liked, this means that you have to go through all the haram content again and dislike it and this is a door for Shaytan. Once he opens it, it can't be closed, so just delete it and move on."
