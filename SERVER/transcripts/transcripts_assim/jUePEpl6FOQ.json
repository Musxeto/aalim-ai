  "title": "Can we take knowledge from Sheikh Imran Hosein? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "second question was about a preacher by the name of Imran Hussein and I personally don't like to criticize people in its I don't think it's befitting to every time someone comes and asks what do you think of this diary what do you think of that scholar this is not the way of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam the way of the Prophet I racism is not to speak and address the people of innovation rather he would come to the pulpit and when he had an issue to address he would say why do so and so people without naming them say such things or do such things so the masses learned that this is wrong without knowing who it is that did this so this saves face to the people who committed that wrong action out of their HT hat and at the same time makes the focus on what's right and what's wrong unfortunately nowadays with the social media with the YouTube with the internet sometimes it is important to point out the things that are wrong when people are misguided by some people who are not doing a good job and Sheikh Imran Hussain is a very eloquent person he speaks beautiful English and the way he speaks is magnificent he's an old gentleman but he focuses on the science of team√∂ focuses on dejar focuses on gog and magog hydrogen modules and focuses on the things that will come from the world of the unseen yet most of his preaching is bogus and not according to the Sunnah he is not speaking according to alison wal Jamaa al qaeda his appeal is not that solid and he has serious and grave mistakes and it is important to warn people to follow the trustworthy scholars of Islam people who are known in Islam and not to follow storytellers yeah any for example all the hadith about the Dajjal is well known when he comes and says that the gel is already out where is he we know that over one man one-eyed man is no no no this is TV this is modern technology this is civilization and he starts to talk about things in the UK in the North Sea and although this is nonsense where is it coming from no no Quran and no soon yet he is a wonderful storyteller but definitely would corrupt your art either in no time so it's a red zone it's something that is toxic and people must not watch that and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
