  "title": "Crying during Prayer (Salah) - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the first question on in the emails is from an anonymous stating that is it permissible to cry out of fear or read up remembrance of Allah during salat there is during prayer if so what's the limitation of this are you allowed to make sounds or shake while crying can you cry in sujood as in the state of prostration first of all crying out of the fear of allah not only it is permissible rather it is highly recommended in Islam the Prophet said during his salat Osen two eyes will never be touched by Hellfire meaning that the person would not enter Hellfire and I that wept and cried from the fear of allah azza wajal analyzer jill has praised those who fear Him and have fearful hearts and their bodies tremble while making dhikr of Allah Azza WA JAL due to the fear of Allah subhana WA Ta'ala and this is highly recommended and there is no problem even if your voice were to be raised a little bit as long as it is from the fear of allah subhana wa ta'ala the scholars differed when the weeping and crying in salat is due to a worldly matter so while you're praying you remember a loved one who passed away or you remember someone's oppression against you and you feel feel overwhelmed and you cry so if you are overwhelmed by that and you could not control it again the scholars say that this has no impact on the salat but if you were not overwhelmed rather you drew this yourself and you wanted it and were carried away with it scholars say that this may impact your prayer and it may nullify it so if you start to do things or say things loudly or complain or utter words that would nullify your prayer but if it's out of your control inshallah there's nothing wrong with it whether Institute or in the whole of prayer"
