  "title": "Can videos be used as evidence in accusing spouse of adultery, or must we still have 4 male witness?",
  "transcript": "my question is related to the witnesses of zina taking place so today masala the technology has advanced so almost everyone has mobile phones with cameras etc so if they take a video if they have proof with a video for this zilla so can they produce it in the code without the other three witnesses islam is a religion for all times and places in the quran allah specifically stated that there has to be four witnesses therefore any photography any videotaping would not take place of even one single witness because nowadays we have editing we have possibilities of manipulating it therefore this has no effect at all in proving such a crime"
