  "transcript": "if an non-muslim I know has become pregnant out of wedlock is it permissible for me to congratulate her on her pregnancy I read the question a couple of times I would ask Aiza why would anyone be acquainted with such a person now in the west the first phrase that comes to mind is don't judge me so they may fornicate they may get pregnant out of wedlock they may get wasted due to intoxicants and do heinous things they may do so many outrageous and wrong things and if you talk to them about it either to advise or reprimand even they would say don't judge me so I ask you Aiza why would you in the first place take someone like this as your acquaintance or to be friend with such a person such an individual must not be taken as close friend or Ally she's a non-muslim woman and this is not by itself a reason I could H have a non-muslim friend not someone that I hang out with and I uh uh uh make him my Confidant and tell him all of my secrets and problems but he's a colleague I know him we exchange greetings we may have lunch together we may play a game of sports every now and then and that is it as long as he's not offensive towards Islam he's not oppressive his views are normal why there's nothing wrong in that but if he's a drug addict or if he's an alcoholic or if he's openly gay or if he or she are and is doing something that are is immoral such as having boyfriend girlfriend relationship I would not take someone as such to be my friend I would not be honored to have someone as such to be my friend whether a Muslim or a non-muslim and birds of a feather flock together so if you take such people as friends eventually you'll end up like them Muslims have a very narrow Circle that they hang out with they care a lot about those who they go out with because this impacts their personality this impacts their religion and uh uh Islamic commitment so to answer a question you should not hang out with such a woman in the first place and after she got pregnant out of wedlock out of Zena this is a major sin how would you congratulate her on such a a sin it's like someone getting wasted and you're clapping him for doing a good job this is a form of approval of such a sin and this is not permissible for you"
