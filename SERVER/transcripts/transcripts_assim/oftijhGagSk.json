  "title": "Does saying 'Oh My God or OMG' take one out of the folds of Islam that requires Shahada? | Assim Al",
  "transcript": "uh from the uk there's there's some people on social media are spreading this um i don't know if it's a rumor but they're saying if you say if you have said in your life oh my god oh omfg you have to take the shahada again this is true okay i will answer inshallah from the uk some say and they're spreading this on social media that if you say oh my god or omg or mention the word god that this takes you out of the fold of islam this is total rubbish this has nothing to do with islam the question is is god one of allah's name the answer is no but it is a translation that is known among all non-arabs that it refers to allah using it is permissible when there is a necessity so if i'm speaking to a kafir who doesn't know a word of arabic he doesn't know islam and i keep on saying him you have to believe in allah you have to supplicate to allah allah and the rasool alayhi salaam the guy said what the hell are you talking about so this is not appropriate because he doesn't know what allah is for me to give him dawah i have to go down to his level and say to him you have to believe in god god is the creator of the heavens and the earth i don't i don't say god is al-khalifa i don't say allah is and the guy said what is allah what is i don't understand your lingo so you have to go down to their levels using the word god is not permissible for muslims among themselves except in certain places but definitely using it does not take you out of the fold of islam"
