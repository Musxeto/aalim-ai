  "title": "Lying or sleeping on your Stomach - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the red one has two questions the first one is what's the ruling on lying on your stomach is this permissible or not it's an issue of dispute and the reason there is such a dispute is whether the hadith is authentic or not some scholars think and believe that the hadith of the prohibition of lying on your stomach is not authentic it's weak the one where the Prophet Adam says that this is a way of lying down that Allah hates and in another hadith that this is the way that the people of hell lie down and he kicked someone who was asleep in the Masjid because he was lying on his stomach a lot of scholars say that this is not a authentic hadith and some scholars say that these hadith are authentic such as Cheryl Alberni and those who follow him so it's an issue of dispute depending on the science of hadith now if you're not a you're not a doctor and I'm not a doctor and we go to two different doctors once say that you have to operate because you have an illness in your stomach and the other one says you don't have to operate because you don't have any that interpretation is different both of them are good doctors but the way they diagnose the illness the way they look at the x-rays and the lab reports they differ so what to do take a third opinion my conclusion my personal conclusion is that you should avoid lying on your back that is let me rephrase that you should avoid lying on your stomach if you don't have a legitimate reason as your spouse massaging you or an illness etc and better to be safe than sorry you have three other sides to sleep you can sleep on your back on your right which is a Sunnah or on your left side and this is permissible not forbidden so as long as hamdulillah the alternatives are there it's better safe than to be sorry he's questioned about my previous answer what would he do would he pray it Nasser is know if I deliberately missed the whole prayer I'm in the office I'm working someone says overtime said okay I'll pray it in five minutes the Jumeirah is finished there is another Jumeirah okay I'm coming in ten minutes and it is close to 3:30 and it's 335 the event of acid is 340 and I know that MCA I still have a couple of minutes to do and the event is called Hamas it's over I cannot pray the then it I come back to my senses and say okay let me go pray the don't pray the says what happens if I pray it Allah will not accept it from you it would be voluntary prayer because the prophets hadith is clear I'm not bringing this from my own pocket as they say the Prophet said that there is no expiation for what for someone who slept for someone who forgot we know that both actions done in sleeping or while unconscious a logical doesn't burden us for that doesn't hold us accountable three the Prophet tells us that Allah would not hold accountable are a sleeping person until he wakes up an insane person until he becomes sane a young a child until he reaches the age of puberty so and also at the end of surat al-baqara banana in a scene Allah Allah do not burden us if we forget or make a mistake so Allah says as in the live a Muslim I would do that Allah answers this application so this means that if you did not sleep nor forget a prayer deliberately waited until the time was over and there's no legitimate reason none whatsoever in this case you cannot make it up entirely yes you can make the other prayers after dishes Al Maghrib in the case of brother Ahmed question who the TV's social media sites are the best way to contact us from anywhere around the world stay connected with Hooda TV's latest news and programs through Facebook Twitter Google+ YouTube Skype and Instagram it's fast and easy stay up to date with your favorite shows and scholars today good at TV a light in every home"
