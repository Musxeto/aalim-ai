  "transcript": "I had a question regarding the mixture of classes when they're like in the US sometimes uh they have classes for that are for boys and girls with a divider in between now my question is is it Hal for to be teaching that class and is it Hal for me to attend those classes these classes are Islamic classes talking about yeah so a in the west it's not like elsewhere because due to the resources are not as in Muslim countries or in Arab countries and the likes sometimes they are unable to segregate properly but if these classes are segregated in the sense that women are on one side and men are on one side there is no free mixing they're abiding by the proper hijab there's no problem for the Sheikh to teach such a class and there's no problem for men to attend such a class because it's segregated and it's not freely mixed"
