  "transcript": "Brother Ibrahimah from Guinea Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu May Allah bless you your family and your team Sheikh and you as well Sheikh I recently heard the fatwa of you saying that it was not Permissible to follow people who post haram content and of course, I have no issues there My question is what about like people like die? Yes What about it There are women appearing on the screen for some seconds or less or more sometimes not in all the videos, but it happens Okay. Okay. This is different. Okay, what is random? Is different than following an influencer on Instagram? Where she posts her pictures and bikinis, for example Or a da'i who always comes with women and random da'is female da'is and exchange laughs and Crack jokes and mashallah. Everything is normal. The only thing remaining is the marriage contract This is different when we say that you are not allowed to follow people who post haram things We're talking about the majority Majority such da'is who come with females and women and Interact freely and these are da'is on the gates of hellfire Like the prophet said because this is not islam what they're doing this is a mutilated form of islam Islam is according to quran and sunnah. This is free mixing Where is it allowed in quran and sunnah to crack jokes and to talk about such inappropriate stuff and then you attach to it islamic like Attaching everything that is a halal to all of things So this glass is halal the fish you buy in the market is halal the vegetables Cucumbers is halal. What is this? It's just a label So it's a different thing from for example when you have a good lecture in a country that Has no segregation rules And the sheikh is giving a beautiful lecture beneficial lecture and the director mistakenly every Like 10 minutes goes for a second or two to the audience and you may glance a woman here and there The content is halal but Some of it is haram lower your gaze No one it's it's like saying sheikh. What's the ruling on going to the park and there are women who are not covered Okay school malls The street the hospital so you want to confine yourself to a bubble and not leave the house this is something that you have to be exposed to This is different than going to a nightclub or going to a prom where there Is free mixing and music? Without any legitimate reason for that and I hope this makes sense"
