  "title": "Prolonging and Reciting the Athaan in a Melodious Manner? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Shayan from the U.S. I was wondering what the ruling was on prolonging the Adhan and making it melodious as I was considering practicing this Adhan. Jazak Allah Khair. Wa Jazakum. Abdullah Ibn Zaid, may Allah be pleased with him, was the companion who saw the Adhan in his vision and he went straight to the Prophet ﷺ and told him about it. He was the one who saw the Adhan, yet the Prophet ﷺ told him, teach what you had seen to Bilal because he has a nicer voice. Which means that it is intended that the Adhan is recited in a melodious and beautiful voice, but not to exaggerate and take it to a level where it becomes a song. Sometimes you go to places like Egypt, you go to places like, may Allah liberate it, Syria, or to Turkey and you hear the Adhan and it's so beautiful. You can't hold yourself but really enjoy the voices, the way it's given. It's SubhanAllah, something out of this world. Such melody in the Adhan is quite acceptable as long as it does not resemble songs and they extend it to be like 10 minutes instead of the average 3 minutes, 2 minutes to 3 minutes. So as long as they're doing it in a melodic way that attracts people, inshaAllah this is fine."
