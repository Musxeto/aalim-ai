  "title": "Rise of Hom*s*xual*ty in Schools, how to control it? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "worda says mostly we talk about segregation of girls and boys but now homosexuality is very common in schools and colleges etc what should be done to control that this issue is not much discussed we focus about segregation etc and forget about this and at the end we wonder what just happened first of all generalization is not a positive thing at all to come to an incident that is isolated and to make it the norm to make it the trend this is unfair and it is against what allah had told us and taught us and commanded us in the quran and that is to be fair you can't label the people of a country to be all drunk cards fornicators womenizers just because a handful of their citizens went to europe and did heinous things as it is unfair for me to tarnish the whole of the christianity religion christian religion and say that's a religion of violence because of the civil war in ireland for example between christians that lasted over a hundred years or so so many hundreds of thousands if not millions killed this is unfair so to claim that this is widely spread in schools is an exaggeration and an overstatement this is not true does it exist of course it does muslims are not angels they're human beings so there might be homosexuality like everywhere else there might be fornication like every where else there might be people who do drugs or drink alcohol this is normal but it is it the trend is it the norm that people do this in public and speak about it definitely not so first of all we have to be careful before generalizing such a description second of all do we have this yes we do but what is the percentage one in a thousand maybe one in ten thousand probably give or to take how to control this it is not something that you control see islam is a way of life it is not rule number one regulation number five that you come and implement it's a system once you have the system you have a perfect community and a society once the system is imbalanced you'll have errors and you'll have such things similar to what you had described why in islam we're ordered to lower the gaze if you defy allah's command and you allow the children as they grow up to watch things that are prohibited in islam to listen to things that are prohibited in islam and the children grow up watching mangas watching cartoons that have mixing tom and jerry when the cat wants to seduce or lure the mouse it paints its tail as if it's a mouse a female mouse wearing a bikini now the children grow watching these things so they believe that such attraction is only natural as they reach puberty their desire grows when they look around them and they cannot find a legitimate place to fulfill such desires here we have the loophole in the system that drives them to homosexuality or some of them why because they did not follow and implement the rules and regulations of islam so how to stop this in our schools by going back to the teachings of islam by taking care of our children from an early age not trying to inflame their desires to the opposite sex not to stir these ideas in their minds to look for such things because they see it on tv tv series on movies on video clips and it's the norm i remember when i was like seven eight years old when my parents who were not practicing at the time used to watch the 16 milliliter milli meter i think 16 millimeter uh movies in in our home theaters whenever there was a random kiss and movies back then were so clean that they might qualify now to be considered islamic and this is an exaggeration but it was way cleaner than today whenever a random kiss was there we used to hide behind the curtains because of our bashfulness and that this is something taboo and we should not be watching this nowadays this is the norm so it is us who are to blame when we bring up our children to see these things to watch video clips when they watch a famous uh um male or female singer singing a song that has a plot and it involves a boyfriend a girlfriend nightclub dancing bedroom a bar and they watch this because the music is fine and they see something that is implanted in them they need a legitimate way to depressurize whatever is inside them they cannot find this is what causes a problem that needs to be fixed however we have schools of we have circles of non-knowledge we have groups that take them to play football and take care of them and bringing them up islamically we should focus on such activities that would take their mind off these subjects and allah knows best"
