  "title": "The Shape of her Shoulders & Chest show beneath her Abaya, is her prayer valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Najwa from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So when I pray, my shoulders, the shape of my shoulders show and so my chest, is my prayer valid? Where I really wide abaya when I pray? Allah Azza Wa Jal mentioned in Surat An-Nur that women must cover themselves and must not show except what is inevitable going to show. A woman's height cannot be concealed. A woman's obvious natural curves cannot be concealed because this is something that's in her. If a woman is overweight, you cannot conceal that because this is going to inevitably show and people would know. So what is inevitably going to show regardless of what you wear, this has no impact on your prayer and you're not sinful for that and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
