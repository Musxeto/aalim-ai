  "transcript": "[Ahraf from Bangladesh] [Ahnaf: Sheikh my \nquestion is that one of my mahrams, she   worries about money, gets stressed and depressed \nso I told her that she shouldn't be doing it and   that Allah is the Razzaq but she says that there's \nnothing wrong with being stressed or depressed as   the Prophet ﷺ used to get stressed and depressed \nand as a proof she said that he ﷺ got depressed   when revelations stopped and he once attempted \nsuicide as well, so if you could explain it a   bit?] [Sheikh: Why is she justifying this? Why \nis she having these anxiety attacks?] [Ahnaf:   She's worrying about money, she says that every \nmonth she starts to worry about that whether she   will get money for her children or not and then \nshe gets depressed and she says that its the same   as the Prophet ﷺ being depressed and i'd also \nlike to know whether if the Prophet ﷺ attempted   suicide or not] [Sheikh: ok, I will answer you \nIn Sha Allah] Sheikh: Ahnaf from Bangladesh,   a woman says that always gets depressed and \npanic attacks whenever she thinks about um money,   so she she's always thinking about the future \nwhat Allah will bring what Allah azzawajal would   provide and she's always having these anxiety \nattacks and whenever he tries to calm her down   and connect her to Allah and says to her Allah \nis a provider she says there's nothing wrong in   being depressed, there's nothing wrong \nin having anxiety attacks, the Prophet   was depressed alayhi salatu wassalam and not \nonly that, he even tried to commit suicide,   so Is what she's saying true or not? \nDid the Prophet ﷺ become depressed?   The answer is yes but for a very short period of \ntime and Allah revealed to him that WE can see   that you are sad and depressed because they are \nnot responding to you they are not accepting your   call and they are not believing in you and \nfollowing you don't be, don't let yourself   be sad or depressed or even kill yourself \nover that, not in the sense of suicide but   to harm yourself by such negative feelings, \nno don't do this there is no need for that,   what about the attempts that the Prophet ﷺ tried \nto commit suicide when he was first revealed to   and then he did not see Jibril so he used to go \nto the top of the mountains and try and attempt   to throw himself is there any authenticity of \nthat? The answer is, \"No\" in sahih al-bukhari   these are known as balaghat zuhri which is a \n(speaking Arabic) Hadith not authentic and has   no authentic narrations, so ALL scholars of Islam \nacknowledge that this is not an authentic hadith   so yes then the Prophet had never ever attempted \nto commit suicide sallallahu alaihi wasallam"
