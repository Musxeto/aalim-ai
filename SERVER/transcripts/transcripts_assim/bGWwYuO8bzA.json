  "title": "Is sending salutations upon Ibrahim & Musa when hearing their name in prayer sunnah? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign so during the congregational prayer when the Imam happens to research especially in Juma and night prayer after the Imam concludes the last area which is some people in the congregation would say Allah to refer to Prophet Ibrahim and Muslim upon them all which are mentioned in the last ayem is this from the Sun this is not permissible to uh to offer salutation upon uh ibrahimov when hearing their names during the Salat and saying this is an innovation because there is no authentic Hadith that the prophet Allah recommended us to do so nor did the companions may Allah be pleased with them used to do such a thing therefore it's an innovation and Innovations are tempting when you do something most people are not doing you feel that you've gained some power satanic power that's why nowadays and I've always mentioned this after Fajr prayer even in the Haram you would find people after doing their car doing prostration and prolonging it hey what are you doing he says this is shukrana prostration I do it every Fajr prayer did the prophet do it no are they and some of them even look at you in a weird and funny way and they say are we supposed to do everything that the prophet only did this is ridiculous so now they think that they're better than the prophet Islam if the prophet did not do it then we're entitled to do that and there is something wrong in there Iman let alone in their thinking so Bida gives you a kick because you feel that I'm better than others I'm doing something they don't dare to do they don't dare to do because they love the prophet and they follow him you are doing it because you're following shaytan and obeying him Satan is pleased with you he's happy with you the bad news is Allah is angry because he blocks repentance from every innovator he blocks repentance they wouldn't repent why his most merciful most compassionate yes but because the innovator believes that he's not doing anything wrong he would never repent this is what is meant by blocking the repentance may Allah guide them all"
