  "transcript": "it sounds a lot I should have got a question yes unless you see Ron don't come to salah in the state of intoxication because you don't understand what the Imam is saying okay in this context having a man on that I don't understand Arabic latest my Salah stand okay any more questions in the same context during during a surrender the Imam doesn't recites slowly we don't understand we don't hear citation so what do you okay thank you inshallah would about a verse in the Quran where Allah Azza WA JAL says yeah you Halloween a man who later Karamu salatu wa antum su cara Hatala mamata kuru o you who believe do not approach prayer while in the state of intoxication until you know until you understand what you saying so it hasn't it doesn't have anything to do with the imam recites reciting even if the imam was reciting arabic in urine arab but you're in the state of intoxication you should not pray and why is that because the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam even told us that if one of you is praying night prayer and he is a bit drowsy feeling sleepy he should retire and sleep because in this situation you may ask allah for forgiveness and instead of saying o allah forgive me you say o allah curse me because you're not focusing so the Prophet tells you no you have to stop you have to go and retire and sleep likewise if a person is praying while in the state of intoxication he's drunk instead of asking for forgiveness he may curse himself and one of the people who used to drink he drinking after once being wasted then urinating in a ball and then performing Woodill washing his face with his urine and saying Allah make me among those who are purified themselves and make me among those who repent Allah agenda me to Aveeno run a minimal tapa hearing this is what you say after making wudu and afterwards when he was sober and so what he had done to himself he took a vow not to drink again you don't have to reach that level you just simply have to submit your will and know that it is haram for you to drink or to be even close to drinking this verse deals with you not knowing what you're saying not because you don't understand the language rather because you do not you are not in a state of mental health or mental case so that allows you to do something that is permissible rather you are in a state of temporary insanity temporary insanity when you're intoxicated you do things and then you regret it you do things and you don't remember if you do things that you would never have thought of even doing when you were not drunk so this is what the ayah is referring to as for us Iran Lord it's the same thing it is no there is no relation none whatsoever to what the imam is reciting because you are reciting the fatiha on your own reciting the sword on your own and making draw on your own analogical knows best"
