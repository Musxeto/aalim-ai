  "transcript": "she says that I'll be traveling on a jet plane and it will consume a lot of time in the sense that fellow Arase and maghrib will pass and I'll reach at Asia time so what should I do with these four prayers the answer is Allah has ordered you to pray wherever you are five times a day how do I know by monitoring the Sun so while I'm on my flight my flight is at 3 a.m. we're flying I look through the window and I can see the dawn breaking this is time for me to pray for I make what do and I pray for if I can stand if you are a rich person or a VIP in flying first-class there is enough space for you to to pray standing directing yourself to the Qibla if not because you're in flying in an economy and usually they would not allow you to stand or to move in the alleys and to pray in this case pray sitting down to the best of your ability likewise with Lahore you pray 2 rakaats answer two rakahs Maghrib three rockets and you can combine if you wish between Lahore NASA on either times and between Maghreb Anisha on either times now for your second question travelling between Kuwait and your hometown in between you can shorten and combine once you reach your reach your hometown you have to pray on time and full prayers because your hometown is the place where you're inevitably and eventually going to go back to so you do not shorten your prayer or combine it as for Kuwait you have settled there so you do not shorten your prayers and you do not combine it as well but in between you are still considered to be a traveler and Allah soldier knows best"
