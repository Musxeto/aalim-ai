  "title": "Struggling with thoughts of Allah giving murderers back their soul to forgive them assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I've been I've been fighting some some ideas and some let me say some whis like uh like no I've been fighting this thoughts some thoughts in my head for the past few years now. So and um today I would like to clarify it with you um that um people that kill each other for example if it is a suer that killed people or it is people that mistakenly kill themselves Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala will forgive them by them giving back giving back to to that soul back to life like Allah will give them back to the soul and they will give back to them that is the way Allah forgives people that kills each other sir and I've been fighting these thoughts that there is no such thing in the Quran but I'm very sorry sir I would like you to clarify more these thoughts so I'll be able to ignore it totally sir I don't understand your question when a murderer kills someone whether he's a sorcerer or he's a perpetrator or he is a tyrant he has blood on his ant and he has rights to be given to the victim and to his family on the day of judgment. If that person repented to Allah before dying, felt remorseful, tried his level best to give the blood money and to make things right to the victim's family, Allah will forgive him. If the person was abducted by the authorities, tried, convicted, and executed, a soul for a soul, Allah would forgive him. But I don't understand the concept of the soul coming back. No, the soul does not come back in this life. No matter what happens, a dead person is a dead person. He will be resurrected on the day of judgment and Allah will avenge him from the one who had transgressed upon him and took his life unjustly."
