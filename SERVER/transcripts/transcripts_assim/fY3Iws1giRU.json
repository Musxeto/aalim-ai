  "transcript": "you have from bangladesh he says what's the ruling on praying after sunrise this is known as salatul ishraq this comes from a hadith where the prophet says whoever prays in the masjid behind an imam the fajr prayer and then remains where he had prayed meaning in the masjid until the sun rises making dhikr reading quran making tasbih whatever and after the sun rise he praised two rakhas allah would reward him the reward of hajj and umrah complete complete complete so this is the great reward that allah has given for that for these two raka's after sunrise does it fall under doha as well yes it does because anything that you pray after sunrise is considered to be as well so if you pray only this set of two raka's it's sufficient and if you pray another two raka's for duha that was uh would also be an advantage and allah azzawajal knows best you"
