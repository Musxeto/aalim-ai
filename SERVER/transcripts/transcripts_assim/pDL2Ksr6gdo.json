  "transcript": "[Music] fim from the Amirage I have a confusion regards to reciting the first verse ofah fa in prayer the is the sun is the I'm asking because if I the IM and I pray without I I said with sently and started alhamdulillah and after I finish my prayer the congregation asks me like those who never heard about that Hadith they will come and why you didn't recite then I say I already recite but they then they asked why can't you recite loudly then what should I answer I will answer inshah from the emirat he says when I lead the prayer and people say why don't you say in the beginning of why do you recite it silently the answer is one because the prophet had never recited it loudly and the vast majority of schools of thought say you have to recite it silently only the shaf recites it loudly secondly although it is written in the Quran copies we have one which indicates that the fa's first verse is the most authentic opinion according to the Sunnah and a lot of Scholars that b is not part of the fa it is a single separate Ayah from the beginning of all suras except chapter nah TBA so the Hadith Allah says in the I've divided the prayer between me and my servant into two halves when my servant says alhamdulillah Allah says my servant has praised me complimented me um compliment Etc so all of this sequence indicates that is not part of the Salah is not part of the fa but we recite it as part of the Sunnah so why is it written in the Quran one this is one of the writings of the Quran there are other copies that starts with alhamd number one and this is the most authentic opinion that it is made of seven seven ayas is not one of them no"
