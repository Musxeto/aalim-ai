  "title": "ðŸ†•âœ¨ She repented for Zina but continued pre-marital relations, marriage valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Salma from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi My question is regarding a couple. A couple had premarital sex and repented, but still hugged and kissed, and they had oral sex. The husband repented for this, but the wife doesn't remember she did. Since they repented for zina, but can't remember for repenting for the other actions, like oral sex. Of course she had committed a sinful act, her and her partner, by engaging in such activities after repentance from fornication. However, if they repented and showed remorse, and sought Allah's forgiveness from fornication, yet were still involved in premarital relationships that do not include fornication or actual zina, rather it was something like the things you've mentioned, this does not impact the validity of the marriage, and their marriage contract is valid. And I'll give an advice to anyone who keeps on getting these intrusive thoughts. They must not go and visit websites of fatwa, or search it online, because this is the fuel that feeds the fire. Their OCD is fueled by such research and random websites of fatwa. As a layman, as someone who has zero knowledge of Islam, doesn't know Arabic, doesn't know the Qur'an, doesn't know the hadith, does not know the fiqh, you must not cherry-pick and keep on going from one website to the other, confusing yourself more and more. This is a rabbit hole that you get yourself willingly into, and you will not be able to come out of. What's the solution? Go to one trusted scholar or sheikh, in your vicinity, in your masjid, in your locality, someone you trust, who has knowledge, not a blind follower, someone who knows, and you ask him and stick to what he says to you. Don't keep on hopping from one place to the other. This is the only way to curb such OCD and to stop this once and forever, Inshallah."
