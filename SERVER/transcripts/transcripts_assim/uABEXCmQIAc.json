  "transcript": "uh Zayna Dean from the UK he says about a stick that was given to Abdullah and him asking to have it with him in his grave when they bury him now the stick was given to him by the prophet I'm not sure of the authenticity of this uh Hadith but there is no reason for me not to believe it what's the ruling on putting in your will that XYZ to be with me in my grave if it has no value meaning if I say I'd like you to put a million quid a million pounds uh in my grave and bear it with me this is totally prohibited not permissible but if it's something like a deity if it's something like a a ring that has no value but it has sentimental values for you and you ask them to bury it with you this seems permissible there's nothing wrong in that Abdullah ask for this stick for a purpose may I will be pleased with it and that is because it was given to him from the prophet Assam and we know that anything that relics or whatever that belong to the prophet is we can seek blessings of Allah from it like his cloak like his clothes like his sweat Etc so the this is why he asked for that now we don't want to open the door for people to say oh Sheikh when I die I'd like to have my kitten with me so many people spend in the UK are so obsessed with the cats and they have funerals and when the cat dies I get tons of mail saying will my cat be with me in Jannah I don't know will it have as well what is this so there is this possession or actually of a session where people have towards their cats so I don't want to open the door generally speaking if it's something that's not where it's worthless it has no value and and people The Heirs would not call for it can be buried with you"
