  "transcript": "members they don't to affray what to say there for example in that cases they are not fit for their partners so can we say that it's very dangerous and if you would not pray even your marriage and all is invalid different things can be okay but I can lock Aditya from Mauritania okay I think we lost sister Khadija Asif says that people don't pray a lot of people don't pray in India I may beg to differ because I've been to India so many times and hamdulillah and the Muslims there are very practising I went to their message and I prayed Juma's there and I was shocked to see the amount of Muslims attending masha'Allah from early hours of the morning but like every country like every community there are Muslims who are not practicing even Saudi Arabia even Mecca and Medina itself there are people who are so ignorant and a deviant that they don't pray so those who do not pray if you advise them then you are doing the right thing and you have no problem in that you may tell the spouse that his or her spouse if he does not pray at all not a single salat no matter how many times you try he refuses actually to pray then the marriage is not valid anymore how did"
