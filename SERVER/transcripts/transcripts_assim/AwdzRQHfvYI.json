  "transcript": "jake you told that a person who is unsure about when their incontinence will begin and start they can make wudhu at the beginning time for each salah and pray so my question is if this person cannot pray at the beginning time due to some reason is it allowed for them to pray after some time of course see the time of prayer has a beginning and has an end when we talk about a person with incontinence and he cannot maintain his state of abolution of wudu we say that this person is entitled to perform wudu after cleaning himself at the beginning of the time providing he wants to pray but if he doesn't want to pray and he would like to go to the middle of the time or just before the end of the time and then clean himself perform mudu and pray that is totally fine alhamdulillah you"
