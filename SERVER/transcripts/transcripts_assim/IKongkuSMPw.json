  "title": "Why is trimming beard more than a fist length haram when Companions did it? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh so why is trimming the beard More Than A Fistful not being Haram deemed a weak opinion when Abdullah and some of the other sahab would trim their beards Beyond a fist I don't know of any Hadith that states that your beard should be a fist length so why would trimming the beard more than a fist be Haram do you have a fist length beard not quite but almost so why are you so occupied with this concept I'll give you a a quick um analogy we have a set of hadiths where the Prophet sallallahu alai wasallam him himself said all saying that leave it as it is and he himself in his description had a wide thick beard so this is his teachings and this is what he did if we get two maximum three of the companions who did otherwise but the whole entire group of the companions did not do so who should we follow the teachings of the Prophet Alam he's doing and the majority of the companions or should we follow only abdah Omar abuur maybe some third uh companion doesn't make any sense so you cannot come and blame me and say she you have a beard that is longer than a fist andbar used to trim it and whatever exceeds a fist length he would cut it short why would he do this some say that because this was his interpretation of the Ayah inat after doing his or shaving his head and shortening his beard this is how he understood the Ayah this is his understanding so who should I follow his his understanding or the actions and the rhetoric and the doing of the vast majority of the Companions and besides it's an issue of dispute though the way the the those who say leave it as it is outweigh definitely those who say you can trim it so to be safe just do what the prophet didam and his the majority of his companions and if you're Fe is too long to the extent that it's hazardous to your life and to your well-being and it's coming in your face and when you're eating you're eating portions of it and if you're a biker it it hampers your vision yes you may take this opinion due to necessity and Allah Knows Best"
