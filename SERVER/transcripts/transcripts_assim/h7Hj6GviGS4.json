  "title": "Going through menopause & see spotting before & after menses - what to do? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um actually uh I was going to ask um my mother-in-law is around 50 years old and she is having a menopause and she cannot decide when she is pure because um she has irregular Menses for about two or three months now and her actual period duration of her actual period is eight days now she says she's having bad spots weeks before her period starts and sometimes she sees the blood spot on her underwear but most of the time she says she sees the blood inside the vagina uh and this continues a week before actual blood flow which is eight days um can she pray in this case because she doesn't know when she's pure actually first of all these spottings that women get if they get such spottings before the flow of the blood they should disregard them any color discharge yellowish brownish or spoture two of blood that come before the flow of the blood before the monthly cycle it must be ignored and a person does not refrain from praying and fasting however when they want to pray the fourth prayer they may perform Moodle after cleaning themselves and changing any clothes that has that have um impurity on them then they may pray until the time of the prayer is over they have they have to renew the wudu and follow the same process the spotting and color discharge at the end of the Menses is part of the menses but you're not asking about this you're asking about it coming before the menses saying that she's 50 years of age and suffering from menopause this is not entirely true because lots of women still conceive when they're 50. and I know personally women that have conceived at this age or around it so this is not necessarily their menopause and they should still consider the bleeding they get to be their Menses and Allah Knows Best"
