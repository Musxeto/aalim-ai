  "transcript": "labe from bangladesh he says that i know that wearing gold for men is haram what about using mobile phones and computer chips in the computers in the pdas which operate using gold in their components to my knowledge this was used long ago when that was the best conductor possible nowadays i think they have what they call rare earth minerals that are way cheaper and much better performing in these devices therefore there is no gold present first of all but hypothetically that i cannot operate my pda without these chips and i need to use this this is permissible for necessity as scholars say that it is permissible to take a golden tooth in the past if you had a silver tooth it would rot and have a bad smell to it like silver does so they used to put golden teeth and the prophet salaam in one of the expeditions one of the companions lost his nose through uh being hit by a sword that chopped it off so he took a nose made of uh silver and it stinked so the prophet ordered him and allowed him to take one made of gold so for necessities this is permissible inshaallah but to my knowledge this is not being used any more on lanos"
