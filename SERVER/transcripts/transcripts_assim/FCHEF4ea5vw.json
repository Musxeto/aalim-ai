  "title": "Ruling on learning & using Ilm Ul Kalam while giving dawah? (philosophy) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says what's the ruling on using and learning it while giving dawah the answer is i ask them what do you mean by al-malkalam so he said it's the same methodology that is used by asha'irah and mathuridis and murtazila and jahmiyah which they manipulate and misinterpret the beautiful names and attributes of allah azzawajal and his answer was sufficient philosophy is it in the quran or in the sunnah no did the prophet teach his companions philosophy no did the companions teach the tabern the tabern of uh taught it to the taber taberi no it came in later centuries when money was so available that the scholar that the the rulers of the muslim empire gave the weight of books translated from the greeks and the byzantians to arabic in gold so everybody started taking all the trash these nations had translating it into arabic this is when the muslims were exposed to such philosophy which had nothing to do with islam and then they went to i wouldn't say the second level to the lower level of implementing this philosophy with allah the almighty so instead of believing in allah submitting your will to allah unquest unconditionally they started metaphorically understanding the quran the sunnah and the beautiful names of allah then they started talking about allah himself then they started talking about allah's attributes and what is possible and what is not possible all of this took many of them out of the fold of islam those who are interested in addressing philosophy in islam and they fight over it most likely i'm not generalizing but most likely they are not true muslims they have grains of hypocrisy in their hearts because they see the people who follow the quran and the sunnah and how strict they are in following the quran sunnah and they don't like this so they want to make a name to themselves and they can't do that by just following the quran sunday because they'll be like everybody else so how can they stand out in a crowd by injecting words of philosophy things that people who say huh i don't understand see you're not intellectual you have to reach a certain level to understand what i'm talking because it's it's too high for you so they started talking nonsense a lot of baloney in islam and people were so shocked jaws were dropping because this is almost blasphemous what they're saying but nobody has the knowledge to refute that because it sounds illogical to even talk about it and they thrived on this and thought that they had it made unknowing that they are becoming full-fledged hypocrites undermining islam and islamic ideology so definitely this is not permissible"
