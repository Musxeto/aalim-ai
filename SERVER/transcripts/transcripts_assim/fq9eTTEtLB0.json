  "transcript": "what is the true meaning of jihad can you can shape this into a specific definition of Meehan and what is the main difference of jihad mozzarella insulin and then she had in our time thank you this requires a lecture but in short jihad linguistically is to struggle and technically it is to fight for the cause of Allah the prophet said Allah salatu salam to the person who asked him Oh prophet of Allah a man fights for the booty for the money a man fights for fame a man fights because his kinship were attacked so he's fighting with them who's among them is in jihad for Samir Allah is it whoever fights so that Allah word is the highest so this is jihad when you fight for the cause of allah azza wajal however jihad can be categorized in five things jihad of Shaitaan when you struggle when you fight Shaitaan this is jihad jihad of your own soul and sometimes they're both interlinked then you have jihad of the disbelievers the Kafar mushrikeen enemies of islam and then you have the jihad of the hypocrites who are claiming to be Muslims but they are fighting an undermining Islam and finally you have the jihad of the sinners Muslims but they're sinners you have to jihad and strive not kill them see jihad is not only killing it can be done by words Allah soldier says about the Quran and was a hit who me and you have to have jihad with the Quran and the Prophet aerosol of Salaam used to encourage she had by words like Hassan bin thabit he was the poet of the Prophet Elisha Lobster and he used to criticize the mushrikeen with poor poems and it was much much more harder on them than swords because people would circulate all they said so and so about your family this it's also about your fear and being coward and running away from battle and all the Arabs would talk about so poetry at the time was like CNN was like you know news agencies so these are five types of jihad that we make and the jihad technically is divided into two types in Arabic they call jihad ever and the second is jihad palapa jihad ever is what everyone agrees upon which is that you had based on defense so when someone attacks you you defer definitely you find it in the doors it found meaning push so someone attacks your country attacks your family what do you do it's legitimate even the kuffar say you can do it that is to defend yourself this was found at the time of the Prophet sermon it's found until today the other type of jihad is the one that everyone trying to hide and it's called jihad Arabic and this means that the jihad of pursuing running after and this you had was at the time of the Prophet Elisha la tercera but this jihad cannot be accomplished cannot take place unless the state of the Muslims is strong if you don't have a strong Muslim country who can they pursue or attack no no no stay where you are just try to fix yourself enrich your people with Islamic knowledge and Eman then you can go and what is the ring then behind such she had number one to call him to Islam it is for Dawa the jihad is only for Dawa that is why when Muslims go and conquer the adjacent country what do we do we kill them all no the Prophet says the first thing you do is called into Islam if they accept it leave them color said Muslims we go we don't want your country we don't want your land we don't want to your wealth if they refuse then tell them Allah obliged upon you to pay taxation gzy stay kafir as you wish no problem but you have to give us a percentage and this percentage by the way is giving is given once or twice a year depending on the rules and it's less or equivalent to say cut your own zakat and by the way Jesus is not taken from women you didn't know this to do so I'm teaching you new things Masha Masha let's call that is a very big scholar jizya is not taken from women it's not taken from children it's taken only from men who work and can't produce so that we take juicier and in return when enemy comes and attack your country you don't fight we Muslims protect you Subhan Allah for this little money yes and you enjoy sitting in your homes and in your country and live your life normally but the ruling is for Sharia so you do not open nightclubs you do not fornicate in the streets you do not know share our rules but you live your life you marry you have children you enjoy your life but publicly is Lambros if they refuse then we have to fight and if we fight you then we capture you you become our slaves and we take your land and you take we're because you refuse I give you two good options this is the strength of Islam but nowadays forget this may any in that in the coming 40 50 years when the Muslims become strong as they're supposed to be and they are focused and Islamically oriented now we're not Islamic ly oriented we are money-oriented we want to live comfortably have a good car have a good house have a good salary and that everybody else die I don't care"
