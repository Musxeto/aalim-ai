  "transcript": "uh we have a question from n joari and he says alayum what is the ruling on saying say Muhammad s alai wasam this is an issue of dispute among Scholars but there is no dispute among them that you cannot say this phrase and this description of our Prophet Alam D during rituals such as as prayer or such as aan so there's no muslim who says that it is allowed when you call for thean to say and then you go if any person does this anyone and everyone knows that this is an act of innovation it's a b and the aan is not accepted likewise when in prayer and one is offering the salutation to The Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam by saying or so you can say both if someone says for example or when he says this is an innovation it is not permissible so outside the rituals outside the forms of worship can we say s Muhammad and the answer is definitely yes he is our Master sallallahu alaihi wasallam he is our Superior he is the best of mankind to have ever walked the Earth he is the best of Allah's creation sallallahu alaihi wasallam no matter how hard they try to discredit him to say bad things about him to criticize him all will go in vain nothing remains except the solitation on the prophet Alat that Allah has taught us and nothing remains except his exalted name sallallahu alaihi wasallam it is sufficient that his name is being mentioned 247 all over the globe whenever you say or whenever you hear the aan you always see that the name of the Prophet being a servant and being a slave of Allah is mentioned with the name of Allah in every in every round the clock all over Earth because everywhere there are Muslims and everywhere they are giving aan they're calling for prayer and they're praying themselves so he is the peace be upon him sallallahu alaihi wasallam our master and he is our Superior so we say Muhammad"
