  "title": "Can we use interest money to pay off our taxes or for personal gain? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Dilawar says we get interest money from our bank account can we use this interest money to pay off our taxes since paying taxes is not from Islam dancers know is prohibited for you to take interest money in the first place hypothetically assuming that you are in a country that forces you to take interest money and there's no bank account that is free from interest money in this case you are allowed to take this interest money with the intention of giving it to poor people as a form of cleansing your wealth not as a form of getting closer to allah now failing to do this and taking the interest money to pay off your taxes would be committing a sin of benefiting from the haram riba money that you've received from the bank"
