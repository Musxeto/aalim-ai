  "title": "Is it permissible to use copyrighted materials?",
  "transcript": "well basically speaking the issue of copyright is something that has to be respected because the author of this book has invested a lot of time a lot of effort he compiled his thoughts he gave you the juice of his experience to make such a book so when you breach the contract and photocopy it you have harmed this individual and hence this is not permissible you can read the book it was sold to be read not to be photocopied and distributed around a class of 30 people and the author only sold one copy this is not fair and if I or you were to have a similar situation where we wrote a book and we sold it for profit and all what we got was five copies sold and a hundred thousand copies photocopied that would not go well down our throats so muslim' would not believe until he loves for his other brother what he loves from for himself so this is not permissible for you to do if you cannot afford it then you don't need to read it the other side of the coin would be that if the material itself is needed for your studies for your school and it is too expensive for you to buy or you are unable to buy it and there is no other legitimate way to do it so it is for yourself a benefit not to make money out of it so you're not photocopying and selling to the others you're just doing it for your own self and study if this is the case it seems insha'Allah permissible for an individual case not for a school plus if it's found on the internet where you can download it for free or you can get a copy on the Internet open to everyone and you print it this is permissible because it is not you who violated it it's on the Internet and this seems permissible enlarger knows best"
