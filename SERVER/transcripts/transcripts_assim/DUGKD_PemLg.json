  "transcript": "learning knowledge is a form of worship and everything we do can be a form of worship if we fix our niyyah and allah azzawajal did not differentiate between sales and river unless or except because it is a form of worship allah has made transactions and selling halal and made riba or usury haram which means that it is a form of worship and if you study which is something that each and every individual should do because the prophet said as in the hadith whomever allah wills good for him he will grant him the understanding in deen so without understanding you are ignorant you're negligent you're a layman and this makes you like the vast majority of people this is something we would like to avoid how to do that by learning our deen and the concept of learning is vast someone cannot come and say give me the most important thing what do you mean what should i study tafsir or arabic language or this is not something that you can pick up in one day there are mandatory things obligatory upon each and every individual and there are communal obligations for rudolphia mandatory things such as what how to pray before that to hate the pillars of islam what does that mean i don't know no this is mandatory upon you to learn so that your akida is crystal clear how to pray shaykh i don't know maghreb is three or four he said no no no this knowledge is important no because i'm studying arabic i don't have time to no this is essential upon every individual but the communal obligations are things that you're not required to learn them until you need them so what are the pillars of hajj i don't plan on making hajj today maybe six years from now i don't have money so is it mandatory for me to know that hajj is has four pillars in this seven eight conditions mandatory things what are the things that break your uh haram what are the restricted no no you don't have the to know these and likewise sales and transactions if you're not a trader if you're not someone who sells and buys why would i have to know what is al musa bana what is what are the types of riba i don't deal i don't have money and if someone who's poor he says um do i have to learn what is the threshold of zakat what are the four categories of zakat what how to give it to who to give it to the eight categories mentioned in surah toba said no you're poor you don't need to if you know so this is why the scholars when you look in the books of fick you find them categorizing it first of all as chapters dealing with ibadat ibadat meaning rituals and forms of worship such as salat siam zakat why because they started first of all with salat as it's the most important thing in islam after the shahadah the first thing to be questioned and they didn't jump to salat no they started with the conditions you cannot be accepted your prayer cannot be accepted without purity so they spoke about the chapter dealing with purity purity depends on water so they started to talk about the types of water according to the different schools of thought there are two only and then they started with what breakthrough would do and then they started with the menses for women because it's a great deal with purity and then they went to uh the prayer which is related to adhan et cetera then they went to what you know zakat then assam then hajj they moved into transactions why these are rituals we know them after fulfilling these obligations now people need to eat and drink and they see things that they like in people's possessions the only way to get it is to get it by force and this would mean chaos in the world that's why allah permitted buying and selling you like something it's going to cost you this much you have the price alhamdulillah and after the transactions when you are alhamdulillah full had a good meal had water and everything is what do people usually look for to get married house is yes but it's actually what's in the house that counts how an empty house doesn't does a job so they started to look into marriages so the scholars in the books of you find books related to marriages how it's conducted etiquette then divorce then custody then types of divorce custody of the children then all of these are related to these things so after you're full after you are married what happens people become arrogant people become choosy so they may harm one another they may kill one another so they talk about chapters that deals with injuries with murder with theft and so on this is the logical way they cascaded things within and this is why we thought that learning how to deal in selling and buying can be beneficial for you why um please with them and and this is an uh hassan hadid by albany he said you are obliged to learn how to sell and buy before you come to the market don't spoil our markets without knowledge you will be spoiling the markets and he used to go in the marketplace with his stick so if he saw two selling and buying without knowledge the transaction is haram he would beat them and he said go learn and come back and if you notice that a lot of the muslims have little knowledge in transactions and this is why we get a lot of questions share what's the ruling on drop shipping share what's the ruling on cryptocurrency share what's ruling on this or that amazon prime or whatever they call it and these things are new but they all come back to the old evidences from the quran the sunnah because this is the power of islam that it fits every generation till the day of judgment it's not something that oh this was at the time of the prophet now it's it changed no this is not true it is valid till the end of time a lot of the muslims in india call me in sheikh we had a property or we had a car and someone wanted to rent it from us so we gave it to him in rent is this halal so it depends what do you mean sheikh what are the restrictions we have to know before you give a fatwa what's the background why why are you asking it's like telling me sheikh there's an apple can i say bismillah and eat it if it's the daytime of ramadan no if it's not yours no tell me about it don't just give me a question and want me to fall in your trap so then he says okay i have a five room uh villa and the rent of this villa is usually 300 kuwaiti dinner a month good is it okay that's a good price so someone came and wanted to rent it so i said okay you have to pay me 20 000 created dirham as a deposit and i'll rent it for to you for five kuwaiti dinars a month is this halal i said of course not this is clear riba this is where the river if you knew your religion if you studied it you would have known that these this deposit is not a deposit it is what it's alone he's lending you 20 000 questinar the deposit is usually 500 so that if paint is scratched we will fix it from that to give you 20 000 and then you charge him only five dinar for the rent this means that you are borrowing this 20 000 from him the interest that he lives in that house for a year for two for five for ten and he's making a lot of benefit out of that so this is riba and eighty percent of the people who speak to me fall into this and they think it's legitimate is halal because they don't have knowledge so this is one of the benefits one of the benefits of learning the rules and evidences governing transactions now let us define before we go into the hadith because the hadiths are clearly i mean we're not going to spend a lot of time but the introduction is important what do we mean by bayer selling because in arabic bayer can mean sell and buy at the same time so beer to who can be or can mean i sold it and it can mean i bought it it's the same thing so what is the definition of selling and buying different definitions i'll give you a simple definition that might be a little bit complicated but when you break it down into points then you will understand just from the definition in legislative and legal definition selling is the exchange what does exchange mean two parties involved i give you take so this is selling exchange the exchange of what of something of value it has to have value with another person okay so there are two involved whether two persons or two entities companies from companies countries from countries this is still considered to be selling pipe through how is this exchange done through cash or credit or a halal service so i sell you this through cash give me one fills so this is an exchange cash or credit which happens a lot of the time salaam alaikum how much 50 says oh okay i'll take it tomorrow i'll bring it for you this is on credit halal no problem or through a service salaam alaikum how much is this 50 fills oh i don't have cash i can't buy it through credit but i'll sweep the floor for you this is a service so i'll sell my service okay it's okay alibaba talib used to do this may allah be pleasing and he used to do it with the jews he used to work for the jew we know that salman al-pharisi also worked in the in the beginning to free himself and this is well known this is a service so the exchange of something of value why do we say of something of value something that has no value cannot be sold so i will sell you a group of ants or roaches jose this is something that cannot be sold because it has no value i'll sell you a dead cow i found it outside this is meta it's haram for you to to sell etc and this would bring us to a very important issue because in arabic it's called mal bimal mal but what is the definition of mal mal the most any authentic definition is something that the whole community agree to be of value in order to exchange in the old times what was it gold and silver later on it was bank notes tomorrow if they bring um rocks and they say okay five pieces of rock we'll get you this bottle of water everybody agrees upon it it's considered to be mal in arabic they call it feminia it has feminine it has a value among us okay sheikh what about cryptocurrency yeah it's not the time wait wait i know everybody is online now shall i buy no wait wait this will come inshaallah later on so the exchange of something of value with another whether through cash or credit or halal service forever why do we say forever because if i lease you my car this is an exchange you're giving money every month and i'm giving you my car is it forever this is timed then this is not selling this is renting and the the law is different the rules are different so forever while not being riba yeah this transaction is not ripper and not alone because river is exchange give me a hundred dnr i'll give it to you 110. so can we say that this is selling no but there is an exchange share of something of a value and it's credit and cash at the same time yes but allah says which means that they are two separate things so it cannot be defined with cells this is the evidence easy to understand inshallah and the loan alone is also exchanged i'm giving you this money and you're returning it back to me but there isn't something that is being exchanged in return except the reward from allah azzawajal and that is why they called they call the contracts of uh loans to be it's not a transaction of exchange it's a transaction of being kind and compassionate to your brother why do i lend you money because i want to help you there's nothing else no strings attached so these are the main um definition when you break it down it helps you understand so now when someone says to you i want to do this you look at the definition how it's broken down he said no there is one condition that is not fulfilled this is not halal this is not this this is not that now there are as stated by scholars seven conditions for the transaction to be halal and where did they get it from they got it from collecting a lot of these conditions from reading quran and sunnah and this is why scholars come always on top and this is why it's frustrating when someone comes to you who does not know arabic who does not know the basics of who has never studied and you tell him about aaron said what's the dele he doesn't even say what's the evidence in english is it what's the what's the dalin what the hell are you talking about you know i need to know your dali do you know the basics of the quran do you memorize the quran do you know hadith he said no do you know arabic i said no but i need to know the dele you don't have the basics you go to a neurosurgeon and he says we have to do this procedure and because of this and they said show me what's your dalil he'll kick you out of the hospital do you not qualify didn't he do even first year of medical school so it's not wrong to ask for the dali when you're qualified when you have little of knowledge when you would like to understand so if you have an ambiguity a question a doubt so you say okay i've read that this and this and this and this and this and this and it goes against what you've said ah now you're putting forward an allegation that i can give you my point of view but when you come from out of the blue and you say i need to know the dali give me the reference number of the hadith i'm answering the question if i memorize the number of the hadith i would have been with the major scholars of islam not coming here to the legendary with all the respect what are you talking about give me a break so you have to ask for the delete when you have background these seven conditions of course i'm taking it from our shaykh they all revolve around preventing riba preventing volume transgression and preventing ambiguity these are extremely important in any transaction between you and even your brother your sibling you cannot just do a transaction and say halas is my brother he's my friend he's my colleague there has to be these things have to be eliminated you can't go with a taxi driver salam alaikum take me to uh jabria okay how much no it's okay we will not have a dispute and when you reach you'll have gunfight you bring a plumber don't work without asking how much he's going to charge and then give him the permission you think it's going to cost you 100 fills he says it takes 10 dinars no there has to be no ambiguity no oppression or transgression no riba so what are these seven um this is not related to the torah it's general introduction and risha is in 15 minutes so i don't want to go to the hadith and break it for salat um you know we have wrong calculation only in asia the four salat are perfect but asia they fixed it to an hour and a half from sunset throughout the whole year and this is wrong usually it's 60 minutes maybe 70 minutes as much maybe 50 minutes after sunset to fix it at one and a half is wrong especially for sisters because our sisters home oh there is uh 15 like i just thought 15 minutes for asia when asia is out in five minutes so they're praying it not on time which is very dangerous anyhow this is not our topic so what are the seven conditions number one consent what does consent means that the both buyer and seller they're doing it willingly [Music] so if i come to a person who has a car that i like and i want to buy he says i'm not interested then i put a gun to his head so now you're interested he said yes i definitely am interested and he sells me the car officially is this halal no allah says it has to be out of consent both of you are happy and this is why sometimes you may engage in a transaction unwillingly your father-in-law comes and he said sell me the property please come on you're my son-in-law uncle you're wanting to buy it half of the price i i want to come on yeah i gave you my daughter yes i regret this uncle but what can what can i do i'm stuck so but he insists on you out of shyness out of bashfulness you agree this transaction is hara because he knows that he forced you and you accept it unwillingly now the second condition is the person engaged among the two buying or selling has to be authorized to deal what do you mean by authorized to deal number one he has to be free not a slave why because the slave does not own and this is something we may talk about later about slavery about the things that may confuse a lot of the muslims why there is slavery in islam this is oppression where is human rights whether it's geneva convention we will come to that later but a slave who has this date said mashallah it's not yours okay what about my apple watch it's not mine it's my masters everything a slave owns and possesses is belonging to his master so when you see a slave riding in an amg e-63 2022 barbados and you want to buy this slave his master says okay i'll sell him for 1000 kd you gave him the 1 000 kd he says to the slave bring me the car bring me the watch bring me your shoes just only wear one soap one dish dasha and you say i bought the slaves yes but not everything everything else is mine so condition to be authorized to deal one you have to be free two you have to be an adult a child with a checkbook coming to a car dealership and he says i'd like this car and here's a check this is not halal that's not permissible because he's not authorized he's still a child and the pen of accountability is uplifted if he hits someone if he does a crime or whatever allah azza will not hold him accountable as the hadith three the pen is uplifted from them one a child until he reaches the age of puberty a sleeping person until he wakes up and an insane person until he regains his sanity hadith everybody knows about it number three he has to be sane what's the opposite insane someone who's insane just out of the looney hospital and he says i want to buy this and he gives you money you cannot sell him he's not mentally fit number four he has to have sound judgment what's the difference between this and being sane no you may have someone who's sane but he has no sound judgment he finds something that's worth one dinar he pays 10. and he possesses something that's worth 10 dinar and he sells it for 200 fills so he's sane but his judgment of selling and buying is a nightmare so these are the four conditions to be in a person who's sound or uh authorized to deal with and we will continue with the remaining two conditions correct like this then i have to go into teaching mode which it means that i will spot ask you what i have said and then i'll ask you to stand up and maybe ask you to do push-ups watch out i'm very vigorous in this may allah make things easy okay so we mentioned two conditions that are needed out of seven for the transaction to be valid and the first one was the consent second one was to be from someone who's authorized to deal and the third condition is that what is being sold has to be has to be one permissible two has benefit in it and three without a necessity what do we mean by being permissible it means that things that are haram cannot be sold cigarettes tobacco intoxicants these are musical instruments these are all haram so this cannot be permissible to sell it has to be permissible and it has to have benefit use so if you sell something that has no benefit such as selling uh insects for example insects have no benefits for people so this is not permissible to sell it has to be permissible has benefit and without a necessity what why do we say without necessity some things are beneficial but they're not permitted because they're only permitted in necessities like for example acquiring a dog a dog is haram to buy and to sell but it is permissible to use in conditions is there any benefit of it yes in terms of a dog that catches game and hunts a dog that protects a dog that used for protecting the herds a shepherd dog so these are permissible but with what with necessity not generally permissible and this is why you cannot sell them and buy them according to the most authentic opinion also buying dead meat this is not permissible but for necessities you can use it so if i have a dead cow or a dead sheep i cannot sell it but i can use it to feed animals that i have this is halal buying and selling it no likewise buying uh animal dropping this is for necessity you can buy this if there is a necessity for it like in buying fertilized fertilizers and in this case you can do that because there is this necessity coming into place number four condition number four that the person selling has to be an owner or authorized so if i do not own this bottle and then can i sell it to people it's not mine so it has to be from an owner or someone authorized so the owner of the bottle came to me and said shikhasam i authorize you to sell it and this is halal to sell because i'm authorized there is an exception but this is very uh uh minor but i'll mention it for you just to have an idea there is something called bail fodoli someone who's not authorized and this transaction is a difference of opinion on scholars someone comes to me finds this bottle in front of me it's not mine do you sell this bottle i said yes how much i said one dinner he said okay i accept and say i sell then the owner comes and i said listen this bottle of yours i sold it for a dinar he said why did you sell it it's not yours i said i know but i thought it was a good deal if he approves it the sale is halal if he says no i don't want to sell it i have to go to the buyer and say the transaction is invalid because it's not mine to give him back the money this is called by al-fudulli and the companions did this with the prophet the prophet approved it and there are many forms of it but this is not the time condition that it's possible that you can deliver it which means that anything that you are not certain of being able to deliver is not permissible to sell so we go to the cornish and i see i say to you mashallah look at the gulf it's very vast i'll sell you five kilos of hamur in the water that's very good deal i accept i take the money and i leave you where is my hamur it's in the water i didn't like you go ahead and collect it this is not permissible if i have a renegade slave that ran away from me when i come to you say okay the slave usually cost one thousand credit dinner i'll sell it for you for five hundred fields well that's a good deal here is your money so allah go ahead catch it selling you birds in the sky i cannot deliver i cannot handle it how can i sell it to you this is ambiguous so islam says this is not permissible number six you sell something that must be identified by clear description or by visual or by touching i cannot say to you well i have this beautiful car i'd like to sell for you or to you for a 10 000 kd he said what type so i don't know but it's a beautiful car it has four wheels it has a good engine and four windows yeah but well what is a good car you think to yourself well live okay i can buy it no you can't because when you see it maybe it's a chinese car maybe it's a car from 30 40 years old this is why you cannot sell something without either full description of it as if you can see it or a picture or something that's tangible i can see something described no this is invalid and this is why among the categories in the sunnah of the prophet sallam he prohibited the selling of what is is a transaction that is dependent on touching so we are in a dark room i'll say to you whatever i throw to you and you touch it it's for one dinner so i throw something in you yeah okay i'm fine you take it it's not what you thought you thought it was silk and then discovered that it was rubbish it's caused once one feels is also prohibited you come to a wholesaler and he says everything is for one dinar so you see many good things he said listen whatever i throw to you this is one dinar or whatever you throw a stone and it falls on it this is for one dinner except you should accept maybe you get something worth 10 dinars maybe you get something worth nothing in games when you go to the fun fairs and you put a coin in the machine and you try to grab a rabbit you may fail and grab a mouse maybe i don't know you and you may grab it this is gambling this is part of the ambiguity something you are not able to collect you cannot participate in [Music] finally the price must be defined so i bought this bottle i want to buy this bottle okay i'm selling it to you okay i'm buying it how much i don't know there is ambiguity in there and there will be dispute because i say it's 200 filth the sheikh said 200.50 ambiguity and he's making me drink it and now he's asking for 200. this is not fair i have to clear it out before the transaction is made so that there is no dispute that may arise in the future so i hope this janisha clarifies and gives you a preview and this is only the tip of an iceberg i've managed to summarize pages for you in these things so that and you just have a chopper view you can see everything but if you want to get details you have to land your chopper and get more information so who's the chef who's going to read the first page number 463 of the book okay page so i have to relay what he says because he doesn't have a microphone and the video there will not be enough sound so page 4 600 463 uh chapter 34 which is catabol your book of sales or bargains yes you read the english for me the arabic i don't think we need to read the arabic because i might as well read it in french funny what's the point i have my notes in arabic because i depend on arabic but i need someone to read the english because i'm very slow in reading english i don't read english at all so that's why i prefer to hear it from someone else you did not read the ayah the introduction of the the chapter in english the book of sales bargains chapter one what has come in the statement of allah meaning then when the juha salah prayer is finished you may disperse through the land and seek the bounty of allah by working etc and remember allah much that you may be successful okay hadith number 984 narrated when we came to al-madinah as immigrants allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi sallam established a bond of brotherhood between me and sad okay so i think we should dissect instead of reading the whole thing and then coming back to it again when the migrants from makkah went to medina they left behind their properties their wealth and some of them their families so the prophet ali-salism established a bond of brotherhood so each one from the migrants was allocated to one from the ansar the people of medina and in the beginning this bond meant that they are brothers so if one of them died the other one would inherit him until the abrogation in chapter eight surat al-anfal at the end where allah says this is no longer only kinship inherit one another and such a bond is found but there is no inheritance between them so the prophet haslam allocated this companion to this companion this companion to this companion abdulrahman alf who is one of the ten heaven bound which ranks him at the very top of the companions as we know the top companions are four and they are from the four from the ten heaven bound then there are the six then we look at the people of badr then we look at this etc there are means and ways of differentiating between the companions so abdul rahman ibn alf holds one of the highest ranks he was made a brother of saad ibn rabir and sad abner is a wise man he knows who to allocate who abdulrahman of was known to be a an excellent businessman and we will come to see that he would not the prophet put him along with a farmer or with a beggar or with someone who had no money because he had to put him it was someone in the same social and financial status so he allocated him to one of the millionaires of medina what had hap what happened said to me i am the richest among the ansar so i'll give you half of my wealth and you may look at my two wives and whichever of the two you may choose i will divorce her and when she has completed the prescribed period before marriage you may marry her so this is what is astonishing now this is an assignment sad take abdulrahman as your brother okay hello brother how are you you may live in the guest room and i will bring you breakfast lunch and dinner if you need some money i will lend you i will give you no no no so i did not do this he did not say okay here's ten thousand dollars no he said i am amongst the richest in medina and this is half of my fortune yours now this is crazy i have two cars actually i have three alhamdulillah and if someone would to be my brother i would give him a car and a half i'll give him a bicycle even a bicycle you return it tomorrow huh this is outstanding something we cannot comprehend nowadays to declare your wealth to someone who's a total stranger not from even your country he's an expat he's from mecca and you say to him this is my financial statement half of it is yours okay if you're a multi-millionaire if you're elon musk what does half of it mean nothing but to come and say i have two wives look at whom you think is more desirable to you i will divorce her after the waiting period you can marry her this is also outrageous to us one or specially feminists who are watching this i hope you edit it huh uh i'll wait for your hate mails i it's okay uh feminists would say oh this is unfair she's not a property she is not something to sell and buy how does he do this how does he contribute think sadhna rabir is not one of the 10 heaven bound which in ranking means he's way low lower than abdulrahman he preferred for his two wives to choose a better man than him and he wants for his beloved wife to be with someone who is much better than him for fulfilling what the prophet instructed isaiah and also for getting reward not that he doesn't like his wives so he gave him the choice and we cannot understand this it's way above our pay grade but look at how this and i would not i don't have the time to go and tell you how sad died this is not our uh place what did abdulrahman respond to this generous offer if someone of you come to me and say this is my bank account have have half of it i say yeah yeah you're embarrassing me i would say this huh i would have no hesitation something coming to me from allah how would he not be normal if i say i don't want it but why is he one of the 10 heaven bound this is his response replied i am not in need of all that is there any marketplace where trade is practiced okay this is why the hadith is mentioned first of all here it says i don't need any of those in another narration also in bukhari says and in your wives i have no need for that no desire for that but is there any marketplace where people trade this is my craft if he was a carpenter he would have said is there any place where people do cupboards and something i want to go and practice my my craft so he's asking about a place where businessmen could practice what they know best so what did sad say replied the market of what is and then we have haibar where a collection of these tribes may have lived in so this shows you that the minorities usually have a very good financial status anywhere in the world so when you have a minority community they collaborate together they start to help one another and they rise to be an influential financial power this is how the jews have been dominating the markets forever this is how they work of course in addition to their ability to consume haram which is a hindrance to us muslims we can be richer than them but we always have restrictions no bribes no riba no haram embezzlement etc which is a favor and blessing of allah which shows you which religion is closer to allah azzawajal so he directed him to the market of the jews went to that market the following day and brought some dried buttermilk yogurt and ghee and then he continued going there regularly so he brought these raw materials yogurt dried yogurt white substance that they can travel and eat from it it's not very delicious is it it's a little bit sour but it gives you energy and it's dry you can travel with it and ghee and these things are any hot items to sell in corona all places went down and lost businesses except restaurants deliveries that everybody needs to eat mashallah kuwait everybody eats whenever i go to a restaurant it's fully packed guys don't you have any forms of entertainment other than eating so but so he went with this little amount and started to trade a few days later abdulrahman came having traces of yellow scent on his body this yellow scent is saffron and this is usually worn when you are a little bit rich or got married it's it's a trace of any uh prosperity in a form so he came to the prophet salam with this traces on him asked him whether he had got married he replied in the affirmative the prophet sallallahu assalam said whom have you married he replied a woman from the ansah then the prophet sallallahu salaam asked how much did you pay her he replied i gave her i gave her a gold piece equal in weight to a date stone or a dead stone of gold the okay so this chapter deals with the ayah now remember why is sahih al-bukhari so important in our lives number one because the vast majority of scholars and ummah of the islam they agree that this is the most authentic book after the quran so whomever comes to try and discredit sahih bukhari you know that he has signs of hypocrisy because if i want to undermine islam what should i do speak about xyz no speak about the quran and try to discredit it but we know that no one can do no one can do this because allah protected it and it's the challenge is from here till the day of judgment so step two try to discredit the sunnah how to do that either speak ill about the companions speak ill about ali speak ill about speak ill about say bad things about them the moment you do this it means that whatever they narrated is questionable so you've dismantled the sunnah if you can't speak about the companions speak about the way the hadith was collected and you say that no no we believe only in the quran the sunnah there might be authentic they might be weak maybe one of the narrators was asleep maybe he saw this in a dream you try to do whatever and one of the ways of also dismantling and destroying the sunnah of is to speak about the hadiths themselves this is not logical this is this and this is that this is why scholars always praise sahih al-bukhari and think highly of it and consider anyone to speak ill about it to be a hypocrite where does the power of al-bukhari in the sahe lie scholars say in the headlines in the titles of the chapters they say that this his in it and we will come to see this so he started with an ayah for either about friday prayer allah says when the prayer is over then spread and seek from allah's bounties through what through trade through work the vast majority of us go eat and sleep the muslims on a friday they used to go to the sukh after the friday prayer and do some transactions and this is why one of the companions is named iraq ibn malik may allah be pleased with him if he prayed juwah he would stand at the door of the masjid and says oh allah i've responded to your call meaning the friday prayer and i prayed your prayer and now i'm spreading on the earth seeking your bounty so please provide for me and give me provision as you've promised and he would go and seek so this is why the bukhari only use this as a title for this first chapter a verse of the quran indicating that it is permissible to trade specifically after a time of prohibition what do we mean by a time of prohibition before the jumwa after the call of adhan which precedes the imam saying assalamu alaykum here it's a time of prohibition any transaction that happens is void okay but i bought this bottle after the adhan it's void return it back collect your money afterwards repent to allah then you can buy it again and a lot of the muslims don't know this so this is why al-imam al-bukhari brought this a title for this chapter brought this hadith to indicate that dealing and buying and selling like abdulrahman did is a legitimate thing because anyone would say where is that of selling and buying is is permissible you bring him the ayah it makes you or asks you to go and you bring him the hadith he is the one who asked where the market is and went and sold and bought and the prophet approved his actions okay chapter two legal and illegal things are clearly defined and if we in between them are some doubtful unclear things so this title is based on a hadith every one of you know the hadith and this hadith is an important concept of islam to the extent that imam ahmad imam shafiri and other great imams of islam said islam revolves around three and some say four hadiths we will mention the three which they agree upon hadith number one deeds are judged by intention this is one of the hadiths that all rulings of islam revolve around in our religion what's not part of it it is rejected this is hadith the first one is hadith third one is hadith of a man even bashir of nisad may i'll be pleased with a man with his father so this is the third hadith it has many different narrations and this is one of them yes number 985 narrated both legal and illegal things are obvious and in between them are unclear doubtful matters okay both he the translator sometime makes mistakes and they translate according to what they think is it legal and illegal there are so many legal things that are haram in our religion so this is not an islamic terminology legal and illegal you should say permissible things are obvious and clear and prohibited things are obvious and clear this is the right terminology and this is why we always reiterate learn arabic if you don't know arabic you cannot become a rule a true full-fledged student of knowledge your knowledge would be superficial like the cream over a cappuccino it's superficial you need to know arabic why once i was 15 years ago i was doing something for kalima in dubai it's an um there is kalima and there is a manara i think or something like that two dawa centers and i was doing for them a course on preparation of the funeral from before the man dies we kill him for he died naturally but yeah and how we wash him shroud him in the salat of jannah's everything while i was doing my preparation i came across a hadith so in order to translate the hadith i it's best for me to go to islam q a and look for the hadith in arabic and go for the translation i don't need to reinvent the wheel one of the hadiths i found an article written by an american imam of a masjid and the article was good the site was good so i read the article article and the man was translating the hadith seven other than those martyred in the battlefield on the battlefield are considered martyrs so the one who dies in a collapsed building the one who does dies by drowning the one who dies by um a stabbing a stab by by stabbing says it oops stabbing i'm an arab i've never heard this so i went and gave it a couple of seconds why do you translate this stab in arabic is pan someone who's stabbed is mataroon which is a hadith but matron also means the person who dies through the plague so the guy was reading is so stabbed okay stopped so imagine if i read this translation i'm a student of knowledge and i'm in new york and a brother comes to me give me a wallet i'm gonna kill you he said he has a knife is it alhamdulillah come on come on make it quick here please what are you doing he said i'll be one of the martyrs no no no stupid give him the wallet and go in peace this was referring to the plague so the translation counts you have to know is it a valid and trustworthy or not otherwise you'll bring catastrophe to yourself so any this is an incentive an encouragement you are in an arab country living here for 10 20 years and don't speak arabic i know that challenges because every time you speak to me as a native i'll reply to you in english i want to practice my english so you find it easy so you're speaking english no insist on speaking arabic i will speak to you in arabic but when you always speak in english you will never ever learn arabic so put it in your mind that every time i speak i have to do it in arabic"
