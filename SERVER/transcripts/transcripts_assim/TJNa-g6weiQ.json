  "title": "Repeated Mistakes in Prostration in Forgetfulness sujood as sahu?",
  "transcript": "muhammad from pakistan sometimes i make mistake in siddha sahib and i do another suggestion for that and sometimes i again make a mistake and do another third one in the same prayer so is this permissible what is the ruling if if someone makes a mistake during siddhasaf he already or she may already have done mistakes in the prayer and then that person is doing good i will answer inshallah muhammad from pakistan he said he committed a mistake in the prostration of forgetfulness once and then he offered another prostrations and he made a mistake and he ah you're playing and if you were not ignorant of the ruling i would have said this nullifies your prayer because this is not the format of prayer that the prophet taught us allah therefore what should i do nothing if you made a mistake in the prostration of forgetfulness move on do that to two prostrations with the mistake and move on and don't repeat it again"
