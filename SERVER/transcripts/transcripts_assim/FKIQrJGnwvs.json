  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Pakistan my question \nis about jalsatul istiraaha about what   when we get up from rukoo' okay yes and my \nquestion is then when should we say Allah Akbar   when we are getting up from the sujood or when we \nare getting up from jalsatul istiraaha position   I have my own opinion in this regards \nand this is my own opinion and that is the short pause where you sit when you rise from \nthe second sujood of your first raka to the second   raka or from your third raka to your fourth raka \nso when I Rise Up from sujud I pause by sitting   down and then I stand up again and this is back \nby the Hadith of Malik may Allah be pleased with   him when he prayed in front of his companions \nto teach them how the prophet Allah used to pray   and none of the companions or his friends or \nuh the contemporaries of the Prophet (Peace and   Blessings Upon him) commended by saying No this \nis wrong and the Hadith is in al-bukhari so it's   the highest grade of uh authentic Hadith and this \nis in the Shaafi'i part of the recommended Sunnah   and uh Sheikh Al-Albani also recommends it and \nSheikh Ibn Baz says that if you do it it's good   if you don't do it it's okay as well so when \ndoes a person offer takabir if you're alone   or you are praying behind an Imam once you rise \nfrom the second sujood you say Allahu Akbar you   pause a little bit and you stand up there's \nno problem in that because nobody's following   you if you are the Imam this becomes problematic \nbecause a lot of the Muslims don't know the Sunnah   so if you say well sujud and you rise and say \nAllahu Akbar and you sit everybody behind you   would say subhanallah subhanallah thinking \nthat yours you're mistaken and you're sitting   for the tashaud not knowing that you're \na couple of seconds You're Gonna Stand Up   to avoid confusion it's best that you rise \nup sit and while you're standing from this   sitting position you say Allahu Akbar \nand everything goes normally inshallah and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
