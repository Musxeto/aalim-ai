  "transcript": "sister shaheen from the uk my other question is uh who do we need to give god zakat can we give it to our brother our own real sisters first or um or shall we give it to people like these people in german syria sharm you know and philippine who are suffering more than where our brothers and sisters are suffering from okay i will answer the question now her second question and as a correction it's not a policy of that tv not to allow more than one question it's my policy because it's my program on that tv that i only take one question to leave the space for the other viewers to ask as many as they can this is why we take usually 21 questions on average in huda they have no such rules or ceilings so that's why i'm taking it question by question i'm taking my time answering the questions and i hope that they're used to this way of of uh process and and and they're not frustrated by it with the so her second question is to whom should we give zakat there are eight categories mentioned in verse 60 in surah chapter 9 where allah azza tells us to whom zakat should be given and the first two are for evil the poor and the needy so these classifications poor a person who cannot find enough so if he has lunch he doesn't have dinner and if he has dinner he doesn't have breakfast really poor rock bottom poor someone who's a little bit better who has three meals who has a roof on his head who maybe has a car and a job but it does not suffice till the end of the month despite his good salary due to his large family not being extravagant or wasteful in expenditures rather when it's in the middle of the month the salary is gone and he starts asking people for loans this is a miskin needy or someone whose salary is good but his father has cancer and he cannot have any savings or property or wealth to pay for the chemotherapy the radiation and the whole nine yards so he starts to borrow and ask people zakat is permissible to give or someone who has children doesn't have the money to pay for their tuition to school buying them clothes to go to school having a car doesn't have the money to fix the car so this is not extravagant he's not poor alhamdulillah he's earning but he doesn't have what suffice the other one doesn't have anything this one has but it does not suffice you can give them the zakat so what about my sister my siblings if you're not inheriting them and they're not inheriting you if one of you dies and they are fulfilling the criteria and they fit the conditions and the labeling of poor or needy definitely you get double the reward the reward of charity of zakat and the the reward of connecting to your kinship and allah azza knows you"
