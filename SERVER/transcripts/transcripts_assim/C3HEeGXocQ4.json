  "transcript": "uh sister NADA is asking about uh parents when they have an insurance policy over you whether it's life insurance or educational insurance or whatever insurance they have and she's asking what to do with such uh an insurance policy what happens if I die should I tell them to destroy the money you can send the money over to Huda TV inshallah and they'll make a benefit of of it first of all seriously speaking insurance is not permissible in Islam and unless it is uh uh Cooperative Insurance with a very strict set of conditions not anyone that says I'm an Islamic insurance company we are Cooperative so let's go with it no there there are a number of uh uh strict conditions to ensure that these people are walking the talk and they're they're not just bluffing secondly if your parents do this insurance policy without your approval then you have no burden on that you have no sin on that so even if you write in the will that if I die let the million dollars be spent on on charity give it to Huda TV for example even if you write this they are not com uh compelled and and they're not forced to do this because they're not going to listen to your will to begin with the money is not yours so what you should do now as you are alive alham you should advise them and you should tell them to trust Allah and to put their confidence and dependence and Reliance only on Allah and not on an insurance policy money comes and goes but faith and IM and belief in Allah asael can be only granted to Those whom Allah asael loves and to Those whom Allah asael uh uh supports"
