  "title": "Is imagining Allah Kufr? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "We have Afzan on the line. Afzan from India. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam to Allah. Is imagining image of Allah and worshipping it Kufr without thinking that it is Allah since Allah cannot be imagined? Yes of course it is Kufr. To imagine Allah Azza Wa Jal and have any image and thinking that this is Allah is Kufr. No one in his right mind would ever do such a thing. Allah says in the Quran, لَيْسَكَ مِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ There is nothing like unto Allah Azza Wa Jal. So whatever you can imagine, this image is not Allah. Nothing can simulate or be like Allah Azza Wa Jal at all. It cannot even cross your mind. So you have to block this so you don't go into that dungeon."
