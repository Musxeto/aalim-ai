  "transcript": "Hamner says having dogs is haram as a pet but is it allowed to be a vet araignee a veterinarian I think this is what they call a vet and check a dog and touch it - yes a dog is a an animal it's a living creature and we are told that a prostitute was forgiven all of her sins just because she provided drinking water to a thirsty dog so being kind to dogs has nothing to do with having them as pets keeping them as pets is totally prohibited it deducts from your good deeds the weight of one carrot which is equivalent to the mountain of a hood of good deeds just because you have what a dog and this is every single day but to be a vet and people bring their dogs and you look whether they need vaccinations or they need any medical assistance and you provide this this is totally legit and pro hit and impermissible there's nothing wrong in that Sharla"
