  "transcript": "accept our fasting our prayers our dua and all our good deeds that we have delivered to allah azzawajal for his sake hoping that our these are sincere anticipating the reward from allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala in this blessed month of ramadan tonight is the night of reed after the sunset of the last day of ramadan muslims celebrate express the jubilation and happiness for this entire event of aid until the sunset of the day of eid where it all ends this day is a day of expressing our happiness it's a day of celebrating the conclusion of the blessed month of ramadan it's a day which islam has given us a number of rituals to conclude the month of ramadan with and to begin a new era in our lives we usually congratulate one another by saying and may allah make this a blessed aid for the whole entire ummah of islam we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back today i'm going to talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam reminded us through his guidance and example that islam is complete submission to the will of allah for one who submits a mere declaration or display of belief will not be taken for success but his or her heart and soul will certainly be put to test allah tested the prophet of allah severely in order that he salallahu alaihi wasallam becomes an example for his companions to follow similarly he tests the believer to see whether he lives a righteous life in accordance with the instructions and commands set by allah all lives according to what his desires dictate whether the faith he displays is firmly rooted in his heart or is it merely on the surface he will be tested to see whether he will continue to have faith and love of allah when in a calamity as he does when in comfort whether he will continue to remember and worship him if given bounties and comforts of life as he does when he lives a modest life allah will undoubtedly test him to see if his faith trust and love of him is unconditional or is it conditioned upon good health and a comfortable life free from stress and anxiety the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam showed us through his own example that for a righteous muslim this life is a testing ground where he will continue to be tested until he meets allah for him tests will be conducted on earth while he lives and not after he dies he knows that as soon as death arrives and he steps into the next world his tests are over there he only receives the result of his tests and enjoys the fruits of the deeds that he committed during a short span of time called life and welcome back as we've said allah azzawajal has mandated rituals at the end of ramadan as a form of betting ramadan farewell as a form of what a sunnah prayer does to the fart where it completes whatever short flaws were there in the fart likewise this is something that islam mandated upon the muslims in the end of the month of ramadan as a conclusion among these rituals is what is known as zakatul zakat is one of the pillars of islam but this is specific this is zakat al-futtur filter is when you break your fast and this is what we call al-iftar when you break your fast when you eat the first meal of the day it's called so the cattle filter is something related to breaking your fast and this is what allah azza has mandated upon us at the end of the month of ramadan why was it prescribed it was prescribed for two reasons one that it is a means of purification for whatever shortcomings we had during our fasting and to whatever bad things we've said so as an expiation we are to give this zakat to erase and expiate what had happened second reason is that the day of eid is a day of celebration and jubilation so it is inappropriate for the poor and we mean by the poor the really poor who don't have a thing it's inappropriate for them to go and beg people for lunch or for dinner on that day therefore islam mandates that we give a certain amount of food so that on that day they would not need to ask anyone or to beg anyone for it so what is the qatar future the cattle footer mandated by the prophet alaihis to be given a particular sar one sar tsar is a means of measurement by size not by weight so it's a vessel or a container and this container carries four mud this is a mud if i take a scoop with my two hands this is one mud so i put four of them fill them up four of them would make a sar and people's hands very if i was in the nba my side would probably be a lot and if i were from the far east then my hands would be so tiny no it's the average height and size of a person and this saw has to be from what is commonly consumed by the people so usually it is given out of dates wheat barley beans corn macaroni whatever people eat and you have to pay attention that the weight differs so one song of dates is different than one slaw of wheat or of macaroni or etc so the size is what matters not the weight and i have to give it out on behalf of myself and those whom i'm providing for providing that they're muslims so whether a slave or a free man a boy or a girl a male or a female old or young i provide for them they then i have to give zakat on their behalf and usually in in some cultures the father keeps on giving the cattle futor on behalf of his children even if they're earning and they've left to live somewhere else and this is permissible only if they authorize you so if my son or my daughter have moved out and i want to give the cattle photo every year as usual i have to take their permission son listen i'm i'm giving zakatos on behalf of you and your wife and children if he says okay dad no problem this is permissible and as in the hadith of the hadith of umar ibn umar may allah be pleased with them all the prophets specifically indicated that it has to be food and he gave categories of food and the value of each sar differs from one another this is what called the vast majority of schools of thought and scholars to state that it is not permissible to give it in cash it has to be given in actual food items and it cannot be given in cash if it's given in cash to the poor it is invalid because the value differs and because the prophet had money at his time yet he ordered the companions to give it in food so unlike what imam abu hanifa says the vast majority of scholars say you have to give it in food now there's no problem in authorizing an agency an institution a charity organization an individual etc there's no problem for me to authorize them by giving them the money in their hands and saying to them you have to give it to the poor in food so you buy food and give it to them no problem in that and when to give it out to the poor there is a time of permissibility and there is a time of recommendation the time of recommendation is just before the eighth prayer the eighth prayer is done after sunrise on the first day of shawwal so just before that between the sunset of the last day of ramadan till the eighth prayer this all time the whole time is approximately 12 hours a little bit less is sufficient for you to give your zakatel this is a recommendation sometimes due to big metropolitan cities you won't be able to know where the poor is so you may need a little bit more time there's no problem in giving it out a day or two like ibn um pleased with him and with his father used to do so a couple of days before eight you can give it to the poor without any problem inshaallah do i have to have a certain threshold to qualify to give zakat no if i have my food for today to most of us this seems that come on we have food for six months in advance yeah but this is what the norm was at the time of the prophet people only had the food of today so if you have your food and your family's food for today and extra that suffices to give zakat then you have to give zakat if you only have your food for today you're not obliged to give zakat so if i'm stoned broke and i have only what suffices me for today and tomorrow give zakat but then i won't have food for tomorrow don't worry for the likes of you others will give you zakat and there's no problem in a group of people a family of 10 giving there's a cat of 10 people to one individual or there's a cat of one individual giving it to a family of five or ten or fifteen there's no problem in that and if you add a little bit more there's no problem in that either this is in a nutshell what zakatl footer is now can i give it on behalf of non-muslims no do i have to give it on behalf of my maids and drivers and workers no because i don't have to provide for them i give them salaries but if i want to do it as a form of charity there's no problem do i have to give it on behalf of my uh pregnant wife the wife yes the pregnancy no it's not mandatory but if you do it then this is recommended as per uthman may allah be pleased with him he recommended that but it's not mandatory at all and do i give it to a specific individual the answer is yes you give it to the poor and the needy only don't make the same mistake that lots of us do when they select their relatives and loved ones and friends and neighbors and they give them the zakat when actually they're not needy or poor this is not permissible and it doesn't count what happens if i was late in giving it so i went for i eat prayer and the time is up what can i do there is nothing for you to do because you're sinful you have delayed it after it's due time ask allah for forgiveness and repent so do i give it the answer is yes this is the right of the poor even if you're sinful you can't just say okay time's up i'm not gonna pay it no it's mandatory upon you to still pay it and give it to the poor we have a lot of rulings concerning salatul eid and this is another ritual that we have to talk about but our time is very limited maybe inshallah when we get our guests online and talk to them maybe we will touch base on some of these issues we have sheikh ahmed even saifuddin with us after the break so stay tuned is upon and all his team members a little bit here in canada is not much different compared to anywhere else around the world our aids celebration starts right after playing the fajr prayer because many of us do not sleep because of the excitement of any as the day progresses we prepare ourselves by trying to follow the sunnah of our beloved prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam as best as we can we take a russell we use them as miswak if that's possible we put on we put on the best clothing that we have and we use fragrances for the brothers and we go to the masjid and we greet other muslims who are there and we pray that sola after praying the eighth salah we visit our friends and relatives and celebrate eat with them and enjoy all the delicious food they might have prepared for us as i talk about food we should not forget the poor and the needy especially among our own relatives who might need our support to enjoy that day like we might be enjoying it so my message is to follow the sunnah of our beloved prophet muhammad in every aspect of celebrating every day and to enjoy your eighth day no matter what kind of situation you might be in because that is the sunnah of our beloved prophet muhammad hopefully with us online is dr ahmed ibn safadeen a dear brother a beloved friend and one of the people we look up to a great scholar and a wise man who we seek knowledge and wisdom from here with us all the way in sha allah from riyadh hopefully if not from mecca if not from medina as he is a frequent traveler with us to share his thoughts about this beautiful event that comes once every year after the month of ramadan foreign accepts from you and us the deeds that we have presented prayers fastings dua and everything else what do you have to share with us about this beautiful event that we are about to witness in sha allah and i think the introduction you made today [Music] really applies to you rather than me you're in the beginning i'd love to pass the greeting and congratulations to all muslims uh on this great event on this occasion and obviously i think we're all so thrilled to receive this occasion and to witness by the grace of allah all what is normally done on the day of let me remind myself and all the brothers and sisters who are watching right now that indeed means something that comes time after time so it is from yarudu coming up time after time and as you already uh said in your introduction that eighth comes only once a year yes there are two or eight in islam and they're all they both came who are sorry they both come after great events comes after ramadan and in particular the last 10 days of ramadan where there is laylatul which is greater than a thousand south thousand months in in terms of uh uh honor in terms of rewards in terms of uh blessing by the grace of allah also is after 10 days or in you know on the completion of the 10 days of this and these 10 days are the best days of time ever so subhanallah it reminds you that you are so immersed in ibadah while you are an aide sometimes the idea comes to mind that which is a time of celebration and joy is just to feel free and and uh not tied to to anything you can you can do anything you want you can go back to uh whatever you were doing before evada while you were in these uh days before eve you're so much engaged in ibadah so i think this is a reminder for us that's why we we start on the day of eight by offering salah today and then we listen to khutbah and uh stay on the same path that we uh we were practicing before eight it's a reminder for us uh but in the meantime of course is a time for joy a time for uh strengthening relationships with uh your your family your parents that they are still alive uh and and uh your children your relatives um even your uh uh you know the people that you have you have ties with of any kind and then at the same time of course to show the happiness and uh the greatness of the day of ease showing all muslims masha'allah being uh praying together filling the streets uh dressing in the best uh you know uh dress dresses they they they uh they would have um so all of these things uh come on the day of read and i i think we can we can um we can say so much about uh the meaning of eight if i may interrupt you now we know that all nations celebrate their own feasts whether it's religiously like christmas uh new well not new year's uh easter and and the likes or if it is something related to their worldly affairs such as the beginning of the year or a new season or the independence day etc so they all have their feasts but when we come to speak about our reeds is the concept of reed related to religion or it's just a cultural thing well that's that's that's the point uh obviously it's so uh clear that in islam you are in fact uh affirming the religiosity if you will of faith by offering the salah in the beginning by uh all three defending hands of generosity uh to to muslims around you to really uh visit those that kantan has passed without seeing them it is time to visit them it is time to renew your relationships with uh with your developers and in particular into to the muslim community to your neighbors to uh uh people that you you remember uh on the day of eight so it has a strong meaning it is so tied to the concept of the worship of allah that's why i see that the real joy on the day of eid is for those who have done well in the preceding days of haiti you know uh if you do well in ramadan if you did well on ramadan then obviously you would enjoy uh the day of adulthood if you uh did well preceding the uh the day of uh like in the in the uh first ten days of the headline then obviously you really enjoy you know you deserve you deserve the celebration you see in the hadith uh the angels would come uh sitting on the on the doors of uh of masjid or the gathering place of musa on the day of and they would distribute prizes so this is the day of distributing prizes what are these prizes for just like we are getting gifts and and you know uh children are get so happy when they uh receive prizes uh and uh and gifts from from their parents or uh elders well we are just like uh having the same concept same idea but we don't see it but we feel it and uh we should have it in mind that people on the day of haiti in fact get prizes so you'd be wondering who's who's the winner on the day of eight after you did well um one other concept check out if i may yes sir regarding the uh celebration of aid some people think that they can get out of the normal they can go and and and do whatever that they like and they if they stopped uh listening to music for example if they did not mix uh like uh having men and women uh uh on in in the same place who are not uh to them then you know on the day really say well well take it easy it's a day for eating it's a celebration even if somebody keeps his beard during some time and then finally on the day of read they go and shake their their beards saying that we need to look nice well you look nice when you're on the worship of elijah remember that you need to enjoy what has been given to you by allah and there are so many good things in life there are so many good things to to enjoy and celebrate not but by you know disobedience but rather by obedience to allah and and yeah i wish we could have a longer session with you because seven minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes is not sufficient we need to dedicate more and more for these powerful messages but if i make summarize what you've said is the day of eight is not the day you are set off your prison so it is not that you were in a whole month of ramadan imprisoned and now on the day of eid everything becomes halal you go rogue you go do whatever you want of sins no this is the result of your tests if you manage to maintain the piety and righteousness you succeeded in maintaining in ramadan afterwards this means that allah has accepted you if not then may allah azzawajal have forgiveness am i observing it correctly yes indeed indeed and uh you know there's a famous saying of ourselves [Music] accepted then you're continuing with the good deeds and if they're uh turned down rejected they're not accepted then actually you get involved in uh misdeeds so that's why we always need to keep on the same track but at the same time enjoy the celebration know that uh you glorify a mosque you enjoy relations you you do not eat it's it's prohibited for you to uh fast on the day of eight because it's a day of celebration the day of enjoyment the day of eating and enjoying with the family uh the community and the whole muslim ummah for these beneficial and wise words and i pray to allah azzawajal that he makes you myself and our viewers steadfast on doing good deeds till the day we die and we meet him subhanahu wata'ala when he is pleased with us may allah make this a blessed aid upon you your uh honored family and loved ones and the entire muslim ummah and hope to see you safe and sound and well soon be it we have a short break a little bit longer than a short break but stay with us and we'll be right back talk about allah today my brothers and sisters is the blessed day of leed it is one of the two elites of muslims i congratulate all brothers and sisters across the globe on this blessed day we usually visit our relatives in the evening and have some biryani and fun don't hold grudges on this day forgive your brothers and sisters shortcomings and invite them over to your house my advice to you would be beware the altean have been released from the chains now they're going to tempt you towards sins avoid free mixing how many muslims worship allah very very well in the whole month of ramadan and when eid comes they indulge in all types of sins may allah protect us also don't put an end to the good deeds that you are doing for the past month don't abandon the salah don't abandon the quran after ramadan it is very important i ask allah and pray that he allows us to see more ramadans allah and welcome back with us on zoom dr ahmed ethekafi and you all know him he is our beloved sheikh who teaches us arabic and simplifies it for us which is the language of the quran and his task is one of the greatest tasks ever that simplifies for non-arabs how to read arabic how to learn arabic and imagine all the reward that he's getting just because he's teaching people how to read the quran to understand the quran to understand the sunnah by teaching the arabic what a simple but honorable deed at the side of allah so with us through zoom dr assalam alaikum allah during the month of ramadan and may allah make this a blessed aid upon the muslim ummah and yourself and your honorable family we have very little time because we have another live program afterwards but in a as much as you can squeeze what do you have to say to us about this beautiful occasion of eight by information by hell really the occasion of comes after the holy month of ramadan and this month is let's say average month for all muslim around the earth and they mashallah doing many things in this ramadan fasting praying doing everything after that allah gives them some kind of prize as a is that we can say this is the readal filter this is gives them the hair this gives them the reward after what they are did in ramadan for fasting and others subhanallah every nation every people in this earth they have a hobby of this aid they have happy of gathering with their family they have happy what they are did in this special occasion like al-fateh yes so in in this beautiful event do you see forms or signs of a shortcomings and flaws that as muslims we are contradicting ourselves in the sense that after a whole month of ibadah of worshiping allah of dedicating ourselves to prayers reading the quran all of a sudden the whole month is it possible that it evaporates and we engage on the day of eid immediately after all of this goodness engage in extravagance in free mixing in listening to haram in watching haram in sins openly does this reflect something uh really my brother i think muslim should take a class and listen from them let's say the school of ramadan because masala ramadan we are controlling in say bad thing we are controlling we watch something is not good we are controlling with without anger with uh with people so subhanallah in a whole month of ramadan we have take a lot of lessons from this month i hope inshallah when it comes after ramadan we are keep on and grow develop in that and grow up spread the happy and the smiles after ramadan should be continued more and more allah not only in ramadan allah all in the month of islam he comes and rajab comes in in every month so we need inshaallah encourage ourselves first of all encourage myself and others of my brother and sister islam encourage ourselves to read quran more to do more to polite people to do care for others insha allah my brother and as i began my introduction i pray to allah that he grants you and your honorable family and the whole ummah of islam a blessed and honored and a happy read for us all right for you and i think we don't have a time time for break but we have with us our honorable sheikh and um brother and friend and colleague dr muhammad salah the well-known dari who is found on most satellite channels islamic salon channels he's known for his dawah all over the world and his fatwas his words of wisdom are also a treat of his and a trademark uh i as i got to learn from the control room we need one one minute uh for sheikh salah muhammad allah to join us meanwhile i'd like to uh recap on some of the issues that we have to adhere to and that is there are a number of sunnahs that we do when it comes to aid prayer and this is a ritual that's an issue of dispute among scholars whether it's mandatory or highly recommended either way it's something that the prophet used to do so we should keep on reviving the sunnah and doing it so this ritual involves a lot of sunan such as takbir since or after the sunset of the last day of ramadan we say takbir and repeatedly saying it until the eid prayer we say keep repeating it and raising our voices the whole community says the takbir in order to announce the jubilation and happiness with reed before going to the aid prayer we eat dates to announce that we're not fasting and we take it in odd numbers three five seven it's recommended to have a full hustle and this is a recommendation and to wear the best of clothes when you go and wear perfume this is for men of course and to walk to the musa if it's possible if not then to drive but it's best to walk and to switch ways so the way you go to the sallah when you come back you change your route and to express your happiness and to greet the muslims by saying and to also take the whole family with you to the musa to witness this event all of this is an indication of how beautiful and how important the eid celebration is as a ritual as a form of we're not doing it as a cultural thing rather because it is a form of ibadah now joining us through zoom from the holy lands from mecca our honorable brother and friend and may allah make this event of read a blessed event for you and your honorable family and the whole muslim ummah muhammad sheikh muhammad to you and to your viewers it is always good to hear from you i mean you are making the screen of uh uh zad illuminating masha'allah with your kind and and beautiful face and alhamdulillah we're blessed to have you with us to share with us in the coming five minutes uh because we have a live show unfortunately it's not sufficient we need more time with you and the honorable guests before you to express some of the wisdom that you have about the aid the jubilation and happiness and some of the messages you would like to deliver so the floor is yours it comes to crown always an act of worship a great act of worship so we have two aides annually enable up it is to celebrate breaking our past after completing a beautiful course of fasting and not only fasting and not only of praying and giving any charity but also upholding the ties of kinship getting closer and closer to allah remitting loads and loads of our sins so it comes as a gift from the almighty allah and if we look into the ayah ayah number 185 chapter number two in which the almighty allah says and then he says if one is sick if one if troubling then you simply skip fasting because of or due to sickness due to troubling provided that don't mean i am in but you will have to make up those days after ramadan when you recover when you become a resident and then he says is an opportunity to do couple things to glorify the almighty allah for heaven guiding us for this blessing for remitting our sins for bringing us closer and closer to him for increasing the level of our iman for granting us this great gift of enabling us to pass during the months of ramadan in addition to rewarding us this magnificent word of the gate of and on every single night of it allah almighty have released many many of his servants from hellfire we ask almighty allah to be among them so in order [Music] so this is one of the means of being grateful to allah to celebrate aid the way that he wanted us to celebrate him to thank him by obeying him he does not mean by any means that hey it is over fasting is over good deeds are over and now it is time to break our fast and our covenant with allah and to be on the rules no after 30 days now we have tasted the sweetness of image now we have tasted the beauty of abstaining from sins you've broken the handcuffs and the chains that they were training you of sinning of sitting before the screen watching what allah is forbidding of wasting your time unnecessarily chit-chatting and vain talk no time our life span is very limited and we need to acquire as much possible as kind of as you can of the good deeds in order to be eligible in order to keep our skills of good deeds on the day of judgment heavy in order to enjoy the present life in paradise because of that if someone and i'm not being advocate of the devil but if someone says come on for 30 days i've been locked in my masjid fasting reading the quran and now you say read is a day of jubilation and happiness where is the happiness you're still telling me to confine myself is is this true we don't have happiness on it i can assure you unfortunately whoever utters this statement has not yet benefited with the 30 days course those who have benefited of the month of ramadan they would wish and they would love that ramadan will continue forever because it restrained us from sinning and it restrained us and it broke us loose from the chains of waste in our lifetime addiction exactly addiction of whatever sort of addiction and also a lot of friends and family members whom we have not been talking to ramadan was the opportunity to uphold the ties of kinship and the friendship and so on so it's so it's all beautiful so allah doesn't say that um you know you don't have the right to have fun or laugh or enjoy your life as a matter of fact from the sunnah we know that the prophet salallahu salaam used to save a beautiful white club especially for the 18 so it is highly recommended to wear the best of your clothes and to wear the best of your perfume and to distribute the heat gifts and exchange gifts pick up the phone if relatives and friends are not nearby and wish them a happy and blessed you know one of the beautiful traditions in in in the eighth prior house is that you go from one route and when you come back walking you take a different route why in order to meet a larger number of people as many people as possible so that you wish each other what happy and blessed and may allah accept our fasting it is an invitation to reconnect to reconcile and to crown our fasting and our worship with the greatest means of being grateful to allah by saying practically not just verbally thank you allah for giving us this opportunity it's not us it is not an opportunity to sin and get lose from goodness into evil god forbid and it is also halal during ramadan not only in the eid but what i mean is enjoy your life in briefly i know your time is very short and you're running out of time if we scrutinize the quran from cover to cover how many times allah said it is haram it has been made forbidden it is forbidden a few times everything in life is permissible except a handful of things pertaining to eat and food consumption pertaining to sexual relations you know enjoy getting intimate with your spouse or spouses with regards to earning uh every business transaction is beautifully lawful except do not deal with usury do not steal do not achieve people and so on so life is beautiful life is lawful and the prophet sallallahu alaihi and his companions did indeed enjoy it as it should be and as i said we will not give you your due right in five minutes we need at least an hour to get these pearls of wisdoms of you pleasure but uh and it's always nice to see you healthy and i pray to allah azzawajal that you he keeps you your mother and your honorable family all safe and sound and healthy to worship him to obey him and to get closer to him until the day we die may allah azzawajal make this read a joyful event for the whole ummah of islam and an honorable event for all of us so i think we have come to the conclusion of tonight's episode this is a dedicated episode for uh the day of eid which i pray to allah azza that he accepts it from us all and that he accepts from us this previous days and nights of ramadan and that he gives us the long life to witness the following ramadan being steadfast on islam to get closer and closer to allah azza wajal once again allah foreign you"
