  "transcript": "Saqib says, suppose someone borrows money from me while giving me some gold as mortgage and it gets stolen even though I kept it in a secure place, who will bear the responsibility of it and will I still have to or will I still have the right to claim my money from the borrower? This is known in Islam as Ar-Rahn. Ar-Rahn is to pawn something of value as a security of a loan and the norm is that what I pawn or what I mortgage would be higher in value than the actual loan. And this thing that the person who borrowed from me entrusted me with as Rahn or mortgage or he pawned it or whatever you may call it, he pawned it or whatever you may call it, this is an act of kindness from my part. It's not a loan. He's not lending me his gold. He's not lending me his car. He's keeping it for guarantee that he would return the money at agreed time and if he doesn't, I have the right to sell it, claim my money and give him whatever is extra. Now this is called and what he kept with me is something that he's entrusted me with and I'm doing him a favor. It's like someone's traveling and before he left he says, Sheikh can you kindly keep this valuable watch with you until I come back? I said sure and I kept it in my safe, in my house. I had no negligence and no transgression none whatsoever. Somehow burglars broke into my house, stole the whole house and whatever was in the safe as well. When the man comes back, he says where's my watch? I'd say it was stolen. He has no right to say I don't care. I want my watch back. It's not his right and I was doing him a favor by keeping it in my safe secured. Likewise when he borrowed money and kept his watch or his gold necklace or his jewelry and pawned it so that he would bring the money later on as a guarantee, if it were to be stolen without any negligence of my part, I didn't throw it in the backyard or on the streets where everybody could snatch it and run away with it. I wasn't transgressing and misusing it and wearing it in parties and the likes. Rather it was safe kept in a secure place and it was stolen. In this case, there is no liability on me none whatsoever and I still have the right to claim my money from him and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
