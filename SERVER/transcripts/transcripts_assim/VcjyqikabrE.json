  "transcript": "sheila rahman al rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen was a la la la salle de mubarak rd he what a Saudi he nabina muhammad in wada early he was a ph me I'm bad assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we are still discussing the chapter that deals with fasting and you all know that fasting is divided into two types mandatory fasting and voluntary fasting and you all know that mandatory fasting is also divided into different types so we have Ramadan which comes on the highest of all we have course making up for missed days of Ramadan haha we have oats that you pledge on yourself Allah did not pledge it on you but you called it upon yourself and this is mandatory for you to fulfill and lastly we have XP ations so if you kill someone by mistake you have to fast two months as an expiation if you say to your wife that you are forbidden on me and you are exactly like my mother's back and since that I have nothing to do with you in regarding intimacy you're like my mother then you have to also part of the sequence of expiration if you cannot free a slave then you have to fast for two consecutive months and etc so these are the types of mandatory fasting the voluntary fasting the sky is the limit we have the highest of all is out of a fasting the day of arafah XP eights the sins of two years fasting the day of ashura creates the sins of one year and the sunday is too fast mondays and thursdays as the prophet used to say a day salatu salam the soon as the first three days of every month and these are preferably the white days known as the 13th 14th and the 15th it is part of the Sunnah also too fast the fasting of the wood to faster day and to skip the next so these are all considered to be voluntary fasting and you can do there is of course as you all know forbidden fasting and it is forbidden for a Muslim too fast the days of read a dual fatal and needle adha and it's also forbidden to fast the last there is the three days of at a shriek they are the three days that follow ada love ha which is the 11th 12 and the 13th of dhul hijjah it is forbidden to separately fast Friday for the sake of friday and it is forbidden to fast saturday separately for the sake of saturday but if there is a legitimate reason for doing this this is permissible as in the case when you fast out of a alone and it coincides with a saturday this is permissible as in the case if you fast the fasting of the wood peace be upon him so this means that this week you will isolate friday in the following week you isolate saturday is this halat yes because this is a fasting of the wood i'm not deliberately isolating fasting the friday or saturday for their sake I'm doing it because it comes within the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam we have hadith 179 and who will read this hadith it is related Diana Cigna Malik said that the Prophet may allah bless him and grant him peace said have sold there is blessing in soho in this hadith of venice of malik we learn some of the etiquettes of fasting and that is to have the sahara what is this the sahu itself is the pre-dawn meal it is the last meal that a person who intends to fast has it before the break of dawn and it is part of the sooner that the prophet erase a lot was salaam used to do and scholars differed whether it is mandatory or it is highly recommended and the most authentic opinion is it is highly recommended why is that because there are a hadith where the prophet alayhi salatu salam permitted his companions to continue fasting yani when it's sunset they continued they did not break it fast until the following day of sunset so they fasted forty eight hours and the Prophet did this array salatu salam to punish them and we will get to know this in sha allah so the prophet would not sallallahu ala salem permit them to do something that is forbidden that is skipping the pre-dawn meal the soul which indicates that the pre-dawn meal is not mandatory but rather it is recommended and mustahab however the prophet sallallahu re while you seldom told us that in this pre-dawn meal there is Baraka so one should not at all take it lightly even if you are about to fast and you don't have something to eat the least you could do is drink some water and intent by drinking that water there it is your pre-dawn meal because the Prophet promised us and informed us that there is Baraka inside of that now people differed some of them especially the deviant sex think that one should not have a good pre-dawn meal because this goes against the intention of starving yourself but actually is fasting intended to starve and Alonzo gel is punishing us know if I don't start what happens I personally when I fast with the grace of Allah I don't feel hungry and I don't feel thirsty because I don't eat a lot those who are used to eating a lot may find this but does this mean that I should prolong my fasting until taraweeh so that I can feel hungry no so it is not as the deviant sex say that Allah wants to torture us and hence we should not have a big meal for pre-dawn meal no you eat whatever is permissible for you to eat and you should use this pre-dawn meal to give you strength so that the following day you would act normally and do what Allah so L wants you to do as a Muslim moving on to hadith number 180 yes brother in the middle yes narrated Ana's bin Malik hacia la one that said even a Sabbath graziela one said we took us food with the Prophet sallallahu wasallam when they finished it the Prophet sallallahu solemn stood for the first prayer and offered Una's asked z what was the interval between their finishing the zoo and the starting of the morning prayer undersupplied it was equal to the time taken by a person in reciting 50 vs of the cross actually it is not Anna's who replied it was they the men Sabbath who replied because Anna's is asking zete and he told him what was the interval and they said that it was about the time that a person takes to recite 50 verses of the Quran from this hadith we learn that the Sun is to postpone and delay the salute to the last minute nowadays in most of the Muslim countries you will find in the Islamic so-called Islamic calendars they distribute you'll find in sac or in sake a trauma bond and it will come 15 minutes or 20 minutes before the identify they tell you the time too fast is that correct this is not correct this is not part of the sooner in Islam you're allowed to eat and drink and have intimacy until you can distinguish between day and night hata it away and a lockable Halabi up middle hiatal as what mineralogy so the break of dawn is the determining factor of you refraining from eating drinking and things that nullifies your fasting other than that there is no value of it or to it so if I have these calendars that say that 15 minutes I should refrain and stop eating or drinking this is not true unfortunately ninety-five percent of the Muslims apply this in their lives and you find them 15 minutes before they are done fasting and this is an innovation one of all secondly this is Emma tating the deviant sex and the Jews and Christians probably because the Prophet told us in an authentic hadith the people will remain in good shape the Muslims as long as they delay this and those who stop eating 15 or 20 minutes before definitely are not falling with a sunnah how do we know that it is not part of the sooner they said between finishing the suhoor and starting to pray 50 is how much would the person take to the side 50 is 10 minutes less than 10 minutes let's say 15 minutes so by the time he ended the event called and they went to make Udo and then the comma was called this is 50 is 50 verses of the Quran which means that it was so late that it was just before the I then they finish this road and immediately afterwards they prayed fajr prayer hadith number 181 it is related from aisha and home miss Allah Allah Allah one Huma sometimes he used to find in father the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam in janaba state of sexual impurity from one of his wives then he performed was ill and fasted in this hadith we have a report by two of his wives salala ha Jerusalem what do we learn from it this is what we'll find ishala after the break so stay tuned assalaamu alaikum and welcome back mother Aisha and umm salama they are teaching us that purity from sexual activity is not related to fasting in the sense that if a person has intimacy with his spouse and the fetcher calls the break of dawn is there while you are in the state of sexual impurity does this affect your fasting it does not affect your fasting that is exactly what the Prophet is also amused to have the fetcher would break the dawn would break and the van would be called forfeiture and the Prophet was on the state of sexual impurity this did not affect his fasting use to go and have his total bath his whistle and go and pray and continue to fast and this hadith clearly states this issue moving on to hadith 182 yes brother it is related from abu huraira zillow know that the prophets allah allah allah may allah bless him and grant him peace said if he forgets and eats and drinks he should complete his fast Allah has fed him and let him drink the prophet alayhi salatu salam is mentioning to us one of the things that if a person commits one of the nullification of fasting his fasting is considered to be complete and correct and what are these things scholars say that in order for your fast to break you have to be knowledgeable you have to be choosing and you have to be remembering what is this they say if you eat knowing that eating nullifies your fasting do I continue or not they said yes you continue because knowledge is a must if I eat because someone has a gun at my head and he said either you eat or I'll blow your head can I eat and the answer is yes okay afterwards can I continue to fast the answer is yes again because you were not choosing to eat you were forced to eat and the third case is when I eat out of forgetfulness if I ate forgetting all right drink forgetting the hadith clearly says that it is a ma who fed you and offered you to drink so these are important to know now we've stated that if you eat and drink while forgetting this is from Allah if I see someone in Ramadan drinking or eating should I leave him and say mashallah lucky him Allah has fed him and gave him drink or should I tell him ok you're fasting I must tell him that he's fasting because he is doing something moon carve something that is not permissible but he's not accountable I on the other hand I am accountable for that it's like if I see someone drinking and thinking that this is water I know that it is not watery I know it's vodka for example and I say let him drink he is going to have fun he's gonna be joyful and cheerful he's not sinful your sinful you have to tell him and stop him from doing this moon cup so likewise now we know that drinking and eating nullifies fasting but what else nullifies fasting allah mentioned in the quran d eating drinking and intercourse scholars say there are more so let us talk about the things that there is no difference among scholars they said that you add to that anything that takes or substitutes eating and drinking so for example if you take Jellico's or these Ivy that can make you alive for five or six or ten days without eating and drinking this is the same ruling this nullifies your fasting understood they also add to that copying and it's an issue of dispute among scholars is copying one of the things that nullifies your fasting what is copying copying is slashing wounding the back of the neck or the shoulders and extracting the bad blood it comes in dark and heavy state unlike the wounds that takes place and after doing it you feel relieved your eyesight improve your memory improves your sleeping habits patterns also improves scholars say that also falls under the category of intercourse ejaculation so if someone does not have sexual intercourse but he ejaculates intentionally or what they know what is called as masturbation if he masturbates then in an ejaculate then his fasting is invalid and he has to make another day for that what is ruling on taking samples of blood scholars say that is is okay it's not like copying because it does would not make you tired so it is permissible to take it does anybody know anything else that I might have forgotten yes vomiting purposely excellent very good the Prophet say that is awesome whoever vomits intentionally must make up for that day and whoever is forced to vomit sometimes you eat and give eating something bad and you can't help but all of a sudden you vomit yourself the Prophet says you're fasting is valid anything else or okay let's take your questions check you mentioned many prohibitions of people are not allowed to fast does that include the Hajis as well the pilgrims the what the pilgrims when they go for hajj yes the five days of Hajj they also prohibited to faster how does that work okay if you're talking about the three days of to shriek the 11 10 to 12 and 13 I'm saying the five days of Hajj when it was the five days the eighth day and the ninth day they have a defined the day before it they can fast but it's not recommended unique and faster day of arafah the pilgrim can fast the day of arafah is not forbidden for him too fast and he may fast as mandated if he cannot sacrifice so the scholars say that if someone is unable to sacrifice the if he's doing tomato or Tehran Allah says in the Quran fella that I am Phil ha what's up a hittable jar to three days you fast in the hatch and seven when you go back these three days are to be fasted on the eighth and the ninth or if you can not fathom you pass them on the eleventh twelfth and thirteenth so you can fast those inshallah slow mushy term it's regarding the intention of fasting when should we begin intending for a thousand should be done every day juggle ahead for mandatory fasting remember we have mandatory involuntary for mandatory fasting you must intend to fast before the break of dawn whether this intention is by eating the pre-dawn meal nobody eats just at four o'clock so definitely if you're eating at four o'clock you're intending it or by before going to bed you intend in tomorrow I'm fasting so even if you over slept and woke up after fechar your intention is correct now in regards to Ramadan scholars some of them say that you have to have intention for every single day and this is not true as long as I know that Ramadan is 30 days or 29 days it is sufficient only to intent the first day after that it is like the domino effect hollis it takes place without me intending it because every day I'm gonna have my pre-dawn meal and so on unless I separate or break because of illness or traveling so I break one or two or more days because I'm traveling once I want to resume fasting I have to have for the first day the intention and after that everything goes as usual yes the brother there it's not like up shaker on some people say that even brushing the teeth is not permissible during fasting what is the running it is ok for a person to use the c walk you know the c walk the miswak it is permissible for him to use it throughout the whole day and night no problem it is even permissible to use a toothbrush providing you can guarantee that you do not swallow any of the paste and most people can do that can guarantee that but if you're afraid or if you used to eating some of the pace and swallowing it scholars say no this affects your fasting and you should avoid this I'm afraid that this is all the time until you meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi avocado"
