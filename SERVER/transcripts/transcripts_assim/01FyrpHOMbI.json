  "transcript": "[Music] in the name of Allah most gracious most merciful alhamdulillah on behalf of alar Cent I Muhammad abadi would like to invite all of you here to today's evening session here at almanar Center being the organizer a wonderful evening we had yesterday alhamdulillah filled with knowledge and a very inspirational talk by she Asim who is here with us yet again today we have a very interesting session today this is a session which gives us the opportunity to ask questions related to our lives as a Muslim related to the life of a Muslim and what goes around in our lives if you have any questions then we just have a few guidelines that you should follow and you may present the questions for the Sheikh to answer back we will have uh the first question from the brothers and the sequence will follow to the sisters till the end of of the program I would request the brothers to line up at this mic here uh for their question and likewise we have a mic at the front for the Sisters whoever asks a question make sure that you mention your name and your profession that will help the speaker to answer in accordance to your background inshallah we will not entertain any questions that are related to politics we do not want to waste any time on that inshallah we would love to have questions that are productive for our lives inshallah and we will begin with the first question from the brothers my question is uh how one can find a pous spouse uh if he don't have any Pious relatives or friends if you don't have any religious friends or relatives alhamdulillah this is not a question to be answered through Quran and Sunnah if a person does not have any friends or relatives who are Pious how can he find the right spouse I don't know you have to ask you have to ask anyone you know that could help you so maybe going to the Imam of the Masjid that you pray five times a day or especially F that you've built relations with tell him sheh I need your help go going to Islamic matrimonial sites and there are plenty of them around alhamdulillah and you put your CV and put what you would like to have and maybe you'll find something through uh uh searching that would fit you but this has nothing to do with Halal andam I cannot tell you what to do you have to look inshallah you you'll be successful in that Allah knows best the question from the sister's side the brothers please uh my name is Hussein I marketing manager in company in jabali four questions actually uh yesterday I attended your lecture so you said yesterday I attended your seminar you said in FJ Salah between aan andama there is no Salah to be performed but if I'm reading two raah in my house and then I enter the Masjid we have to pray correct so should we pray that or we should not pray that okay that is first question okay okay I'm too old to remember what I had for lunch yesterday so let's keep it at first question and we move on inshallah now I remembered what I had for lunch it really took me a while alhamdulillah anyhow the is in normal conditions so if you come to the Masjid and you pray you cannot pray anything else you have to sit down but if you prayed it as it's the Sunnah in your home the best thing to pray your voluntary prayer is in your home so you prayed after thean the which is the sunah and you came to the Masjid now okay we have a problem the prophet said don't pray between and I accept the Sunnah and I prayed the Sunnah and if I sit down the prophet said don't sit down until you pray two raas what to do it's very easy the Hadith of not to to pray more than two of the Sunnah is in case you prayed it in the Masid if you prayed it elsewhere and you came to the Masjid you cannot sit until you pray two even if it's after even if it's after even if it's seconds before thean of you cannot sit until you pray two ra and this is Exempted from the prohibited times of prayer and Allah knows best second is uh yesterday you mentioned that at the time of the death of the prophet alhi wasallam the Quran was not compiled it was scattered and information here and there so after how many years was it published and who took the initiative and how was everything put together in some revealed in Makkah some revealed in Madina so how was it all done to be in one book the Quran was compiled was known to all as a book but it was not written in a separate book it was written in in different forms in different shapes but people by heart memorized it all and they know it from a to zed and this is one of the great characteristics and virtues of the Quran if we were today to burn all copies of the Quran on Earth not a single copy remained we can reproduce it tomorrow with not a single mistake because it is as Allah described it in the uh Quran it is clear verses of the Quran in the chest of the of the Believers so it is preserved and memorized by heart and that is why I could lead the prayer and make a mistake and a seven-year-old behind me corrects me from his memory and I have nothing to do but to to correct myself because he's right and this is yeah uh uh one of the miraculous characteristics of the Quran so they knew it by heart now when was it compiled into one book this was done in the reign of Abu Bakr sik and he reigned for two years and few months so this took place maybe a year after the death of the Prophet or maybe less sallallahu alaihi wasallam then it was reproduced once again so that they would make different copies and send it official copies at the time of may Allah be pleased with him uh third question is uh okay do we have any questions from the sisters yes yes please I'll take the sister's question and come back to you asalam alikum my name is insh Khan um I have a question why as a Muslim we do good deeds with the main goal of attaining Jenna should we not aim our goal our Good Deeds to please Allah because he is our creator and he deserves and loves to be pleased are we not wrong in defying our goal because our goal should be pleasing Allah not to just to enter Jenna okay the question is clear why do we seek and make Dua to enter Jenna and do good deeds to enter Jenna while we should purify Our intention and do it for the sake of Allah there's no contradiction because worshiping Allah Asel has main pillars and these three main pillars without them worshiping Allah would be incomplete and the scholars the describe it as having a bird a bird has a head and it has two wings and a bird flies when one of the Wings is not functioning well the way of flying is not well and it might not fly well and it might fall and if the bird did not have a head then the bird is totally dead so in Islam the head of the bird is Allah's love anyone who says I do not love Allah he's a cfir because this is the essence of worshiping Allah and the wings are fearing Allah and hoping in what Allah has and when the fire complained to Allah oh Allah I have eaten myself I'm eating myself because the fire is so hot it is so ferocious and destructive it is eating itself so Allah gave it two breaths one in summer which is the uh highest degree of heat and one in Winter which is the coldest Breeze of freezing and Allah addressed Fire by saying you are my wrath i punish people with you and Allah had dressed paradise and he said you are my mercy and I admit to you those who I have mercy on them so when you worship Allah asael seeking his Mercy that is seeking his paradise then you're fulfilling what Allah has told you and this is why Allah tells us in the Hadith I have prepared for my servants what eyes did not see what ears did not hear what Hearts could not imagine so Allah has prepared Jenna and he gave it to us as a reward and he told us you do this you get Jenna so no one in his right mind would say oh Allah I love you so much I don't want your Jenna you don't want your my Jenna you go to hell no you have to worship Allah you have to love Allah you have to want to get to Jenna and you have to fear hell because it is anger and wrath so I hope this answers your question I like to know uh about hassad should someone uh fear doing like voluntary and recommended good actions for fear of hassad okay now would someone refrain from doing righteous Deeds so that people would not give him an evil eye the answer is no the fear of evil eye could put you into problems with because as a Muslim I'm obliged to go TOA prayer someone meets meah where are you going and I say um I have something to do what is this so I'm afraid that he will think that I'm a righteous and Pious person then he would give me evil eye this is not permissible as long as you fear Allah as long as you believe that Allah is your your protector and you read the AAR in the morning in the evening after the prayers before you go to bed then you have nothing to fear whether it's evil eye hassad Envy black magic possession of Jin I fear nothing because Allah is my protector so refraining from doing good deeds in public though it is called for I have to someone comes and says I need charity to pay off debt and you know that you will not see this person again and there isn't any possible way to give him money except now or never and you refrain you say I don't want to give money so that people would not praise me or so that people would not envy me this is a a serious breach of your no you should give money now when it comes to worldly matters yes you may hide some of the worldly matters because the prophet said meaning that when you want to do something of worldly Affairs try your level best to keep it low profile because everyone who's blessed by Allah is going to have to get envied so I don't sit in public or with everyone and say oh tomorrow I'm going to buy a fancy new car and the day after I'm traveling to a vacation in here and there and I'm going to do this and this business of mine and I speak about future things that are worldly and nice but the people around me may not be as nice so they may work against me they may give me evil eye and I called for it no the prophet in here tells us keep it low profile and Allah knows best sisters as a sister has a question her in-law stay at a distance of more than 80 kilm she visits them weekly is she allowed to offer CER uh what about her husband what is it rolling I could not understand I hear the question properly did you hear it her in-law stay at a distance of more than 80 kilomet can you give me cities please sorry can you do can you name the city any jida meca or Abu Dhabi Dubai by okay so she um and and she visits them every week or every so often and she asked can I offer KAS prayer correct yeah you're right any any other question uh and what about my husband can he also offer kaser because it's parents house so and uh J which is joining it's an issue that a lot of people are confused about so I'll give you a short summary when am I to offer the answer whenever you quote travel unquote what do you define traveling the answer leaving the borders of your own City your hometown that you reside in permanently the question so what is the the destination answer there is no destination the most important thing is there is no kilometers defined 80 90 75 100 and some say if you travel over 85 kilom so if I travel 84.5 no 84.9 no 85 okay Subhan Allah have have a Mee with me huh shall I pray KAS n a little bit a little bit and then what yeah now you can this is not logical and it's not mentioned in the Sunnah by the way so what is mentioned in the Sunnah it's mentioned once you are traveling so Define traveling I go from daa to uh go I don't know if this is applicable or not so this is traveling she no this is within the city limits okay from mumbay I go from the north to the to the South it takes me three hours is this traveling no you're still in the city within the city limit ah my daughter can travel 3 hours to college and come back yes she doesn't need a Maham because this is within the city but let's go to the people of Dubai do you commute to Abu Dhabi yes she do you consider it to be traveling meaning when you leave home you kiss your wife or your spouse providing the opposite sex you're not gay you you kiss your spouse and say I'm traveling to Abu zabi so no we attend abudhabi a wedding and come back and maybe in the evening we go once again for something and come back and said in this case there it is not traveling Like Us in jida I live in jida what about meca meca is about 90 km away depending if you live up north and you go to the south of Mecca maybe it's 115 km it's a a long drive but nobody shortens prayer or combin why because we don't consider it as traveling and that is why if my wife says I want to go with my sister with our driver to mekah for omra can we said go I trust the driver the Two Sisters meaning that there is no seclusion there's no and it's not traveling go if she says okay 60 mil to the east of Mecca there is thif and the weather is beautiful and it's high and it's a resort can I go said no no one in jida considers St a close distance they all considered to be a traveling distance this is Haram so coming back to your question 60 70 80 kilometers away from where you reside can I shorten the prayer we have to ask the people of your city and the City of your in-laws if they say yes this is traveling nobody commutes for work every day we don't go up and down every single day because this is traveling in this case yes you shorten prayer what about my husband he was born there raised there now he is in the city with me and with my family we ask did he move permanently or not what do you mean Sheik I'll give you an example people come from India Pakistan Bangladesh to live in Dubai how long you've been here I've been here 30 years how long you've been here I've been 40 years masallah tab so sh am I traveler can I shorten prayer on Dubai said no you're settled here okay she I go twice a year or once a year to my country to visit my parents do I shorten prayer or complete it depends on what Sheik it depends whether you after living here for so long will eventually go back to your home country and live and die there or you've migrated if someone has migrated has no intention to go back to their home country at all like someone has shifted to Canada and he's a Canadian citizen now and whenever he goes back to Chennai or Hyderabad or Bangalore or wherever he goes just for a month visit and come back he comes back so when he goes to that country of his parents does he shorten or praise full he shortens but someone who's an expert he's here for a mission 30 years 40 years lots of money buil houses another Taj Mahal small Taj Mahal mallah he's done it well are you staying here no no no inshallah one year two year 5 years 10 years I'm going back to my country to live with my people and this case yes he has to complete prayer here and there and Allah knows best there a question from a brother is it permissible in Islam to invest money in a company which in turn invests this same in buying and selling of various currencies like Forest trading and gives back a fixed return each month it sells and buys what it sells and buys by investing the same in various currencies in the Forex Trading forense okay now the question is financial institution that deals in selling and buying currency so what are the guidelines of transactions in currency now currency takes the same role on and rulings of gold and silver which means that it has to be equal and it has to be simultaneous as in [Music] the six items two two of them are monetary gold and silver and four of them are edable that can be stored and can only be sold either by weight or by size either by liters or by kilograms depending on how you look at it these six categories have two main categories monetary gold silver dollar Dirham real euros and eatable things that can be stored and measured by weight and kilograms so dates corn uh rice all of that falls under it what about iron sheh we can weigh it he said yes but you cannot eat it so it is Exempted what about watermelons he said yes but you don't weigh it and you don't measure it by size you me you you measure it by numbers 6 one six melons 7 10 melons so now we Cascade this this to the Halal andam what is the ruling on buying gold with gold but different weight so I go to the brother and I say this is 10 g of gold and I like this bracelet of yours which is 9 G so take this in Return of this hand in hand Haram why it has to be exact so when it comes to the same kind whether dates and dates you know there are six seven types of dates 10 typ and sukari you know this you know a and sukari they the most famous types of dates so can I buy 2 kilog of AA with 5 kilog of su the answer is no why because the prophet says hand in hand exchanged now simultaneous and has to be equal exactly so who would buy one date 1 kilogram of AA with 1 kilogram of AA it's the same thing okay this is the point then there is no transaction and if the types are different then of course they cannot be similar so if I buy a kilogram of dates and I pay for it with two grams of gold it's okay because no one would say no two uh 1 kilogram of dates 1 kilogram of gold no they're different you can exchange now what about gold and silver no problem the weight is not an issue because they're different but it has to be hand inand so I give him 100 grams of silver and he says I'll buy it from you for three gram of gold and I say done take the 100 I take the three transactions is the same with currency $100 equals 375 uh Dirhams so I give him $100 and he says okay here is 300 Dirhams 75 remaining after 15 minutes inshallah I'll give it to you Haram this is riba okay this is $100 tomorrow I'll give you 500 r or Dirhams Haram it has to be simultaneous take and give you cannot have a gap or a difference so now we come back to your company if the company deals in an Islamic way this is halal investing in it is halal what do you mean by Islamic way sh this company has an exchange shop in Emirates mall whatever malls I don't know your malls and you go there you give them dollars they give you Euros you give them reals they give give you Dirhams on the spot what's the ruling on that they make. 5.4 uh uh% on transactions is this Halal totally Halal no problem even if he sells you one real this they do this with us Saudis poor Saudis you guys here are embezzling us and you're you're you're extorting us I come and I give 100 R thinking that it's 100 Dirham he gives me 80 Dirham what is this rip off do you want it I need it I have to it's Hal take and give there's nothing wrong in that now in Forex for example you open a virtual account you put money you transfer your money I have 100,000 Dirhams in there I buy and sell and mallah everything is halal the problem is that I made a transaction I bought my 100,000 in Euros in 6 days later I sold it and I made a profit of €2,000 mallah I want to withdraw my money today they cannot give you your money you have to wait between 48 to 72 hours this means that the transaction is not true is not correct because it's not simultaneous there is a a delay there is a gap so investing in such companies is Haram but if the company itself is doing what I have said earlier about the uh uh exchange money ex exchange um and doing it simultaneous with with the Islamic guidelines then there is no problem in that and I hope this answers the question uh for Muslims offering Salah is far from the age of probably 10 or something but what about those Muslims Who start offering Salah maybe 24 25 years of age and they already have a backlog and they've collected punishment for sizable period of time so in India Pakistan they are offering you know first Kaz with the first we offer one more first is it bidda or how do we make up for the Lost prayers of the past see I cannot say anything against the Pakistan Indian Bangladeshi culture because there are majority here they will kill me I'm a m what can I say but I have to say a most of your rituals are all baseless the is unfounded in in in and so many times people say I pray like gazillion what said yes I pray 4 plus 2+ 2+ 3+ 1 plus what is this I'm very bad in calculus I used to do engineering and I quit school I went to Linguistics because it was easier because of this what is is he said yeah but then we have two and then is not then we have two then one so they have plus plus plus plus all of this is baseless is you want to add to that we can discuss it later but is four don't add anything to it now or orat or whatever you call it all these names are unfounded in Islam now how to understand this I've missed a lot of prayers so I have backlog should I do it or not the prophet answered this question when he said in an authentic Hadith whoever misses a prayer or let me rephrase that whoever sleeps over a prayer or forgets it he must pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no experation for it other than that now what would people expediate sin would anyone exp something that is not sinful but he was asleep and when people are asleep they're not sinful or he forgot and when people forget they're not sinful which means that making up for a missed prayer can only be done if these are the two legitimate reasons forgetfulness and sleeping if someone deliberately aband bons a prayer until the following prayer is due or until its time is out like f prayer he's sitting there hears the aan doesn't pray until the sun rises then he says okay I'm going to pray what are your excuses for missing F nothing were you asleep no I was awake did you forget no but I was lazy I'll make Kaza now so no don't make it and if you make it it will not be acceptable why she because the Hadith that I've mention mentioned earlier and this is why Allah says in the Quran has been I don't know what this translation it's it's it's fixed time it is ordained at fixed times so you have to pray it on time otherwise it's not going to be accepted I'll give you another example from one of one of the pillars of Islam I applied for Hajj I got to permission they give me the Visa I wore myam from my Dubai home and I went to the airport I went to the mashallah Emirates first class having fun drinking juice went to the airport Hajj terminal I went down they said oh the Visa there's a problem and they were treated nicely by the passport authorities in my country Mah they're very why why are you laughing so they treated him well they put him in a five-star hotel in you know but small area and he stayed there for 5 days on the 12th of the when people were in Mina they said I we are sorry wall we are sorry it's a mistake no we thought that it was uh uh forged and a lot of uh uh problems like this we have with Saudi visas go ahead I went immediately from the airport to arafa and I stood there in with my umbrella on my head at 11:00 of course on my own everybody's in Mina and the police patrol came and said hey what are you doing said you blind I'm wearing my I'm Ina what do you think I'm doing I'm making up for said is on the 9th today is the 12th said yeah but I had a very legitimate reason I fell sick they caught me in the airport I didn't have a transportation Allah knows my intention go away is his ha accepted because the time has gone has expired and there is not a justification islamically the time is from Sun uh um from Sun uh the break of dawn of the 9th of till the break of dawn of the 10th of the this is a Time fora if you don't stand there for one minute your H is invalid no matter what your reasons are so likewise with Salat and Salat is extremely important so there isn't any such concept of K prayer of especially of and you find people praying F and praying another F and another F okay which one is it I don't but to be safe rather than sorry I add two three F you've been praying this for 60 years you're only 22 years of age how many years are you going to put it mileage is good for you and the more you you bring food for the guests the better it will not be less so this is wrong and Allah knows best yes what is your opinion on a group who tends to undermine the Hadith and claim some are not acceptable as that of the magic of the Prophet they claim that they are more closer to Companions as such what is the position of a woman who is married to such a follower this person who IGN ignores some of the hadiths not all of them he's ignorant he should be taught see if he were to deny all Sunnah he says all Hadith I do not believe in it I believe only in the Quran then this person generally speaking is a cfir anyone who rejects the Sunnah rejects the Hadith of the Prophet or says why do we believe in the Sunnah we have the Quran itself it's enough and rejects the Quran it's the the Sunnah all together this person is a cfer but if a person says I believe in the Sunnah but there is a Hadith or two that I'm not convinced of he's ignorant this person is ignorant because so much in the Sunnah that Allah is testing us with that you may not comprehend and that is why when the Muslims in Mecca you used to pray they used to pray towards Jerusalem but in between they used to pray to Ala so ala was here to the north of it is Jerusalem so they used to pray in one line but the the the order was to pray to Jerusalem when they moved into Medina ala become became South and Jerusalem is north so the prophet Alam used to pray to Jerusalem but he was inclined to pray to Mecca but there was no instruction so when the order came to shift 180° and face Kaa The Hypocrites and the Jews said Muhammad doesn't know when to pray sallallahu alaihi wasallam he prays here and then he prays there and this was a test from Allah when he said in in chapter 2 so we did not make the shifting of the except as a test for those so that we know who follows you from those who turn back on their heels so this was a test from Allah and this is also a test to your husband so if he rejects a Hadith or two for example the Hadith of of uh uh the prophet being under a spell of uh uh Black Magic by a Jew named and he rejects it this is not possible he's ignorant let him sit with a scholar who would explain it to him and show him how ignorant and uh uh little knowledge he has if he still insists he's still a Muslim because he did not reject something that is well known to all that cannot be rejected so for example if he says I don't believe that wine is Haram is cfir we establish the proof on him these are the ayat these are the Hadith he said still I don't believe in itas he's a cfir you cannot live with him but if it's something that he thinks whether the nikab of women is mandatory or not he says I don't believe it's mandatory it's a disputed thing among Scholars so he does not become a cfir you try your level best to explain it to him and to clarify it and Allah knows best she I volunteer with Islamic Center I volunteer with an Islamic Center and we'd like to have some competitions for for speaking and writing we'd like to know what's the ruling on giving prizes for these competitions it's an issue of dispute in giving prizes over competitions to make a long story short say it's okay now the issue is if they put seed money so if you in order to get into this competition you pay five r i myself believe that this is Haram with all due respect to the great Scholars because it's the same though they consider it to be under the category where the Prophet said there is no racing there is no competing except in blades meaning archery or a the the hoof is it of a camel or the shoe of a horse all of this is used in Jihad so Scholars say anything that falls under the category of jihad such as competition and because is Jihad it is okay to compete in it but if one wants to make something other than that the majority say no this kind of competing is not permissible so if it's without money definitely it is permissible we make a competition who makes a research on the ruling of uh praying fer in Masjid and the best research the brother gave a donation of a thousand Dirham and he will get first second third prize a donation from a third party this is totally Halal no problem in that insh can I add one minor thing to the question uh okay if it's a a non-islamic competition if it's a non-islamic competition there something else which is something minor uh like for example a running race running a race okay they ask you like you want to go there for a dawa purpose you know you have a beard you want to run with the people show them about Islam uh you don't want to win the prize but they ask you to pay to enter no this is not permissible even if it was yeah for winning the prize paying an entry fee to register in a squash competition and you are a good player squash player even if you're afraid of playing against me but still and you pay 50 Dirhams I have no problem 50 Dirhams is nothing for me whether you win or lose this is gambling this is Haram and it's not be fitting for you with your long bead and short trousers to run with those who are almost clothless and say this is for da sayah allahar and like the brothers when they play football you know the Beard Brothers pass the pass the ball and when you scoreb what is this as alizing it no it doesn't need to do this do whatever you can with the boundaries of Islam Quran and Sunnah don't go out of your way to call people to Islam Islam doesn't need that someone goes say today is uh what Saturday night let's go to the nightclubs and give da to the sisters you know they're dancing and drinking but we make da for is this permissible what are you doing this is Haram even if you're in see the deed to be accepted by Allah there are two conditions one that you're sincere I'm sincere in going to nightclubs two that it comp it it uh complies with the Sunnah of the prophet and this is definitely against the Sunnah of the prophet and Allah Knows Best in your lecture during peace conference you said that um you can eat in countries ofab but these are many but there are many brothers in their country who are non-muslims what what then uh should we do because we uh because all the meat we eat is not h she has to repeat she's talking about you're talking about uh uh uh meet in countries that are uh not Muslim right yes okay now there this is an issue of dispute among Scholars and I tend to follow the softest and most authentic opinion which is Abu uh the opinion of chapter 5ah Allah tells us that the slaughtering of the people of the book is halal for us now people come say yeah but they don't Slaughter do you know that for sure yeah they say they say leave it in your home let's talk about facts what did Allah permit for us Allah permitted for us to eat from the food of the people of the book do we have to ask maybe it's best to ask but if I ask as Allah permitted it wouldn't it be also permissible for me if brother Muhammad abadi invites me to his home and he brings me this meat and I say is this Halal or because it's better to ask no this is offensive she why is it offensive I want to know what I'm eating yeah but he's a Muslim brother so there are so many sinful Muslims yeah but he's a Muslim and by default we eat what Allah permitted us to do ah good point okay let's go to the Christian he John or Paul or Luke or Matthew or whoever invited me to his house so I went and he bought me this big chicken fried chicken said eat H should I ask him but Allah told me that it is per ible for you to eat from the food of the people of the book meaning slaughtering as Abbas explained it um no I should eat no problem bah how do you know that it was slaughtered maybe they don't Slaughter let's go back to history the prophet Alam was invited by a Jew woman who wanted to poison him so she put a lot of poison in the shoulder of the Sheep and the prophet came wasam and he ate it was never reported to us that the prophet said woman is this slaughtered Halal is it kosher or not he didn't not only that we are told in the Quran that at the time of the Prophet Alat the Jews their income was from riba and from eating people's money the prophet did not ask her is this Halal money or you bought it from your riba and your other Haram transactions so this means that asking is not part of our religion now having said that it depends on the country you travel to someone goes to China and it says I will eat from Chinese food no they're not people of the book They're Buddhist they're atheist they're whatever Christianity is nothing so if I go to a social country who are not Christian they're all socialists are same but if I go to the UK for example UK UK is a Christian country he said no no no she they're not they're atheist no ask any one of them they say I'm Christian sheh they don't go to the church they say that Jesus is the son of Allah this is shik they used to say Jesus is the son of Allah at the time of the Prophet but Allah Allah described them in the Quran that they say that Jesus is the son of Allah and Allah is one of three so their religion practice is the same as now so the the say that you go there and eat without any problem and this is what I tell the brothers now if you are in a country where you find regular McDonald conventional McDonald and a cheeseburger shop that is halal I would definitely go to the Halal one but if you are in a country like America for example or in Norway or in whever there's no Halal shops all of there are uh uh conventional shops and you know that they're all Christian and you don't have any concrete evidence only heay by heay I mean we should not drink any Pepsi no Coca-Cola you should not use Colgate or closeup we should not use any perfume because all have all has pork in it all has alcohol in it at the end of the day even my clothes I cannot uh put on because it has some Haram ingredient here or there they will he say no in Islam you have to have certainty and facts otherwise you will open the door for o CD and Allah knows best but the question is uh if in UK there are many restaurants whose butchers they are non-muslims so can we eat the food the butcher isim if the butcher is Christian of course we can eat we can only eat what a Muslim a Jew or a Christian Slaughters providing it is slaughtered one two that we are not certain that he said the name of other than Allah because if he says in the name of Jesus Christ and we know that this is Haram and Allah knows best she can you throw some light on uh doing business with banks and financial institutions okay and the consequence of uh dealing in it doing business with banks and financial institutions is halal as long as the business is halal so if I have I understand your question I know what you're getting don't worry if I have a brother in the UK and I want to send him money I will not go to any Tom Dicker Harry I have to go to the bank and I give him ,000 worth with7 durhams transaction fee and that is it this is halal if I want to deposit my money because there isn't any Islamic Bank and I put it in this bank and they don't give me Interest it is halal if I want to pay my telephone bills electricity bills through the bank this is halal so doing business with the bank and financial institution is halal however if the transaction itself is Haram then it's Haram so if I'm dealing with the Bank either taking riba I.E interest or giving riba having a loan from the bank and putting interest on the loan not buying anything from it just money for money this is one of the major muat the major sins that takes uh uh that take the individual to Hell the prophet told us it uh uh it is one of the major sins Allah told us in the Quran that whoever deals in riba will have war waged against him from Allah and his messenger sallallahu alaih wasallam so it's a a huge threat but you have to look at the transaction in order to give the answer uh how about uh doing some service not exactly dealing with bank suppose banks have some requirements for their own office it's not like depositing money or something so this is different now you're not dealing with the bank as investing or transaction you want to provide this financial institution or conventional bank which is RI based with services such as maintenance electrical work Plumbing renting this is your question yeah or I'm a software engineer and I work for a company that developed software and they assigned me to develop a software for that conventional Bank what's the ruling it's Haram Allah said in chapter five in the very beginning cooperate on virtue and fearing Allah and do not cooperate on Haram Vice and uh uh uh sins and transgression so anyone who helps someone in Haram will take the same burden of him so this is totally prohibited so the answer or the question which is uh you should stand behind the line this is oh he has privileges okay uh the the question is what about insurance companies what's the ruling on insurance company does it take the same ruling the answer is yes insurance is Haram because insurance is gambling Insurance give us 2,000 Dirhams and we insure your car to a liability of 3 million Dirhams a whole year passes nothing happens my 2,000 Dirhams are down in drain good luck pay another one I make a m i make an accident worth of 1 million they pay it off so it is like Lottery buy a lottery ticket for 100 Dirham and win a Porsche or lose 100 Dirham this is Haram this is gambling can we take loan from an Islamic Bank from Islamic Bank okay Islamic B this is a misconception that is well spread among Muslims Islamic Banks do not lend money and if an Islamic Bank tells you that I lend you money he's Haram he's conventional they don't lend money at all okay what do they do ah they sell you a product and then you pay for that product in installments so for example I have this pen it's expensive pen I don't buy buy expensive pens this is a gift so someone comes to me and say sh I'd like to buy this pen from you says okay I'll sell it to you for 5,000 R and brother Muhammad comes and says she sell it to me and I say I'll sell it to you for 7,000 RS he says why do you sell it for me for seven and for the brother for 5,000 this is mine I can sell it for 100,000 it's not your business right or wrong do I have the right to sell it in any price the Islamic Bank deals in a similar way you come to the Islamic Bank and you tell them I'd like to buy this property it costs 2 million Dirhams the bank says okay at the moment I do not possess the the the uh uh property but if I were were to possess it I would sell it for 3 million over a period of 10 years the man says okay now if the bank says okay if this is okay with you sign these papers please that you will buy buy this XY Z after I possess it and if you don't then I will find you then I will sue you then I will make you sell everything you have until I get my money off you and you sign this is Haram because the bank sold you something it does not own or possess and theith of he said the prophet forbade from selling something you do not possess okay what is the Islamic thing Sheik the Islamic thing is that when he knows that I want to buy that property he says come after 10 days and the bank does its due diligence he asks in the market how much does this property uh is it worth and they say it's worth 1.9 to 2.1 1 million so M so if I buy it I'm not losing so the bank buys it and registers it in its name when I come 10 days later the bank says okay the property is mine here it is now I'm sending it to you for 3.5 million Dirham it's it's your choice you want to buy it alhamdulillah you don't want to buy it no harm done if I don't buy it the bank is stuck with it and this is straight you may win and you may lose but if I buy it alhamdulillah he's selling something to me so this is not a loan a lot of the banks in I don't say here I don't know about your transactions huh until I leave inshah the Border I can speak but until now I cannot so I don't know about your transactions but some banks in Islamic banks in Islamic countries you go to them and you say um I'd like a 100,000 din or D he said no we don't give you loans Haram this is RBA mallah you are interesting Muslim country okay what to do said no I'll sell you 10,000 units of air conditioning what what would I do with that no no no don't worry I'll sell it to you for XY Z price and then you authorize me to sell it on your behalf in the market because I know a lot of people and then I'll give you the cash that you got for selling it and I take my percentage over it said come again I'll tell you 10,000 AC units this is approximately 250,000 Dirhams this is the money you want correct he says no I want 200,000 say yeah okay I'll sell it to you for 250 you will pay it in installments over 12 months and then I will be authorized from you to take these 10,000 units and I'll sell it to this company or to that individual but it usually gets you 200,000 and this is the money you want I'll give it to you and you pay me 250 says okay sounds logical and Islamic okay sign here please sign here okay alhamdulillah in 10 minutes time you'll find the money in your bank account huh when did you buy when did you sell so no no this is all automatic now this is totally prohibited there is a a fatwa from the Council of that's saying that this is called uh organized selling buying selling buying selling buying and the same unit is there and most Islamic Banks deal in this trick they tell you we have 50 tons of iron of Steel we'll sell sell it to you and then you authorize it and we will sell it to someone else and here's the cash and they have 100 branch in different cities and they're all selling the same steel and it's just a trick this is totally prohibited and this is Haram so depending on the Islamic Bank depending on the transactions how they will sell and buy the safest thing is to do Islamic Bank the 10,000 units you have them he says yes come to my store uh house and I go to the warehouse and I find 10,000 units of General Electric or whatever I buy it and I sign it okay ship it to me please and I go to the souk I go to the market I go to companies other than the bank and they buy it for me regardless of the price this is totally Halal this is permissible and it's according to the Shar and there's nothing wrong with in that and Allah knows best we have the question um today we live in a generation where the Haram things are easily accessible and we get caught up with it because as humans we get tempted towards it uh what are the best things that we can do to prevent from these Haram things what Haram things any things in general like uh in for example um using the internet we can get caught up with a lot of different Haram things through the internet through the internet or any other thing in general but this very easy Whenever there is a place where Haram is displayed stay away and there isn't any vaccination that I will give you and say oh I'm strong I can watch porn I have no problem alhamdulillah I am uned no it isn't wherever there's Haram you must stay away from it if I'm weak sheh whenever I I try my level best I fear Allah I fast Mondays and Thursdays I do night prayer a lot of brothers do this but whenever I open the internet or watch YouTube I fall into sin and then I do what comes afterwards masturbation maybe chitchatting with the opposite sex I do this and that what's the easiest way to what should I do she there's no secret portion that you take and you become immune you have to stay away from this cut it she I go to uh a university and it's mixed and I am falling into sins they night and I cannot help it quit school I cannot quit school either you behave and become a good Muslim and walk straight or quit school because when it comes to the end of the day school that is your religion or school no My Religion definitely comes as a priority so among other things is reading the S of the Prophet Alat reading the S of the companions associating yourself 24/7 with righteous people so coming to the center knowing Brothers going into with them engaging in lectures voluntary work that occupies your time that doesn't give you time to sit alone with shatan or to exchange your environment with good environment this comes as a A plus and Allah Knows Best alikum um I work as a research manager in okay I have a question uh I have read certain a Hadi that uh uh signs of a good death for example like when you pronounce shahada or you die of uh some stomach disease or you die in the sake of while doing Jihad it's a sign of a good death and uh there was a Hadith I guess I read that if you die of some incurable disease that's also counted as sign of a good death can we count like dying of cancer or as a heart attack in this and related as a question what's the Jihad for women what the second one I didn't did not what is the Jihad for women okay this is political or it's okay okay okay no problem the first question is the prophet saidat who do you consider the martyrs among you and they said the martyrs are who who those who die in the cause of Allah meaning in Jihad in the battlefield mean Jihad let us be clear it's in the battlefield and then the prophet said no then this case Martyrs are so few those who die in fire are Martyrs those who die under a falling building are Martyrs those who die drowning are Martyrs those who die with an illness that comes at the side as a tumor and it causes uh uh uh fluid and and and bad things which can be considered to be a kind of cancer the prophet said it is uh uh uh he's a martyr a person who dies with the plague and it's a well-known illness and epidemic so this can also be considered with Eola and uh the one we have in Saudi what is it the one with the c with the camels M or Merc or no they had the previous anyhow they have different names and finally the prophet said and the woman who dies while in labor while she's giving birth she's a martyr so all of these are martyred by the prophet Alam and they get providing they are tolerant and patient someone who whals and screams and why me why not him this is not fair and he dies no this goes to hell definitely he's not a Marty but someone who's patient he's drowning a building falls and he anticipates the reward in Allah and he dies he's a martyr now she says what is the Jihad for women the prophet Alat wasam was approached by female companions and they said oh prophet of Allah we want to go for Jihad we want the reward you know so the prophet said you have the best and the most beautiful of all Jihad Haj and so the Jihad of women is to go for Hajj this is the authentic Hadith from the prophet now those who have Twisted ideas they say no no this is not enough we want actual Jihad in this case they're rejecting the prophet saying and teaching and they should revise their Islam once again Allah Knows Best Salam alikum I want to ask a question regarding bid uh the principles uh that uh regard things are bidah we understand it pretty clearly with regard to many acts of worships that are not prescribed but there certain things are a little bit cloudy uh I remember listening or hearing uh from Sheik nasid albani he gave a principle which says anything that the prophet Sall could have done at that time and he didn't do we do that similar thing it is B for us to do so when it comes to things like for example recently we had this world hijab day and I knew that there was a little bit of a difference opinion between the speakers about whether this is permissible or not and I remember reading from you that you did allow it as long as it was not a recurring event how do we comp uh you know combine all these and decide something is b or not b in these cloudy areas now the B is a very long topic any act that you do in order to get closer to Allah which was not mandated or directed to us in the Shar is considered to be so it has to be the intention of getting closer to Allah so throwing a mid for the prophet is a b no doubt about it at all now when it comes to the quote of Al albani I don't know this quote so I cannot elaborate until I read what's before it and what's after it and understand what the shikh meant however we have guidelines to govern the issue of bid so anything that we do has to fit with the reason with the timing with the location with the number with the uh a number of things that must fit otherwise it falls under B so when the prophet says you have to sacrifice in from Camels cows or sheep and goat if someone says I have a horse that is 100,000 R worth I'd like to sacrifice it on what do I say to him it's a because the type is different the cause whenever you enter a Masjid you have to pray what two this is a cause the prophet indicated this if someone says mashallah every time I enter my home I pray for my home hey this is I said why Allah will punish me for praying for him he said yes he will punish you for innovating this is not the reason that the prophet gave us the time the quantity uh the how if someone says I'll do ta around the Kaa seven times mallah but instead of making it on my left I'll make it on my right so instead of patching the duy on your left hand side pass it on your right hand side what are you doing this is uh clockwise she it's it's it's it's better for the heart it's wrong the format is wrong so there are things that have to fit now when we come to day it is an innovation to celebrate anything that is reoccurring because has two meanings location wise and TimeWise location wise if there is a place here that we visit every single year this becomes a in Muslim a man came to the prophet Alat wasam and said oh prophet of Allah I have vowed to Allah to slaughter a cam at buana a location near Medina the prophet asked him two questions is there a for the idol worshippers do they every year come to it said no is there an idol that people worship said no then in this case go ahead and fulfill your vow no problem so hijab day if it's occurring in that particular date what was it 21st of March whatever then this is Haram because it's becoming a Eid like Labor Day like national day like uh Human Rights Day like animals day all of this is reoccurring this becomes under Eid and it's not permissible besides if there are things done that are not in accordance to Islam so if women go to the street wearing their hijab and talking to men taking their autographs giving them leaflet giving them dawa this inter uh mixed dawa is is not permissible A man gives dawa to men otherwise let's go to the nightclub again and sisters give dawa to sisters it's not appropriate for a sister to give da to the brothers and it's inappropriate unless it's needed with a hijab with the uh uh um conditions for a brother to give da to sisters because this was done at the time of the Prophet Alat as long as FNA is secure but the opposite way is not permissible so if it's a once every blue moon occasion no problem if it's not reoccurring in the same date so today is in February uh next year it's going to be in March the following year maybe skip it and it's not a habit there's no problem in it inshallah and Allah knows best this is uh my name is andum I'm a human resource officer by profession uh my question shik is um during the first quarter of this year there is a fatwa from the Muti of Dubai that using mobile is not permissible my question is how fatwa should be followed by every Muslim and what is the impact of fatwa if Muslim doesn't follow it or if they follow it first of all I never answer a question when it is regarded or related to a fatwa of a Sheik so when you come to me and say she so and so gave fatwa of this and that I cannot comment on it because it was be inappropriate for me to comment on someone who's not there second of all I don't know if his fatwa that you've quoted is correct or no not I don't know if you understood his fatwa or not and I don't know the circumstances and this happens a lot she says so and so what do you think or I ask she so and so and he told me like in Muhammad Salah for example the one in Huda you know we're the rivals we always fight and boxing and under the belt and so people call me on the phone on the program she Muhammad Salah said that this and this and this is wrong what do you think you're asking me ask him and I hung up it is inappropriate and this is not from my own courtesy and I fear Allah a lot no this is the teaching ofh our whenever anyone came to one of the greatest contemporary Scholars of all time whenever someone comes to him and say sh so and so of Egypt or so and so of this country said so and so and so I asked him in he told me you don't have to sacrifice a camel what should I do he said you've asked the Sheikh don't come to me this is not a game that we can play so ask me on my website you know my website www. al.net post your question without saying I ask and so and so or there is a fatwa in this country so on so just ask me about the question what's the ruling on wearing black shoes made by Prada and I will tell you okay try to buy Louis Vuitton maybe it's a little bit more stylish but don't give me names of shakes or uh countries and I will answer you inshallah and Allah knows best my question is wearing the garments above the ankles it is compulsory on all the times are only during the prayer times because why I am asking is I working as a marketing executive and marketing executive marketing actually M my manager is Muslim but he is not allowing me to wear the pants trouses above the ankles he is telling that is looking like funny so maybe customer will not like you so these kind of reasons they are giving to me so how to handle this issue and if you uh uh do as he says he will be pleased with you but if he comes tomorrow and says your beard looks much funnier it is also he told already he told already so shave your beard as well no no no no just how to handle this issue this if he says this what are you going to do are you going to shave your beard no no no actually I have given the explain from my side whatever I knows okay so if I ask you you will give first of all the ruling for men garments below the ankles is totally prohibited and there are two punishment set by the prophet Alat wasam the first punishment is that if you lower your garment your trousers your Bungie or uh whatever you call it below the ankles and and the ankles are the joint between the leg and the foot these two bones are ankles if you cover them not out of arrogance but laziness then your punishment is whatever area is covered under the ankle this will be tortured in hell and we know that the least person tortured in hell is a man where a fire stone put in his sandals his head his brain boils from it so he becomes heat conductor he's not in Hell only this so this is the least now if you do it out of arrogance out of pride in this case you have four punishment Allah doesn't look at you Allah punishes you Allah does not purify you Allah does not talk to you and this is in hell all of these four punishments so to come back to your question it is totally prohibited for you to do this a lot of the brothers especially from the subcontinent they wear long trousers when it comes to Salah they fold it but they're sinful the rest of the day in the prayer they're okay but the rest of the day they're sinful for what they're doing and one other practice I've seen also which is very very funny they take a handkerchief and their mes and putting it on their head and tying it for prayer I don't know where they got this practice from why do you cover your head with a handkerchief either you wear this you wear you wear turban or no don't we anything but to specifically come and pray with it and 2 24 hours the day you don't have anything on your head this is an innovation and Allah knows best the previous question you answered about the good death about the good death it means we cannot count heart attack as a sign of good death death heart attack is a sign of good death yes those who die like this it's a sign of good death there are number of signs uh for a good death for example the sweating I hope I don't die now but if I die it's a good death because I'm sweating like crazy the prophet said the believer dies with lots of sweat on his forehead and I've seen this people dying sweating and it's freezing but this is a good sign because the prophet said it's a good sign one of the good signs is to die anticipating the reward from Allah when you have cancer when you are giving labor when you're drowning I don't know if if you're anticipating the reward or lot but you died these are all good signs if you die on a Friday so today is Thursday night tomorrow is Friday and someone dies tonight this is a good sign or he dies tomorrow which is the day of Friday this is a good sign because the prophet told us that he will not be punished in the grave that's one of the best signs there is if he dies while praying someone I think I posted on Facebook let me advertise my Facebook who follows me on Facebook masallah inshallah they will enter J Ya Allah and all of you who on my Twitter as well no problem um I posted it on fa Facebook this is a story that a person the a community in America they wanted to they used to uh pray in a rented facility and the owner of the Masjid rented Masjid was a Jew and every time he sees the people mallah more and more he raises the the rent until the Imam says we can't afford this so he told them that next month we're going to close so they were sad one boy stood up youngster in his te or 20s he said why not buy the the whole facility and everybody laughed he said how can we buy it if we can't even pay the rent he said no if inshallah there's a will there's a way and he was this a man who sells falafil and he brought his savings for a whole year and he said I was hoping to utilize this in something that is good but inshallah so he gave it to the IM and the IM took the initiative and they started collecting and in 3 days mashallah they managed to buy the property from the Jew and it became a full-fledged Masjid the community as usual the Muslims mashallah mashallah masallah they started backbiting the boy oh he's a show off he didn't do it for the sake of Allah look he doesn't even have a beard no no no he did not do this for the sake of Allah that year he did not reply that year Allah mallah willed it and he went for Haj he gathered money he got a gift he went for Hajj and on the day ofaa while supplicating to Allah he died Allah doesn't give a good death except to those who are good so definitely he gave that money with sincerity and Allah rewarded him with such a death may Allah make our death likewise so if you die in a form of in in praying while fasting while doing something that Allah is pleased with you this is a good death but if you die with the reme control skipping between uh American uh Idol and So You Think You Can Dance or the voice and you this is M who's watching this I'm not talking about pornography but this is that came into my mind and you die like this this is an awful death Allah did not intend well for you so may Allah make our death easy and nice uh my question is regarding playing cards uh um is is it permissible to play uh a betting game without using money but merely for the fun of it okay so let me understand this so you asking about playing cards playing cards and it is a betting game so like poker or uh uh blackjack or it starts like this is this part of the characteristics of Muslims or non-muslims just non-muslims okay between you and me when we play poker or a blackjack or do we play without chips we have to play matches at least huh but eventually five six months from now it's going to be boring matches and chips let's put uh okay you buy or we if if I win and it develops like this that is why Shan he's a master in what he does and I'm complimenting him Shan if if you come to me I'm not Shan by the way but if you come to me and ask me for my CV I'll give you five six pages my training sessions my management role my this my that my degrees mallah if you go to someone who is more decorated he will give you maybe 20 Pages shayan's CV is from here to Abu Dhabi he is experienced in playing with our minds since Adam his first victim peace be upon Him Allah tells him do not eat from The Forbidden truth and he says eat from it eat from it eat from it until he ate from it so when he comes to you and says come on let's go to Las Vegas you know La Mir is is very good or the Caesar palace Wow Let's uh let's party and have hangovers huh what will happen you will say you're crazy I'm a Muslim I can't go there I cannot do these things okay let's start from Level zero let's play with only matches let's play with chips let's play with Monopoly banknotes huh nothing Haram alhamdulillah few weeks it will develop into Haram few months it become gambling and definitely you from from day one are doing sin because you are following the footsteps of shatan and you're imitating the kufar we have our dignity we play Muslim games and Allah knows best one more question she uh Also regarding uh martial arts um as it as we know it's not permissible to strike the face but many martial arts for example boxing and MMA and karate they uh they they train you to defend yourself by striking someone's face but they don't actually unless unless you go for competition they don't you don't really have to do it so what is the ruling regarding the prophet Alam forbade totally striking the face boxing is totally prohibited spying is prohibited if it's there's contact with the face with the full body not intending to harm this is permissible masas whether it's jiu-ju or akido or hapkido the Korean type whether it is martial arts kung fu Taw all of these you can Excel and learn and be fit without hitting the the face if this is done no problem when no there's no Bowing in it there's no problem go ahead if they insist then you have to decline and I used to do all of these things when I was young you know last century I'm that old uh but now I discovered that the best thing is a 9 mm so how he that's it why should I sweat and work and injure myself I have it it's licensed by the way huh I'm a Saudi it's it's licensed by the government so I have it with me alhamdulillah and I have no problem with that and Allah knows best is photography Halal taking pictures of your family and friends what is your opinion photography is an issue of dispute among Scholars the majority of schols 10 or 15 years ago the majority say it's Haram why because we have have texts from the prophetic saying that those who take drawings in Arabic Al the gentleman here behind the camera in Arabic what is his job in his ID it's called Al so the prophet said Al is the most severely punished on the day of judgment I apologize but this is a Hadith what do you want me to do don't turn it off now wait until I finish my answer so the the the word itself Al has a meaning at the time of the Prophet they did not have any photography did they no what they had was drawings and sculpturing so the majority of Scholars say that drawing is totally prohibited all Scholars say that sculptures of living creatures a horse a a human being a president Etc it's all totally prohibited when photography came into the scene the majority of Scholars said hm what's your job title ah this is and they did not look into it a little bit thoroughly because it was something that was new to them until they started looking into it whether it fits the criteria or not so if you look at the Hadith Allah says who is more wrong other than the those who go to create like my creation so if I draw a portrait of brother Muhammad it's not going to be a good one but it's a portrait is it mimicking Allah's creation yes so I fall under the the category but if I take a photograph of him and I show you the photograph who's this wow mashallah your picture is very good what nobody says this this is him if I have a book a checkbook and I sign a checkbook and you take the check and you Xerox it you make a a photocopy of it and you bring me the photocopy on the original and you tell me about the photocopy whose signature is this masallah this looks like mine Subhan Allah no I would say this is mine if I look in the mirror and I see my reflection in the mirror and I say mashallah this matter is good this is me this is the creation of Allah therefore Scholars said H photography is not mimicking the creation of Allah this is the creation of Allah therefore they said it is permissible but they excluded two things or three just to be safe the first one that you cannot keep photo photographs of dead people why because you remember shik started first when they built Idols over the five righteous people of n tribe and after generation and another generation they started worshiping them so anything that may lead to this happens and this happens in Egyptian soap opras if you watch Egyptian soap opras when someone eyes they put on the frame of the picture black uh cloths and the Widow would come why Abed she speaks to the dead if you see what's happening to us look this is all Haram now this is not only in Egypt it's in Saudi it's in Yemen it's in Syria so deceased Haram you have pictures of your parents your grandparents your loved ones destroy them two pictures of women H sh why men everything is halal and for us is Haram no it's not like this men are not obliged to cover women are so if a woman takes another picture of a sister a daughter a mother without wearing the hijab she is actually exposing her sh nobody will see this picture a brother comes to me and say I only photograph my wife nobody sees the photographs except me Haram why she because you may sell your mobile phone your camera you may sell your laptop which the pictures are in it I always format everything even if you format it a brother of mine a friend of mine he's a airline Saudi Airline Captain came to my house and he was so shocked and what's wrong he said I bought a used laptop from a friend and it was formatted zero nothing so I gave it to a shop and I told them install Windows uh operating system this and that and office and the man was my friend the shop owner so I come the following day and he said I put a surprise for you so I went home and I opened my laptop and I and then I found the folder I clicked the folder and I found personal family photos of my friend and his wife in Intimate situations with the kids with the sisters with the and I said called my friend the shop owner what is this he said I retrieved the formatted material he said how can you do this oh we have softwares easy and everything that this brother took of his wife found it there another brother of who used to work with me he was a ordinate of mine working for me got married 10 days after his marriage he came back to work and he said I have a problem what's your problem he said on the wedding night you know I put my VCR and I recorded what happened with me and my wife and five or six days later we were at my mother's house someone broke into the house and took the camera and the videos and now I'm thinking of divorcing my wife how will I feel if I find such sex tapes on the internet and everybody's watching me and my wife I said you want to divorce your wife you stupid donkey with all due respect any I said it in Arabic usually I don't swear but sometimes you have to and I said it's your problem because you're the one who forced her was she willing she said no Allah she wasn't willing but I forced her because I'm young you know we have this so no no this is your problem you should suffer for that not her so this happens photographs of women is totally prohibited thirdly or not let let's not go into that because it's going to take enough much time so in this answers the question Salam she I'm Nabil I work for as a Caro supervisor for Emirates Airline I have two questions uh the first question is uh regarding about credit card um I had a credit card with me but after hearing the the Hadith of Reba like the one who promotes Reba the one who gives riba and who one who makes a profit out of a RBA it's all the same so if you consider the credit card it has the same uh facility so is this what I've done true uh the correct act or wrong now credit cards whether they're Visa Master Card Card blanch American Express Etc the transaction and the dealing is similar you buy on credit and you have 40 days approximately I'm not sure 55 this is or 45 days they call it the grace period I bought something for 10,000 R in 45 days if I don't pay they charge me Interest whether it's 5% 7% depending on the percentage so what's the ruling on this this is definitely and you have to get rid of this card she I already have the card my advice get rid of it or always uh uh charge it upload it so you know that you're going to spend 10,000 r a month so in advance deposit in it 10,000 real so as if it's like your ATM as if it's like your debit card whatever ever you buy they will take it from it and you have no problem with that adding to that you say she I know for sure I'm not going to be late for payment I'm 100% sure you cannot be you can buy something and go to hospital or be in prison or forget or get broke and riba will come to you however if even if you are 100% sure going to the bank and telling them I agree on giving you 7% if I'm late this is agreeing for riba and this is Haram and Alternatives alhamdulillah we have many Alternatives one of them is I don't know if you have it here we have in in in uh Saudi Islamic Visa meaning if you're late they block your card they never take any interest on the amount you you bought this is in Raj andad Bank free advertisement remind me to take endorsement from them and also you have another alternative tell her to stand in the line please the same uh the second um alternative is debit card deit card so debit card I give them 300 real or Dirhams a year and I charge my card for 2ou uh 5,000 10,000 40,000 and inshallah this is permissible there's nothing wrong in that but the issue with like for example if you're buying iPhone and everything and you need to have a credit account so that you can buy their apps so we are like if I try to avoid even the credit cards but like if you have an iPhone we need to get for that uh I think I Apple has their own uh App Store uh card you buy from Shops Apple so I go if I need to buy apps from Apple there are app card credit that you pay for example $50 and you buy apps as much as you want until it's finished and then you buy it again you don't need a credit card at least get an Islamic credit card if you have it here uh she the second question is like uh since you spoke about the insurance now um the RTA rule over here is that if you don't have an insurance the the car will not be registered under you so in that situation when you have been forced to have an insurance uh in that case what you are supposed to do sh insurance is categories you have third party insurance you have limited insurance you have full scale Insurance the government tells you third party insurance is mandatory correct correct this is what you want so you pay 400 500 dhams maybe a year for registration someone says yeah okay if I'm paying no I'll pay 5,000 a years because I want to fix my car in the workshop of the agency and I want extra this extra that this is Haram you take the bare minimum and there's no sin on me because the government is forcing me to do it health insurance they're forcing me to have health insurance I know it's Haram but if I don't do it they'll find me they'll put me in jail they'll extradite me then this is halal out of necessity like eating pork meat when you are starving to death and Allah knows best yes sir what is the permissible limit to keep gold as I am not able to pay zaka amount if you have gold zakat is mandatory providing it reaches the nisab which is 85 G of 24 karat of gold and a full year lunar year passes over that so if you have a sister once called she says I have 2 kilogram of gold she but I don't have money to pay zakat I said are you married what is this 2 kilog how much is this 400 ,000 no if you have 85 grams or more the most authentic opinion is that you have to be give zakat if you don't have money sell part of it don't sell it all sell one gr or two grams and pay the zakat of that but if you have a lot of gold and you say no I don't have cash hence I'm not going to uh give zakat this is Haram alaykum you already answered my question regarding the credit card but still I have one question to ask non-islamic Banks normally they give a lot of uh benefits such as cash back and uh Skyward skywards and so when we use it we accumulate this okay and there are banks like know they give even 5% 10% cash back it's like solid cash can I okay unfortunately I'm using credit card I have some cash back my question is can I take it and give it to not charity to someone who can so you're asking me about about the interest accumulated on your deposits no on a credit card here there are lot of credit cards oh so do you ask me about the points that you get point and on your credit card okay there is a difference between credit cards and your bank account when I open a bank account and I'm a Saudi I'm a rich man I put 1 million Dirham in my bank account and because I'm a VIP client every 6 month they send me an iPhone they send me routers they send me gifts vouchers all of this is Haram I cannot utilize a single thing of it why because this is straight forward riba where is the riba she when I put a million Dirham in the bank is this for safekeeping meaning they will put it in a box and lock itas it's mine no they will take it and use it and lend it to people and build buildings with it and maybe go into transactions with it ah so what is it is it an AM if I go to Sheik Muhammad and I give him 5,000 Dirham and I say keep this as AA can he go after 1 hour and buy shares in a company no this is Haram am means it has to be a deposit that is for safekeeping he cannot use it it without my permission for it then what is it and not only that if it was a mana and I gave him 5,000 R and I come tomorrow where is my money he said w i put it in my house and the house was burned to the ground and your 5,000 was burnt with it I said this is not not my responsibility give me my 5,000 we go to the Islamic Court the judge say says are you crazy this was an am he was doing you a favor and the house was burned to the ground you have nothing go even if it's a 5 million as long as I deposited as an am okay what about my million with the bank the bank was burnt to the ground and all the millions in it was burned to the ground do I say I forgive you the bank says no this is a liability that I have to pay for it why because he borrowed the money from me when I deposit money in the bank I am lending the bank money that is why he can use it wherever he wants and that is why he guarantees to return it to me in credit card it's the opposite I am the one who's borrowing from the bank so when the bank gives me points for purchasing something this is halal so whenever I buy from this grocery shop he gives me 10 points if I buy a car he gives me 40 points points these points at the end of the day I can cash into a phone into a car into an electronic Gadget this is halal inshallah there's nothing wrong providing we go to the conditions we've mentioned about the credit card earlier a couple of questions ago and I hope this answers your question okay thank you sir yes should man pay zaka from his wife for his wife or wife should pay zaka on her own if wife has has some saving which husband is not aware shall she pay zakat from this money A woman has to be smart and by Nature they're cunning and smart and a little bit devilish not a lot a little bit so if she has savings and the man does not know and she can sweet talk him honey give zakat on my three kilogram of of gold and he says yes my love I will do that for you I'm it's a gift from him and this is her strength and her smartness and there's no cheating she did not go and say I don't have money she said you pay and he says alhamdulillah then this is okay there's nothing wrong in that inallah but if he says nope I'm not going to give you a single real or Dirham she is obliged to give it from her savings or from anywhere else and Allah knows best yeah uh we know that after the death of prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam Abu Bakr was a rightful CIF but there are other categories of Muslim who says the thatz Ali he's rightful the khif so can we give any reference from Hadi or any particular proof to them how to do dawa to those category of people who say that uh some somebody else is the rightful KH this category of people do not believe in your soul sources or in your Hadith that you will quote them so if you say Abu may Allah be pleased with him said he they will say he's a cafir if you tell them okay Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him he a cfir Omar cfir cfer who's else there traitor T Zu all cfer who is there said they will name five or six only Companions and the rest are all cfer how can you speak with people like this it is narrated in bukari and Muslim the most agreed upon we don't believe in bukari and Muslim so it is pointless why should I go down to people like this give them da with all du respect the hell with them I give da to people who are receptive who will take who will believe if I say they said the prophet said they will accept but to try and convince people in the middle of the day that this is the Sun how do you know it's not Jupiter how do you know that it is the sun actually not something some other star maybe it came visiting maybe it's blocked by a a a meteoroid or oh it's a long topic so don't waste your time speaking to them the majority of Muslims accept let me take you down the road a little bit isn't Ali the most Brave man among the Companions and the most courageous the most strongest these people you're talking about what will they say definitely isn't Hussein one of the strongest and the most courageous yes couldn't they take their right from Abu Bakr Omar couldn't they fight with them why didn't they fight with them why why did Ali give his own daughter in marriage to Omar you know that Omar is married to Al's daughter if Ali thought that Abu Bakr and Omar were cfir or were Hypocrites or were traitors he would do this the lowest of people would not accept this because this is treason how do I give my honor to someone I believe he's a traitor this indicates that Ali had the full respect to Abu Bakr Omar and may Allah be pleas and there are so many things I could say to you from here till F but I it hardens the heart it makes my heart hard when I speak with such people about things that are basic it's like telling me defend your father and mother that they were married and you're not out of wedlock I will refer to my 9mm are lotteries and lucky drawers permited in is Islam Dua for increase in money memory Lottery is totally prohibited in Islam it is like wine it is like Idol worshipping and Allah has mentioned this in chapter 5 you have to avoid it second question how do we our wealth how do increase our wealth invest and invest wisely I don't know if I had the answer I would have not been here I would have been probably in my K shal or in my y you have to work you have to invest you have to seek Halal means if you're equipped for that people some people are not some people are talented and equipped to be Scholars some are equipped to be diis or orators they can speak fluent and and Captivate people some are good in administration some are good in business and getting financing some are good in writing but if they come to the podium they cannot even speak one single sentence when they write they're excellent authors so everyone is designed and created by Allah to do a special talent how to increase your wealth first first of all connect to your next of kin the prophet says whoever wants Allah to increase his wealth and to prolong his lifespan he should connect to his next ofkin so whenever you call your uncles aunts uh uh um female cousins if you're female or male cousins or your relatives and you always keep connection to them they need money you send them money Allah would Grant you money from places you never anticipated also among the reasons for increasing your wealth is to work early the prophet said said may Allah bless for my when they begin early nowadays they begin work from 9: to 5: people Begin work from after so Allah would bless this time would put a lot of Baraka in it ensure that nothing except Halal comes to you ensure that you're truthful and you show and expose what you are selling the prophet said and then he says if they are truthful and they show everything on the table Allah would bless their transaction and if they lie and deceive and conceal mistakes in and what they're selling or buying Allah would take the blessing away many many things that are possible for increasing your wealth among among and above all isul to trust Allah not to trust your ability not to trust your knowledge or your wealth or your connections only trust Allah the prophet sallallah wasallam said now translate this to to English is difficult if you trust Allah as he should be trusted he will provide to you as he provides for the birds they go away from their Nets nests in the morning empty stomach and they come in the evening with full stomach what degrees do they have how many language do they speak do they know people in the municip ality or in the governor's office nothing but they have full trust in Allah and if you trust Allah like them and you work hard like the birds do Allah would give you risk and Allah knows best sorry the question was Dua for increase in memory increase in memory he told me that it is risk and then and they didn't stop okay alhamdulillah there isn't any should I ask only one I'll take the three questions can I answer sitting down I'm to for this before you continue sister I answered you huh there is no Dua for memory so this is a short uh and direct answer I would like to know is it permissible to purchase a vehicle through my bank account for example the actual value of the vehicle is 100,000 but because I'm purchasing it through the bank with installments the they are charging me 20 uh 120,000 for the vehicles so what is the ruling on that if the bank owns and possesses the car I don't know do you have showrooms of Bank of XY Z showrooms for example in Saudi again advertising remind me uh Raji has a showroom so you pass by it Raji showroom you will find Toyota Camry Toyota Land Cruiser GMC yoken XL these are the hottest items on on on display people buy it like crazy in Saudi Arabia so he knows what the people want he puts it in you come you say I'd like to buy this in installments you buy it so he possesses it so a if he sells it for 120 140 though the original cash price is 100,000 this is totally permissible he has the right to sell whatever price he wants if you like it alhamdulillah if you don't go somewhere else but if the bank does not possess the car and he has millions and millions of Dirhams in front of him and you say I'd like to buy a Camry for 100,000 R Dirhams and he says okay I'll sell it for you uh uh for 150 and you agree and he did not purchase the car he made you sign papers and transfer your bank account to his bank and took obligations from you and uh a a commitment that you will buy it and maybe sometimes take a down payment of 10,000 just to be sure that you're serious then he goes and buy the car this is Haram and Allah knows best sisters our faith is written beforehand by Allah subhah wa ta'ala then what difference does it make if you do good deeds or bad Deeds is it okay to recite zikar while taking the body to the burial ground I don't know about the second question the first question doing good deeds and bad Deeds if our Deeds have been already written 50,000 years before Allah created the creation so what is the point of doing good deeds or bad Deeds do you believe in that sister yes or no yes if you believe in that then you have to go to B Khalifa to the last top floor and cross the fence and jump and if Allah wills it wall he will fall on your feet and walk safe again but if it's not written that you are safe you will die a miserable death so give us a call inshallah tomorrow and tell us what happens would anybody in his sound mind do this no don't you believe that Allah has written everything 50,000 years before he created the creation yes we firmly believe in that okay why don't you do this she because we are the one who are making the decision I don't know what Allah wrote for me but definitely I'm not going to go to B Khalifa not even to drink capuccino if this is the case ah then when it comes to sins and Good Deeds it's the same issue but on a smaller scale if you do good deeds you will go to Jenna if you do bad Deeds you will go to hell what did Allah write and decree for you to do is something you do not know therefore you do your level best and then what Allah decreed will happen but to intend and premeditate to sin and then accuse Allah that he made you do it someone will come to you and slap you on the face take your purse run away and say Allah made me do it would you say may Allah forgive you I know how you feel no you'll go to the police and you will run after him and if you have the 9 mmers definitely you will use it and Allah knows bestum I think we have a brother uh no this is the same question that I wanted to ask okay sister asked me for that asked me I mean asked same question for you uh the thing is that you know people uh say you and I say that this is not good it should not be done so they cannot change and what they say is that see if you believe that that is right and I am believing this is right that means everything is written and I cannot change because Allah you know everything is written beforehand that's why I'm unable to change so that was a question I didn't understand the question but I may think that I've heard similar questions uh through my life you say that if it's written yeah it cannot be changed yeah okay how do you know it was written no they when uh they say that you know uh I am like this because Allah you know wanted me to be like that okay so if I take a a knife and I stab him will he say Allah created you like this or he will complain not let's not be too violent if I smack him on the face it will hurt yes would he be angry and want to smack me back or he would say alhamdulillah I believe in destiny definitely he will act a man was brought to Omar may Allah be pleased with him and the man was a burglar he stole money so they caught him red-handed and they brought him to Omar and Omar told him why did you steal he said oh Allah decreed 50,000 years before creating the creation that I would steal today would you punish me for something that Allah decreed Omar said yes you're right and Allah decreed as well that we chop your hand take him away so you do not know what Allah decreed and hence you cannot justify your actions by it and that is why the companions ask the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam oh prophet of Allah why are we doing what we're doing why are we performing things is it something that Allah has gone through and it's over with and it's written in the books Halas finished or something that is reoccurring no he said no it is something that has been written and gone through with it's over with so the companion said then why do we do what we and why do we pray why do we do good deeds he said no you have to do your level best because everyone will do what Allah made it easy for him to do you make the choice you seek guidance from Allah asael and whatever is decreed will happen but you cannot do bad things and then say Allah uh wied it to me your child comes to you fails in all subjects and he said Allah decreed that on me your boss kicks you out of job your husband does uh cheat on you and they all claim that this is decreed no this is Haram and they don't know what is decreed uh uh beforehand it's their choice and that is why Allah will punish them for that and Allah knows best thank you this is a question from one of my friend who cannot speak English sir his question is like music is totally prohibited or any uh type of musical instrument can we can Muslim can play and there is another question is nowadays there is the uh mobile phones were ringing while doing the prayer is that how it counted in Islamic views I mean how it's the issue of music is something that I have been asked about a gazillion times so I don't know how to address it in a different way because I usually answer questions differently so that I do not become bored and I play with the question and the answer but you I've you know exhausted myself in answering the music the issue of Music in Islam first of all the issue of is it haram or Haram this is a big problem Muslims nowadays come to me and say she what's the ruling on a woman traveling without a Maham it says Haram he say Haram Haram or Haram don't look at the size of the sin look at who you are sinning against and then you will not look at a major sin or a minor sin all sins are the same because it's Allah that you're sinning second of all is it actually a sin or not the Hadith the Quran says it's a sin so Allah says in the beginning ofah this as interpreted by abdah Zu abdah Abbas abdah to be singing in the Surah of an interpreted by AB by the language of and you are singing and in Ayah 64 Allah is addressing Shan Satan provoke whomever uh uh among them with your voice muah the student of Abbas said it is the mazam it is the singing it is the pipes the authentic Hadith Muslim imari and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said there will come from my umah people who would make the following Haram things into Halal Zena fornication wearing of silk musical instruments and uh uh uh intoxicant or the consensus of the four schools of thought the school of Abu hanifah Malik sha and Ahmed they all agree that musical instruments are totally prohibited they differ whether singing Nashid is prohibited or not two of them say it's prohibited by the way this is bad news for Nashid artist and two say it is halal as long as it doesn't have any instrument musical instrument is the most extreme they say if you enjoy music you become cfir to that extent so it does affect you negatively and it affects you mentally if you listen to music if you go to the gym and it's an aerobic class and they turn on the music and everybody's right left jumping huh if one reason or the other you turn off the music everybody stops there there's no energy where are you getting the energy Froman if you're driving on khif Khalifa's Road and you're listening to uh sendon oh Mah you're doing 20 kilometers and and people are honking you giving you light beams there are low beams move said no I I have found Jenna what is this music plays with you heavy metal people can kill rappers can drink and fornicate they change your interior change your soul with music so it's definitely Haram it is intoxicating mobile ringtones this is uh humidity or water humidity masallah uh uh ringtone on mobiles is Haram because it's still music yeah if it's a a um a phone Bell no problem my grand mother's uh Bell you know the the old one it's okay but if it is notes like dor Sola or like ABCD EFG depending on the flats and the sharps and whatever and it's a mu it's music then definitely this is Haram whether in the Masjid it's extremely more Haram or outside of the Masjid and I hope this answers a question are lucky drawers permitted in Islam after questioning in the grave what happens to the soul till the day of judgment so what has lucky Dr to do with the soul two two different questions okay uh alhamdulillah I thought that will we have draws and then we would be lucky soul in the grave I would participate in that definitely um lucky draws are Halal if your intention is to buy not to win the prize for example I always shop from uh XY Z Supermarket every time I'm a customer and today I went I filled up my trolley my basket with food and on the cashier they say fill up this form and there's a lucky draw okay I fill it up and go this is halal if I win something it's 50/50 between you and me because I'm telling you it's Halal so it's okay however if I read in the newspaper that so and so Supermarket is making a draw and I never go there but because of the draw I went there and bought from them in this case this is Haram I hope this answers the question as for the soul in the grave we are told in a number of Hadith that people either will have a window on Paradise and they will get from its Breeze and from its coolness and they will see some of the beautiful things that anticipates and waits for them it will be joyful or a window to Hell Fire and they will get the Heat and they will get uh uh the bad smell and they will anticipate what will happen to them so e either a Believer or a disbeliever a bad believer in between we refrain we abstain we don't know what will happen to him and we hope for the best but it's not that promising may Allah make it easy for all of us sh for taking me as a questioner uh my wife is pregnant alhamdulillah and inshallah we're expecting a baby girl uh I've been doing some research about what to do after her birth as a parent and uh I've read the few things that uh to pronounce Yan in her in her ear as a first thing and doing and per offering the on her behalf and uh choosing a good name for her now two things that I've stumbled across why you say her not him her because we've already been told by the doctor it's a female it's a girl inshallah so the two things that I have questions about is first the when I read a few places I I stumbled where it said if it's a boy it's two sheep and if it's a girl it's one and you shave the head but then I read some other place where where the girl's head shouldn't be shaved so I was confused about that if you can shed some light on that and the second thing is were about giving a child a good name uh inshallah when she's delivered to us safely inshallah I like to give her the name Huda but then I was told that because of the meaning of it it might be a controversial name because it could be self-praise or another thing because it could be a characteristic of the Quran itself so for that reason it shouldn't be given as a name can you also answer that as well please I may forget the second question I'll repeat it when we first Ram is I depend on RAM my hard disk is gone so whenever up I I have to well it's too obsid actually noways they have USB upgrades first this is your first born uh Third born insh first okay first of all thean though very popular among jurors the Hadith is not authentic so the most authentic opinion is that you do not give the aan and definitely not give the in the second year this is the practice among people since long ago but when you trace it it is not founded Hadith is not authentic give aan to the right give to the left and maybe pray two I don't know because uh secondly uh the issue of sheep to for the boys and one for the girl there are five situations in the Shar where the man is double the woman or double the uh uh female correct for example in inheritance inheritance help me here three others huh three others three others no and blood Money okay a man when is killed the woman when is killed she is given her her her heirs are giving half of what a man gets and also in freeing a slave the prophet told usam when you free a male slave Allah frees every limb of you from Hellfire and when you free free two female slaves Allah Freeze from their limbs one of your limbs so this is double uh this and there is number five of course you all know it so don't Corner me like this I don't like and the fifth is is testimony so the testimony of one man is equivalent to the testimony of two two uh females and and males and women that is so your question was not about was it was about the Shaving of the head of a girl the Shaving of the head the Shaving of the head is one of the eates for the newborn plus giving a good name plus weighing the hair and giving in charity its way weight in Silver he say is a Sunnah and the scholars differed whether to give the female same treatment of Shaving the hair or not some of them abstained they said no the beauty of the girl is in her hair why do you shave it I differ with them as I differ with them when it comes to being fair in giving your children the same amount because our Scholars say that you have have to give the boy double the girl so if I have a boy and a girl and I want to give a gift I give him a th000 Dirham I give her 500 I differ with them not from my own there are Scholars that are backing me up alhamdulillah I can't fight this alone so other Scholars like IM B say no they have to be equal why because thei of may Allah be pleased with him and with his father the prophet asked him a straight question he said do you like all of your off Offspring to be obedient and respectful to you alike of course he says yes said then you have to be equal to them in gifts so if I give the woman or the girl half of the boy then she would say then I will respect you half of my brother and this cannot be so let's go back to the Shaving issue so shik why do you differ with those who say no we cannot shave the girl I say because the Hadith is clear the prophet saysat wasam said about the newborn he said remove the filth of his head and give sodak the weight of it in silver now the filth on the head is it only for the boys or for the girls as well when they're born newly on both definitely for both so it is definitely for both and I do this with my my daughters I shave their uh uh heads because it's cleaner for their scull for the scalp and it makes sure that inshallah we're in accordance to remove removing this uh uh um filth from their head so it's a matter of a difference of opinion I guess yes but I yeah you asking everything there is a difference of opinion everything ask any question you want all right and I'll tell you it's the difference of the opinion among Scholars but we look for the most authentic as much as we can but isn't there a Hadith that says that two things shouldn't be done to a woman I mean her raising her voice when she speaks and her shaving her head the what her there's a Hadith I read that two things shouldn't be done in regards to woman her raising her voice when she speaks and her shaving her head I don't know any such a Hadith however this Hadith can be applicable to Elders ERS corre grown up correct your daughter if she is like two days and she cries you smack her on the face don't raise your voice the same thing with the Shaving the head she wants milk so she's crying so I don't think this goes on and regarding the name that I asked Huda Huda is an issue of dispute because some Scholars do not recommend and some prohibit the names such as Iman or tawa or Huda and the reason is that they say when someone comes to the house and say is there Huda said no is there Ean no meaning she's out but what the people understand is there is no tawa there's no Im so this is misleading so must yeah I I would recommend choose something for your daughter to look up for I gave my daughters names from history some comp uh contemporary some very old but alhamdulillah I know that they know their history so say I have 13 girls bless bless them all I don't have boys at all that's why sometimes you find me a little bit feminine you know I I swim in an ocean of ostren all girls sometimes I feel like I'm growing a womb because of all the girls around me and I have all names the eldest is ARA then I have Sarah then I have I may lose count Asma then I have smma then I have sha then I have then I have then I have J then I have and then I have Muna and I have uh haer and I have safia and I have ha each one knows exactly her history she knows she says the wife of Abu Bakr the wife of Ja the wife of Ali one great woman who was married to three great men unbelievable so she knows her Legacy if she if I say this or that everyone knows their homework inshallah they have someone to look for but if I have a name like safas who's safas I don't know there has to be either a good meaning a strong and beautiful meaning or a legacy a a history that they look up for Allah knows yes are sh Muslim are sh Muslim all who say Muhammad Allah are Muslim until proving otherwise the prophet says in authentic whoever prays our prayer faces our eats our slaughtering then he has what we have and against him is what's against us so Shia yes they're Muslims until proven anybody don't be offended if I'm saying they're Muslims so they are Muslims however if they nullify Islam then they they don't become Muslim but I cannot uh uh brush paint all of them I cannot say all of the sh aref why because I need evidence this man prays I had a Shia who prays with me all five prayers never ever cursed Abu Bakr or Omar but he says I'm a Shia and I didn't see anything that nullifies Islam what do I say to him but if someone comes to me and says Abu Bakr Omar they're all cfir or the Quran you have is not the real Quran the real Quran is mus Fatima and not a single word in your Quran is in mus FAA where is mus Fatima only the scholars have it but this is not the Quran there is a Quran there is a Surah that was not in your Quran Ali you don't have it in the Quran because your Quran is distorted this is a CF you don't have to think twice if he Slanders mother AA and she he say accuses her of adultery you step on him he is a cafir you don't ask two questions more other than that if he only curses or says bad things about the sahabah he's a bad Muslim but still it's not an act that nullifies Islam and so on and Allah knows best I goam Alay alhamdulillah dear shh on behalf of almanar we thank you for your time may Allah subhana wa ta'ala increase your knowledge and benefit for the umah and dear uh brothers and sisters may Allah subhana wa tala reward you for being with us two days and may Allah increase your knowledge and benefit for your life here and life Hereafter all the volunteers thank you for your support and Allah subhana wa ta'ala reward you in this dun and hereafter"
