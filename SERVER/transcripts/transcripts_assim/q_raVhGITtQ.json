  "transcript": "Abdul Bari from Ghana Assalamu Alaikum Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Please, I wanted to ask, I heard that around from Asr Salah going, it's not good for you to sleep This is not authentic nor true. There is no time that is prohibited for you to sleep. As people say, whoever sleeps after Asr prayer, if he becomes insane, he has only himself to blame. This is not true. And this is a fabricated hadith. It is totally permissible and fine to sleep after Asr as long as you know that you will wake up before sunset to be able to pray Maghrib. And Allah knows best."
