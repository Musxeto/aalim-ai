  "title": "Can we name a girl / female after an angel (Malak, Malaak etc)? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "but unfortunately a lot of the females nowadays are called malak and malak or malak means angel and this is totally prohibited to name a female by the name of angel because this is what the idol worshipers used to describe the angels of being being females and being daughters of allah azzawajal so if your name as a female is malek you have to change this name you"
