  "transcript": "I was talking about something that always astonished me about the people from the subcontinent masha'Allah Tabarrok Allah they are so observant to their nawafil you rarely see someone from India Bangladesh or Pakistan missing his nawafil and the Prophet says I am 12 rocailles 12 records during the day in the night whoever observes them alone would build him a house in paradise and when I come to see my fellow Arabs and other Muslims and the way they neglect and I'm one of them the way they probably miss one or two every now and then out of laziness out of wanting to leave the Masjid out of it brings question marks about our commitment to Islam I brought this as an introduction to say that we have a problem with the people from the subcontinent when it comes to praying in the Masjid in Fez your prayer they have this common mistake they come late to the Masjid the Imam is in the first rocaille reciting the fatiha instead of joining the congregation they go and pick a pillar of the message and create to work as of Sunnah and sometimes they miss the first record of the congregation pray because of this well this is what I wanted to advise my brothers and sisters that their prayer when the Imam has started well actually before that their prayer when the Elven has a gala given the Akama for the salat is invalid the Prophet Isis Salam said when the prayer is being called for that is after the Akama there is no prayer valid except the man that you repair the one that it has been cold for so you cannot and you should not hear the Akama and start your sunnah prayer it is invalid because what's mandatory upon you is to join the congregation to be in the first row if you can and to attend the first act by Allah if you can this is what I wanted to say with all admiration and love to the brothers and sisters from the subcontinent"
