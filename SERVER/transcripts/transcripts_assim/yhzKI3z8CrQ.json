  "title": "If I add & omit something from the salah, do I make sujood as sahu before or after Tasleem?",
  "transcript": "he says if i add and omit something in salah which says do i do inside salah before the salaam or outside salah after the salam so his question mainly revolves around a person who did two mistakes or more one mistake requires that he offers two prostration of sujud before salah the second mistake requires that he performs sujud after sallam so which one should he choose or should he do both no it seems that he should do the one before sallam because this is within the prayer and he did do something that requires doing it before salaam so this takes care of the one after the salaam as well and he only does this one before the salaam you"
