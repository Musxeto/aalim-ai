  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bosnia Sheikh a brother was given a credit card by \nsomeone else to use it and to buy whatever he   wants with it, he was in doubt because the credit \ncard isn't Halal, is it permissible for him to use   his credit card or not, the credit card doesn't \nbelong to him, but it belongs to the other person?   As long as he's going to use it to buy a Halal \nproduct with it and at the same time refund the   money, the actual amount that he bought \nit with to the owner of the credit card,   it's not his downfall, it's not his responsibility \nwhether he's going to pay it in instalments or   pay interest over it or not, there's no \nproblem on you in using that credit card,   you bought an amount of a hundred dollars, \nyou take the hundred dollars and give it   to the owner of the credit card and the \nrest is his problem and Allah knows best."
