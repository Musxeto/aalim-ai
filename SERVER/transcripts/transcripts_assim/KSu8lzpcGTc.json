  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the UK um so we know that \nwhen you buy a gold there's some conditions   have to be met um I checked online and if \nyou you check that you can't buy gold through   online because it takes a couple of days \nto come so I'm wondering if you go into a   shop and you pay by debit card uh can you get \nthe gold uh by using a debit card in person   that makes sense yes it makes sense okay the \ncondition of buying gold via gold or via cash   so let's talk about cash this is what you're \ntalking about in terms of exchange the   prophet made it crystal clear that it has to be \nsimultaneous here's the money I received the gold   online is not permissible because I'm sending \nyou the payment by the time the shipment comes   to me it's a day or two maybe more maybe less \nbut it's not simultaneous I'm not giving and   taking at the same time as if I'm in a shop the \nissue that you've raised up is going to the shop   picking a necklace it costs 200 quid and I give \nmy card to the shop owner now if it is a credit   card this is not permissible because he \nwill not receive the amount immediately   and the amount would not be paid from my side \nimmediately I have a 40 Days of Grace Grace Period   and there can be many things that might go wrong \nso this is not permissible if it's an ATM card   so immediately once I give him the card and he \nchecks it the money is transferred from my bank   account immediately to his bank account he gets \nan SMS I get an SMS so this is simultaneous it's   like Cash There's no problem in that now if \nthe debit card is the same as the ATM meaning   that on immediate effect they deposit the money \nin his bank account this is also permissible if   not if it's going to take a day or two this is not \npermissible and I hope this answers your question"
