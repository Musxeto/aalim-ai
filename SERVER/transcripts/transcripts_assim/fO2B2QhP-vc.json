  "title": "Cousin prays 2 rakats of repentance every time he sees a woman on YouTube! (first glance) | Assim Al",
  "transcript": "ayub says his cousin has a sort of anxiety problem so whenever he watches youtube if he sees a woman randomly as in the case of an ad or a woman just comes out of the blue he rushes to pray the prayer of repentance and he is arguing with him saying that this is not needed you are entitled for the first glance so he's asking is is his comment valid or not first of all we have to look at your cousin's state of mind meaning that if he was intentionally watching something haram in this case what he has done is perfectly fine praying for forgetfulness praying repentance prayer is highly recommended because he sinned intentionally and deliberately so the way out is to repent to ask allah for forgiveness whether it's a first second third glance it was done intentionally so i cannot turn on the tv or watch a video clip or a youtube clip that i know contains women with revealing clothes and just pretend that this is the first glance some of the brothers would make the first glance take like a couple of minutes and it just is not blinking what are you doing he said this is my first glance don't waste my time and he's stares at it without even blinking thinking that this is halal for him no this is not halal first glance means that it was accidental so i was driving and i saw something on my left side i took a look it was a woman i immediately returned my uh lowered my gaze and looked the other way around but to look and say okay 1001 1002 1003. what are you doing this is my first glance usually it takes like five to ten seconds no this is totally bogus haram so if this is the case then what he's doing is correct if he was watching a halal clip he was watching something about animals something about sports that is halal and a woman came randomly for a second and and left in this case no he's not supposed to be anxious he's not supposed to be afraid because he did not intend to sin the place was not a place of sin so there is no sin on him whatsoever and allah azza knows best"
