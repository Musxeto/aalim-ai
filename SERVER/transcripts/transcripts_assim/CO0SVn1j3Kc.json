  "transcript": "um mad's uh second question was about Salat and Salat is mentioned in some of the books of F and it is a a prayer that you do when you have need when you want something from Allah but the most authentic opinion is that the Hadith is not authentic the Hadith is weak and we cannot use it or utilize it however alhamdulillah Allah did not close the door for us to supplicate to him on the contrary he opened the whole wide door for asking Allah and begging him so there are times between your supplication is answered the prophet tells us when it when it's raining Allah will answer your call when it is at the last third of the night two to three hours before thean of this is a time where Allah answers those who supplicate and invoke him and ask him for their needs also when you are prostrating whether in F Salah or voluntary Salah you can ask Allah whatever you want while prostration all the the way 24/7 also before you conclude your prayer so after tah and offering the solitation to the prophet Alam and before Salam you are instructed by the prophet to choose whatever Dua you want so alhamdulillah don't uh limit yourself to this prayer which is not uh authentic"
