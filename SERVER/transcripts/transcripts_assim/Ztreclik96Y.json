  "transcript": "Mahjoub from the US Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Ok so I am a computer science student so I program a lot and I have a software that helps me like program sometimes whenever I get stuck it will like help me assist in writing my program so sometimes when I am programming the AI will sometimes just finish the code for me and I am so shocked because sometimes these are just in my thoughts and I am like woah how did it know and then I get what's west and I am like oh you committed shuyukh and all this but it takes me time to realize that you know the AI has so much knowledge from the internet like a bunch of data as well as it takes the data from what you typed and it tries to formalize like a final answer and my issue is I don't want to keep thinking that I committed shuyukh and then fall into this west west trap that I had years ago so what do you think I should do in this case? This is totally absurd you are a computer scientist student you should know of all people that this is not rocket science it's only a matter of algorithms and predictions based on previous people's work and this is like auto dictation or correction so if I write two letters and the computer or the smart phone finishes the whole word there is no shuyukh in it woah it knows the future so I start rubbing it and saying okay maybe it will grant me three wishes there is nothing like that you should of all people know better that this is science there is no shuyukh in it there is no prediction of knowing the unseen and the likes so just ward it off and move on and Allah azza wa jal knows best"
