  "transcript": "Faison from Kashmir. How are you? Alhamdulillah. Why is everybody asking me how am I? Every time saysalamlaykum, how are you? I hope you're doing well. Come let's have some and some shba and some coffee guys please. I I enjoy your good feelings and asking me good questions about how I feel. But I would highly appreciate to keep the socialization somewhere else when you come and visit Jidda and we meet rather in this program just go straight to your question. Sam from Canada. I think they learn from me when I say how are you to you every day. This is for you and for everybody else. Today's episode, I already had three callers saying, \"How are you doing? How do you feel?\" Yaki, do I look like I'm having a heart attack? Everybody's asking how you I don't know what's what's happening, but nevertheless, yes. What's your question, Sam?"
