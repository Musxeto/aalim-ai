  "title": "\"And I (Allah) am time\" - Saying, \"I have some time to kill\" wrong? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um she are you familiar with the saying in English um I have some time to kill yep what's the what's the crime of time to kill it is it allowed to say this saying if there's a Hadith that do not curse Allah for his time no no no this is totally separate issue the Hadith you're referring to is the the son of Adam is insulting me or harming me he insults time and I am time now all Scholars agree that time is not one of Allah's beautiful names or his attributes however this is to refer to the issue when someone someone says damn that day I met you it was a horrible day it was a cursed day now the day has nothing to do with it you are cursing what made you fall into meeting that person or doing that action so you're actually insulting Allah because he's the one who pre-ordained this upon you not time and not the day or the year and therefore when someone says I have time to kill he's not insulting time it's a metaphoric phrase to indicate that I don't have anything to do I'm just spending my time trying to make time run so they these are two separate things and Allah Knows Best"
