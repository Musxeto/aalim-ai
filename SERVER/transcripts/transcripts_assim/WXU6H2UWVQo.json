  "title": "Is fasting the 10 days of Dhul Hijjah not authentic? - Assim al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "when I got married my husband told me not to fast arafah and he reported the Hadith where Isha may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet saws never fasted the 10 days of the Hijra and this is an issue of dispute first of all fasting the day of arafah I don't know anyone with knowledge would say that it is not recommended let alone not permissible the hadiths are in the sahih nobody can argue with this the prophet said I'm fasting the day of arafah I hope that Allah would forgive and erase the sins of two years and fasting the day of Ashura the tenth of Muharram would expiate the sins of one year and this is authentic there's no doubt in that now the issue of the 10 days of the Hijra the first 10 days of the Hijra this is an issue of the dispute but the vast majority of Scholars say that the authentic hadiths stated that it is a Sunnah and some wives of the Prophet Islam reported that he used to fast them but even if he did not fast them he himself said there are no days on Earth where Good Deeds are more loved to Allah than these 10 days of the this includes fasting charity prayers whatever you want the whole nine yards so definitely what your husband is saying is bogus and not true shamim from the youth"
