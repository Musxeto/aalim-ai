  "title": "OCD with Istinja (Excessive Rubbing) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "faison from india i had one question uh a few months ago started and i had wasfasting and although in all matters almost now alhamdulillah the only was fast is in uh means excessive rubbing okay i tried many things i saw the cam but i asked people but nothing seems to work can you please advise me what do you mean what's happening uh what is happening is i don't know but how much ever i try i can't just reduce the water pouring and rubbing i i just tried my best and even then i can't do it it's affecting my other acts of worship okay i will answer inshallah brother faizan from india says that he has a problem when it comes to esthinja which is clearing the passage after answering the call of nature and it's inja is something that is part of our religion and it is part of our life so it is not something that people say uh disgusting we shouldn't talk like this on public tv etc no it is an essential part of our religion in a muslim a group of jews approach salman al-faris may allah be pleased with him mocking and making fun or showing and expressing their irritation either way so they said to him your prophet taught you everything even how to take a crap excuse my french he said yes he taught us not to face or give our backs to the qibla when defecating and not to hold our private parts with our right hand and not to cleanse ourselves with less than three stones and to uh not to cleanse ourselves with a piece of dung animal dung or with bones so everything was explained to us now why do people get with us and this is the one million kuwaiti dinar question i get so many counseling sessions with the grace of allah eighty percent of them is on with and with the grace of allah azzawajal those who come rarely come back again because it takes them few minutes to understand but they need to have this in their minds shaytan comes to you when you are inclined to be religious and pious he doesn't come to you with these thoughts of cleanliness and purity if you're ignorant if you don't pray on time if you party all night long if you free mix if you neglect salat he doesn't even bother with you on these topics he has a different agenda because people are divided into two types when it comes to whispering of shaytan so if you're inclined to be practicing if you fear allah fear hell fire fear that your prayer is not going to be accepted you are a fertile ground for shaytan for iblees for satan to mess up with you so how does he do it he approaches those who have little knowledge and with little knowledge you can do wonders if someone has little knowledge i can make him a terrorist i can make him an infidel i can make him leave the fold of islam i can make him do heinous things he has no knowledge so i can control him i can play with him i can mold him as i wish once you get the knowledge then you have surrounded yourself with a very high fence that it is almost impossible for shaytan to penetrate or to cross over so what to do people have been urinating and defecating since adam peace be upon him so why would it be only you that masha allah you fear allah azzawajal that you're getting these whispers all the shu all the students of knowledge all the normal muslims have no problem and you're the only one who's careful has to be something wrong what is wrong is shaytan he's messing with your mind so what to do first of all rule number one certainty is not affected or impacted by doubt so all the time you will find that everything that you do is based on doubt not uncertainty and this is why you say maybe a drop came out maybe this was the trace of so and so i guess the wetness i felt during salat was something that i discharged perhaps all of this is to be taken and put in a paper bag not a plastic bag to avoid uh environment pollution and you throw it in the dustbin because doubt has no impact in our lives this is a gateway for shaytan to enter into our minds block it and you are safe to go second thing which is very important that you block the means that shaytan would come to you so usually if you feel that there is a drop or two coming out after urinating ask yourself do i have you you're in incontinence how do i know sheikh if you are dripping urine 24 hours seven days a week week it's always dripping dripping no matter what you do this means you have a problem but if you don't you simply have this feeling after urinating performing we'll do one while doing prayer 10 15 minutes after prayer you don't have any feeling until the following prayers then this is a great sign that shaytan is messing up with you what to do when you urinate while sitting just relax don't squeeze yourself don't squeeze your private part don't even do anything just relax and once it stops you pour water on your private part you wash the area without squeezing without con contracting your muscles nothing you just pour water on it and sprinkle some water on your underwear so it's a little bit damp a little bit wet once you stand up perform muddle and go to pray if you get the feeling that oops i feel something came out ignore it and convince yourself that this is the dampness the wetness of the water that i had sprinkled if you fight this over and over again in three or four days you will not have this feeling at all it will stop for about a month or two shaytan is giving you a pause and then afterwards he will try again you follow the same process and believe me you will never ever complain from this again insha'allah"
