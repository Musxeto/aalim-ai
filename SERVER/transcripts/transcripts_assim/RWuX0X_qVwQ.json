  "transcript": "Nabila says is it allowed to open the Koran app in the phone while praying taraweeh prayer at home if you're alone or leading someone yes you can open the app and read from it during taraweeh - is it allowed to switch on the recitation - so we have the text of the Quran in front of us and are also listening to the recitation specifically if someone is not very fluent in reading the Quran the answer is no why not also watch the news this is not befitting for you to be praying and reading which you have to do and then now you're listening to the Quran and maybe someone else's okay I read the Quran but I also read the translation and either read the commentary why not read so I shall go Hari as well no this does not fit praying you can hold the mobile phone or the Quran you can read from that but you should not listen and follow that an allah azza wajal knows best"
