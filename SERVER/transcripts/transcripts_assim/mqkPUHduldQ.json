  "transcript": "[Music] asalam alaykum because of my problems and tensions I cannot sleep well I lost many things and I'm worried about my future nothing I can do except makes make Dua my question is I want to live peaceful life so how to live peaceful and how to get calmness and Tranquility in my a very good question and a lot of the Muslims go through this same P one time or the other in their lives and peacefulness tranquility and calmness is what own people look after and seek Muslims and non-muslims alike they all are pursu peaceful life the Peace of Mind the tranquility and a life without tension and this can only be attained by and by temporary means per means can only be awarded to the True Believers if you want to attain peace and Tranquility in your life and one may say aren't we all TRS and the answer is no unfortunately we're not we are Muslims either by birth or by conviction however to be a True Believer is a higher degree it's a level where a person believes that whatever happened to him it is by Allah's Dee and it would not have missed him because Allah wrote that upon him so once you know this once you believe in Allah's decree once you believe in Allah's pre- ordaining things upon you this brings C to your heart so no matter what happens you're always calm and peaceful it may hurt in the beginning but it is like the injection a person gets the noodle itself hurts once it penetrates your body but then the pain goes away it reported in the books of history that the son of asak may Allah be pleased with her and her father his name was and his father was the famous companion of the prophet and one of the 10 Heaven [Music] bound and his brother was the companion of the prophet andd Zu Zu may Allah have mercy and his soul was not a companion but he was one of the great Scholars of Medina actually one of the great seven it was Syria eight beautiful handsome strong sons and they were part of the dignitaries of qur so they were prominent and they were quite known they are the descendants of Abu Bakr may Allah be pleas with him and of Zu so it was a great lineage it was reported that when he entered to visit the KF one of those attending at the cf's court gave them or gave him or gave one of his son the evil eye in that night Subhan Allah one of his sons entered the stable off the CIS to see and check the horses and one of the horses ran him over and killed him and the same moment the very moment the doctors checked on his leg because he he was complaining from his leg and they said that we have to amputate your leg otherwise you will die so they told him we have to do this and he said do whatever you want they tried to give him something intoxicating so that he would not feel the p s and cut his leg and he told him I would something that would take my mind away from mentioning Allah's name and remembering him subhanahu wa ta'ala so they gave him uh so they ask him what to do because it is very painful he said to them give me time and until you see me indulging in my prayer in my Vick then do whatever you want and once they saw him do his VI and he is concentrating in Remembering Allah they started to S his leg until they amputated it and he did not say a word in the same night two calamities struck this great Muslim believer his son was killed and his leg was amputated after it finished the operation was finished and they broke the sad news to him he praised Allah and said the Dua he grabbed his leg he kissed it and put it down and said by Allah I have never walked to Haram with my leg and Allah knows this and then he addressed Allah saying oh Allah if you have taken by Allah you have given me a lot and if you have tested me with this Calamity by Allah you have given me Prosperity throughout my life throughout my life look at the way that this man received such two strong blows if anyone one of us were to receive one of them it would have probably gave him a stroke or a heart attack but because he's a Believer he knows that everything is from Allah he was patient tolerant and satisfied with what Allah has ordained upon him and this is what every believer must do Scholars say that a wise man does what a fool does in a Calamity after one month if you have two people one is wise and the other one is a fool what the fool would do after being struck by a Calamity a mon later is what the wise man would do on the spot a Calamity strikes a fool he shouts he complains he swears he bangs his head on the wall he is in a fous state rage one day two days a week two weeks after a month is history it's gone nothing changed the Calamity did not go it was not removed it remained as it is but after a month every he calmed down a wise person a Believer a true M would do on the first day what this fool did a month later because he knows that no matter what he does the Calamity will remain so why gain more sins why gain a lot of displeasure of Allah instead you should be tolerant and accept what Allah has decreed therefore if you have disbelief in you if you have true dependence and Trust in Allah if you have real tole on Allah you will not be dis spared at all you would not feel the tension of this life life would become easy for you no matter what calamities take place it may sadden you for a while but then you believe alhamdulillah this is not my own doing Allah ordained this upon me so I'm accepting it I'll try my best to remove it I'll try my best to fight it I'll try my best to CH my status but with a calm and peaceful heart if you do this inshallah you will taste the beauty and having the Trust In Allah and Allah knows best iot to mention that there are temporary means of getting this peace and tranquility and that is by watching movies by listening to music by engaging in Haram activities by consuming intoxicant drugs Etc this may give you Tranquility for an hour or two it's temporary but after it's gone you find that the tension and the discomfort and the lack of peace of mind increases and you have to take more tranquilizers you have to take more things to calm it down but it would never maintain calming down down and you would be uh uh sort of addicted to these Haram means neither you have gained the pieace of Mind nor you were safe from Allah's punishment on the day of judgment and Allah [Music]"
