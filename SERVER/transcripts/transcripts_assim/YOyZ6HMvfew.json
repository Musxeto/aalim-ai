  "title": "What is the Sunnah to be done during Burial & Funeral - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Hammad sent us an email saying that in burial procedure when we pray funeral prayer then what here a lot of the Muslims after funeral prayers or before they recite Quran make dua together or after putting him to the grave then again they recite what exactly should be done first of all as Muslims it is not the word of mouth that we practice our religion so what we usually learn from our ancestors is not necessarily true and hence we have to go back to the Quran and to the Sunnah and if we go back to the sooner we don't see any such thing as reciting the Quran making duaa from the moment he died till the moment we bathed him till the moment we shrouded him and perfumed him till the moment we took him to the Masjid till the moment we offered funeral prayer then we carried him to his grave put him down his grave then put a soil on top of his body and bury him there's nothing prescribed so is it open nothing is prescribed so if you say may Allah forgive him may Allah have mercy on him no problem reciting the Quran is an innovation and congregational dua before is also an innovation afterwards is an issue of dispute especially when the people don't know what to say so what is the prescribed the only thing we have prescribed is that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam after finishing burying one of the companions he said 'i still fear allah a Hickam resolutely had a who death beat for in nevada you said two things seek Allah's forgiveness for your brother so oh Allah forgive him oh Allah give him forgiveness and ask Allah to make him steadfast steadfast on what is dead yes but he's being now he's being questioned by the two angels who's your Lord who's your messenger what is your religion what have you done in it so these are questions posted and they are addressed to this deceased so you ask allah allahumma thabbit'hum ala make him steadfast o Allah teach him what to say and how to respond correctly this is the time of draw nothing else so if you spend after the burial like 10 minutes 15 minutes facing the Qibla seeking a lot forgiveness for the deceased making dua for him to expand his grave to fill it up with lights open a window to paradise to make him steadfast etc this is good but there is nothing else other than that"
