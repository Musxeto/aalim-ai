  "title": "Sins, Repentance and Forgiveness - Legacy of the Prophets (Part 2)- Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh shaykh abdul rahim Salah he gave us a good reminder and I don't think I have much to add to it with the exception of I may go into some detail about some of the prophets peace and blessing of Allah so VLP upon them all the problem is that the prophets and messengers of Allah are so great we would not do them justice if we talk about one individual in ten lectures let alone to combine more in a single lecture the prophets and messengers of Allah Azza WA JAL they are the cream of Allah's creation they are the elite they are the superstars if you wish Allah Azza WA JAL could have sent the Quran hello revealed to us and we acknowledge that it is from Allah but it would not work because we would say this is good for angels this is good for people not like us so Allah Azza WA JAL sent his ambassador sent his messenger so that the people would see that this human can implement a las commands and he is our role model and the prophets and messengers of Allah Azza WA JAL as stated they are Allah's ambassadors they convey a Las message to us and interpret it in the best of form and that is why it is an article of faith we have pillars of Eman and one of the pillars of Eman is to believe in these prophets and messengers and whoever discredit them whoever displaces them whoever ridicules or make fun or say a joke or even laugh at a joke said about them he's a kafir even if he prays five times a day even if he fasted Ramadan even if he performs how every single year against the Circulo I can't I can't perform Hajj every year I'm a Saudi people say oh so how do does this and that it's a rule for everybody five years a once every five years unless you're a dye then this is a different issue so their position their level in Islam is very high and Allah Azza WA JAL mentioned them a lot in the Quran so whenever you read the quran you hear a lot of them mentioning why is it just history no every single letter in the Quran has a purpose and we have a very big problem is that we do not respond we do not recite we do not contemplate and ponder upon the Quran and that is why Allah humiliated us allah azza wajal made all the kafir nation on top of us and their feet on our necks because we don't have any pride now having pride does not mean to go and kill and bomb people having pride is to abide by the Quran and Sunna the most peaceful person was the Prophet is a lot to say how did he treat the Jews in a very kind way even when the Jew was sick he goes to his house he visits him and he calls him to Islam when a Jun woman invites him to a sheep that she filled with poison especially in the shoulder he accepts her visit her invitation and he doesn't go and say no she's a Jew and she's a woman he accepts her a sauna so this is the way that we should look at the prophets of Allah so you know one would argue and say we have the Prophet on in solution he's sufficient he is he is sufficient but Allah ordered us in the Quran to follow all the messengers of allah allah azzawajal says in the Quran indeed there has been an excellent example for you in brahim and those with him sallallahu alayhi wasallam and that is why ibraheem' is one of the greatest messengers of allah do we love him yes we do to the extent that when we pray the Prophet taught us a resolution to send salutation to him as to send salutation to Ibraheem not only that it is part of our a peda it is part of our deen to love those whom he loved him and to hate those who hate him do you know that this is part of our religion our Aveda unfortunately our art EDA has been diluted has been dissolved so that everything fits it's like one size fits all toward Islam your Judaism you and Christianity you want Buddhism everything is it goes after there is the most important thing with these messengers and prophets of Allah as you have the rahim stated to the extent that we are ordered in Islam whenever we see a house lizard to kill it from the first blow and Allah will give us 100 husana if we kill it in two blows Allah would give us less has an ad and if we kill it in three blows Allah would give us less and less why is the lizard what's so special about the lizard is an issue of apena it's an issue of belief it's an issue of love to the prophets and messengers when Ibraheem was thrown peace be upon him in the fire that they had built all creatures all animals and insects and living beings tried to put off the fire except the lizard it kept on blowing so that it would grow more and more and that is this is the hadith authentic hadith ah so the Prophet is telling us this is why we kill the lizard among other reasons but it's an issue of Ikeda our religion is based on a leader it is based on do's and don'ts but it is based on your heart so we love them we follow them and the Prophet was instructed to follow them as well when Allah tells him there are the V they are those whom Allah had guided so ya Muhammad Muhammad Salla Soleimani follow their guidance we don't have time to talk about what was advertised and that is the repentance of Adam the dower of Noor and the perseverance of Ibrahim peace be upon him because each topic requires literally a couple of lectures but maybe I'll try to go inshallah discuss with you the first two and what I'm going to say inshallah like share abdurraheem said it's not rocket science in the sense that you all know this information this is a reminder and we pray that Allah shall open our hearts to remember and to benefit because so many things we hear so much information is poured into our brains and hearts but only those whom Allah guides would benefit so try your level best don't analyze me don't analyze Jeff at the Raheem don't label us don't look at us and say you did this you said that what you hear try to only look and analyze yourself and see how it fits you and see how you can benefit from it Adam peace be upon him he is the father of all humanity and he is as stated in the hadith the first prophet ever sent Shalala re usin them and who is the first messenger not sure who the rahim definitely who's the first messenger no and how many years separated them one thousand years ten centuries as the Prophet said that is a lot to say Adam is unlike any other messenger or prophet because he was created by Allah's hand and the Prophet told the sorry swap some that there are fourth that Allah created with his hands one the pen that registered everything from here till the day of the judgement and this was done fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation so the pen was created by Allah's hand the throne was created by Allah's hand the gardens of Eden may Allah make me and you among those who enter it was created by Allah's hand and Adam and that is why when a large Dajjal told us a shape on Satan why don't you or why didn't you prostrate to whom I created with my own two hands Satan did not say I was created by your own two hands as well like everything else no satanic knowledge yes I was not but I am better than him I was created from fire and he was created from clay or mud Adam allah azza wajal honored him to the extent that he ordered all the angels to prostrate and they did prostrate them peace be upon him as we know his story and we're not going to go through that you all know that Allah told him do not eat from that forbidden tree he disobeyed Allah Azza WA JAL and he went astray to error and he ate from it and you know what had happened so what can we learn from the legacy of Adam first of all we can learn from it that even those who are great even those who are prominent even those who are high can fall can sin so 0.1 do messengers sin the answer is yes do they make major sins the answer is definitely no not a single messenger does major sins do they make minor sins it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion that they do because this was mentioned in surah Taha in black in white Allah says la raza Adam or Abajo and Adam disobeyed his Lord and he strayed into error so this is mentioned Allah is the one who told us that Adam sent and not only that Allah mentioned in surah al-qasas where Moosa when moosa knocked that coptic down with one blow mashaallah was not mm a professional and just that's it is gone he's history so he said oh Allah I have wronged myself severely and I repent - and I ask and seek your forgiveness so forgive me and Allah forgave him no yo knows when he was swallowed by the whale what was the thing that metalizer will rescue him what was the thing that he said that the Prophet told the solution whenever there is a calamity that befall upon you say the word and allah azza wajal would relieve you and whenever you depressed say the word and alonso would relieve you and wherever you supplicate say the word allah allah would answer you what is this beautiful world the ilaha illa anta subhanak in coming to me Nirvana mean what beautiful admission what beautiful confession I'm not saying get me out of the whale it's dark I can't see I can't breathe he didn't say that he knows that Allah knows what's happening in humility in submissiveness there is no God worthy of being worshipped but but you I acknowledges and I acknowledge that I have been among the wrongdoers so lesson number two the most important thing for us to learn from the legacy of Adam is that you confess your guilt the majority of us sin right left and center and when someone tells you if he ask allah for forgiveness repent to allah this is how long-- what's harm I don't kill I don't drink I don't play i gamble I don't steal I don't fornicate hamdullah don't have any sins what should I confess off we have a problem because each and every individual has a sin or more the prophet said that is salat wa salam Kulu bani adama' hapa the majority if not the majority every single son of adam is is sinful and the best of sin of those who are sinful those who repent so the first degree of repentance is that you have to confess if you have an illness what is the first step for you cure to admit that you are ill and go to the doctor I have brothers coming to me and say ah hey this brother of ours he is possessed with jidan he has black magic and he has an evil eye and he was young chief what is this this is ASDA this is nothing he has everything in in one place ok I say take him to someone to make rakia for him he said what liar he he doesn't admit he refuses isn't there's nothing wrong in me and this is a problem I can give you the cure if you're willing to take it but if you're not then how can I cure you likewise you want unless forgiveness you have to confess confess to whom then after the lecture insha Allah you come to me and say share forgive me for I have sent him with nothing in a Catholic Church don't come to me I don't have a box do you see a wooden box next to me you see a caller said yeah you said confess yesterday I did this and as it was you know it was Saturday night and I went to the apartment had couple lagers and then went to the disco and did this and that it and I met this bird Wow and what share ham Dylan I'm confessing if you do this alone not forgive you imagine if you tell someone about your sin Allah will not forgive you it was reported in the hadith in Bukhari and elsewhere that the prophet sallallaahu salem said cool no Mattie Martha the whole of my Ummah Allah will forgive them Wow as easy as that yes ll Mujahideen with the exception with those who do it in public and the Prophet says that among the things that are considered to be done in public is that you sin at night and then when it's morning and Allah has concealed your sin nobody knows about it you tell your friend ah he didn't you know last night I did so is so-and-so so he exposes his sin along will never forgive this now compare this to the brothers when I see them much aligned their fancy cars blowing rap music I have a degree in linguistics English linguistics I can't not understand what are they saying seriously and and the brothers I look at him he's a Muslim he looks dark-skinned you like us someone yeah what are you doing I'm chillin I'm chillin you're not chillin you are warming up for hell man it's gonna be hot why because he did not agree unless OGL made you weak to music roll up your windows put the volume down listen to it with remorse and sadness and confession or Allah I'm weak help me and when you stop at the traffic light and there's another brother Muslim next to you turn it off as if you're not doing anything this means you shall are you close to repentance but if you don't care I could care less I'm not afraid of anyone I am brave I am strong in this case Allah will not forgive you so you have to confess your sin and also we learn that there is a difference in Finny say it and send them peace be upon him sint is it the same motive no Adam's sin was out of weakness out of forgetfulness human nature Satan sent out of pride arrogance no I'm not gonna frustrate why I am better this logic a lot of the Muslims use and this logic entitles them to be with Satan on the day of judgment why he Reba is hallam yeah yeah yeah Surat al-baqarah and sure its own so yeah everybody Haram I say you have a mortgage and you're paying gibbehh yeah yeah this is nothing this okay it's okay mashallah why is it okay yeah theologically these kafir take our money and we pay them taxes so at least we could do is take their money you're not taking their money you're giving them interest okay you are cheating and lying to the government you have three wives and twelve children and all of your wives are registered as single mothers the every year they go with their belly like a mashallah pregnant and she says yeah I'm a signaler mother and she's wearing the whole hijab and covered up you're a liar yeah it's okay it's okay the government god save the queen this is a lie this is a cheat you cannot a Muslim does not do this and you got so on and on and on so what is your the motive of your sin if it is stemmed from your weakness and human nature inshallah you're in good hands eventually you'll be strong as long as you do not argue and debate and say no no it's okay no so many times I speak to a brother every smoking is Haram and out of arrogance you look at my big this is this long and at least they give me a credit Dhamma shake yeah yeah another scholar but he respect me he says you know smoking is not Haram Isis Harlan say no no no if it's Haram we're burning it if it's halal we're smoking it what kind of logic is he doing that Subhan Allah so he justifies another brother I mean if he smoking is Haram immediately he turns puts it officer to Allah and sure I've been trying for a couple of years yeah sure I asked her I urge you make dua for me and this is your responsibility I want to quit I am unable and they cry well like some of them cry I spoke once to don't say this to my wife because she's gonna kill me I was coming from Egypt to Jeddah and when I travel I usually travel with my jeans and t-shirts and in first class so this this this hostas comes and she says she and she recognized me I don't know how maybe it's a beard she said sure can I ask you a question and the full the first class lounges is full so they see this woman talking to me and I'm lowering my gaze I'm looking at the ground trying my level best because maybe somebody has a camera and then I'm in trouble nice night I was watching so she asks me a number a question about sins and I give her in like two and a half to three minutes reminder about how sin is and how Allah's most forgiving what lie she broken tears in sobbing and crying and I said Oh everybody's looking is that our chef shame on you you did that yes he will lie I have nothing to do with her I don't know the woman so you never know when Allah Allah will open your heart for repentance so look into your sin look into your inside is it out of arrogance and pride or is it out of human nature and weakness if it's out of human nature and weakness never forgive up allah azza wajal is always there extending his hand subhana wa ta'ala for those who sinned in the at night to repent in the morning and for those who sinned in the morning to repent at night Allah Azza WA JAL opened the day that the gates of repentance and would not be closed until the day of judgment however there are two phases for repentance so now and Allah if we reached the the phase of confession admitting our guilt repentance doesn't come easy there are two phases phase number one that Allah guides you to repent and this is 50% of the process so if you feel remorse I admit my sin I feel bad about it I'm going to do something about it I'm going to make a lot of good deeds I'm going to do this I quit doing sin this is 50% so many times you find people two best friends from childhood till high school or ere levels all levels uni and they graduate and all of a sudden one of them starts practicing they're best friends identical and everything and the other guy says hey what's wrong with you now you're growing you're beat you're shortening your thought and your trousers don't you remember how we used to make fun of these people don't you remember how we used to tease them you're becoming one of them and he says cause I saw the light and he starts to practice for I pray five times a day and they go different ways why is that because Allah loved that person he guided him he opened his heart to repentance and Allah did not love this sinner so he let him be in a lot so L would open the doors for him to sin and would increase him in aggression because Allah doesn't love him likewise first 50% Allah guides you what repentance is not done yet the remaining phase the remaining 50% is when Allah accepts your repentance so Allah does not accept repentance from everyone who repented because Allah knows best so when you repent you when you sin and you fall and you do something about it and you try to repent don't as we say in inside the Arabia don't put a water mellow melon in your your stomach when you put a watermelon in your stomach colors The Drowsy you want to fall asleep when you sin and repent and do good deeds always be fearful that Allah might have not accepted your repentance so this way I'm hopeful that he did and I'm fearful that he may not until you die once you die allah azza wajal will accept your repentance for sure but once you're alive and you think Shaitaan will tell you ha ha yeah Allah accepted it so why are you sitting here in the message let's go on party let's go and have fun why yeah all the sins were forgiven cos it's a new record this is what happens with a lot of the Muslims I come and go to maqam a Cremora finish my Umrah and on the way back to Judah after I shaved my head with a Haram I turned some music and start mashallah ah hey what she what are you doing I have zeroed the meter alas my record books are white and clean so might as well I have credit man I took my mobile I took my credit card I have like I think I can do like five days six days of sin and watch movies and skip prayers here and there and but then I saw Sean Hollow so I will do my best - this is not the way you deal with allah azza wajal this is not the way you deal with your friend you don't go to your child and spank him on the face and then give him candy and forget and let's kiss and make up and forget this doesn't happen with Allah you don't know Allah Allah is not like us Allah is the creator of everything you see and if he wishes he annihilates everything in seconds so you have to address these two types of repentance and what was the words that Adam received a lot else is new Quran that Adam received words from his Lord so Allah has forgiven him this is strange Allah so gel created us and we were a sperm then a fetus then a baby coming out from our mother's wombs with no knowledge Allah describes this in the Quran well logically Buitoni Omaha to complete our ammunition Allah Azza WA JAL extracted you Allah got you out from your mother's womb and you did not know a single thing so now we have degrees we have profession we have money we have houses we have cards you have children we have wives we're intellectual we can make a lecture we can travel all of this is from whom from a becoming Nima from in Allah whatever blessing or favour you're living in is from whom it's not from your own pocket it's from Allah soldier yet after all of this when we sin would we make an awful act and we sin Allah Allah does not throw us away allah azza wajal teaches us what to say so that he would forgive us he taught Adam Rob banner in a vellum navasana when interfered Anna water Hamner done economy jose palace he taught them what to say so this is what we should say the people are distributing water so is is my time over vanilla shake no 10 minutes bye we move on okay so we get the lesson of the legacy of Adam so the legacy that I should implement in my life after this talk is that I go and I look into the mirror providing that there's no one watching her because then if I speak to myself in the mirror they will say I'm crazy and I speak to myself you you yes you I'm talking to you what are your sins list them 1 2 3 10 100 500 what are you gonna do about it you gotta make home ground that's it continue doing your sin or are you going to repent if you're not going to repent do you think that Allah loves you and that's why he did not guide you definitely it doesn't but if you manage to repent and if you manage to analyze by allah i will enter jannah to the best of my ability I'm not gonna wait for anyone I want to go there and I want to enter there and if Allah wills it that I don't have done my best but I have to do my best in order to be among those who enter Jannah the second part is the legacy of no peace be upon him know is one of the strong world messengers of Allah there five who do Azzam Minard Russell they are as historically in order nor come on Ibrahim Mousa Lisa muhammad sallah re-listen dr these are the five mentioned in the quran and described as cool as me Minoru so they are the one with the strong-willed no did he have a strong will yeah he when I look at myself and I see that masha'Allah I'm traveling and making Dawa I'm giving a lecture after lore and I'm giving a lecture after Madrid twice a day wow this is some achievement if I go to Bombay and record eight episodes a day for peace TV Ya Allah I think I'm Superman I did like a lot of time I could do that wa to a person for a couple of hours debate with him argue with him try not to hold him and punch him in the face so I could give down for two hours when I see a better him giving that wa for a full day I said Marshall age younger fourteen fifteen years younger than I am he can manage and when I see for example one of the Diaries who give that were for a whole week I say man this is Superman and if I see someone giving doubt for a whole year non-stop I would say that this person is from Venus or Mars not from this planet but when I see someone giving Darryl for nine hundred and fifty years I say this is no peace be upon him imagine something giving devil for nine hundred and fifty years and his Dawa is not like our Darwin my Dow is I give you a lecture and I leave I'm the land of story his nieuwe was all over and this is the art lesson each and every Muslim must be at I must be someone who calls to Islam Sarah I'm hesitant when I come in front of the camera I start to shiver and the I mean I get scared and my knees you know hit each other and I sweat and I'm unable to remember my name watching him one of the brothers once the a man did not come to the Masjid and they told one of the practicing brothers are here you give hope back there's no one Friday so the math the Brotherhood went in Salaam alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatu and sat down and they might even give the a map then and then the brother stood he said alhamdulillah and he looked at the brothers and he fainted seriously he fainted don't think that this is for everyone so the brother comes and says sure I am unable to do this Dawa so I'm not gonna do it give that way and you you're giving me this and putting it next to me and you think that I'm going to continue the lecture und with concentration yeah this is not fair you guys anyhow you can come you can meet Dawa is not limited in giving lectures jaha WA is a vast terminology Allah says in the Quran woman : min Mandara illallah muhammad Assad Hannah all in annum innum muslimeen woman accent : translates to there is no one it's not a question who is it translates to there is no one better in rhetoric in speech other than those who call for Allah and do good or righteous deeds and proclaim and say and announce that I am among the Muslims now are you among those same da illa llah well how can I you can if you practice Islam you're a Muslim when someone sees you in the street he recognizes that you are a Muslim he knows that this is Dawa if you deal with your neighbors and your loved ones and your Muslims in the Islamic way you never cheat you never lie you never fight you never use abusive words you never ridicule people you never backed by it you never do this or that you never hold a grudge you always think positive you always connects to the next of kin etc in this case you are giving the best form of Dawa but when a sister calls me from UK and says I'm a rivet for five years married to this brother who is masha'Allah acknowledged by the community to be practicing his beard is mashallah bigger than fidel castro's and his stove is shorter than whatever and he has a big tree in his pocket and he's recognized as mashallah not aware yet chef he abuses me he hits me he says bad word he uses the f-word and the so often in the house and when he's with his friends he's so cheerful and have been he is the best man on earth once he gets into the house he's abusive to the children and to me what kind of down is this this is a hypocrite how would clef classify this brother as a hypocrite because he has two faces one with the externals and another with the internals and this is pure hypocrite a sister was calling me I was more going from London to X Y Z up north I'm not going to say where and I was on the phone and she's saying chef my husband is involved in that one and he's doing this and he's doing that he's a sweetheart everybody loves him but he spends three to four hours every day until 2:00 a.m. on his laptop watching pornography I stopped for a law and I said no this is bad this is wrong you have to advise him share why don't you do this I said well I would but she'll he's sitting next to you seriously well I rely this happened the the brother was sitting next to me and she said yeah any try you do whatever you want how to open the subject open the subject what is this it's like Dracula he sees across I started burning this is a problem when you have this this means that there is an error in the way of our commitment and of our devil so the best way of that making Dawa is to follow the Dawa of know be patient be tolerant never give up a lot of us go to make tower to the brother next door Sam Urick Michael Samia he I would wish I could see you in fetch a prayer with the community it's none of your goddamn business is that Allah here officially colossal and I leave him for ten years why we his his abusive is doesn't feel Allah this guy is a hypocrite he doesn't pray for his munafa and look at him look at his table it's below his ankle it probably he's a kafir Subhan Allah what kind of a tower is this nine hundred and fifty years and he never gave up change your tactics he told you it's not of your business next week bring him some some booze sex I'm sure bruh yeni maybe tried to soft in his stomach that would stuffing soft in his heart next time tell him hey I'm going to this place if you want me if you see him unload his groceries give him a helping hand don't give him the hour for a few months but show him that you love him and you have interest in them that in you that you care for him this would help how where do we learn this from nor did no huge one methodology or different methodologies my job is to make Dawa from 9:00 to 5:00 I work for example after five o'clock after I punched my card if someone tells me okay I'm interested in his lounge good luck for you come tomorrow 9:00 o'clock tomorrow is weekend so come on Monday inshallah okay I'm interested in entering Islam good good that's good but I have to there's a match in Manchester and whatever Birmingham United I have to watch it so I don't have time ah no it wasn't like this no was 24/7 working for Darwin Allah Azza WA JAL says and verily I called on to them openly there is allowed then verily I proclaimed to them in public I have appealed to them in private so he used all different ways no shifts Twilight graveyard morning no he was the whole day the whole week the whole year the whole century the whole nine and nine point five centuries nine hundred fifty years he doesn't work in days okay and subhanAllah not only that I can give dower to as they say preach the convergence you came here with your own feet from who for the ice cream but regardless are you staying here at least you ate that actually when you're still here which means that you came to listen to something that may benefit you that may get you closer to Allah so you are willing knowest that I was not like this whatever he gave that word to his people they thrust their fingers and their ears and they covered their heads with the garments and they went into their magnified themselves in pride so don't ever give up learn from him that this Dawa is for the sake of Allah and that you're doing it for Allah alone what was his door for a new Bentley did he want a new mansion did he want a lot of money his Dawa was for Allah to forgive them to grant them forgiveness and that is why he did not call for himself and that is why also he used another form of Dawa which is the stick and the carrot mubashir inna woman Dini so he told them listen if you disobey Allah he will enter Hell fire from the widest gates so he threatened them he warned them that you will enter hell but he didn't only limit his Dawa through warning people and this teaches us that we have to look at the individual that we're giving Dawa if the individual is taking it easy he doesn't pray he goes to the pub he drinks he goes to nightclubs he fornicates he cheats he lies he does the whole nine yards so when I give him dower would I use the carrot or the stick what do you think the carrot if I use the carrot and si ahi Allah and the Prophet said that is awesome whoever says the ilaha illa-llah sincere from his heart he will be admitted to Jenna and the guy says circle ahead get me the bottle give me another bottle I handle Allah will forgive us he will increase in his aggression no I have to use the stick with him and I'll say hey Masha Allah Rakha bla do you know that the Prophet said I assume that Oskaloosa la the most burdensome prayer upon the hypocrites is foreign Asia do you prefer in Asia is it no Allahu Akbar don't you know that Elijah admitted a woman in hell because she held back a cat a kitten until it died and look at what you're doing so you scared the hell out of him until he says ok Hollis I give up where's the Masjid I want to repent but if I go to a brother who prays 6 hours a day night prayer and recite the Quran he sits in the masjid for 20 hours in between and there are mahi supplicates any cries and whenever mentioned at the mentioning of hellfire is is there he cries and he says sometimes and declares it and I will never forgive me I've done so many so many sins what do I say to this man do I tell him that Allah he Allah al admitted a woman to hell because of a kitten definitely you're gonna be there for a lifetime he will die have a heart attack or a stroke and I know I will tell him how he Allah's forgiveness Allah is mercy are for those like you so think positive of Allah and Allah Azza WA JAL would grant you more than what you think of him and in the veneer BDD I Allah says in the hadith Qudsi I am as my servant thinks of me so you think negative of Allah Allah soldier would teach you like this if you think positive in Allah and you act upon your positiveness Allah Azza WA JAL would forgive you and it is not I came all the way from Saudi Arabia I'm not gonna stop yeah she had that hey me soft is kind and when it comes to this I don't care sue me what are you gonna do"
