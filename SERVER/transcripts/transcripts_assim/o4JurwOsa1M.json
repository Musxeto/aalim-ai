  "transcript": "so cyma again has another question or a different one she says can we use vanilla extract or vanilla essence in our cooking now vanilla at the end product does it ever intoxicate you unanimous decision is nope you can eat as many ice cream cones you wish you can put as many vanilla in your cakes and desserts and consume whatever you want yes you may become diabetic at the end of the day but this does not render it or make it harm so why do people ask about vanilla extracts simply because when vanilla is produced it is one of the most expensive plantations around I think it's maybe second to saffron in value and the way it is processed is that it's emerged in large quantities of alcohol it has to do something with dissolving it and processing it in a certain way now this is what makes a lot of people this what makes a lot of people confused oh it's emerged in great quantities of alcohol first of all alcohol is not neji's it is not impure and hence using it externally applying perfume with 80 percent alcohol in it externally has no impact on my prayer on my purity at all so I need not be concerned of the issue of purity okay sure then what about the issue of intoxicate alcohol is not wine is not whiskey is not Scotch alcohol is a different thing it is the essence of all intoxicants that people drink but by itself it is not considered to be wine it's a substance and this is why we use it in surgeries we use it in medicine with small quantities now when does it become a decisive factor when it leads to intoxication so the end product is what it is the vanilla consume a kilogram of it does it intoxicate you dances no then it is not prohibited even if small amounts of alcohol are found in pastries in cakes in some fruits in some juices as long as you consume a lot of it and it doesn't intoxicated then this is insignificant the amount does not affect the permissibility of a product and likewise with the vanilla extract and I hope this answers your question"
