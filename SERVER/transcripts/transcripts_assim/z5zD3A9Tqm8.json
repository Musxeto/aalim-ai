  "title": "Doubt that water reached my throat during Wudu, is my fast valid? | Sheikh assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "son TJ says my question is if you are in Sunna fast and on taking ablution you are in doubt that whether the water past your throat or not what to do the default is that it did not pass and we know that doubts do not remove certainty so as long as this is a doubt ignore it secondly even if it was not a doubt even if you accidentally swallowed some of the water again due to the fact that it's unintentional and accidental there's nothing wrong and there is no sin on you bearing in mind that in the hadith of lucky to know Sabra we are pleased with him he said the Prophet told me that it's awesome to exaggerate in swirling water in my mouth and my nose unless I am fasting so you should try your level best not to do this in the future but your fast is valid"
