  "transcript": "Abdullah from Japan. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you doing Sheikh? I am doing great Alhamdulillah. My question today was about regarding an interest. So, here in Japan there is an app similar to eBay where you can post and whoever wants to buy your product can buy. And the app offers for whoever wants to buy, to buy that product in deferred payments, like you can in monthly installments. And for that, depending on the price, they have their service fee, let's say. So, for example, if you buy a product worth 500 USD and if you want to pay it monthly in like 3 or 4 months, depending on the price. The period. The period and the overall price of the product, their service fee changes. So, I wanted to know if this is an interest? Are you buying or selling Abdullah? I'm going to buy. Okay, if you're going to buy in installments, there are two conditions that must be fulfilled. Number one, that you're buying straight from the owner. Now, the app is not the owner. So, definitely they have financers. They have banks, they have financial institutions who are investing and saying anyone who wants to buy in installments, they've got a credit card or a debit card or a bank account that we can hold them accountable if they default it on the payment. Then go ahead. Here's 100 million dollars. So, these are interest-based loans from a third party and this is haram. But if the owner of the product, I'm selling this pen on eBay or whatever app and I'm telling people this is for 1 euro. And if someone says, listen, I can't afford it, can you sell it over 5 months time? And I said, okay, it's 1.5 euro and you have to pay me this much every month. He says, okay, agreed. Then this is halal because I'm the owner. I have the right to sell it for a euro or for 100 or for even a thousand euros. It's my product. What price I give is none of anyone's business. Whether I give it for cash or on installments, this is my job. This is condition number one. Condition number two is that the price is fixed before we agree. So, it cannot be this is 1.5 euros over 5 months time. Okay, agreed. And we sign an agreement. But if I defaulted on one month, he says you have to pay 1.7. And if it's one year, now you have to pay 3 euros. And it goes up as long as I'm not paying on time. Therefore, he gives me a list of choices. It's 1.5 in 5 months, but it can be 1.7 in 7 months and 3 dollars in one year and so on. And I sign without specifying which scheme I want to take. And it's open. No, this is riba. So, these can do conditions if the product is halal. If you're buying it from the owner and if the final price that cannot be one cent extra agreed upon before the agreement. Alhamdulillah, this is permissible. Allah knows best. And have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days. And I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
