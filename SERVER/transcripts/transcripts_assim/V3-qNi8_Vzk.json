  "transcript": "from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuh So next week In Sha Allah I should be having a surgery so I want to ask about my Salah, how could I simulate or how can I pray while laying down or sitting and could someone wipe because if I'm unable to wipe can someone wipe my hands and my face and feet for Wudu? Okay first of all may Allah Azza Wa Jal make your surgery successful and fruitful and may Allah restore your health to be better than it was before. Secondly in the Hadith of Imran Ibn Hussain may Allah be pleased with him, he said that the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam said, pray standing up which is a pillar, if you're unable pray sitting down, if you're unable pray sitting on your side, pray lying on your side. Now this shows us the ease and simplicity of our religion. There's no compulsion or hardship in our religion. Allah says in the Quran, Fear Allah to the best of your ability. So if this is the best of my ability, I can't stand up O Allah, you know, I can't sit, I'm bedridden, I can barely move. Okay pray as you are. How? To the best of your ability. If I'm sitting down, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar, and I try to make it lower than my rukur. If I can't, then do as you can to the best of your ability of gesturing Salat. But Shaykh I'm hooked with all these different pipes and my urine and the catharet is coming out and I'm not clean. Try your level best to purify yourself. You can't make wudu to the best of your ability. You can't let someone help you. Oh Shaykh, it's going to make a whole mess because my whole body and the bed would be soaked with water. In this case, Alhamdulillah, Allah made a way out for you. Perform tayammum. In lots of the Muslim hospitals, they have a small box with some sand in it. You just open it, you strike it once, wipe your face, wipe your hands. Alhamdulillah, you can pray now to the best of your ability. You are unable to use any of this. Pray as you are, as you are, without doing any of the previously mentioned things. And Allah is the most forgiving, the most merciful, but never ever skip a Salat."
