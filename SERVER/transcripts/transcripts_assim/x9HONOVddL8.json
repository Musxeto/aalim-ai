  "title": "Should we speak about Islam Without Knowledge? (feeling hesitant) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem - JAL",
  "transcript": "a person used to talk about religion a lot without knowledge so after he started gaining more knowledge he realized that the severity of talking without knowledge about religion um so he stopped speaking without knowledge but now he has become too careful for example he for example he just learned something and he knows it but he's scared to convey to others because he thinks he might make a mistake in voting etc so what should he do okay i will answer inshallah faizan from india he says after practicing islam i am more hesitant to talk about issues because i'm afraid that i might be saying something wrong this is a good feeling it's always best to be safe rather than being sorry so if you're hesitant if someone asks you a question and you're not sure don't put yourself as a bridge over hellfire where people cross on top of your back simply say i don't know simply say i will ask and tell you i remember like 30 maybe 34 years ago i called sheikh bin baz the grand mufti of saudi arabia one of the greatest contemporary scholars of all times and i asked him on the phone about an ayah in the quran which to me at the time seemed easy the grand mufti said to me um i don't know can you please call me tomorrow i'll research it and give it back to you he doesn't know me he never met me and he's having the humbleness to speak to a random caller and ask him to call him the following day i called him the following day and the moment he heard my voice he said yes i researched it and even cathy says so and so and so so this is the verdict on it so you do you're not sure don't speak say i don't know it will not deduct any of your fame or reputation or your knowledge rather it would increase you in knowledge in front of the people"
