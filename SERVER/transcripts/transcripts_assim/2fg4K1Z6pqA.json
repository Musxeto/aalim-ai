  "title": "Seems knowledgeable in Arabic & Tafsir but does not have knowledge in FIQH, can we listen to him?",
  "transcript": "Salam Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So there's a famous person who gives tafseer and he seems really knowledgeable in tafseer and he gives references of different tafseer where it's like tafseer of Imam Razi, Al-Zamakhshari, which I am not sure if they are authentic and he also gives his own interpretations of Quran and he seems really knowledgeable in Arabic but the problem is that he doesn't seem to have a good knowledge of fiqh and he does some haram things and so I read that for a person to interpret the Quran he should be knowledgeable in fiqh and since I've started to read the fiqh of Quran and I read the tafseer of Ibn Kathir and Tafseer al-Saadi and but because he the person gives really good and detailed explanation of Quran I like listen to him so is it permissible to listen to his tafseer and like if I teach it to others? Okay, first of all Ibn Sirin, may Allah have mercy on his soul, one of the great tabi'een said that this knowledge is religion whether it's knowledge of fiqh, whether it's knowledge of tafseer, whether it's knowledge of aqeedah, he says and this was also attributed to Imam Malik and so many other great scholars of Islam, this knowledge is religion so check out who you receive your religion from. Nowadays, unfortunately, with the influx of social media and the access of information at your fingertips, whether it's on Instagram or YouTube whether it's on Instagram or YouTube or Facebook or even TikTok, people have found a platform for them to become famous and people of ignorance, laymen, normal people are amazed and fascinated by how articulate these people may seem because they don't have the tools to scrutinize what they say and hence they are fooled by them and by the number of followers so they start to listen to them and especially if they are from the same ethnicity, if they're from the same culture or country, then this adds more wood to the fire and they become blind followers, defenders of such people. This is Islam, this is a religion and we're ordered to only take our religion because it's something we believe in from the Quran and the authentic sunnah with the understanding of the favorite three generations, the sahaba, the companions and the tabi'een and the tabi'it tabi'een. Al-Zamakhshari, the compiler of Al-Kashaf, the book of tafsir was one of the deviant scholars and imams of Al-Mu'tazila which is a deviant sect, one of the 72 sects in Islam that the prophet warned us from. Therefore, a person who benefits from it and endorses such a tafsir, this raises a lot of red flags. In addition to that individual's lack of knowledge of fiqh or his lack of knowledge in aqeedah, definitely by endorsing Al-Kashaf and Al-Zamakhshari and the likes, his aqeedah is corrupt. So who in his right mind would go and learn from such an individual? Yes, he's famous, he has a lot of followers but at the end of the day this is his problem and his followers problems. Your problem is how to save my neck when I'm in the grave and when I face Allah on the day of judgment. Therefore, do not at all listen to such people. Learn from the trusted people. Tafsir Ibn Kathir, Tafsir Al-Sa'di, Tafsir Al-Sheikh Abu Bakr Al-Jazairi which is one of the great tafsirs that is not as known and famous to people unfortunately and I don't think it's translated even. These are the great tafsirs you should learn from. Lots of those other people who may sound articulate and knowledgeable in Arabic, they all take from other sources that cannot be trusted and when cross-examined you'd find a lot of flaws. May Allah protect us all."
