  "transcript": "nazmal hop says is it right or wrong if I press a lot of read alone we mentioned this Najam last whoever misses the eat prayer can pray it alone at home but imam abu hanifa and also shekel some even Tamiya and Sharon I mean as well say that this is not possible because this salat was made initially to be prayed in congregation as a ritual of Islam so praying it alone home devices purpose and the larger knows best"
