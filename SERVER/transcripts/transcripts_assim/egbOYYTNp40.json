  "transcript": "Mujib from Nigeria. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. I've missed three Jumaa as a result of traveling on Fridays. I want to know if there is no issue with that at all. The Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam warned Muslims not to miss three consecutive Jumaas and he says that this is a sign of hypocrisy and whoever does this, Allah will seal his heart. We're talking about Muslims that are obliged to pray Jumaa, men who are residing, who are capable and healthy, who have reached the age of puberty, of course they're men not male, which exempts women, slaves, children and travelers, so of course and the sick people who are unable to attend. So if a traveler is on a journey and he misses three, four, ten Jumaas, there's no issue in that and he's not under the hadith being threatened that his heart would be sealed or that he would be among the hypocrites, with the grace of Allah. Because falling sick or traveling is a legitimate reason to skip Jumaa and Allah Azzawajal knows best. you"
