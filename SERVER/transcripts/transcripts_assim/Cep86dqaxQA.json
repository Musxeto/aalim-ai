  "transcript": "one of the great values of our beautiful religion is respecting others privacy and this is not a glamorous word that is used to Advocate and advertise for Islam this is something that is practical that is deep in our religion and when you compare it to other cultures you see the beauty of Islam where it makes it not only illegal but also contradicting with religion it makes it sinful to invade other people's privacy we look at the West and the way that celebrities live we look at the paparazzi and how they try to get a photograph a recording we see what the tabloids do in terms of rumors and gossips and we look at their laws and we see how so many loopholes exist that protects The Intruders and does not protect people's privacy in Islam it's totally different not that Islam is against the freedom of speech or the freedom of press as they call it Islam is against harming others or invading their privacy because each one of us has been honored by Allah the prophet saidat the whole of a Muslim is sacred to another Muslim his blood his wealth and his honor this was stated by the prophet Alat wasam in the farewell Haj pilgrimage which was the last great congregation that the prophet conducted only four months or so before he died so respecting others privacy meaning that you do not invade their privacy you do not intrude in his own Private Affairs which he does not want other others to look into and this is why in Islam we have something that is mentioned in the Quran in terms of seeking permission before entering a room or a house Allah asael says oh you who believe do not enter houses other than your own house until you a certain welcome and greet their inhabitants that is best for you perhaps you may be reminded and if you do not find anyone therein do not enter them until permission has been given to you and if it is said to you go back then go back it is purer for you and Allah is knowing of what you do Allah is telling us if we knock on someone's door and he tells us go back I'm not in the mood to meet you I don't have time I have something that prevents me from hosting you you should not feel depressed or sad or angered or humiliated rather Allah says that this is purer for you which is best so it is part of the Islamic etiquette that when you come to a house that you seek permission to enter three times and if no one answered you leave in peace and how is is this done by saying can I come in nobody replies asum can I come in and you repeat it three times no one answers you leave even if they there are people in the house and you can hear that nowadays usually it is the doorbell that you ring in order for people to either accept you in or not and seeking permission is for everyone whether he's a relative or a stranger whether he's a man or a woman whether he is even a blind person some people say blind people can't see so what's the problem in of them entering a room or a house without seeking permission they're blind but they're not deaf they may hear something that the people of the house don't want him to hear and essentially seeking permission was made so that you do not look a man asked Omar may Allah be pleased with him should I seek permission before entering at my mom he said do you like to see your mother nude he said of course not he said then you have to seek permission and not only that the prophet Alat wasam made the punishment of a person who looks into your house without your permission made it per permissible for you to punish him with poking his eye even if you waste his eye this is permissible why is that because he's transgressing against me in theah a man was looking from cracks and holes in the door of the prophet's house sallallahu alaih wasallam and the prophet had some sort of a com in his hand scratching his head with so when he saw the man trying to peep into his house he kept on following him so that he would poke him in his eye and he told the man if had I known that you were looking before I would have stabbed you in your eye because seeking permission was made to prevent people from looking at other people's private uh Affairs and Islam has protected this has protected my privacy has protected your privacy when Allah stated in chapter 49 when Allah said do not spy and this incubates every type of spying whether by looking by hearing by snooping the prophet said means do not listen means do not look and some say no is to spy for your own benefit and it's to spy for other people's benefits so what is meant by spying all types of spying so putting uh remote um monitoring cameras that people do not know this is prevailing unfortunately in the west so we have heard in non-muslim countries it is quite famous nowadays the brand Airbnb which is taking the place of hotels if I want to go to a foreign country instead of paying a a bunch of money a lot of money for the hotel tells I can get half the price by renting through Airbnb a flat or a house of a person who leaves it for a week or two and makes some extra cash now they have discovered that the owners of the houses hide and conceal cameras in bedrooms in bathrooms and this is outrageous in Islam it is totally sinful and people would be punished for that so this is part of spying ease dropping is part of spying tapping phones some people even do not respect your privacy you speak to them and they turn the loudspeaker on so that everyone in the room can hear you without identifying this to or notifying this to the caller by telling listen uh I've got my wife and my friends uh in the car and they're listening to you no they just simply put on the loudspeaker some they track movements and others would hack into systems or look into people's messages files emails without his permission others would crack a person's password in forums or in on in his own mobile all of this is prohibited spying in Islam the prophet wasam warned the Muslims and he said whoever EAS drops while people are speaking and they hate it they don't like people to EAS drop or they are trying to escape from him listening to them what is the punishment the prophet said Alam on the day of judgment the melted type of white uh lead would be poured into his ears melted lead that is white will be poured in his ears on the day of judgment and Islam fights snooping and interfering in people's Affairs and the prophet saidat it is a sign of a person's excellent Islam to mind his own business which means that those who do not mind their own business are not excellent Muslims so many times you go to a random place and someone out of the blue comes to you and say um what do you want work my name is so and so high he's trying to socialize and you try to socialize as well but then he goes into areas he should not what do you do how much do you earn a month how many wives do you have how many children do you have this is interrogation and usually such people have no shame they have the audacity to go on and on without any stop and the best form of of counterattacking them is to do the same so he says what do you do you say well I'm a teacher what about you says well I do this and this and then he says how much do you earn so I said no not much what about you what's your salary do you do overtime do you have savings how much do you have in your bank account how many bank accounts do you have and you bombard him with such questions and the guy would definitely stop because he would sense the gravity of his mistakes Islam promotes that you keep people's secrets and not reveal them Allah asael praised the Believers that retain the entrusted things they're entrusted with and their promises and they keep it and part of the secrets that that you have to retain and honor are what your friends speak to you see so many times I sit with a a brother and as he speaks to me one to one he says listen she I and he looks right and left and then he continues looking right and left means that this is a secret the prophet said Alam whenever a man speaks and then he looks around this is an entrusted am this is something that he's entrusting you with so it's a secret you should not disclose it and keeping secrets is something natural we all like to conceal so many women in the family when they get pregnant they say don't tell anyone until it is obvious like in the sixth or seventh month why they just don't like people to know they like to keep things to themselves and yya Ali who was close to harun Rashid the khif he once was eating with him and all of a sudden harun Rashid spoke to his servant in person so immediately yya interrupted him and said if you want to tell him a secret I just wanted to notify you that I myself no person so Haron was very happy of his comment because it showed that Yahya did not want to Snoop or intrude by not saying anything and hear what the Khalifa had to say to his servant so he interrupted him and said listen don't say anything because I know the language and concealing Secrets is well known uh uh characteristic of the Sala tells us a beautiful story that when his son-in-law died haa his daughter was without a husband so he went toan whose wife had died earlier so he saidman how would you like to consider ha my daughter for marriage so said give me a couple of days and he went and came back and said I tell you what I don't feel like getting married so he said I went to Abu Bakr and I said Abu Bakr my friend I am thinking of having haa married so would you consider marrying her Abu Bakr did not even reply to him and walked away Omar says I felt so bad about what he had done more worse than whatman repli replied and after few days the prophet Alam proposed himself to ha and then Abu Bakr came and he said Omar my brother don't be sad don't be angered with me or by me because couple of days ago I heard the prophet Alam mentioning ha's name and showing interest in marrying her so when you approached me I could not r R and and and and disclose the secret of the Prophet that's why I did not reply to you but now as he had already proposed so don't be mad with me but Subhan Allah how Abu Bakr kept and concealed the secret of the prophet wasam and the secrets we keep are not only of those who are close to us even we are supposed to conceal the secrets of Sinners open your WhatsApp or Facebook you'll find it filled with rumors and uh bad things and sins so and so did so and so this area did this this organization did that disclosing people's hidden Sins Not the sins that everyone can see and this is wrong this is intrusion on their privacy it's between them and Allah the sin is between me and Allah if I go to my house and lock myself in and drink booze until I'm wasted it's none of your business this is between me and Allah no one knows about it if you happen to know you have no right to go and tell people about it and Allah will expose you on the day of judgment like you have exposed me the prophet Alat wasam says whoever conceals a Muslim Allah will conceal him in this life and in the in the Hereafter imagine though he's sinful but you concealed him and some of the scholars said that if I see a man and a woman committing fornication I would conceal them with my garment because when you disclose this and show everybody that oh we have sins here we have concerts here we have movies here we have theater here we have mixing here at the end of the day my heart would be filled with Despair and I say there's no hope Islam is on the decline there's no hope for us so let's let byan be byan let us do like everyone else but when you conceal sin then all what Rises is virtue and Islam and you respect the Privacy not on the only of the living but also of the Dead the prophet Alat wasam said praising the person who washes a corpse of a Muslim he says that whoever washes the corpse of a Muslim and he conceals what he sees Allah would forgive him 4 times for Zero for what because I did not go out and say W this person I washed his face was black his body was as stiff as a rock and every time I press his stomach so much waste and defecation and and feces comes out of him he stinks he's this he's not the people especially his relatives would think that this is the worst death a person could have and he's bound to hell and therefore you would depress them and make them sad rather do not say anything wash do your job and move on not only that even the privacy of a deceased corpse in his grave is protected the prophet said the breaking of the bone of a deceased corpse is like the breaking of the bone of a living person so you have to respect the graves you cannot sit on them you cannot walk with slippers on graves imagine that just to uh uh observe observe the um privacy of such uh de person and there are so many ways Islam promotes protecting others privacy for example the prophet said Do not sit on roadsides so the companion said but wait if we don't sit on roadsides where where can we meet we have to do this oh prophet of Allah so the prophet said if you disobey me and insist on sitting on road sides in this case you have to give the road its due right so they said what is the due right of the road so the prophet said lowering your gaze refraining from harming others enforcing virtue and good and preventing evil and Vice and to reply whoever gives you Salam you sayam so you lower your gaze if you go to the cafes in mayorca in kazur in these beach resorts you will find that people sit there all day long on the beaches drinking the cappuccinos and lates and watching the filth in front of them on their beaches gazing and looking at topless women nude men and things that are so heinous and filthy yet they fight theab if a woman wants to conceal her beauty from others oh this is a taboo if she wants to sell her body like any uh livestock this is okay no problem in that Subhan Allah this is the right of the roadside uh um Gatherings if you are forced are forced to do it and Islam has even reached a limit that no other religion had reached and that is that it prohibits even doubt Allah says in the Quran oh you who believe avoid much negative assumption indeed some assumption is sin so even assuming something that you don't have evidence on is Haram in Islam so just thinking is prohibited then what about acting transgressing taking his money or abusing him physically also part of Islam's respecting others privacy is that you judge only what you you see you have no right to judge what's in my heart you have no right to say well you intended to do so and so you can only judge me by what I act and what I say and this is why when us may Allah be pleased with him and with his father was fighting against the idol worshippers and one of the knights was EX in a duel with him when this disbeliever figured out that he's going to die he stopped and he said as I bear witness that there's no God other than Allah worthy of being worshiped which means a declaration of Islam in the midst of the battle after he had killed so many Muslims just because he figured out that Usama is going to beat him and kill him Usama went ahead and killed him when the prophet heard thisam he was angered and Usama apologized and said oh prophet of Allah he only said the testimony of Faith to protect his himself now Usama judged his intention though you and I would have done probably the same if not worse the prophet said did you open his heart and looked at his intention where will you go from ill on the day of judgment Usama was totally devastated and he said I wished that I did not accept Islam except on that particular day so that everything that I had done in the past would be erased and I begin a new chapter so when we look at fields of privacy there's so many but the time is so limited and the control room are telling me that this is the time for break but in in a quick fashion inshallah we have to respect the privacy of the parents so even they are my parents I'm not allowed to go to their Chambers without seeking permission especially in three times that were mentioned by Allah Before Dawn prayer when they put aside their clothes at noon and after prayer these are the three times when they are in in their Chambers I must not enter without seeking permission also part of respecting their privacy when they fight I should not intervene a lot of the times we take sides and this angers the other side so they are spouses they are husband and wife they can carry on their own problems unless they seek my intervention ition and my counseling then this is a different thing but to take sides and to uh uh intrude again this is not uh a good thing children have their own privacy so we should respect that especially when the child grows and he doesn't want you to change his clothes or bathe him or he he's becoming uh more mature though he's five or six respect that teenag uh have their own privacy don't spy unnecessarily on their mobile phones on their emails don't check check their clothes if they have this or that or documents unless there is reason Beyond doubt but other than that give them their respect or you will spoil them likewise if a if a boy is if a teenager has his own desire to study a specific field all what you can do is advice but don't Don't force him to be a doctor or an engineer or an accountant if he doesn't want this because this is part of his privacy also the Privacy between spouses they don't go and display and expose their secrets to uh other people and uh uh yeah or even spy on their spouses mobiles or emails or facebbook account just to see if he is chitchatting or doing something Haram because this is not allowed in Islam and finally one of the righteous people who wanted to divorce his wife a man asked him one of these Snoopy people said why do you want to divorce your wife and the man said Subhan Allah a man never discloses his wife's secrets so after a while he divorced her so that same man came to me and said why did you divorce your ex he said what should I care she's someone's else wife now so he did not disclose anything of her Secrets not before divorce nor after divorce and the topic is quite big but we have to insert this value in our lives we have to teach our children how to honor it how to implement it in all aspects of their lives so that people could respect their privacies and they could respect other people's privacy as well"
