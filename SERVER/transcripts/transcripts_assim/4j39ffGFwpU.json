  "title": "Pooja Prasad || Foods that are prohibited when other than Allah's Name is mentioned #assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign it says four things to be forbidden one of them is any food on which is taken it mentions any food in some other translation I find animals which is slaughtered not taking others name so which one is correct it is is it any food or is it animal and could you please give me the references of the two hadiths about them first of all I do not give references because the time does not allow us to do this and I don't keep references in my head otherwise I wouldn't be in this program I would have been somewhere with the major major Scholars of Islam secondly we do not jump to conclusions without doing our own research so you cannot just jump to an Ayah and have your own conclusion and let that Cascade on different issues and then you find yourself in a no man's land this is not the way it's done you have to go to Scholars you have to understand the interpretation of the Ayah read the different six or seven of them and then go to the books of and understand the juror's opinion on such tafsiris Etc there's no dispute that if I bring an apple and a disbeliever a mushrik says different names on it of his idols that this has no impact on the Apple I think they call it Puja and when the Hindus give food and sweets and veg food that was offered to their gods and then they offer it to others no problem that the food itself is not going to be contaminated when they say the name of Krishna or Rama or whatever gods they have it doesn't matter the apple is going to still still be an apple the sweets is going to be still be sweets the thing that is affected and impacted when saying other than the name of Allah is when you Slaughter an animal so if you slaughter a sheep or a goat and you say in the name of so and so so you're sacrificing for the name of a false god whether it's Jesus whether it's Buddha whether it's whatever name this makes the meat of that slaughtered animal Haram and you cannot eat it consume it or use it it's nudges and this is what is meant by kulum and do not eat from what the name of Allah was not mentioned upon and this is a sinful transgression so this means that if the Jews the Christians the fire worshipers the idol worshipers give us some sweet that we can consume that because it does not contain Haram elements of meat inside of it and if the Jews and Christians give us meat that is halal then we can consume that because it's mentioned in verse 5 Surah chapter 5 that the slaughtering that the Jews and Christians do to their animals is halal for us so we don't have to ask or check once it comes to us we can eat and say Bismillah and I hope this answers your question"
