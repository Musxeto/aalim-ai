  "title": "Spending Money Lavishly because he says Allah will Provide? (Dying with debts) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Fatima from India yeah my question is a person spends money very lavishly and when we try to stop him he says he trusts that Allah will give him plenty he is also stuck deeply in debt because of this attitude how can such a person be advised when he says that he spends without a care for tomorrow because Allah is going to provide is he spending the money lavishly in halal things or in Haram are these Halal things necessary or unnecessary at all unnecessary most of them are necessary okay and he's uh getting debts because of that yeah yeah okay such a person has to be advised that acquiring debts is not something recommended in Islam the prophet said every sin Is Forgiven for a martyr except if he has debts on him jibril just came and told me that in the beginning the prophet saw thought that every single sin of a martyr is erased automatically once he dies in the cause of Allah but jibril came and corrected him and said except the debts so if he has debts upon him that wouldn't be forgiven even if he died as a martyr in the cause of Allah so such a person we have to introduce this fact to him and that borrowing is not permissible unless there is illegitimate cause and reason for that Scholars say borrowing to go for Hajj which is a pillar is not permissible because Allah wants your um wants you to be free of debt and this debt of Hajj which is mandatory upon you Allah says postpone it until you can afford it don't borrow money what about buying Halal things what about giving money to family members or taking them into a holiday Etc and borrowing for that that is part of extravagance that Allah does not love"
