  "title": "Has the Prophet ﷺ‎ ever done something Makrooh (Disliked)? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question is about is it possible that the prophet allah does something makru and the answer is yes there's no problem in that because i'll ask you another question which may make it a little bit clearer is makroo sinful or not if you say it's not sinful in this case alhamdulillah the prophet did not do any sin so why would the prophet do something that is makru alaihi to show his ummah that this is permissible and it's not prohibited so in the hadith where he said to the man who drank standing up vomit it throw it up and in the hadith that the shaytan had joined you in drinking it all of these hadiths are responded to with him allah drinking zamzam water standing up and supported by the hadith of ali may allah be pleased with him and when he said i don't care whether i drink standing up or sitting down after i had seen the prophet saw i'm drinking standing up so the understanding of the sahaba the companions may allah be pleased with them is that the prophet did this also to show them that this is permissible and it's not prohibited it's not sinful and allah azzawajal knows best"
