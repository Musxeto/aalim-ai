  "transcript": "um from india yes actually uh i will be visiting uh my hometown and it is very rare for example we go uh for a week in one year and sometime for a week in two years this time we'll be there for a month so my question is my son is actually asking that he can shorten his prayer or it will be like normal for him because it's like his grandfather house his own house but he's not used to or it's like a new place for him so what is the way for prayer spotting or normal okay our assist by the issue of shortening prayers is for a traveler and scholars say that whenever you travel and you go to other than your hometown you have to or you have the permission in the concession to shorten and combine prayers now for expats for you living in the uk for a temporary amount of time so you're an expat you're there to work for 10 years 15 years and after you collect money and start your business and build your house you intend to go back to india and reside there where you were born and this is your hometown this is your country in this case you do not combine or shorten in either places nor in the uk uh neither in the uk nor in india but if you work for for example in saudi arabia or if you work in america and i ask you what are you doing in america i said sure i have migrated and i have my citizenship and i'm residing there for good but i go once every couple of years for a week or two or a month to visit my father and my relatives for vacation then i go back to my country which is the us which i'm a resident in i'm a citizen i'm never going back to india in this case you can shorten and combine prayers as long as you are staying in india because you are not a resident anymore so the difference is expats who come to work in saudi arabia are you there forever or for good no we're there to to work maybe 10 years 15 years 20 years 30 years eventually we're going back home to reside and live again in our hometown in this case in both places you never shorten nor combine and allah knows best you"
