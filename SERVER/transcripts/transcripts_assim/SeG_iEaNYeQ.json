  "transcript": "Su from France so I have a 2 years old son I recently noticed that his behaviors are not normal and it concerned me so in the evening when he looked outside or at the door he feels scared and ran to me and cried then he pulls my hands and want him uh me to be like hugging him or something like that then he pushed me back and scream uh so I also noticed that more animals and birds are attracted to my home so my question is like if these signs are the signs of magic and if Magic's affect children as well so when I do r as well and Play Quran he says stop it I don't want like he act react to it and he doesn't want me to recite Quran or do on him as well so no no he's two years old yeah two years old two and a half yeah and this happens when you take him out or well at home no no this is childish Behavior if you show him concern and you show your being worried he will his subconscious will make him sell you this and behave in such a fashion because he's getting attention out of it don't worry about him just read the normal AAR of the morning and the evening and the bestar of protection is in the Hadith of this long Dua and is part of the morning and evening says whoever says this particular Dua he has safeguarded his health his wealth his family and children and his religion because you're asking Allah to protect them all so you should say this and do the normal Ria without him listening to it and blowing him do it on water let him drink from it and whenever he acts like this ignore him and try to show him that if he come to come to me I'll hug you I'll kiss you I'll I'll I'll cuddle you if you want to push me you go I don't care about you but eventually after five six days he will come down and he will start to think that my efforts are not paying off so I'll act normally inshallah don't put it in your head that he has black magic or the likes"
