  "title": "Why is Laylatul Qadr hidden from us? What happens on The Night of Decree? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "why has allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala wish worshippers to be exerting themselves to the best that they can throughout this particular time allah does what he wills and all of allah's actions are wise and based on knowledge so we don't have the right to just to ask for justifications but we can speculate so allah azzawajal told us that in these 10 nights there is a special night allah could have told us which night it was but this defied the purpose of making it unknown and why is that so that allah azzawajal would encourage us to excel in ibadah to anticipate the great reward without knowing when or where it is and this is why in the beginning and by the way leila means the knight of great value this is one of the interpretations of the name al-qaddr is value one of the other meanings of it is the night of decli where allah azzawajal mentioned in surah this is a blessed night where every thing that is precise is being decreed in it so it is how allah reveals to the angels what will happen in this year so the angels know who will die and who will be honored and who will be humiliated and who will be rich and who will be poor and where it will rain and where it will be famine and drought in this particular night for the whole year as we know everything was prescribed 50 000 years before allah created the creation the universe so nobody knows what's been prescribed but in this night allah reveals to the angels what will happen in this particular year one of the meanings of laylatul is that it is tightened so nobody knows where it is specifically and this is why they say that laylatu is it has been tightened and lessened so this night was made unknown and ambiguous so that everybody would race and put all of their effort in these ten nights to seek allah's forgiveness allah's bounties allah's reward allah's favors where if we were to know that it's on the 27th we would neglect all the other nights and just focus on that particular night some say due to the life span of the followers of muhammad sallallahu alaihi due to their the shortness of their lives because the hadith says the prophet said the lifespan of my ummah is between 60 and 70 years and rarely you'll find people passing that so the prophet died when he was 63 abu bakr died when he was 63. romer died when he was 63. earthman passed that he was in his 70s or so or 80s ali died when he was 63 so this is the average where the previous nations people would live for 200 years 300 years north peace be upon him gave dawa to his people for 950 years and some say this is how long he lived 950 years and some say no this is his dawah maybe he left lived for longer than that so in order to compensate the ummah of muhammad ali islam for their short life span allah substituted them with one night which is that is equivalent to 80 plus years so if you worship allah sincerely and wholeheartedly you may hit the jackpot and be awarded 80 plus years of good deeds and remembering allah and quran and and pray a night prayer in the whole thing and allah azza knows best"
