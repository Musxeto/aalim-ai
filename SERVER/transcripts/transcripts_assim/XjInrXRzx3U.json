  "title": "Watching movies with magic, sorcery invalidate prayers of 40 days? (Harry Potter, Dr Strange) Assim",
  "transcript": "cd from germany he says that watching harry potter or dr who or dr whatever movies with sorcery and supernatural powers and magic would that invalidate my prayer for 40 days i've asked scholars about this and they said no it won't yes it is sinful it is not like going to a soothsayer or to a fortune teller and listening to them just for the fun of it this is different so this is the ruling that scholars say i would highly recommend that you don't watch at all even if it's not going to invalidate your prayer for 40 days just to be safe rather than sorry what about if there is a possibility that shaytan throws something in your heart of the possibility of someone turning this animal into a human being or giving life to the dead etc which shaytan is capable of doing why would i risk my iman just because some scholars say that it does not invalidate your prayer for 40 days so it's best to be safe rather than sorry"
