  "transcript": "other who did not mention his name he says that for long 10 years I've been suffering and I've been practicing for the past two years I'm 26 years now and I've been praying five prayers a day and I'll be trying my level best to be god-fearing however I have this illness in me I have this fear that I may die as a kafir or I may commit suicide so I've been asking Allah Azza WA JAL to give me a natural death and Allah did not make this happen so his question is if I kill myself would I be thrown in hell because of killing myself or can i object to Allah and say oh Allah I've requested that you give me a natural death and you did it and I've requested you that you relieve me from my tribulation and situation and you did not answer so will I still go to hell and the answer is committing suicide is one of the major sins of Islam Allah Azza WA JAL mentioned that in certain disapp and the Prophet told us are a sort of Salaam that it is a major sin and the person who kills himself would be killing himself until the day of judgment that is in his grave whether by stabbing if he committed suicide by stabbing himself or drinking poison or throwing himself from a high riser or mountain or drowned himself he will be continuously punished with the same way that he killed himself till the day of judgement and then it is up to Allah Azza WA JAL because this is one of the major sins it does not take a person of the fold of Islam but it is a major sin if allah azzawajal wishes to punish him Allah would do so if Allah wishes to forgive him this is up to Allah you have no right in objecting to Allah soldier you have to kick these bad thoughts and whispers of Shaitaan don't let Satan play you know who's laughing his head off is Shaitaan when you have these thoughts look at the positive things that Allah has given you look at your health look at your wealth look at those around you family members that Allah has blessed you with look at the three meals that you have look at the food you have look at the education you have there's so many things that you can be grateful but those who are by nature ungrateful would continue to doubt allah azzawajal so be careful because this is one of the major sins"
