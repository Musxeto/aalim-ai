  "title": "Accept a marriage proposal from a suitor who does not pray regularly but wants a religious wife?",
  "transcript": "or yusef from canada yes yusef okay my question is about marriage proposals who are coming to my sister and those are people who don't pray very regularly but they claim that they want like a wife who encourages them to improve so is it acceptable to accept such proposals so if someone proposes to your sister and he says that i have herpes or i have hiv positive but i'm getting treated insha allah and i'm hoping to become well would you give them and marriage of course not the most important aspect in a specific individual or a suitor is his religious practice even if he is the most handsome man on earth the most masculine and uh of the best figure bodybuilder the richest the speaks five six languages very kind he spends two months in africa doing uh relief work he is he checks all the boxes but he doesn't pray regularly dump him he's not to be considered as a potential suitor why because the prophet salallahu salaam gave us the criteria when he said whenever a person comes and proposes to you meaning to your daughter to your sister where you accept his religious practice and his moral conduct you should give him a marriage accept him two things religious practice that means he's a practicing muslim he walks the talk and his moral conduct so even if i get someone with a big beard and short throbs and the guy prays five times in the masjid he gives lectures he's a very uh uh well articulate blah blah blah but he has rage issues he's stingy he lies a lot this is bad news ditch him don't even consider him no matter what so these two conditions are a must to be fulfilled someone who prays on and off is not worthy of being considered for marriage to my sister unless my sister is someone worse than him doesn't pray at all okay then they fit as a glove but when my sister is someone who is righteous practicing fears allah wears the hijab and this guy wants to you are destroying your sister's life associating her with such a person don't even consider such a person because he's not worthy of being considered and allah azza knows best you"
