  "transcript": "says that I read that it is necessary to clean the mi with water not like urine which can be cleaned with tissues what uh uh etc. So let us go and look at the discharges found or mentioned in Islam. We have urine which is totally impure. it snudges from a a person you normal person an adult. So this has to be washed if it touched your body if it touched your uh clothes if it touch a spot that you want to pray. Now washing or cleaning yourself from urine or from uh uh after defecating this can be done in two ways. either you use water and wash the private parts until the filth is gone. And this is the most uh uh uh the cleanest thing or form of cleaning yourself. And the other way is to use hard substances such as toilet paper, such as wood, such as stones, such as a piece of cloth that would cleanse the area. But this is a second degree. The first is using water. Now mi is a substance that comes out a discharge that comes out. Some call it prosthetic fluid. When one's sexual desire is aroused. So this comes out it nullifies wudoo and it is impure. It is nudes. What to do with it? It is a lower degree in impurity than urine. See urine you have to wash. If it touches your clothes, you have to wash it, squeeze it, wash it, squeeze it until it's clean. With me, it is sufficient to get a handful of water and just sprinkle it. No need to wash it and squeeze it. So, this is how you cleanse it. This is how you clean it and you purify yourself from it. What said that we can we have to use water. No, it is like urine. You if you don't have water you can simply use uh toilet papers or stones etc. But what touches your clothes it's like urine. You have to use water for that and uh nothing else would suffice. You cannot just wipe it off with tissue."
