  "transcript": "thank you first I want to take some of your words last night in music that we as a Young Generation should not be involved on labeling individuals like these guys mostly how these guys yes we are probably aware of that in this time of period our internet our social media are polluted by so many ideas from benefits whatever I'm trying to get this right now um six of them are equating themselves on cancer and the worst part is each of them got their own future and knowing the fact that even the student of Edna bus which is enough even fall into the Earth kind of Hupa so then anything that should be really limit some resource of information from particular Studios but in the same time I think that will lead me so which which made me think that I really hope you can give me or give us a Young Generation a principle of our quality to to examine or filter any of those ideas that come to us like a pouring rain so I think that's all pretty much my question thank you so much this is not something that we can gamble with I cannot say to the youth listen to everyone and inshallah you will be safe because this is putting you in the middle of the ocean when you don't know how to swim and say inshallah you will be safe if not eaten by shark you will drown so in Islam Allah azzawajal tells us now we have as you have stated 72 sects which the prophet said all in Hell except one and everyone has fuja this is not true if you if they had Allah would have confused us and we would not know what is right and what is wrong no no no truth is clear as daylight you can see it anyone from the people of of innovation of Akida that is corrupt the moment he opened his mouth immediately you know it's falsehood while the people on the path of the Prophet the moment they opened their mouths you say natural I feel good I feel that this is going with My Soul because this is the religion of Allah so you as the youth what to do number one don't engage yourself with something that would confuse you because this is what shaytan wants you to do shaytan's only mission in life is to gather as many volunteers and companions in Hellfire that's it whether you do it through lusts and desires whether you do it through Whispers And doubts whether you do it through Shirk and OCD no problem you choose I want you to be with me in Hellfire this is what shaytan wants so now as youth you have to focus if you go to the gym and you don't focus on what you're doing by just looking at people and you will lose you'll be distracted no focus on what you're doing what are you doing I'm learning Islam how to learn Islam learn the book of Allah how to learn the book of Allah learn the the meaning and memorize then learn about the Sunnah of the Prophet is implement it in your life learn about the Akita of Allah once you do this you can easily filter but you don't go and listen to filter rather if you hear something you will be able to filter by saying this we say you have to follow one trusted Sheikh you trust his knowledge you trust his religious commitment you trust his I wouldn't trust who sits with women and flirts with them and laughs and cracks jokes and she cracks jokes and my place are yours this is not a real Sheikh who is committed to Islam to abiding by the religion if you follow this Sheikh he will manage to carry you until you reach a level will you say when you say to the sheriff you did your job I can walk on my own now because now I you have given me the knowledge and the strength to see for myself but till then you have to be with the Sheikh otherwise you may be distracted like you have said hello hello so you may be distracted by the different people on the arena that you will have doubts in your own religion which is very bad people of devious and different sects they do not have huja cleared it up for him his doubts I think if I'm not mistaken he also went to Ramadan and shared with him some of his doubts what did Roma do he took his stick and hit him on his head until his head started bleeding so he says do you still have doubts doubts are gone oh God disappeared okay now you go so this is the best way inshallah of solving doubts a good stick"
