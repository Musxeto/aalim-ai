  "title": "Must we raise, develop a bond with the animal before slaughtering it, to sacrifice for Allah? Assim",
  "transcript": "landlines so the first question says is it true for bani what is qurbani by the way is the sacrifice that the muslims slaughter on the day or on the eid of hajj so it is a sacrifice that is slaughtered to allah offered to allah as a sacrifice it's in the subcontinent they call it purbani so is it true for korbani to buy the animal beforehand raise it develop affection for it and then slaughter it to feel the essence of qurbani that is losing something you care about to fulfill the sunnah this question is a little bit awkward because it implies insinuates that islam promotes self-torture and this is not true there is nothing in islam where it tells you to buy a sacrifice and build a bond with your sacrifice this is not natural and a little bit weird and there's something wrong upstairs whoever says this a sacrifice is a sacrifice you're supposed to buy the most expensive the most precious to your heart and slaughter it but to claim that you have to feed it raise it and have a sort of affection and a bond between you and the animal this is way weird and it has nothing to do with islam so is it from the sunnah the answer is definitely not and it would be even weirder if you get this bond with your children so the children love the animal they play with it and they are affectionate towards it and all of a sudden after three weeks you bring them in the day of aid and ask them to witness it whilst being slaughtered this is totally uh un-islamic and it has very negative consequences in the future yes if they are willing to attend it no problem but to build such a an affection and bond with the animal and then ask them to come and watch it being slaughtered this is not a good thing to do"
