  "transcript": "and Asthma says can we burn our hair that we got because of hair fall why would anybody burn their hair it even smells awful no this is an innovation if you do this because of the fear of people making ahead or black magic but this is not logical sorcerers and soothsayers are not lurking in the dark waiting to see a hair or a piece of your clothes and they will take it and make a spell that would change you into a gorilla for example that this is nonsense so such fear is not realistic throw them in the dustbin like everybody does"
