  "transcript": "oh alhamdulillah and welcome to lessons in we're still studying the chapter that deals with the obligatory bath or the uh uh total bath that one takes after certain actions or before certain forms of worship and the Hadith we have before our hand Hadith number 104 although uh uh We've read it last time but we did not have enough time to go through it so we'll read it again narrated by may Allah be pleased with her whenever Allah's messenger sallu alaihi wasallam took a meaning a bath after sexual intercourse he would begin by washing his hands then pour water with his right hand on his left hand and wash his sexual organ he would then perform abolon then take some water and run his wet fingers through the roots of his hair then he would pour three handfuls of water water on his head then pour water over the rest of his body and subsequently wash his feet agreed upon and the wording is Muslims Al bukari and Muslim reported from Muna may Allah be pleased with her Allah's messenger Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam poured water over his private parts and washed them with his left hand he then struck his hand against the Earth in another narration he rupted his meaning his left hand with the surface soil and in the end of this narration then I brought him a towel but he returned it and began wiping off the water with his hands agreed upon as you have heard this is the description OFA and Muna the wives of the Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam describing how the prophet Sall wasallam used to take the total bath and this is one of the reasons that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam married more than one and as we know that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam died while he was married to nine and Muslims are not allowed to exceed four wives this is an exceptional case for the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam and polygamy is not a new thing it was there since the beginning of time for example the prophet David had a lot of wives some say a thousand they uh uh Prophet Solomon we know that he had 100 wives and Abraham had two wives Sarah and hajer and so on so this is the Sunnah of The Messengers of Allah that is not a must it's not uh uh preferred to all individuals depending on their status on their capability to tolerate depending on their financial and physical uh uh state but the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasam was married to more than four he was married to nine and a lot of people talk about this in a negative sense saying that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was a woman's man and he used to uh go after women and this is completely not true and unfair to the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam The Prophet s. had one wife on until he was 50 uh 50 years old he had only one wife until he he was 50 years old and of course one would argue and say well if if he was a woman's man then he should have married more than one when he was 20 25 30 years old at 40 years old in in in the midst in in in the Heights and peak of his manhood nevertheless he had only one wife and that was may Allah be pleased with her and when he married her some stories say that he was 25 years old and she was 40 years old so after 25 years when he was 50 she was 65 years old yet he was loyal to her sallallahu alaihi wasallam and did not marry uh uh anyone else why because he had this great love for her when she died the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam married again and again and if you look at the life story of all the wives of the Prophet Alat wasam you will find that there was only one Virgin of them all and that was abak may Allah be pleased with her the others were not virgins they were either widowed or divorc divorc fored so if a person would be labeled as a woman's man he would not choose something that has been used before him he would choose something that is fresh something that is uh uh lucrative and nice to have it wasn't the case with the prophet Alam most of the marriages that he married marriaged married sallallahu alaihi wasallam most of the marriages that he married where of those in Need For example ha B Omar may Allah be pleased with her and with his with her father Omar her husband died and she was widowed and Omar went toan and said toan his companion his friend uh my daughter has been wed would you like to marry Herman said I don't feel like I don't feel like doing that thanks I'm not in the mood of marrying it's it's not something that you say would you like to have a sandwich yeah well I'll skip no it it is something serious but only Brothers go to their brothers and and propose to them because they know them inside out so Omar went again to Abu Bakr and said Abu Bakr uh haa has been wered so would you take her in marriage so he said no thanks and then the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam PR opposed to ha and she became his wife only then Abu Bakr came to Omar and said Omar I heard the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam men her mention her name otherwise I would have accepted her for myself but because the prophet s wasallam was mentioning her name once and he was saying that what happened with ha I heard she was a wow now and so on so the prophet married her because she was a good woman and because she was the daughter of his closest friend Omar and he also married the daughter of his closest friend Abu Bakr and he also married Sall wasallam a woman that's called saf which was a Jew and was the daughter of the leader of a Jew tribe her husband and her father were executed because of treason and they tried to wage war against the prophet Alam she convered to Islam she came to the prophet s wasallam he honored her because she is now humiliated and feeling weak and vulnerable because of her loved ones are dead and her tribe have been scattered away and he married her sallallahu alaih wasallam and so on and on um Sal for example and this is not our topic but it's essential that we know our history um Sal was the wife of Abu Sal it's not a coincidence this is how they call their people you know uh if you have a son you are Abu this for example if you have a son named Abdullah then you are Abu Abdullah your wife is um Abdullah which is the mother of so Abu Sal was a great companion of the Prophet Alat he was one of the first to migrate from Mecca to Medina and he was the brother of the Prophet alham because they had uh uh the same breastfeeding mother so they all were brothers because of the milk when he died this is an old woman and she has children he proposed to her in marriage she said prophet of Allah I'm a very jealous woman and I have kids what what do you want of me so the prophet saidat as for your kids I'll take them in and I'll I'll sponsor them as for your jealousy I'll pray to the almighty that it's gone and she married him on and on you have you have this you have that you have Z was his cousin though she was married to Z who was his son adopted son and when Allah says said that there was no adoption anymore it's not permissible in Islam to adopt meaning that you may not take a child care for him and give him your name no you may adopt children but don't call them after you because this is forbidden Islam taking a child in into your custody uh uh feeding him teaching him taking care of him this is an extremely Splendid thing in Islam the prophet says that he who sponsors an orphan is with me at on the day of judgment like this and he he he he joined the two fingers together so this is a good job so Z was was the adopted sonin-law of the prophet and all all of a sudden this Bond was cut and there's no adoption in Islam so and he was married to Zan J the cousin of the Prophet they didn't like each other they it didn't work they didn't have any chemistry they were all good people but there was no there was no chemistry simple as that she's an honored female an honored lady from a very honored tribe from Mecca Z Hara was a slave bought by ham the nephew of khad given to khad who gave him who who gave Z to the prophet and he adopted him he loved him so much he adopted him he said that this is z Muhammad he's my son and he gave him his cousin Zab B J in marriage she didn't want it but the prophet ordered her to accept she accepted it and they stayed together for a while until they separated the prophet knew that they would separate and he kept on saying to Zade stay with her and he kept on saying to zanab stay with him but then it was inevitable they had to separate after separation Allah ordered him that you must marry her and he didn't want this the prophet because in the Jah she's considered to be her uh his uh daughter-in-law he she is the wife of his son adopted son but there's no adoption in Islam so Allah wanted us to prove this practically by the prophet marrying this woman that was married to his adopted son and he married her sallallahu alaih wasallam and so on so the wives of the Prophet Alat were there to convey to us knowledge otherwise we couldn't have know known this knowledge we learned from the companions of the Prophet male companions by them narrating to us what the prophet did am in the mosque in the Masjid in the streets where he used to sit with them whenever they traveled but we don't know the private and real things that happened in his house how did he sleep s Ali wasallam how did he eat how did he drink how did he wash what did he do when he wanted to answer the call of nature what the pro how did the prophet wasallam treat women when they had uh the monthly period how did the the prophet wasam had intercourse with his wives what what things to say what things to avoid this could not have been reported to US unless the prophet had wives sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam to convey to us this knowledge and that is why here we finda and Maya may Allah be pleased with them reporting to us how the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam performed and inshallah just right after the break we will continue and explain the Hadith of the Prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam so stay tuned the tension there what what about the North Korean uh nuclear program and the six uh uh party uh talks uh how will the tension there affect a relationship between us and China they did that early in 1993 and after long discussion and negotiation finally they stopped their program will the world be able to stop this flow of Secrets will it affect international relations or were there simply um you know basic known facts for most experts and and most diplomats and uh we don't know if there's more to come it's information war and welcome back just before the break we talked in so many issues none of them were were related to the Hadith we we're talking about which is so let's go back to it againi Andi may Allah be pleased with them they're describing how the prophet sallallah wasallam used to perform the total and obligatory bath after sexual intercourse and Scholars say that there are two ways of Performing Gul because in Arabic b means total bath so if one intends to perform and he dips himself in the sea and comes out providing that he has turned the water in his mouth and sniffed the water up to his nostrils and took it out again then he is had he has performed now this is called rul it's not the Sunni because the you should follow the same sequence that the prophet Sall wasallam did but both of them does the job they all do the job so you have no problem with doing any of them meaning if you stand under the shower turn on the water and wash yourself with the intention that you are removing the major impurity sexual impurity and you turn the water into your mouth you make rinse your nose then that's it as long as you've covered the whole body that's it it's enough does wash washing your your body with soap uh uh uh is a prerequisite is it a must no it's not what about uh uh uh washing your hair with shampoo no it's not a must is just to cover your body with water and that is all this is the Nonni this is acceptable one and we will come to explain the Sunnah now Mustafa if you jump in a swimming pool with the intention of whistle would that do the the water of the swimming pool we we have to understand that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam denied us from performing in stagnant water now if a swimming pool is a big swimming pool you're talking like a Olympic side size uh uh swimming pool then it's okay because the amount of water suffice which means that the water will not become impure so if you jump into a swimming pool now one would argue and say well there were kids before me so you know what kids do in swimming pools they feel the water warm and say they enjoy it so so is is Pure or not it is pure as long as it hasn't changed its color or its order or it's smell odor and smell is the same odor color uh and it's taste no cheating no cheating next time I'm going to charge you guys uh uh uh MoneyWise huh okay uh that's all so as long as the the uh it does not change the smell uh uh uh The Taste and the color does not change then it's okay it's okay is is this acceptable to you all well not comments huh and few abstain thank God this is not the uh Security Council we would have have had a problem I disagree and let me explain though we this G gets us way back at the very beginning of the p and the water let's assume that I am living in a house an old house and I'm turning on the faucet and the water that comes comes yellowish with rust and dust what's the color yellow yellow can I perform a pollution as as long as the the the water is I can how the color is yellow you can see it you can smell it you can taste it but it's it's not n the water's how would you know you just said that if the color taste or order changes then you cannot use this oh it changes with an Nessa happening you thank you and this is what was missing it's very essential to be specific and choose your words carefully when you talk in terminologies and and and rules of Shar because if you just say it without saying Jaa then any form of water that changes the color taste or odor the smell then it's it's unusable and this is not true this has been changed the color and the smell and The Taste it's not water anymore but it was not changed by a NASA it was changed by a pure substance so it's still pure now in the case of swimming pools big swimming pools the water is still water no matter how many uh uh kids peed in it urinated in it it's still water now the minute stinks and you can you know smell uric acid or you can see that the the color is completely transformed change then this is a different story because it was changed by a NASA coming back to your question dipping yourself in a pool or in the sea or in a large quantity of water even if it was stagnant it is okay providing you have the intention and why do we say intention because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that all Deeds are governed by intention so it all depends on how you what what did you intend before dipping yourself in the pool and I'll come back to this somewhere I don't know when but I'll come back to it inshallah again going back to the Sunni how do I perform in a manner may Allah be pleased with her explains she said that the first thing that the prophet s began with was what Muhammad no private no priv uh was uh have a pollution no uh Musta wash the private part no wash his hands washing his hands washing his hands now why do I wash my hands Scholars say now remember it is forbidden for us if we wake up in the morning to put our hands in a bowl of water because we don't know where our hands spend the night said well spend it next to me yes next to you but where you might have touched something you might have done something we don't want to elaborate on this now when you want to perform at the time of the Prophet Alam they didn't have faucets they had bucket so in order for him to wash he should put his hands and take the water and wash so the very first thing which is putting your water you're not sure that your water your hands are pure and that is why you have to pour water wash them now you're clean you can wash you can put your hands in this bucket and use the water is it understood yes okay so washing your your hands is in the case of the Prophet Alam in our case it's just turning on the faucet then he started with cleaning washing his private organ and why is that to remove any filth or dirt on it after intercourse it's not clean so you have to clean it and wash it so that you don't have to touch it again afterwards because then you would nullify your wood so the prophet s wasallam did that he washed it what else did did he do he hit the or or struck the floor the soil with his hands why was that why was that uh Muhammad you think tum or something no why why perform to while you have water Muhammad is it because it takes the place of soap it's a clean excellent excellent that's that's the answer now after washing his organ there is filth in his hand or something that is not clean so they didn't have any soap at the time so the sand or the soil does the job so he struck the floor or the soil and washed it so now he's ready to have the total bath what did he do afterwards he performed Evolution the normal Evolution and we have two versions one version says that he completed the full Evolution with the exception of the feet he did not wash his feet and he delayed washing the feet until the very end of and why is that because at the very end he should wash his feet before moving from the place he performed you don't know what will be in the floor so he delayed that and one version says no he completed the whole thing so you have the choice whether to complete the full oolution with washing your feet or just simply delay washing your feet until you to finish the whole obligatory bath after that what did the prophet Sall wasallam do he uh rubbed the skull of his head so that to ensure that water reaches to the roots of the hair in his head so this rubbing process you know clears the way for water to reach the soil or or the skull of or the roots of the hair and then he brought three handful of water and he put them on his head and this ensured that the hair was soaked with water so it's not enough just to rub on the surface and that's it you have to ensure that the water has reached the roots of your hair and then the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam poured water on the right right areas of his body and he they then poured water on the left area of his body in that the water reaches every place in his on his body and afterwards he washed his feet and that was it this is the total bath in one narration as you remembera may Allah be pleased with him with her brought him what come on guys we read the Hadith we read it twice tow brought him a towel you have to try to think things over before you know turn the turn comes to you because I'm going to pinpoint you one of these days and say you answer now I'm just uh not specifying any person in particular she brought him a towel and the prophet Sall wasallam did this meaning that he's Drying himself without a towel so some Scholars say the sunna is you do not accept towels and you just left let yourself dry and they start justifying this is good because then the skin takes all the grease in it and the water helps cleaning it other scholar say this is something depending on the person the prophet didn't want to use a towel then so you cannot generalize this you cannot say that well if the prophet didn't use it we shouldn't use it no he didn't instruct us not to use it he simply didn't want to use it so it's up to you whether you want to use a towel or or not it's completely up to you and the choice is yours so this is the form or the way the prophet uh performed and whether you choose to follow the Sunnah which is recommended highly recommended or you choose to just shower and take a total bath uh without any sequence or uh following the Sunnah it's also acceptable and there's nothing wrong in doing that uh I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so inshallah until we meet next time oh oh"
