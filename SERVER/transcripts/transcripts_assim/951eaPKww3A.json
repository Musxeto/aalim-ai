  "transcript": "lady you what come on for so I what Oh sanath nagar rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil alameen whoa salotto assalamo alma Bruce matin lil al-amin nabina muhammad anwar ali he was over he is very amiable assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh last time we met we were discussing what allah azzawajal had prepared for the disbelievers and those who transgress allah says in surat inaba verse 21 onwards truly hell is a place of ambush so hell is a creature hell is something that was created by allah azzawajal it has feelings it does what Allah tells her to do the Prophet told us having a solid wassalam that this magnificent yet horrific creature is existing today and the whereabouts of it is an issue of dispute among scholars some say that it is in the middle of the earth others say that it is way down but we do not know where because we know that paradise and jenna is way up in the authentic hadith the Prophet told us are a slob Sam that Hellfire on the day of judgment would have 70,000 leashes with each leash there is seventy thousand angels dragging it so you can imagine how huge this structure this creature is and it will be an ambush it will anticipate it will wait for those who are fond as Allah says in verse 22 a dwelling place for the tarun and who are the tejon with in that those who transgress whether disbelievers are believers they will be punished in hell they will abide therein for ages as Allah says azzawajal nothing cool shall they taste therein nor any drink except boiling water and dirty wound discharges and exact recumbents according to their evil crimes for verily what are their crimes one they used not to look for a reckoning and we address this issue and that the majority of us even on the muslims fail to acknowledge this point fail to recognize and realize that they're welcome a day that they are held accountable in but they belied our ayat completely so among their sins among the things that they'll be punished for is their falsifying Allah signs weather universal or religious and if you recall Allah so jelz ayaat has two meanings one is the verses of the Quran and this is the religious I at so it's a floor of an ayah which is a verse of the Quran and the second meaning is the signs the Magnificent miraculous signs of Allah soja in the universe so the stars are an eye at the Sun is an ayah the moon is an ayah the whole universe is an ayah there are so many in our own bodies that are signs indicating towards the oneness of allah so asian the greatness of a large thou shalt the magnificence of Allah the all-mighty and all things we have recorded in a book so these transgressors these pawan they belied they did not hope for a day of reckoning and to add to all of this they neglected the fact that every single thing is recorded in a book and this is the most scary part when you forget things alonzo gel never forgets them when you neglect things you'll find it on the day of judgment recorded every single thing every glance you looked at everything you heard with your ears every single letter that came out of your mouth everything is recorded and not only that you'll be held accountable for it if it's good you will be rewarded and if it's evil you will be punished and the weight on the day of judgment that things are scaled by and weighed by our the good deeds so good deeds over ways your bad deeds inshallah you're in paradise the opposite the other way around you'll be punished in hell until your purified providing that you are a Muslim and then Allah so Allah says so taste you the result of your evil actions no increase shall we give you except in torment and this is one of the most scary verses in the Quran suzuko felon Aziza come alive taste we shall not increase you in anything except in torment so sit back relax stretch your legs and think you are in a horrible place so dark that you cannot see a thing it is so hot that each part of your body each particle is suffering from the heat from the torture you feel hot you need something to cool down you don't find anything you so thirsty you want something to drink you're given boiling water and discharge coming from the wounds of the people of hellfire and coming from all the dirty things you can think of this is the only thing that you can drink and Hellfire and every time you think that this is about it you'll find that there is more to come when you drink the boiling water it tears your guts and you drink more and more and it never takes your thirst away the flesh is burnt yet Allah restores it once again so that you can feel the pain over and over again and whenever you try to look for an escape you see an opening and you think that this is it I'm gonna break out and once you go there you find that it was a mirage and that you're still in more and more pain torment and agony and whatever you think that you've reached the max and they couldn't be anything worse than this allah azzawajal tells those who are in hell so taste you know increase shall we give you except in torment and this depresses them more and more and it adds insult to injury physical injury physical torment Plus this mental torture that they get and this is only fair because they have been warned and Alonso gel has showed them the way Alonso girl has given them everything that would help them to be guided it was them who refused it it came to their door steps people gave them Dawa and called them to virtue and righteousness they were shown the light yet they preferred darkness and in exchange this is their punishment on the Hereafter what are the benefits of these verses that we've read first of all it shows you what would happen to those who transgress to those who go beyond what they were told to do and no one can claim that listen I'm free I have a free will we have the freedom of speech we can do whatever we want no you cannot even if they fool you and tell you that yes this is protected by our Constitution we can do whatever we want we can say whatever we want and this is not true there are boundaries even in this world even in their laws there are things you cannot cross and the greatest law of all is the law of Allah zildjian you are not free to do whatever you want because you are a slave he created you he put boundaries for you you cannot cross and if you do cross now you know what awaits you in hell Allah created you to worship him to follow his revelation to follow the Sunnah of the Prophet sallallahu ala Salem that only calls people to goodness now if you fail to comply if you fail to obey then this is what will happen to you in the verses Allah Sojin is showing us the punishment of those who be lie his signs and ayat allah azzawajal is showing us what will happen to those who say that there is no day of judgement who falsify the fact that there will be a day of reckoning and we've heard clear verses of the Quran that leaves no doubt for anyone who has a free will who is freed from being bias who's blessed by Allah to be objective and able to see among the points that a large they were gel is telling us in these beautiful verses that those who do well will be rewarded and those who do evil acts will be punished not only that that everything has been written down everything is recorded nothing is going to be forgotten and if there were to be things neglected they are neglected with knowledge meaning that Allah is so merciful he does not want to embarrass his servant in the authentic hadith allah azzawajal on the day of judgment would question an individual and allah azzawajal would cover that individual from the people so that they would not see him and allah would tell him about the bad things he did in this life but he would only begin with the small and minor things so he said my servant you did this on that day you did this on that day and the servant says yes I did he could not deny it he confesses yes I did yes I did and once he feels that he's about to be doomed a lot of mighty with his favor blessing and mercy says to him my servant as I've concealed your sins in the dunya in this life on earth I will conceal them on the day of judgment and I will change them into good deeds there are other points that we can learn from these ayaat but we have a short break so stay tuned ya Salam aleikum and welcome back among the points that allah azzawajal is telling us in these beautiful verses that those who do well will be rewarded and those who do evil acts will be punished not only that that everything has been written down everything is recorded nothing is going to be forgotten and if there were to be things neglected they are neglected with knowledge meaning that Allah is so merciful he does not want to embarrass his servant in the authentic hadith allah azzawajal on the day of judgment would question an individual and allah azzawajal would cover that individual from the people so that they would not see him and allah would tell him about the bad things he did in this life but he would only begin with the small and minor things so he said my servant you did this on that day you did this on that day and the servant says yes I did he could not deny it he confesses yes I did yes I did and once he feels that he's about to be doomed a lot of mighty with his favor blessing and mercy says to him my servant as I've concealed your sins in the dunya in this life on earth I will conceal them on the day of judgment and I will change them into good deeds how merciful Allah is and how greedy the servant is when he recognizes that he's been saved that he has been spared not only that there are lots of your changes is bad these into good deeds then his greed comes and if you're not greedy with Allah who will you be greedy with so is this o Allah I have so many big sins major says that I don't see here and a lot Almighty laughs of this because allah azzawajal is so merciful is so kind is so caring and loving subhanim as a virgin so every single thing would be recorded but the Prophet tells us Ali salatu salam this is sort of display of the deeds not holding people accountable so the display of deeds means that Allah will forgive and a large oj would that met them to paradise but when Allah holds a servant accountable for each and everything he will be tormented he will be put in hell my location ASAP rusev whoever Eliza holds accountable for every single thing in his records he will be punished but the display itself no this is something that Allah so Allah forgives also in these verses we see the establishment again again of the aqeedah of resurrection and of being rewarded or punished for your deeds now remember the Prophet aerosol Absalom had spent 13 years in Mecca calling people for this ikeda to know and acknowledge that you will be resurrected on the day of judgment and you would not be left and accounted for you will be summoned and you will be held accountable for every single deed you had done and also we learn from these verses that the torment on the day of judgment is endless it is forever and it does not end it is for eternity and this is a big problem see how long are you going to live on earth the best of us if they say that we reach the age of 80 now wow we've got it made and if you go to those who are 80 years old and you say uncle how long do you think you're gonna live longer he says I heard that there are some people up north and they reach 105 so I you go up north and ask the people who have reached 105 how long do you think I'm gonna live they say of course they had lost the teeth that we've heard of North and he lived like 950 years calling his people to Islam it never ends you always think that you can live for eternity and the minute you die you discover that you have lived for nothing compared to what awaits you of eternity the real eternity in heaven or in hell and that is why you should be wise you should not throw away eternity eternal life in paradise for a few lousy years on earth you should utilize it you should make the best of it and the best of it brings you the best in this life as well being righteous and pious is not a bad thing it gives you the tranquility and the peace of heart and mind and this is what every single person should look for strive to do and to attain moving on to the final phase of the surah and this is when allah azzawajal talks about what he has prepared for the people of gender the people of paradise and this is the norm in the quran it's called mithani which means that everything comes in doubles so if you speak about Hell you'll find verses speaking about paradise comparison if Allah talks about those who do good deeds the believers the righteous people you'll find a large dajjal immediately afterwards talking about the people of hell those who do evil deeds when Allah talks about males he talks about females when talking about old we talk about the young so there is always a comparison between two things in the whore on and this shows you that you have to live on earth with this in your heart fearing Allah and hoping for what Allah has for you without the balance you will not be able to live a righteous and good life if you fear Allah so much you fall into despair you'll give up hope in a larger but if you on the other hand wish hopefully in what Allah has and always consider a las forgiveness and mercy rather than his punishment and torment shape on would lead you to overdo it and to be heedless hairless about sins or about doing obligatory deeds and this is the balance we have the how our age who felt that Allah would never forgive them so they spent the whole night praying the whole day fasting yet their minds were tilted their minds were diverted from the straight path so they ended up killing righteous people killing Muslims and thinking that once-in- would make them forever in hell then they lost hope and on the other side you have who are known as Elmo gia and these people say no matter what sin you do allowed forgive no matter how many obligatory and mandatory acts you neglected Allah would still forgive you as long as you do not associate others with Allah and both cults are not from alison l jamar they are all deviant you have to have this balance so Allah Sojin mentions the people of hell immediately afterwards he mentions the people of paradise to give you hope while threatening you not to be from the people of hell now from verse 31 all words Allah talks about the reward of the people of paradise Mellas Oh she'll make you and me among those who are fortunate to enter paradise but I'm afraid that we don't have enough time remaining with us in this episode so inshallah we will try to elaborate a little bit more on the remaining of these beautiful verses next time we meet and if Allah wills we will move on to the following surah so until then I leave you fear manila oh sorry what a sort of but I solo me I"
