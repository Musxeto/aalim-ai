  "transcript": "so sure question is the Imam does not give sufficient pause between the Fatiha and the surah for us to read the fatty ha first of all there isn't such a pause neither in mandatory prayers nor in taraweeh nor in another prayer the Prophet Elisha never paused as the sum of the Imams do leaving time for the people to recite the fatty huh the Prophet would only pause to take his breath so that he could go on for the second surah so therefore this is not part of the Sunnah to pause secondly if you started reciting the fatty ha and what is the ruling on reciting the fatty ha in the congregational prayer where the imam is reading"
