  "transcript": "uh the next question is from sister nadia my daughter is interested in marrying a revert to whom she had given the message of islam how do i verify if he is or if he will be a righteous practicing spouse unfortunately marriage is like buying watermelon we are in winter so we most likely in kuwait you don't have watermelon but when it's summer you find them everywhere and here in saudi arabia they say alaskan meaning that you buy it providing we i open it to you and you can get to see it's red and sweet and if it's not you're not obliged to buy it and some scholars say that this kind of transaction is not permissible because it's ambiguous you're buying something that is not um sure and certain and it is a transgression towards the seller because he would be losing if he opens it to you and it is white and and sour or not sweet but the most authentic opinion is that he's experienced and he's the one who's giving this concession so the transaction is halal we're talking about marriage what are you doing talking about watermelon watermelon is like marriage when someone proposes to my daughter i do my due diligence i check around i ask all his friends his relatives co-workers i go to the masjid all boxes are checked so i say bismillah we do the marriage a couple of months later the guy happens to be a psycho or has mental illnesses and he divorces my wife my daughter should i blame myself no i did my due diligence so was there any guarantee that i could have attained or obtained to ensure that this man is practicing no there isn't so what to do nothing you have to only check and cross check and praise the hara and whatever is good will happen but if you don't check just because ah i'm a revert and he's got blue eyes and blonde hair and oh river meaning he's a sahabi he's like the companions no no no no wait hold your horses not all of them look like this not even most of them are like this they need a lot of time to embrace islam correctly some of them come with weird ideas especially some westerners they want to embrace islam and they themselves becomes imams so you find themselves opinionated actually i hope the word is right i don't know my english loves you both ways i'm not practicing so some of them think no no this is halal this is haram and he has no knowledge what are you speaking he says no no i know this is this islam is not like that and he starts to give his own opinions over major issues such people are there so not every tom dick and harry who accepts islam being a westerner or being a revered means that he's a scholar or a companion or a righteous person you have to do your due diligence ask around check how he is after accepting islam especially if he's been a revert for two three years but if he became a river last week and he just wants to get married to your sister or to your daughter i get suspicious and question marks so i have to i cannot give my daughter or my sister to someone like that until he proves he's a good muslim he's a practicing muslim because so many of those after marriage they abandoned the salah they are bad in islam and they go back to their own ways because all what he was interested in you know what so after he got it that's it so there isn't any way you can verify whether it is a good proposal or not whether it is practicing or not except through what we can see with our own eyes and allah knows best"
