  "title": "Husband gave me 1 Talaq, am I divorced - Issues of divorce canâ€™t be solved by phone or email",
  "transcript": "Zahra from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum One night when my husband was away in another city and we had a huge fight over the phone through text messages I was fed up with everything and told him that I won't live with him anymore and that time I was quite determined to do so I told him that I will inform my parents about my decision Next morning I informed my parents and also told my husband that I informed my parents and I won't live with you anymore Then he got angry and gave me three talaqs at once through text messages Now my question is will this consider as one talaq or khula or both? These issues of divorce cannot be answered on the phone or email cannot be answered by the woman's presentation and it has to be done with the husband so that we could hear from both parties understand the background the intentions and where they're coming from My advice is to take this case to your court in Bangladesh Islamic court and show it to the qadi and see what he tells you about it or you can go to an Islamic center that follows Ahlul Hadith because most likely your qadi would say that these three divorces are final and you cannot go to him at all you cannot remarry him again So no, go to Ahlul Hadith or to someone who follows the Qur'an and the Sunnah and not the Hanafi madhhab strictly the Qur'an and the Sunnah and then inshallah they will give you the right fatwa"
