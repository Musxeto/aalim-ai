  "transcript": "same Erica nuts so the fatty huh there are two different dissertations all are attributed to the profit that is lobster so we say manly Kiyomi teen or al hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen manikyam ed but when it comes to other similar locations for allah huma magical malt we cannot say Paloma medical mug and we cannot say put out of business Maddie kinas we have to say marinus we move on the benefit of the garage to realize what you decide and what to avoid again is it is the same point north on the same point to realize what to decide and want to avoid because there are authentic para but it is not accepted because it is different to the way the Muslim was written and this is another challenge to our cameramen the Destin yes it I'll give you an example Masha Allah Allah you have to get Tina Turner the way so that the people from the hotel do not see any how it's my mistake after teaching 15 years usual and aware of this but I haven't fought for eight years so that's why I lost touch going man ah what I was going to say ok when lady-y-y yamcha wanna hurry hey de la jolla what Zachary one Punta what is this Mahalo pop and recover well concerns this is how we know it he'll miss wrote me a letter pleased with him had it in his mooseheart whether the car will haunt her so the narration is authentic but it is not with the coat the way it's written in the most half of art man do we accept it we do not accept it so this is why it is important for us to realize what to recite and what to avoid whenever my suit says the latter to a young men motor caveat it's authentic can we recite it we have to avoid it but it adds value when we come to explaining the for on to add meaning as in evolution now again I'm making life difficult manage if we look at why I vehicle kill a maraca p 1 0 0 0 seconds war r jülich on do you have another pen this practice for camera type this is one way of reciting it boom shaka Bureau sicko war r jhoola cool this is what we decide absol answer there is another recitation where we say wants of abuse equal well Judy Kuhn and this is very linguistic Allah says hello salut usual how come why Diaco it's all fat ha that's her once a hobby room second war jhoola comfort her again so what does this mean this is very detailed grammatical arabic allah is asking us or instructing us to wash our faces our arms to the elbows and our legs but here he says wipe over your head so there are three limbs that are washed and one that is white this is what we know but the Kara are the second carafe it's fine it was where Allah says wash your faces wash your arms to the elbows why over your heads why over your feet so when I say why are you lick on this means that I'm wiping when I say what are Joe Flacco this mean I'm she so this adds that to me what value does it add to me it adds meaning what meaning does it add it tells me that I can i why on the socks the shoes whatever I want to do and this is sunnah and this is the added value we get out of the term ahad also it clarifies the mean sometimes the meaning is a little bit vague I cannot understand the car comes and adds another meaning as in the case of menstruation where Allah says by either a diverse grata Kumu hula hut there yet holnap they that Aparna there to win them in hi to America moolah the word itself your corner it's written in this way yup home now this can be that the blood stops and it also can be that they take the obligatory ocean the total bath there is another cara the same letters yo this is definitely to wash to have a total bath so allah tells the husband's not to approach their women until they have the total path so if the bleeding stops the first gras means okay plus the bleeding stopped they did take a full bar so it's okay for you to approach the second car on ours is no it has to stop and they have to make the total back they might they have to mak make the whole suit so this adds and clarifies to me what is meant by the verse so it's important in this sense also one of the benefit of the kilowatt it makes it easy for people who find it difficult for them to recite and for example what a shine napper this is recited where know a little bit far to the west morocco and lg's they recite wash and naphré and it is very very difficult for me to recite it because the way of pronouncing it is difficult and it's very difficult for them to pronounce have some awesome and they say you mean wanna be right they don't say you may know what I did right and if I tell them no you have to respect like this maybe they would find it difficult i lik so it makes it easy for some people to recite the Kawara that suits their language and of course the benefit of the garage that it preserves the or on when we have a narration of is not to the popular is Aram and every car is very strict on every single data that is pronounced how it's pronounced this is the way he learnt it from his share this preserves the Quran from changing section 6 is operating ok hamdullah now we accept all the shooting and the firing please explain me what is the basic difference between our roof and karate I'm confused I am do that we have it on tape so i recommend that you get the tape again in a very short answer I believe this question came before we even started brother this will not help the best thing to do is to get thinner alcohol or thinner this would make it very easy all it does help MA yes still okay hamdillah ashram or different revelation of the Quran depending on the dialects they were given to the Prophet Aristotle salam they are seven in number the Companions understood it and knew it not all of them knew it at the first the prophet taught someone different to the other to the other but they finally came to understand and realize it and accept it as it is nowadays we don't know these Arab you cannot have a distinction saying that this is how or this is not how except in few words such such as Malik and Malik well you cannot say that this is visitation definitely this is half that of the out but which are some scholars say that I hope our tribes that the language of kewdale the language of the P the language of horizon the language of Christ the language of proper path the language of the Imam and so on but there is no basis for this show the I heard are different ways of reciting the Quran revealed by allah azzawajal to gibril and from Jibril to the Prophet ericeira the para art is a way that was recited by different parties and they attribute this to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and we had seven companions who taught the Quran and they had students and their students afterwards relate this to their students and this is how the Quran reach us do they have any connection yes the karate are based on da who but you cannot distinct and say the this power of apps announcer is half number two it can have her number one and some from half number seven and some from house number three definitely mixed but we cannot state and see the house starts here and ends here well dr. ah we can say the car starts here and ends here and this is once i hear it I know that this is the power of this card or number two or number five for number seven and Allah knows this does can also mean change in the words but with same meanings dr. aha now I have to get to the whole course again there's the car I mean to change the meaning to change the word by having the same meaning yes as we've stated but attempt a tool or  by you the same word but the meeting again and again e is a different word but it has the same meaning and the writing is different but it's again it has to be in accordance to the most half of or the writing of Earth man you address that Quran sir ok because I don't want this to become any open here's the chairman he directs me to answer that so is it the color again we stated we cannot define if this is out or not we relate that all the seventh row art come from the 7i 0 but which is which we do not know so when we come to perturb a hero phata that battle they're approved draw yes then definitely they are approved our and one-half cannot have two words one half is for today you know the other one is participatory there was another way of saying it then we would have a third cup but it has to be authentic motivated so this we can say that this is how this is out which one is it has number one half number three half number four I don't know it which Pilar I know the body I know who resides at the piano and I know who decides predator but everyone makes a mistake in recitation of the Quran during sulla especially when one is reciting surah that he is in the process of learning does the salon become invalid know allah azzawajal says at the end of throttle baccarat of bella la tua hizzoner in Xena hapana it was authentic adi SI muslim allah says i have done so but file to so Allah would not hold you accountable if you forget or if you make a mistake only when you intend to do it so if someone is learning the Quran and he makes a mistake and hamdillah there is no burden nothing wrong with that his prayer is valid except in deciding as one of the brothers asked me yesterday in Fatiha patty ha is not acceptable at all to have a mistake and it that changes and authors the meaning one says surah al idina and I'm to re him what's the difference between an m2 and an on top I did and Allah did so when you say the fact that you have blessed instead I say in the back I have blessed how much the meaning is gone so one says not all my race he's not out of its ok no it is not okay go and pray again but if the mistake is another sewers other than the Quran this is tolerable if you can correct it corrected if it this is him he cannot correct it then inshallah there is nothing wrong if the Quran was revealed in more than one half to make things easy for the people then why was the Quran not resided in more than one language so that it is made easier for many more people why is only the language close to Arabic revealed more than one-half this is especially because the quraían is for whole world for all mankind Allah Azza Virgil says in surah cool ambia the user who have my eval go home use her own this translates to Allah is not questioned about his deeds and they are questions about this you cannot come to Allah say Allah why because five fingers why not six it would have been easier for us to you know play Nintendo PlayStation it will grow much faster for us to print you do not ask a larger question Allah Allah sir will revealed it in the Quran why I cannot answer for Allah how are you doing to Quran in Arabic why I cannot answer for Allah Allah tells us that it was revealed in Arabic why so and Allah Allah intended it this way now i can give justifications and you may say masha'Allah good justification do you miss it I don't buy it it's up to you but why I don't have any answer except that Allah revealed it in arabic now justifications because Arabic is the only preserved language is English preserved 200 years ago Henry you cannot understand English if you read the novels the plays of Shakespeare do not die down what is this and if you read the poetry of 100 years ago of TS Eliot or whatever still nice but difficult or on everybody understands it it's still the language of millions of the Arabs they understand it they do not understand few words because it's not used it's common but they easily relate it because they know the root of the latter of of the word itself so Arabic as I said before is a very rich language when you say hane eye is the eye it can also be I the object itself I'm a shape it can also be a spring of water it can also be a spy I would send I i will send an eye well no I was sent a man who would go and see things and relate it back to me so Arabic is a very very rich language you can draw pictures with Arabic the Prophet Isis around his words are numbered imagine when he says that love what about this hadith is a whole chapter and took is a whole chapter in a powered the rules ha disappear no matter what I do have two words only yes why is this because they say that you yeah I kind of explain it it will go to cook when Allah says in the Quran what I couldn't fill fill fill casar see I am told the audit al-bab forward five words in a sauce in prescribed punishment an eye for an eye if someone kills someone has to be killed this is called a sauce in this cause you have life if you just walk ponder upon it what life I'm going to execute this man because he killed my brother yes in this you will have life what life a lot of those who will kill will refrain from killing then this brings life to the community type words now if you want to explain this in English you'll probably right 34 pages but it's very easy in arabic so arabic is a preserved language then Arabs at the time where the most uncorrupt people online Stein they were the most uncorrupt there Scholes they're thinking it was clean pew and uncorrupt and these are all the syph occasions I can go on and a short time but can someone say definitely this is why Allah as they will reveal the Quran Arabic no therefore the question is not correct to begin one final push is regarding the grammar so I would like to give the cushion to shape to reach so that he can understand better lock / laces Belva and two Alou would you happen place el burro and two Alou do happen this is one part and the other one is please explain why in surah al-fatihah touch la jolla enough alayhi these are parts of a number of grammatical differences in the Quran that were compiled by some of the enemies of Islam saying that these discrepancies these differences show that the Quran is not from a large that we get the funny thing is the Quran was revealed to the Prophet"
