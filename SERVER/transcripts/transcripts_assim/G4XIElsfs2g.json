  "title": "Forgot to wash a part in Wudu, should I wash the part or start over? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Samiha says if i forgot to do one part of wouldl that is evolution and remember it right after completing Woodill do I have to do wudu again or wash the part I forgot now what samia's referring to is the issue of forgetting for example to wash my left arm so I did everything I rinsed my mouth sniffed water up my nostrils then pushed it out washed my face washed my right hand wiped over my head washed my feet and then I've noticed that this is dry so she says do I have to do the willow again or simply just wash my left arm the answer is you have to do the left arm and what comes afterwards because what comes after it is void so washing your face rinsing your mouth and nose this is valid washing your right hand arm this is valid wiping over your head and washing your feet is invalid because there are six pillars for woudl there is washing the face including the mouth and the nose washing the arms to the elbows wiping over the head washing the feet up to the ankles the order face arms head and feet and then to be simultaneous not leaving a gap what you have done you neglected the pillar of order and hence you have to go back wash your left arm wipe your feet head and then wash your feet"
