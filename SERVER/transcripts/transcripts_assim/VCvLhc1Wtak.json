  "transcript": "the more you live the more Good Deeds you do the more Allah loves you in Ma you all know him may Allah be pleased with him one of the 10 heavenbound companion of the Prophet Alat wasam one of the most beloved companions to the prophet wasam he says that I saw in a vision I slept and I saw in a dream and before he saw that dream and he told us about that dream he is telling us that two men from a region up East came and reverted to Islam they accepted Islam so they were brothers one of them was much better than his brother in worship so he prays a lot of nights and he fasts a lot of days and he does a lot of good things gives in charity and this particular person the one who does Good Deeds went to battle and was martyred in the sight of Allah so he's a Shahed so what more do you want he's a companion he does a lot of good deeds and he died as a Shahed one year later his brother died normally naturally so he said I went to bed one night and I saw in a dream that I and these two men were outside side of paradise waiting for the gates to open so the gates of paradise were opened and they summoned they called the one who died a year after his brother the one who did not do a lot of good de the one who was not martyred and it was closed and after a while the doors were open again and the other person the Martyr was admitted says I wanted to go in and the angels told me it's not your time yet and I woke up so I spoke about my dream to everyone around me and people were shocked and astonished how is it a person who dies as a mar and he did so many good deeds he was much much more enthusiastic than his brother yet his brother is admitted to Paradise before him there's something wrong and this dream reached the prophet Alat and he heard what the people were talking about so he called them and he said what are you wandering about they said oh prophet of Allah he dies a year after this martyr and he didn't do as many Good Deeds as he did yet he's admitted to Paradise first so the prophet said how long did he live after him and they said one year he said did he fast Ramadan they said yes how many days did he fast how many prayers did he offer how many prostrations did he give more than the man who was martyred a year ago by Allah what's between them is like what's between the heavens and the Earth One Year of Living does the difference between a normal person and a martyr which indicates that you should value every single minute that you live and consider it as a gift a blessing and a favor from Allah I say what you hear and I seek Allah's forgiveness so ask Allah Asel to forgive me and you as well"
