  "transcript": "what's the ruling on seeking medicine seeking a healing for one of our illnesses is it mandatory is it permissible is it something up to you to do or not what do you think it is Sunnah always no one would say mandatory always no was a permissible no so Abdullah whatever you ask a question say it's an issue of dispute among Scholars anytime someone asks you a question say okay it's an issue of dispute this scholarism you're saying the right thing it's correct but seriously speaking what is the ruling on me taking the medicine when I feel sick Scholars say that if taking this medicine if not if not taking this medicine means I'm going to die because 100 the medication cures my illness and I don't take it I'm sinful so first of all if you have 100 percent confidence that it would cure your illness with the grace of Allah of course or you have 90 confidence so it's most likely you must take the medication it's a must the prophet says seek healing and medication and treatment for your illness this is an instruction Scholars say that if taking this medication most likely would cure my illness but my illness is not fatal is not something that's going to kill me so if I don't take it I'm not going to die but if I take it it's going to cure my illness so if I leave it then it is highly recommended that you take it it's not mandatory I've mentioned how many points two first one if I take it I'm gonna get better if I don't I'm going to die what's the ruling you must it's mandatory two if I take it I'm going to get better if I don't I'm not going to die it is recommended to take it it's highly recommended to take it but if you don't take it you're not sinful I don't want to get healing the third is when it's equal there is a possibility that if I take it I'm going to get better but it's not a hundred percent it's 50 50. like most of surgeries today if you the doctor tells you well you have a 50 50 success what would you do Scholars say it is best for you not to take it but unfortunately because we love this Dunya if the doctor tells us that there is a 10 success rate we're going risk of not being successful so I have to get better I have to go back to my sports I have to go back to my family so this now you know you know the percentage likewise you can apply this to cancer patients you can apply this to uh heart uh um disease patients some of them they tell you Allah we have a a procedure we would put something in your artery and you would feel good how what's the success rate you say it's 90 percent okay you have to do this but sometimes the doctor says we have to have an open heart surgery and we have to change four arteries for you and Allah the success rate is 50 60 don't do it and I'm shocked when I see people who are in their 80s and they're undergoing heart surgery how long you want to live seriously come on 18 years old get ready get your rug prayer rug and pray and sit on it until death comes to you you're dying not that I'm telling you don't live no live but live with the vision that you're going to die in a second now don't live forever and I'm not saying that people should want to die now the longer you live the higher you go in Paradise insha Allah imagine I am a very optimistic person but I do not cherish living a lot and I've lived a long life mashallah I've enjoyed every single day of it do I have any other desires to come but I'm very positive yet something to remind you of the value of living on Earth Allah be pleased with him do you know uh raise your hands has anybody heard of Talha one two three four okay we have people enthusiastic yeah I think I did okay I'm not gonna ask any questions is one of the ten Heaven bound of the Prophet Allah he said and the authentic Hadith that two men came from a village called Bila it's in harassan close to Iraq Iran Afghanistan in the region and they embraced Islam they were brothers and they went for Jihad one of them was martyred he died in the cause of Allah and his brother lived after him for a whole year in Medina and then he died says I saw in a vision I was dreaming I was asleep and I saw in my dream that the three of us these two men and myself were at the gates of paradise and the gates of paradise were opened and someone came and said you come in and the one who died last not the Martyr was admitted first and after a while the gates of paradise were opened and they admitted the second one the Martyr and he said I wanted to go in before it was too late and they said no no it's not your time yet and he woke up so he spoke to the people and said well yesterday I saw this and this and the people were astonished and they started speaking and this reached the prophet Allah so the prophet gathered them said what's wrong with you it's the prophet of Allah he was martyred he was Shaheed and yet the guy who died on his bed a year after was admitted to Paradise before him how is that he said the prophet subhanallah he died one year afterwards how many prostrations did he offer how many times he prayed how many days he fasted how many money uh how much money did he spend in the cause of Allah by Allah what's between him and the Martyr in Paradise as the distance between the heavens and the Earth so this is an encouragement for you to live more because the more you live the more Good Deeds you do yeah imagine how many times you say in the day subhanallah how many times and you've got palm trees planted the more you say this you got bricks of silver and gold you've got this and this in Paradise all waiting for you while someone who's your brother who's your friend who died 20 years ago is deprived of this so I'm not asking you to have a death wish no I'm just telling you to look at your life evaluate it value it and utilize it to what benefits you"
