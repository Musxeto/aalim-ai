  "title": "Does the dua of 8 gates of Jannah open for one who does a perfect wudu apply if they wash once, or 3",
  "transcript": "Omar from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, I have a question about the many hadiths that the Prophet ï·º says whoever performs wudu and does it well and then says Ashadu an la ilaha illallah wa akhdahu la sharika la wa ashadu anna Muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh eight gates of paradise will be opened for him and he may enter from whichever he wishes So we know that the perfect wudu means that you have to wash all body parts three times But what is if someone is too lazy and just washes all the parts once or twice Is it then not allowed or a bid'ah to say this dua in the hope for the reward? JazakAllahu Khairan Did the Prophet wash his limbs once? Yes or no? Omar Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. So if he washed it once, this means that that was a perfect wudu. Therefore, it is sunnah to wash it once, twice or three times and all is considered to be perfect wudu. So it doesn't matter. What matters is that you've made the perfect wudu in one wash, not leaving any area. So if you manage to do that, then you say the dua and you will get the reward inshallah."
