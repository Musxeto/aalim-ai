  "transcript": "but never give up giving even when there are many rahim and hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik ala mean nabina muhammad in wada he was happy he ajma'in assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato generosity is not a theoretical thing it is something that we must practice in order for us to be perfect believers it is one of the branches of belief that in order to be a true practice and believer you have to fulfil them the companions of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam knew this and they went out of the way not to give when they were rich only but also to give when they were in desperate need they used to be so generous that they would prefer strangers to themselves it was reported in the authentic hadith that a man came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam from out of medina and he requested the prophet alayhi salatu salam to give him food and shelter so the prophet sent re salatu salam to his wives send me food if you have any and all of his wives replied by saying that we do not have food ourselves so the Prophet said that it's awesome to those who were around him to his companions who would take my guest to be his own so I would tell her I'm sorry may Allah be pleased with him said I will take him or prophet of Allah and Abu Talha took his guests to his house and he spoke to his wife on Moshe Lane the mother of an asylum addict the Blessed family of companions of the Prophet Elisha lobster I mean he said I'm sure lame do you have anything for us to eat so she said that by Allah I have only my children's food this is their only meal so Abu Talha said well give them something give them water give them anything that would make them fall asleep and then give us their food so she put them to bed and they slept and she brought the food and she put it in front of the guest pretending to be eating with him the food was so little but they wanted the guests to eat and she turned the light down so that he would not see that they were not eating and they pretended to be eating in the dark until the guests ate all the food when they went to the Prophet al-assad said I'm the following morning and offered fidgets prayer with him the Prophet told them the glad tidings that Allah approved what they had done that night this is the form of generosity we are referring to not what we see today someone having millions and millions and gives a thousand or two in the cause of Allah and thinking that he had done something that no one else had ever done this is not the generosity we are referring to I was mad when I found me allah be pleased with him was not a great warrior of SLAM like Omar and I Lee he was a great caliph and he was someone that the Prophet loved sallallahu selim to the extent that he gave him two of his own daughters in marriage when the first one died he married him the second one he was not one of the greatest fighters of Islam but he was one of the most generous people of all and that is why he bought the well of rumah which was controlled by a jew depriving people depriving muslims from drinking from it he gave it all to the Muslims he did not keep anything for himself he also managed to sponsor the army that went to HUS with Tabuk and he gave a hundred of camels with all that is needed for it in terms of saddles of food of water it's fully equipped for the cause of Allah and the Prophet said that it's awesome who would give for the cause of Allah so he said another hundred Oh prophet of Allah on me and the Prophet encouraged who would give for the sake of Allah he said another hundred Oh prophet of Allah on me and then the Prophet said that is a lot of Salaam it would not harm earth man whatever he does after today Allah will forgive whatever he does may Allah be pleased with him I'm mad even off as well one of the rich companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam gave a lot of his wealth for the cause of allah they had this wealth in their hands and not in their hearts that's why it was easy for them to give it away we have our wealth in our hearts and that is why when we spend something we feel like having a heart attack even if it was negligible even if it was so little yet we feel that we are having a stroke every time we spend why because we depend on ourselves we think and believe that we are doing what we're doing and the money we're gathering it is all by our own power and knowledge not from allah almighty islam encourages us to spend and we have to know that allah wants us to spend money but not to humiliate ourselves if you compare the doing of abu bakr may allah be pleased with him when he gave all of his money for the sake of allah one would think that this is insane what will you do you will your children hungry you will leave your house unattended you will not have any money to pay for your needs and the things that make you live in an honourable life the question would be posed is Apple bucker like any one of us the answer is No Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him was a traitor he was a merchant so he knew that even if he gives everything away in couple of days he would be able to make another deal and Allah who would give him more and more money so if we were in the same position yes this is permissible for us to give all our money away but if giving all our money away meant that our children will starve and we would not have money to live a decent life then this is forbidden and that is why one when spending should be wise he should not be extravagant in spending and he should also not boast or brag about it he should have it for the sake of Allah Allah Almighty says and eat and drink but waste not by extravagance certainly Allah likes not the mushrikeen those who waste by extravagance and also we should avoid doing what we're doing so that people would be happy and praise us because spending being generous giving away in charity this is a form of worship therefore we should make it solely and entirely and sincerely for the sake of Allah Almighty Allah told us that as the Prophet SAW Allah Allah mentioned that Allah says I am the wealthiest from having associates with me allah azza wajal does not accept to have any associates with him whoever as Associates others with me I will abandon him and those whom he associated with me therefore when you spend in the cause of Allah and means of charity this has to be and for his sake alone the Almighty the punishment of those who do not comply is indeed severe the prophets of Allah who are aware he was seldom told us that among the three whom Allah would punish on the day of judgment a person who used to be known as the generous jawad and when allah azza wajal brings him in front of him and shows him his blessings shows him what he had done for him the almighty then Allah asks him what have you done in this regard the man says o Allah I gave my money away for your sake and for your sake alone Allah then says you are lying you did this so that people would say that you are generous and indeed they have said that you are generous take him to fire and he would be among the first to be thrown in Hellfire we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back assalamualaikum warahmatullah and welcome back it is one of Alma's names that he is generous and if you look around you you will find clear display of Allah's generosity in your entire life since you were given birth by your mother till the day a person dies Allah the Almighty is so generous but as individuals as humans we neglect to see the positive things we fail to see a lot generosity overwhelming us in all aspects of life if you recall it was defined generosity was defined as giving when you don't have much and preventing those who ask you from humilation so it is essential for a person to be generous to be giving but also to prevent humilation from reaching those who ask you and unfortunately this is not the case in some of the times a lot of almighty says o you who believe do not render in vain your charity by reminders of your generosity or by injury so you can render you can even void your generosity and you can become even worse you can become sinful with your generosity when you start to use and to remind those who you give that you had done so and so for them this is one of the major sins it is called in Arabic and men it is to show off and to remind someone of your kindness and this is unfortunately quite common among those who do favors who do well who charity when they are cornered when they feel that their charity was not in its place so they go to individuals and say didn't I do this and that for you didn't I do you a favor why do you do this and they remind them of the things or the good things they had done and this is a major sin abu hanifa one of the greatest scholars of Islam and the Imam of the school of thought of Hanafi school it was said that he was a businessman and he had lots of money and he used to lend people money for the sake of Allah interest free and it was also said that he used to sit in the shade of a house in the afternoon where it was pleasant they did not have air conditioners they did not have fans so whenever it was pleasant and it was possible to sit in the shade he would go out of his house and sit in the shade it was reported that the owner of that house who was his neighbor borrowed from him a small amount of money and from that day Abu Hanifa stopped sitting in the shade so the man came to him and said Imam you used to sit in the shade of my house what prevented you from doing this and he said that I was afraid that sitting in your house now is interest for the money I gave you and I did not want to use you or I did not want you to feel that you being used look at this type of generosity that this scholar this Imam had and it was also reported by the Seraph that when you do a favour to a person and whenever you see him you see assalamu alaykum as a reminder that you have done this favour do not offer Salam to that extent a Muslim should be sensitive don't do something that hurts your brother if you lend someone money if you do him a favor and every time you meet him you greet him or you do something and you feel that he's upset because he is humilated then avoid this so that you would not hurt his feelings the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam told us in the authentic hadith there are three whom Allah will not look at or praise on the day of judgment and there will be a painful punishment for them the one who wears his garment below his ankles the one who reminds others of his favours and the one who sells his product by means of making false oaths these are all major sins because Allah Azza WA JAL will not look at them will not have mercy upon them on the day of judgement and he has repaired punishment for them the first one it is a person who prolongs his garment his trousers whatever he's wearing below his waist to the extent that it exceeds his ankles so this one would be punished by Allah the second one is al menon and he is the one who reminds others of his favours so whenever he is sitting with others who say I did you this and that I introduce you to your new job I lent you money the other day I made you come out of a problem by solving it or by having some one influenced the decision makers and so on so he keeps on reminding people of his favours and this as mentioned earlier is a major sin a proper Muslim does not do this why because he's doing what he's doing for the sake of Allah and the third one is a person who made Allah the Almighty his product in selling and buying in the sense that he does not sell something or buy something unless he swears and says by Allah I bought it for so much and I sold it for so-and-so and people would take what he's saying for granted simply because he used the word Allah he swore by Allah and they believed in that all of these three people will be punished on the day of judgment if you're generous you have to do that for the sake of Allah and you will live freely and happily but if you do it for the sake of people then you have a problem a lot of the Muslims usually have problems when they do well to others and they are not faced by the same token so you get people upset with others why are you upset well I visit them I phoned them and they never returned my calls and then never returned my visits so why did you visit and call in the first place because Allah instructed me to connect with the relatives in the next-of-kin so then if you're making it for Allah you should not expect a reward except from Allah likewise if you're generous this is for Allah sake expect the reward to come from Allah not from others that's why you should not avoid your charity by doing this one of the means that should make us generous is to know and to believe that whatever we have an own is just something deposited with us by Allah Sojin so the wealth we have is not ours it's a deposit that Allah may take anytime he wishes it was narrated by abu hurairah may allah be pleased with and that the prophet alayhi salatu salam said there is no day on which the people get up but two angels come down and one of them says oh Allah give in compensation to the one who depends in charity to the one who spends in charity and the other one says o Allah destroy the one who withholds so whatever you do it is a deposit that Allah has given you two angels supplicate one says o Allah give and bless and compensate those who spend in charity the other one says o Allah destroy the money and the wealth to those who withhold and they do not give away in charity one would say then whom should I give in charity for whom should I be generous to to the one who are poor to the one who needs medicine should I dig a well should I feed the should both those who don't have what is the best means a man came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he said o prophet of allah i have a DNR what should I do with it the Prophet said a lot Salaam spend it on yourself on your needs the man said I have another one the Prophet said spend it on your children he said I have another one the Prophet said spend it on your wife on your family the man said I have another one the Prophet said spend it on your servant those who serve you then the man said I have another one the Prophet said Ras salat wa salam spend it wherever you think is best and this hadith we understand that spending what we have we have to start on spending it on ourselves on taking care of ourselves not to go to extravagance by buying designers clothes and so on no but at least don't humiliate yourself and live in poverty try to live a decent life then spend the extra money on your children their education their well-being then spend it on your wife then spend it on those who serve you whether they are working for you or working with you that you are responsible for supporting them and providing them then you may spend it on whatever you wish such as giving it to the next of kin and to those who are close to you Islam recommends to be recommends us to be generous the Prophet even goes on to say arias philosophy and whenever you cook a meal add more water to it so that you can make it bigger and share some of it with your neighbors to that extent it is a sin for a Muslim to live and to have a full stomach while his neighbor is hungry the Prophet tells us a little of some do not humilate or look down do not look down at the size of the charity even if you were to give a leg of a sheep to your neighbor what would he do with the leg of a sheep it's a gift it is something to be charitable with it is a sign of your generosity so we should be giving we should offer the brothers and the sisters what we can in order for us to be generous and in order for us to qualify to be among those whom allah azzawajal loves this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time female Allah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
