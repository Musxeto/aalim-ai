  "transcript": "Mohammed from Norway Mohammed. Yes Sheikh, Jazak Allah Khair, I just have one question. Assalamu Alaikum. Yes, I just have one question, it is about. Give Salam first. I have only one question. My question is about joining the prayer. What is, can someone join Maghreb and Isha if they feel they will not be able to pray Isha on time due to oversleeping? The Hadith of Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, that the Prophet once in his life, Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, joined Asr, Zuhr and Asr and then joined Maghreb and Isha together without travelling or being ill. And when he was asked why did he do this, he replied so that there would not be any hardship upon his Ummah. Scholars looked into this Hadith and said that whenever there is hardship upon the person, real hardship, then it is permissible for him to combine between Zuhr and Asr or Maghreb and Isha. Such hardship is when in your country, the night is too short. So Isha is performed at 11 and Fajr is performed at 2am. Three hours is not sufficient to sleep and if you pray Isha on time, you're going to miss Fajr. And if you don't sleep the whole night, you're going to miss work and school. There is great hardship. In this case, we tell people that if you pray Maghreb and combine to it Isha immediately and then go to bed immediately so you can catch four or five hours of sleep, that would be permissible due to necessity and huge and great hardship. And Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best. you"
