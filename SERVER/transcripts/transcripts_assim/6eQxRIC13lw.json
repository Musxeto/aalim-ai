  "title": "Should I mention my depression in my marriage biodata or tell the potential spouse? assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "Bailey from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam. Sheikh, I am on anti-depressant and other than no sickness and I am going to give my biodata online. There is a section saying if I have any physical sickness, so should I write about my anti-depressant on my biodata or should I say this to the groom personally when they choose me? The depression you're having, is it chronic? No Sheikh, I have no problem right now and the doctor said that it will get fixed once I get married and that they will. No, if this is a mild depression, there is no need to tell anyone about it and move on. But if it's something that affects and impacts the peace and flow of the marriage, then yes you have to make sure that you clear it with the potential spouse."
