  "transcript": "what's the reward of praying to raqqas after rohr that is after praying the two rakah of sunnah muakkeda there is an authentic hadith where the prophet said alaihis whoever prays four raka's before and for raqqa's after the he will be forbidden for not for hellfire meaning that he will be saved from hell fire and these eight raka's six of them are part of the emphatic sunnah because we know that there are 12 raka's that the prophet salallahu and never abandoned when residing he would only abandon some or skip some when he travels so the hadith where the prophet says whoever observes 12 raka's in the day and the night allah will build him a mansion in jannah in paradise and he explained to us these twelve raka's two before fajr four before the two after the two after maghrib and two after asia so these are twelve now the lahore has four before and two after these are emphatic whenever the prophet allah susan traveled he used to skip these six raka's of the voluntary prayers and the two after maghrib and the two after asia the rest was was business as usual now to add two more after the which makes it for before and for after you get this reward of being saved from hell fire but as i stated earlier the two raqqa addition to the six voluntary prayers are not emphatic if you do them alhamdulillah if you don't there's no problem inshaallah none whatsoever uh"
