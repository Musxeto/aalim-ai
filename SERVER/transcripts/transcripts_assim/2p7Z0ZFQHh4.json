  "title": "Impersonating Others Haram? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from the US. So I saw the role model episode you did about what the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ hated. And one thing you said was that the Prophet ﷺ hated when somebody would mimic or impersonate someone. You said that the Prophet ﷺ told Aisha, may Allah be pleased with her, that, and I quote your words, I don't like that I have so and so worldly wealth and I would impersonate a person. No, I would never do this, end quote. Where did you get this ahadith from Sheikh? I can't find it anywhere online. Personally, I'm really good at impersonating people and at mimicking accents, but if the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ hated this, I'll stop doing it, In Sha Allah. Okay. So, first of all, if I had the ability to quote the references and remember where they're at, I wouldn't be sitting here, I would be somewhere else in a higher level place. I don't remember these things. I can barely remember what I had for lunch yesterday. Of course, I was fasting. So, the hadith is authentic without any doubt, In Sha Allah, In Sha Allah, In Sha Allah. Any hadith you hear from me is 99.99% authentic. It's like the Arab elections because I entirely rely on authentic hadiths. All of my lectures and try my level best. I don't know the reference at the moment, but an easy search on Islamqa.info will get you the answer in a heartbeat. And you will find the hadith with the references, with the page number and the volume. So you have no problem in checking it out. If not, then please come back to me on my website and In Sha Allah, I will try my level best to quote it to you, though I don't usually even give references on my website. But I'm 100% certain that you will find it with the grace of Allah on Islamqa.info. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it In Sha Allah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
