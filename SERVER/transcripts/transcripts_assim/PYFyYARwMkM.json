  "transcript": "the next question is from a sister my brother borrowed money from me with my permission then used it to invest in Bitcoin without my knowledge I only found out after he already invested he returned most of my money back to my account but I only have a little bit less than a KD some fills is still invested in Bitcoin from the money he borrowed as far as my knowledge is concerned I believe Bitcoin is Haram in Islam but I was not the person who invested so what do I do from here onwards with the money that I have received the money that you have received is yours so you gave him uh 500 KDs he returned 4.99 and one KD or a few fills uh are missing no problem the money is yours the problem is that when he gives you profit or he says that I invested it for you and he gives you more than what you have given him this is Haram you had given in money to it to as a loan so yes if he returns the loan as it is no one says that this is wrong even if he invested it in selling wine the sin is on him the money the 500 KD you gave is halal he's not going to use the same money dinar by dinner it is the amount that he has taken on his name that you want from him so I want to see it Returns the 500 KD whether he dealt in riba he dealt in wine in drugs and it's none of your business it's your Halal money coming back to you what he does with it it is his problem and Allah Knows Best"
