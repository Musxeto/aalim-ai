  "title": "Quran says 'Kill the disbelievers wherever you find them' Chap 9 verse 5 Verse EXPLAINED",
  "transcript": "[Music] cd from germany there are enemies of islam with their accusation where they say that occurring according to quran we should all kill non-muslim and they use sort of toba verse 5 as their argument for their false accusation and maybe they are also however to use this as a justification for the evil deed so can could you please give to the ignorance and to those who wants to make power the future inshallah what does what this ayah means okay i from germany says that the verse in surah tawba chapter 9 where allah says to kill all the idol worshipers wherever you find them this verse is speaking about a specific situation where there was a treaty where there was a truce given by allah to the idol worshippers for four months and after that the truth is over so this is what the ayah was talking about because if you look at the other ayahs of the quran they cannot contradict and it states in the quran that allah does not order you to kill those who are peaceful with you who do not force you to leave your homes who do not have enmity against your religion you can be kind to them if you look at what the prophet islam used to do what the companions did with the jews with the christians with all other denominations they didn't kill them they didn't pursue them though they were living some of them among them and with them the jews were there the christians were there so you cannot come to one verse and leave the thousands and say that oh this overwhelms and controls the rest you have to understand the whole thing all together and allah knows best you"
