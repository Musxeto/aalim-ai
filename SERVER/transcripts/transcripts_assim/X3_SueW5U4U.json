  "transcript": "Dr Zakia as many of the shows we've started off with definition of the terms and this episode will be none different in the sense that I'd like you to first and foremost to define the term what exactly does is mean especially in the context of Ramadan alhamdulillah the Arabic word means to correct it means to improve it means to repair whenever one Muslim corrects another Muslim or he improves him it is called as Islam for example if a Muslim is making a mistake whether in offering Salah or in any of the acts of Islam or anything if someone corrects him it is called as ISL and it's mentioned in the Quran Sur H chapter number 11 verse number 88 my only desire is your improvement is your betterment to the best of my power and My Success will only come from Allah subhana tala and I trust in him and I look up to him I trust in Allah and I look up to Allah so here we realize that sham he wanted to is to his people it's further mentioned in the Quran in Sur chapter number 4 verse number 114 it says that in the secret talks there is no good except for a person who desires a good deed of Charity or Justice or reconcilement between two Muslims if such a deed he does then secrecy is permissible and if someone does such a deed seeking the pleasure of Allah subhana tala he'll get the reward which is very high otherwise normally secret talks most of the time it's not good except for Deeds of Charity of justice and reconcilement between two Muslims so here we realize that Allah subhana wa ta'ala he says that one Muslim should try and improve the other Muslim he should do is with him you should correct him and Allah says in the Quran in Surah Al Imran chapter number three verse number 110 oh Muslims ye are the best of people evolve for mankind Allah is giving us an honor and calling as Muslims as the best of people evolve for mankind and Allah continues he's calling us the best of people because we are supposed to enjoy what is good and forbid what is wrong and believe in Allah if you do not enjoy what is good and if you do not forbid what is wrong we ar fit to be called as we ar fit to be called as Muslims so it's the duty of every Muslim that he should do is and dawa and try and improve his fellow Muslim and there's a Hadith of a beloved Prophet wasallam it's mentioned in say Muslim number one in the book of Faith number 79 where the Beloved Prophet M wasallam said that if any of the Muslims see anything which is abominable anything which is wrong he should stop it with his hand if he does not have the St to do that he should stop it with his tongue if he does not have the St to do that then he should at least abhor it in his heart should at least curse in his heart and then he will have the least degree of faith that means if you abor it in your heart if you curse in your heart you are the lowest level of moment that's the reason Islam is a very important part of the muslim's life"
