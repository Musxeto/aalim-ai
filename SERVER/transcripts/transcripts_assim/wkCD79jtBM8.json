  "title": "Ruling on buying Collector's or Limited Edition items for purpose of reselling to gain profit Assim",
  "transcript": "india yeah i think it was asking about collector's items or something that has a limited edition and he says i would like to buy it and after a few years sell it for a profit is that permissible if the product itself is halal and there is no extravagance there's nothing wrong in that so if you buy a ferrari or for example and you store it for 20 or 30 years hoping that you would make a profit out of it this is halal if you have the money uh to spare but if there is extravagance if it is a a special ring or a historical uh a pen or something of the the nature now this would be extravagance it would be insane to buy such a portrait for a hundred million dollars or to buy such a chair of a famous artist or a jacket or a glove of a famous pop artist all of this is extravagance and totally prohibited latifah"
