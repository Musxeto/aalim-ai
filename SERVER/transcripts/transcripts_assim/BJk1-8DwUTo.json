  "transcript": "and this is as i said a book that also talks about the unseen heaven and hell the day of judgment what will happen talks about prophecies that had come and prophecies that will come and we believe in that and the astonishing thing is you cannot find any contradictions in it it's a perfect book simply because it is the word of allah and one of its miracles is that allah has challenged the humans and the jinn as well to collaborate together and produce 10 surahs like it 10 chapters like it if it's possible allah says or they or do they say he invited he invented it the disbelievers say that the prophet sallam invented the quran say then bring 10 surahs like it that have been invented and call upon for assistance whomever you can beside allah if you should be truthful so if this man the one who does not know how to read and write invented this book call and collaborate with whomever you wish and produce out of the 114 chapters produce only 10. if you're truthful then the challenge goes up and the stakes are higher allah says or do they say about the prophet he invented it say then bring forth a surah one chapter like it and call upon for assistance whomever you can beside allah if you should be truthful till date 15 centuries later the challenge is still on and no one has succeeded they all have failed miserably why because this is the word of allah no one can duplicate or replicate something like it so you as an individual know as basics this is the ultimate revelation this is the final revelation allah stated that prophet muhammad ali is the last messenger ever to be sent to humankind and to the jinn and the quran is the last revelation that's it full stop till date this stands till date it is challenging it is a miracle that stands"
