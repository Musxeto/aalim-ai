  "transcript": "foreign was the kindest person ever to have lived and he was the best of people in moral conduct and ethics and way of dealing with people he was soft and kind tolerant easy going he lived with people and they loved how he lived with them he was kind and soft and compassionate towards his wives the children his companions with everyone everyone who knew him loved him at first sight described him and praised him by saying so by the mercy from Allah o Muhammad you were lenient with them and if you had been rude in speech and harsh in heart they would have disabandoned from about you so the prophet Allah was easy going was kind was tolerant not rude not aggressive not intimidating and this is something that is rare to find nowadays it's a quality that can only be found in leaders whom you respect yet you feel their love and care not to be intimidated or frightened from them this is how the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam was when it came to his wives and we know that wives differ some can be kind some can be arrogant some can be nagging some can be rude women differ like men however the prophet saw some with all of them was loving and caring and kind he used to check on them each one every single day nine women he used to check on them in the morning and then after assar nowadays we hear complaints from so-called men who are married to more than one and their wives complained that he may abandon her for a month or two without even calling or texting or checking or not even paying them their allowance and providing for them the essentials such as food and shelter these are not real men they're alone to be Muslims because this is not how the prophet dealt with his wives he when he married Isha she was a young girl and she loved him more than anything on Earth and he sallallahu alaihi wasallam would appreciate and put into consideration her young age so he used to send her other young girls to play with her friends so that she wouldn't be feeling lonely he also used to do whatever she desired as long as it was halal he would go with it once the abyssinians were playing with their swords and Spears in the Masjid a form of training a form of let's say dancing but it's training actually and the prophet salallahu was watching them Aisha came from behind from inside her house and the prophet said would you like to watch and she said yes he wouldn't say no go hide don't look don't watch don't do this don't do that like so many of us may do prohibiting what is permissible just to be safe no no to be safe don't do this without any knowledge the prophet saws said to her come she placed her chin on his shoulder and kept on watching and after a while the prophet said had you have enough had you had enough and she said no no no I'd like to watch more and the prophet would leave her Allah whenever she drank from a glass let's say milk the prophet would take the glass and search for where she had placed her lips on to drink from and drink from the same spot just to show her how much love he has for her and of course a woman would be delighted to see her husband not being repulsed or discussed to use the same utensils she had used like we always make a joke when I say to my wife bring me a spoon please so I can eat with she says take my spoon I said okay wash it seven times with water and once with soil and then I get smack on the face this is a joke but unfortunately there are men who may act like this no no I wouldn't eat with the same spoon the prophet saws did that he even went further to see when she had a bite from a bone that had meat on it he would take it and look where she snatched the meat from and do the same from the same spot and this makes the love grow between the spouses when he used to call his wife he used to use what's known in Arabic as atarim and is deleting a letter or two to give a nickname so instead of Isha he would say ish and that is a beautiful way of calling her and he would also show his kindness even when she is the wrong Doer it was reported in an authentic Hadith by management Allah be pleased with him and with his father that once the prophet saws was with Aisha in their home and they were in a heated argument like any couple when Abu Bakr isha's father sought permission to enter so he was given the permission and he entered his daughter's home and he found shouting at the prophet Allah in a sense raising her voice when talking to him and he charged on her wanting to beat her and scold her saying to her do you raise your voice foreign and when the prophet saw this of course if he is the husband and his wife was treating him like this and it's her father who wants to reprimand her and scold her or beat her up I didn't do anything I didn't ask for it I don't mind be my guest no the prophet saws immediately intervened and student Abu bakr's face and he prevented him of course from doing anything because he was in his face in his way so Abu Bakr left the house angrily with his daughter so the prophet salallahu went to terrify the Aisha and said to her don't you see I prevented him from beating you up don't you see I saved you from the man you should be appreciative look how kind I am to you so he's showing her what he did to her and few minutes later she started laughing with him and the prophet was laughing with her back and they were happy again Abu Bakr came to the house again wanted to see what things are happening there and when he entered and found them laughing and giggling he said o prophet of Allah as you have engaged me in your War moments ago engaged me in your peace and tell me what you're laughing about no harms done and the case was resolved this is how kind the prophet was Allah he was extremely kind with children whether his own or others the prophet Allah used to show his kindness even Abbas his cousin may Allah be pleased with him he used to say that the prophet salallahu once saw me he wiped over my head and made Dua that Allah grants me wisdom Anderson Malik his servant was a boy a young boy serving the Prophet assalam The Prophet was was always address him by saying yeah my son and this shows that the prophet was showing him kindness and empathy and being kind to him not only that even toddlers four years five years of age the prophet would nickname them may Allah be pleased with him had a brother and this brother had a small bird in a cage and when the bird died the boy wept and was saddened by it and every time the prophet came into their house he would nickname him a child and he said the father of and the boy did not have a wife let alone a child but this is one of the etiquettes in Islam to nickname children and also there was this young girl that the prophet used to call um Khalid he used to joke sometimes but he never said Any Lies he jokes but never says Any Lies Anna says once the prophet Allah called me o you with the two ears and of course everyone has two ears but sometimes people would feel insulted but what do you mean by two ears you have two ears I didn't say that they're long or big or small or ugly two ears so the prophet used to do this but he would not lie he would also not reprimand his servants or the children says one day the prophet salallahu sent me on an errand and I embedded in myself not to go I wanted to play I wanted to have some time off so I saw a a group of children playing so I stood there watching them and maybe wanting to play with them when all of a sudden I had someone holding me from my neck from behind me and I looked and it was the prophet saws laughing and they said unes his name is anas ornes is the smaller version of the name did you go where I ordered you to do or to go so I said yes sir prophet of Allah I'm going now and the prophet Islam let him go laughing no reprimanding no scalding Anna says I served the prophet since I was a young boy for nine years and never ever he said to something I had done why did you do this or for something I did not do would wouldn't you have done so and so he served the prophet Allah for nothing this was the idea of his smart wise mother um who brought him to the prophet Islam when he migrated to Medina and she said o prophet of Allah this young child is anas he's a smart young boy let him serve you and the prophet saws made Dua for him and indeed that was one of the best steps a mother could ever take for her son who accompanied the prophet is who memorized his Hadith who was with the prophet salallahu wherever he went who got Dua tremendous blessing and favors from Allah when the prophet says o Allah prolong his life and give him many children and bless his wealth and I said after the prophet made these duas for me due to the request of my mom I am the longest of all the companions I don't know companions left he lived over a hundred and my offspring exceeded my children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren exceeded a hundred and I've buried many of them and as for my wealth all farms in Medina produce once a year mine only produced twice a year so what a beautiful reward for serving the best man ever to walk the earth nowadays liberals and enemies of Islam said look they this is child abuse How would how dare she give her own child to the prophet to serve him a foreigner a stranger blah blah blah look at the fruits he managed to gain from serving the prophet Allah the prophet was kind to his own grandchildren he loved them more than in his own children Al Hussain IBN Ali his grandson he was a young toddler playing in the roads of Medina with other boys when the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam saw him when al-hussein saw the prophet Isa Salaam he ran to him in a playful manner and the prophet extended his hands so Al Hussain would go right in the prophet would do this go left would do this until he embraced him and he took him and kissed him and he said al-hussein is from me and I am from him may Allah love whoever loves Al Hussain and by Allah we love Allah Hussain because the prophet loved him because he is a great companion because he is the son of Ali one of the ten heaven-bound and the son of Fatima the daughter of the Prophet that Islam and he's one of the Masters of the Youth of Jannah the prophet Allah was so kind that even in false prayers imagine when the prophet is leading the congregation and he's prostrating one of them two grandsons of his would Mount him as a right the companion said the prophet once prayed and he prostrated and he prolonged the prostration we thought that he might have died so one of us raised his head and found that his grandson is mounting him so he went back to prostration and when the prophet concluded the prayer they said oh prophet of Allah you've done something you've never done before you prolonged the sujood we thought that either you had died or Allah is revealing Quran to you he said neither of this happened but my son referring to his grandson mounted me as a right and I hated to haste him so I just left him until he got bored and left compare this kindness with the grandchildren with what many of us do nowadays leaving their children to daycare just because they the the mother wants to work for extra cash they don't need it but she's bored she wants to work leaving the children to Foreigner Maids foreign Maids who come from overseas with their customs and habits and with even their different religions at times and we don't know what they do with them and we snatch the children from their moms laps and throw them to these Maids or to the daycare centers how such children would grow up this act of kindness during prayer illustrates the Iman I saw a clip the other day of an Algerian Imam leading charaweeh and there was a camera in front of him and while he was reciting a cat climbed all over him to sit on his shoulder licking his face and his subhanallah recitation was not interrupted he just patted the cat while continuing to recite the Quran instead of tossing it against the wall or stepping on it or doing something or being frightened subhanallah kindness even with the animals this is what we lack in our religion the prophet salallahu was playful and joyful with children one of the companions one of the youngest companions ever to be classified as a companion he said I still memorize I still remember an incident where the Prophet was making wudu and I came as a five-year-old and I stood next to him and the prophet threw some water from his mouth while making wudu in my face like we do with children when they are standing next to us and we throw water in their faces and they laugh and enjoy this so Mahmoud who's a stranger but recalls how the prophet was kind to him the prophet was kind even to his companions even when they were angry once he went to his daughter's house Fatima and he asked where is Ali and she confessed we had a fight or a heated argument yes we're companions we're Heaven bound but we're humans we tend to have different opinions over things so we argued and he did not like what he heard so he left the house and did not come for the afternoon nap so the prophet sent someone to look for him and he they found him lying in the Masjid on the soil so the prophet went to him and made him get up dusting the dust from his shoulder saying rise up the father of dust up Ali says by Allah this nickname is better for me and more beloved to me than Abel Hassan his eldest is a Hassan and usually we nickname a person by the eldest of his sons so he says the father of soil or dust wallahi is better and more beloved to me than Abel Hasan because it was said by the prophet Allah and it shows us that the father-in-law tries to reconcile is wise he's trying to patch things up instead of saying to his daughter he was having a fight with you leave the house and come to my house I'll teach him a lesson like so many arrogant ignorant imbeciles do with their daughters instead of telling their daughters be patient be tolerant even if they even if her husband curses me or swears at me or says bad things about me ignore it as if nothing had happened your husband comes first this is not found anymore unfortunately because parents don't have the wisdom don't have the knowledge in Islam how to teach their daughters that her husband is her priority even if he was wrong doing we can solve things Nobody's Perfect similarly the prophet said To His companion are they familiar man when he sent him to bring him the uh um knowledge of the army forces besieging Medina in the battle of the trench so it was freezing cold but the prophet made Dua for him and he felt like he was in a sauna all the way there and all the way back and he told the prophet about the information he needed Isa salaam then the cold came back to him so the prophet gave him his a cloak to warm up with and he because he was tired went to sleep in the morning the prophet woke him up and said om yeah no man again no man the Sleepy one so the prophet is not saying calling him by name is nicknaming him to show his kindness and there are so many many stories all prove to us that this man is unique now we all can be this kind but we all cannot be as Brave as him as knowledgeable as him as a man of authority as him a man of power as him the greatest of all Messengers as him all of these cannot be collected and combined in one man except the perfect man and that is the role model Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam"
