  "title": "Can a woman ride Scooty / Two Wheeler / Bike? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "seikar says for attending daily classes in college or everyday shorts is it allowed for a Muslim hijab' girl to ride a scooty this is not permissible in my opinion because when you ride a motorcycle or a scooty or a bike your figure as a woman is clear so you can see a woman's back a woman's waist a woman's buttocks and a woman thighs clearly even if she's wearing abaya not only that it is extremely dangerous if she were to fall or to have an accident and this is something that a woman must not put herself into such situations and hence my own opinion is that this is not permissible and a large L knows best"
