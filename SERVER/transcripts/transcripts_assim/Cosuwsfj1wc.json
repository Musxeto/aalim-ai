  "title": "Repented from my past sins but friends make fun & expose my sins, what should I do? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is how should one react in deal if a person remembered from his sins and sorry to become a pakistan muslim but his cousins or his friends exposes his sins so this is a frequently asked question i was a normal person i had my sins i even boasted about about them everyone knows about them and all of a sudden allah guides me to become a practicing muslim and a year or two later i am an imam i am looking like a practicing muslim but everyone around me knows my past so whenever they see me they make jokes they may humor with me thinking that this is funny so they say oh mawlana do you remember when you did this and that oh your eminence do you remember when that thing happened and you did this and you did that and this offends me hugely well this comes with the territory being abused or being reminded of your past sins is something that you cannot overcome easily you shouldn't be so sensitive about it because what you had done in the past must have consequences so alhamdulillah that the consequences are only limited to this and that is being reminded if you simply smile not defending yourself moving on as if you did not hear anything it will fade away and little by little they will accept you for who you are they will acknowledge that you have changed and you are a different person and they will never look back at the past and whenever you hear such a negative comment or reminder move on if someone says you're a donkey will you grow two ears and a tail no so don't pay attention to their abuse and insha allah you'll be rewarded for that"
