  "transcript": "Arayes Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh This is Arayes from Canada Okay, yes Arayes There is an Islamic school near us which teaches worldly education and Islamic education which is very good but the problem is I want to go to that school and because I am studying in a school which is hard for me to pray my Jummah prayer, Namaz and everything like this and I want to study Islam there is a long waiting list in that Islamic school so I'm just asking can I ask my mom to bribe or donate so that they can put me early is this permissible? because I saw a Hadith which goes against this, JazakAllah Yani, do you want her to bribe the administration? Yes No, this is totally prohibited Arayes, come on, give me a break how can you attain something that pleases Allah through bribes there is no way that this is permissible there are hundreds of families waiting similarly to you to get a slot in that school so you want to bypass all of them by committing a major sin no, this is totally haram and not permissible Al Fatiha"
