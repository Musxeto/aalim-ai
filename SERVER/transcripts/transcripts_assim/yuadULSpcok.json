  "transcript": "[Music] can dear brothers and sisters in Islam and we're still in this blessed month of Ramadan trying to find a fix to our corrupt Hearts the Hadith we have at hand today was narrated by Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallallah alai wasallam said call upon Allah in supplication while being certain being answered and know that Allah does not answer the supplication of a heart that is distracted and heedless that is oblivious and neglectful Allah doesn't respond from a heart with such a condition ask Allah while being certain of being answered IM man may Allah have mercy on his him said be in a state where you deserve to be answered and that is when you're sincere and that is when your hearts are attain full and when you're acting and Performing forms of worship while having a strong force of Hope in what Allah hasel IM muak fi may Allah have mercy on his soul says the prophet's statement supplicate make Dua to Allah while being certain of being answered this means that you have to be in a state a state of certainity that you deserve to be answered such as doing good deeds staying away from Haram and fulfilling the conditions of Dua because Dua and supplication has conditions such as your heart is present you're not oblivious you're not somewhere else and you are anticipating the Blessed times where Allah answers your Dua as well as the Blessed places the Masjid meca Medina as well as being in a posture that is beloved to Allah as in the state of sujud and prostration because then Allah would certainly respond to your Dua I may Allah have mercy on his soul says Dua is a means of answering so when you make Dua this is one of the means to be answered when you're hungry you eat food this is one of the means of being full so Dua would be answered if you fulfill the conditions and avoid the obstacles because if you don't fulfill the conditions and you don't avoid the obstacles being answered might not happen and among the main conditions in answering your Dua is your heart being present in conscience and you're hopeful that Allah will accept your Dua Imam nawi may Allah have mercy on his soul says the purpose of Dua is to have your heart present and part of having your heart present is that you conscience of what you're doing so many people we see them not only make an innovation after Salat rather it is worthless a great deal of people after they raise their hands and they start whispering duas what are you doing I'm saying the I'm saying du I'm saying this and so many things okay were these said by the prophet Alam no so why are you doing it isn't this an innovation oh no it's something that is good and after they do this some of them even go to the extent of washing off their bodies and wiping their bodies what are you doing he said well I made made Dua and I guess I have some form of blessing in my hand so might as well wipe my body with it was this done by the prophet Alam no so what are you doing something that was not done by the prophet not but done by the companions may Allah be pleased with them definitely it's an innovation the sad thing is the vast majority of those making Dua they don't won't focus on what they're saying so some of them raise their hands make Dua and they look at the chandeliers they look at the watch on the on the wall they look at others and they give gestures while just saying duas and they finish and they wipe their face and their bodies with it all of this is an innovation your heart is not there AB Abbas Al he may Allah have mercy on his soul commence when the prophet said in another Hadith Allah says I at where my servant thinks of me and I'm with him when he supplicates to me I at where my servants thinks of me meaning that Allah when you think positively of him he's where you think of him and if you think negatively of him then that is what you will get so Al says the Hadith supplicate to Allah while being certain that he will respond to you means that when you make Dua be certain that Allah will answer you when you repent be certain that Allah will accept your repentance when you seek Allah's forgiveness be certain that Allah will forgive you and when you do good deeds be certain that Allah will accept these Good Deeds but if you do all of these things while thinking that Allah is not going to accept them then this is not going to benefit you because that is being despair of Allah's Mercy and it is one of the greatest sins to despair of Allah's mercy so many people think negatively of Allah thinking that no no he will never forgive me it's beyond forgiveness what I have done is so huge is so heinous Allah can't forgive me this is one of the major sins to despair in Allah's Mercy also it it is irrational and illogical and a major sin to think that Allah will forgive you and to bestow his mercy upon you while insisting on doing sins so many people acknowledge they're doing sins but they're refusing to quit the sin sister why aren't you wearing the hijab yeah I know it's wrong but I'm always seeking Allah's forgiveness and mercy and he will forgive me I know that Allah will forgive me because IM man is in my heart why are you doing intoxicant or doing drugs Allah is most forgiving is not like you if I ask him for forgiveness he would forgive me this is utter ignorance and being fooled by Allah's kindness and that would drag people to the Creed of who say that it doesn't matter what we do what counts is what in the hearts and this is not true if you think well of Allah Asel you have to do what Allah has told you to do and act upon that Allah does not respond to a supplication when the heart is heedless oblivious neglectful or distracted which means that you have to have your heart focused because Dua is the strongest means in repelling what we hate and attaining what we want but Dua may not take place may not be answered either because the Dua itself is weak or because the heart itself is uncertain oblivious neglectful distracted the heart is not forthcoming towards Allah or there might be a another reason such as consuming Haram and the run or the layer that is caused by the sins on the hearts or being overwhelmed by neglect and Ignorance by lust and Desire by being distracted all of these come to the heart and block means of answering our Dua and this is why we have to focus 110% on the health and well-being of our hearts don't be fooled by the outer shell by the physique by the muscles rather focus on what counts on what Allah looks at on what Allah loves and that is your hearts the Purity the presence the submissiveness being filled with what Allah loves such as hope fear love trust Reliance seeking Refuge asking Allah for what you need this is what Allah loves and this is what will protect us with the grace of Allah in this life and the Hereafter we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
