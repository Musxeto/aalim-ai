  "title": "Ruling on taking vaccines, medicines or using gelatine that contain pork - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says that sometimes we are obliged we are ordered it's mandatory to take vaccines that contain pork what to do first of all this is something that most likely is based on hearsay so people come and say don't use toothpaste don't drink colas fizzy drinks because it contains pork don't use soap because it contains pork don't buy clothes because it may contain all of these are speculations the default is that everything is halal that everything is pure until proven otherwise and this is a rule in life this is what our mean stated in his answers throughout his life when it comes to vaccines when it comes to medication there is the gelatin that or gristillen or something like that that might be used and they say that it can contain it may contain pork ingredients in it now if it is truly containing such haram additives or material and there is no other alternative in this case it is permissible for a muslim to use due to necessity because there is no other alternative if there is a medication for diabetes or insulin that has this component in it and there is no other cure other than than that manufacturer it becomes permissible if it is gelatin that we're talking about it's an issue of dispute whether it's permissible to use or not because of the rigorous process it undergoes to change and to be usable in such vaccines and such medications and there are a group of scholars who say that it go it undergoes a rigorous process where its chemical and physical characteristics change to another material so it's not related to pork anymore so it's like when eric putting uh an impurity to a tree of apples you you pour urine human urine into it so the apple comes after two three months it's pure it's halal because the urine has been transferred transformed into something else which is halal therefore i see no problem inshallah in accepting it if you don't have any other choice and if there is no other alternative to that particular vaccine allah knows best you"
