  "title": "Lying for a friend, Lies, White Lie VS. Dodging the question…",
  "transcript": "Abdul Mujeeb from Nigeria. His friend got sick \nand he asked him not to tell his mom. And his mom   called, asking why is my son not picking \nup the phone? So he said that he's   okay but he ate something and he doesn't feel \nwell. And I did not say the truth that he was   sick or was hospitalized. Have I done a white \nlie? There is no white or black lie ? A lie   is a lie. But if you dodge the question \nby giving ambiguous answers that can have   both ways, there's no problem with that. So if you \nsaid 'Alhamdulillah he's fine', in the sense that   mentally he's fine, physically he's not. When \nyou say that, he wasn't feeling well, and you   meant that he was sick but you \ngave the impression that he wasn't   that sick, then this is permissible, in \nshaa Allah, and you're not sinful for that."
