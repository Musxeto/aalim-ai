  "transcript": "Hamza. Hamza from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. My question is, if the zone has to say exactly what they want and are, so as an example, if they want a car, a house, etc., but they ask Allah, just give me blessings in this life, would that be sufficient or do you have to say exactly what you want and are? Jazak Allah Khair. Wa Jazak. First of all, we have only one Lord in this universe and that is Allah Azza Wa Jal. If we don't ask for our needs specifically from Him, who will we ask it from? So there's no problem in saying, oh Allah I need this an increment, I need a raise, I need this, I need that. There's no problem in that. But the problem is in going into details. Oh Allah I need a car with a sunroof and a panoramic this and that and it has to have a supercharged engine, an all-wheel drive, preferably a quattro. What are you doing? This is too specific. This is transgression in du'a. Make a general du'a of a specific thing and that will do the job inshaAllah Allah and Allah knows best."
