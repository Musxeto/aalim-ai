  "transcript": "may Allah bless you and your family sh and yours as well my question today sh is about um the the public hair I mean like I'm talking about the limits because I'm I'm a little bit confused when I read a little bit on Islam as well like what is w to cut what is mustahab to cut like some people will say from form to back some will say around the testicles and so on like what is exactly like the limits from the westline to down there how is it how do we set it like the pubic hair is the hair that grows on and around the private part so from the naval down is not part of it but it's recommended to clean and remove and what's on a person's anus is not part of it but it is also recommended to remove and the testicles some Scholars say that it is included and it's best to do one's level best to the best of his ability but again it's not mandatory it's what grows on the private part itself and the area around it and Allah Asel Knows Best"
