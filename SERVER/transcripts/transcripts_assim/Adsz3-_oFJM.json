  "transcript": "let me understand your question you're asking me why do muslims when they mention the name of the prophet sallallahu alaihi don't say may allah have mercy on him or may allah be pleased with him like when they mention the name of a deceased or of a companion correct exactly exactly okay okay first of all the prophet was is in a higher level than anyone else on earth so deceased muslims my father my uncle my neighbor they died they're normal human beings what do i say to them may allah have mercy upon them and i ask allah to forgive them may allah forgive their sins may allah have mercy upon them companions they are mentioned in the quran and allah says allah is pleased with them and they're pleased with allah so when i ever mention abu bakr's name i say allah may allah be pleased with him as mentioned in the quran can i say may allah have mercy upon him yeah i can but this is given that allah would have mercy upon him we want allah to be pleased with him which is a higher level when it comes to the prophet alaihis salat was so when we say may allah have mercy upon him it doesn't make any sense because he's the most beloved human being to the to allah azzawajal may allah be pleased with him we know that allah is pleased with him that because allah selected him to be the messenger of allah and the prophet of allah so in the quran allah says allah and the angels they praise the prophet o you who believe praise him and offer salutation and peace upon him so prayer which is a salat from the individuals is dua from allah is to praise his mentioning and to raise his mentioning and elevate his status in allah's court so this is what we say because we are ordered in the quran and the prophet hasan ordered us to say this so i hope this answers your question"
