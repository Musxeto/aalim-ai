  "title": "I did not know you have to perform Ghusl for major impurity, are my past prayers valid",
  "transcript": "Talha from Bahrain Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi So my question was I was like 12 to 15 years old when I was impure I didn't know I have to do ghusl to perform wudu. I thought washing the private part was the only part. So I performed namaz till I think 15 years. I am 15 now so I now know that if you are impure you have to do ghusl now I do ghusl. So is my prayer valid for the last prayers which I prayed in impurity? Yes it is valid because it is valid because you were ignorant of the ruling. Ask Allah for forgiveness and move on Inshallah."
