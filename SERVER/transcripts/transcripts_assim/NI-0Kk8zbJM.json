  "transcript": "therefore remember me I'll remember you and be grateful to me and never be ungrateful to me how do we remember Allah the best type of remembrance of Allah is when your heart coincides with your tongue so what you say whatever pleases Allah is considered to be thicker subhanallah alhamdulillah and reciting the Quran reading a Hadith reminding someone of an incident in the Seer all of this is considered to be generally vicar so the best of it is when the heart coincides with the tongue and if you do this you're at the highest level now there are other types of vicar which is more specific and that is when you hear something about Islam and you implement it so now you're doing thicker with your limbs rather than just your tongue and heart you're acting upon it so this is a very huge and wide topic that covers all of our Lives as we will see insha Allah and Allah tells us in the Quran oh you who believe remember Allah with much remembrance foreign which indicates that remembering Allah is not limited to a specific time of the day or the night rather it's a continuous process and to those who are close to Allah it becomes like breathing and by the way this is how the people in Paradise may Allah make me a new among them will remember Allah azzawajal there are no forms of rebada of worship in Jannah in Paradise there's no prayers there's no fasting there's no Hajj there's no zakat the only form of worship is remembering Allah and they will be given such remembrance by simply something within their lives as if they are breathing not that it is something that they're intending to do it it becomes like breathing so Allah is telling us to remember him much remembrance and this is an instruction we need to know are we complying are we fulfilling Allah's order and command to us to us so there is this instruction and there are many verses of the Quran by the way that talk about this about the importance of remembering Allah about continuing to remember Allah azzawajal and we will come to know that in the following hadiths inshallah in the following episodes when we come to see how the greatness and the power of remembering Allah should impact our lives and how far we are from that role we are expected to be fulfilling so the prophet said should I not inform you of the best of Deeds now everybody's anticipating and the most sanctifying of Deeds before your lord wow which does more to raise your positions with Allah and are better for you than the distribution of gold and money in the cause of Allah azzawajal or battle with the Enemy now the companions are trying to figure out whoa what kind of Deeds would be better than all of this so they said indeed inform us so the prophet said remembrance of Allah this indicates that all what was mentioned above remembrance of Allah is more beloved to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala than it though it seems to us that it is very little compared to spending spending of gold and silver and meeting the enemies and fighting them and what may result out of that whether we are martyred or we kill them they are the enemies they're attacking us we have to defend ourselves yet what's far greater than all of this at the side of Allah though the work and effort exerted is far less as it seems to us is remembrance of Allah azzawajal this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave"
