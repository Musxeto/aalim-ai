  "transcript": "salamualikum' welcome to labor care to welcome back we have with us share our symbol of man Hakeem we just saw the reports awesome by dr ehab Samaha regarding the complications of reproduction and how to deal with them if you could elaborate for the islamic issue on reproduction or having children and how this relates to islam children eloheem hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu shalom Walker Abdi or Julian I mean nabina muhammad in water ali he was hopping at jamayne first of all we have to understand that whatever state a person's in it's because allah azza wajal judgment for him was for the best yet this does not mean that we should not strive and do our best to change it within the boundaries of Islamic laws a lot almighty tells us in the Quran to Allah belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth he creates what He wills subhana WA Ta'ala he bestows female offspring upon whom He wills and bestows male offsprings upon whom He wills or he bestows both males and females and he renders barren whom He wills verily he is the all-knower and is able to do all things so it is up to allah azza wajal whether to grant and bestow children to people or not having said that islam encourages reproduction islam encourages life and we are instructed in islam to marry a woman who is fertile and who is able to reproduce because this is the essence marriage as the Prophet said RA salat WA Salam marry the one who is loving and fertile for I will feel proud of your large numbers before the other prophets on the day of judgment so this is part of Islam that we marry someone who's fertile and is capable of reproduction and one would ask how would we know that if she is fertile or not well this can happen by two means the first one is that we know that she comes from a family that has no problem in in this field so her mother her sisters all have children and they have no problem in reproduction the second way or the second means is that this woman was widowed or divorced and she already had children so then now we know that she is capable of reproducing we were just discussing the issue of reproduction and the benefit of marrying a woman who can have children and can bear children and the dr. Radcliffe II was talking about the issue of some people have trouble with this in two different categories could you please expand upon what those categories are well the scholars have gathered in the Islamic Council of Filth which is part of the Muslim League and organisation and they came up with a number of categories and this over these categories they've reached after consulting physicians and doctors and they deliberated a lot on these issues and they came with a number of types so they say that the first one is when the fertilization is taking place between a sperm and an egg from a woman that is not the wife so they take the sperm over the husband and an egg from another woman a donating woman then they take the embryo and they plant it in the womb of the wife okay this is the first way of doing it the second way of doing it that the sperm of a man who is not the husband is taken to to the egg of a wife and then they would take the embryo and plant it and the womb of the wife and similarly this is done widely in the West where they have what's known as sperm banks yes so if the man is unable to produce his own sperms they just go and take it from anyone anytime they can hear anyone yeah and then they would would do this the third procedure is that they would have the sperm of the husband the egg of the wife and cultivate it and then take it to a shed a good mother and plant it in the womb of a woman so now the child of two individuals is being born in another individual yes the fourth and this leads us to hiring the wombs and having women surrogates mother's doing this for money and this is a big trade in the West and we've heard and read a lot of the stories where the woman at the end of the day changes her mind and says no I'm going to keep the baby I concede it for nine months now I don't want to give it away and the parents are saying that this is ours it's our DNA features in it it's the man's sperm and the woman's are the wives eggs the fifth one or the fourth one is when this is done in the wife's womb but with the sperm and the egg of two different people were not related to the spouse the fifth type is when the two husbands that will the two spouse and the man's sperm and his wife's egg are cultivated but then planted in his second wife's womb okay so it is the thought that the husband's sperms it but it is not the wife's egg it's the second was the co-wives egg it's the second wise acre the second wife's womb there he has two wives okay one of them does not conceive so he takes the egg from his first wife and then he puts the embryo in the second wife's so that she would conceive and bear children and the sixth and the seventh are permissible but all what was mentioned above was not or is not permissible because the origin of the sperm and the egg must come from the man and the wife and the person conceiving this embryo is there should be the wife herself not the co wife not a surrogate mother not anyone else now they have a sixth and seventh seventh procedure that they say this is permissible and that is that the sperm is taking from the husband the egg is taken from the wife and it's being cultivated externally and then the embryo is planted in the wives boom so basically it's taken care of in an outside environment and then planted in the same wife's womb that's true because it could not have grown there okay the seventh one is that they take the sperm of the husband and it is carefully injected into the wife and by this because this is done when the husband is unable to have normal intercourse or is unable to deliver his sperms to the right location and this is also permissible and this is probably the closest to the natural way yes berrak la vie comme"
