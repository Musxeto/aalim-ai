  "transcript": "kareem from holland um my question is uh about praying in congregation when i'm working i am the mosque is pretty far but sometimes i think uh i have to go or if i don't have to go should i search for muslims in the building to pray with so um my question is actually when do i have to pray in congregation and if i have to go to a mosque how far does that have to be okay i will answer inshallah kareem from holland he says i work and the message is far away can i pray at work so kareem if your work allows you to go to the masjid and gives you time you should go and pray in the message if the message is within the vicinity about 10 minutes or 14 15 minutes walk but if they don't allow you and they don't give you time off then you have to pray at work on time and if there are muslims try to invite them to pray with your congregation if you fail or they don't want to pray with you and congregation pray on your own and inshallah it will be accepted"
