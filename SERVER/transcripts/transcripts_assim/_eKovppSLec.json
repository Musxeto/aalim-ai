  "title": "Can a woman pray in large or baggy pants, is the prayer valid? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abdul Malik from France Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam to Allah Is it permissible for a woman to pray with large pants? For example, large sweet pants? To pray in what? With large pants. With large pants. Well, the prayer is valid, but she is sinful for not following the hadith of the Prophet ï·º of having an outer garment. Her awrah is covered. But this is not the appropriate attire for Salat. And hence the scholars say, yes, the prayer is valid, but she is sinful for not wearing the outer garment, and Allah knows best."
