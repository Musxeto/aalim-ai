  "transcript": "The next question is, is practicing or learning yoga forbidden in Islam? Yes it is, because yoga is based on Buddhist Hindu traditions. So, and they're facing the sun in some postures and they have these, worshipping other than Allah Azza Wa Jal in this kind of sport, though the stretching is good. So, if you can have a routine of stretches that has nothing to do with yoga, or the name, or the practice, there's no problem in stretching, it's good for your muscles. But when you say, well I'm going to my yoga class, this is my yoga mat, this is my yoga pants, and you have the same postures and facing the sun at certain names and pauses and the likes, this is totally haram."
