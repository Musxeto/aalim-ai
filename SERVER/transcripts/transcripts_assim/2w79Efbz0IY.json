  "transcript": "[Music] ald we begin with the grace of Allah who has blessed us to gather in this blessed place we begin today inshallah with reading the hadiths of the book and the first chapter deals with Purity Purity and the first Hadith we have today is is usually the first Hadith in all books of f because it is the main pillar of our religion and who will read this for us inshallah Omar Al the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said the Deeds are judged by intentions and every person will get the reward according to what he intends so whoever migrated for Allah and his messenger then his migration will be for Allah and his messenger and whoever migrated for worldly benefits or for marrying a woman then his migration will be for what he migrated for this Hadith is one of the greatest hadiths in Islam to the extent that Scholars looked into the hadiths all together and said Islam revolves around three hadiths and some said Islam revolves around four hadiths so those who said that Islam revolves around three hadiths the first Hadith is Hadith Omar may Allah be pleased with him that Deeds are judged by intentions as in the translation here the Deeds are judged by intentions the second Hadith is may Allah be pleased with her in Muslim and elsewhere where she said the prophet saidat wasam whoever innovate something in our religion that is not part of it it is rejected and the third Hadith is may Allah be pleased with them where the Prophet said is clear and Al is clear and between them there are dubious matters and if you look at this Hadith I'm not going to go into the other hadiths because this is not our topic why is this Hadith important well we're talking about Juris prudent we're talking about we're talking about W we're talking about Salah and all of these forms of worship depend entirely on intention so if the intention is good you're okay if your intention is bad you're not okay but what is intention this is a very important question intention has two meanings or it's divided into two sectors of Islam the first is who you intend with the work you're doing so if I am jogging 8 kilm every day what is my intention to become a footballer to become an athlete this is my intention so it is for worldly game this person's praying what is your intention why are you praying you usually don't pray well this is true but my boss is next to me and I'm thinking of a raise so I have to show him that I'm praying well so his intention is for that boss so this is the greatest intention on Earth if is the one you intend Allah with and that is why Deeds are worthless without intention the Hadith is clear the Deeds are judged by intentions so if you do something in accordance to the Sunnah 100% you pray in the first throw of the Masjid five times a day like the Hypocrites used to do you believe that the prophet is the messenger like the Hypocrites used to say but Allah falsified what they said in the Quran by saying and Allah testifies that they're Liars why the acts are like ours they act like us they behave like us they even look like us but their intentions are not for the sake of Allah the second Department the second part is the one that differentiates between forms of worship and how is that I go to the bathroom I take off my clothes of course the door is closed you can't see and I take a shower full shower what is that shower if I intended that this shower is for removing the sexual impurity which I had then now after the shower I can pray correct but if my intention was simply to get clean I was smelly I sweat a lot so I just wanted to refresh myself and after I went out I remembered oh I am in the state of sexual impurity I'm junob okay it's okay I just made a it's okay no it's not okay because you had to have this intention before you took your bath likewise someone goes to the bathroom and I know a lot of people who come to me and say this they say Sheikh it is a habit that whenever we answer the call of nature we find ourselves washing our feet and we just realize that we've made woodoo so is this woodoo acceptable answer is no you did not intend it before you make W you sayah intention is there so this is what differentiates prayer from prayer your intention if you go into the Masjid prayer and you say Allah and in the first he said this is is it h it's okay that's switch from AC to DC no you started your prayer on what on the account it's now it's so this prayer is invalid it turns into Sunnah you have to go out and you start it all over again however don't open the door for wiw foran because if you performed W in your house and you walked to the Masid and you entered the Masid but you're not thinking when I walk to the Masid do I say I'm going for I'm going for I'm going for I'm going for I'm going for I enter the Masid and before is being recited say this is this ISB this is now I'm I'm resing no Nobody Does this so as long as you have performed w at the time of and went to the Masid your intention is definitely but you don't tell yourself as long as you're praying the prayer of the time alhamdulillah and that is why Scholars say that the intentions are great doors for Shan to come from it can destroy your it can destroy your life when you allow Shan to whisper into your ear no no you did not intend this no you must have intended something else so don't open the door for Shan by doing this now we have the issue of intention in every single thing we do do I have to say it meaning we want to pray I usually hear people say on the day of Tuesday 11 November 2011 the im's name is so and so and he lives and so allahar what is this are you making a declaration of independence for example of what what are you doing I'm I'm I'm I'm saying my ni well the question is who are you saying it to says to Allah Allah doesn't know Allah knows H no no it's not for Allah it's for me you don't know what you are intending you're crazy intention is in the heart you don't have to say anything not only that intention is everywhere for example I do this and I drink and I put it back one says she what did you do I drank did you intend it of course I drank it do I have to say I intend to go and hold the glass and drink from it and return it back this might come natural from a robot but from humans they don't when you they put the buyani in front of you don't say I intend to eat the buyani and then discover that it is a cake for example you just go ahead and eat it if you want to answer the call of nature you go and answer the call of nature this is the intention so there is not a specific thing you say and this is what the prophet used to do am saying it verbally is an innovation the prophet did not do it neither his companions at all so by doing it you would be innovating one would say all types of all types of even fasting even fasting tomorrow is Ramadan my intention is to fast when I have the pre-dawn meal s what is this I never eat at 4:00 so what is this this is my intention I'm eating because I'm fasting tomorrow if I go to bed and I sleep thinking that I have to wake before F so that I can eat an apple and drink a glass of water and I overslept until after f is My fasting correct no who says it's correct raise your hands please 1 2 3 4 who says is incorrect meaning that four was were listening five five were listening and the rest did not know the question I'll ask you the question again after the break and if you're sleeping I'll have to make you wake up stay tuned inshallah we'll be right back Salam alaykum and welcome back just before the break I've asked a question and got four people to answer or five and the rest did not commment so I'll ask the question again and I beg you to stay awake I know the class is a little bit boring the teacher is a little bit boring but the subject is not the subject is very very important and by mastering it you will become your own sheh of course after maybe 20 30 years but eventually you will reach there so we go for the question If a person before going to sleep said to himself put the alarm uh on 4:00 so that he would wake up and eat some yogurt drink some water because he's fasting the first day of Ramadan and Subhan Allah he overslept he so tired he only woke up after the for the prayer was done so is this person considered to be fasting or his fast is not acceptable those who say his fast is acceptable raise your hands please mashallah tab Allah okay now we have consensus of the scholars so the answer is yes his fasting is acceptable though he did not say anything he did not eat anything but the intention was in his heart now one would say okay if you say that this is in all forms of worship what about why do I say why do I say why do I say isn't this the answer is no it is not this is called and the scholars all agree that if I put on my and I go for Hajj without saying this my Hajj is valid and I've just said the three types of ha verbally well actually is is this is this is so I've just said it does this make me in the state ofam no because I did not intend it so the intention is in the heart now from this Hadith we have to be extremely careful when it comes to intention the things you do they have to be for the sake of Allah otherwise you are in great trouble why is that in Muslim the prophet said the first three to be thrown in hell are a martyr a person who knows Quran and knowledge scholar and a person who is charitable who gives money for the cause of Allah the first three to be thrown in in Hell the first one who who died in the cause of Allah Allah brings him and he shows him all the favors and blessings that Allah bestowed upon him in dya and said what did you do he said I fought for your cause until I died a martyr Allah says you're lying you fought so that they would say you're brave throw him in Hell the other scholar he said I taught people Quran and I practiced what I taught he said you're a liar you taught them so that they would say you're aari and the third one to say that you are generous so the intention is extremely important now we live so long on this Earth we did so many good deeds but the problem is Will Allah accept them or not the problem is were they for the sake of Allah or not and that is why the best thing for you to work on is not your body it's not your muscles it's not your Investments it's not your kids it's your intention the minute you have a good intention everything changes and that is why Scholars say that I would have an intention even when I drink a glass of water imagine waking up at 2: a.m. you go to the kitchen you make a cup of espresso coffee with the intention that I'm going to pray for 2 Hours night prayer and I'd like to be a awake your preparation of that coffee drinking it is a form of worship it's you're rewarded I drink coffee and I'm rewarded yes not only that the prophet said if you have intimate relationship with your wife this is a and Allah will reward you and the companions flipped prophet of Allah one of us fulfills his desires and lust and he's reward did and the prophet of Allah said yeah if you do it in Haram would you be sinful then likewise if you do it in halal Allah would reward you so it is extremely important to understand and to purify Our intention however what does this have to do with our book now we're talking about purity about cleanliness about removing the filth and uplifting the had and this has to be with intention because prayer itself requires conditions to pray you have to have conditions what is the meaning of conditions but what what what is the definition is it in the in the same form of worship yes without which the I is not accepted so it is before or during or after it's before it's before conditions are the things that without them the I would not be acceptable however with them being fulfilled the I may or may not be present what do you mean for example I'll give you an example W evolution is is a condition of Salah correct meaning if I want to pray if I don't have my Evolution on my prayer is invalid but if I have my Evolution on do I have to go and pray no that is why we're not before going to bed part of the Sunnah is that you offer ation before you sleep why because the prophet told us that there is an angel that comes between my blanket and my body and whenever I turn around he says oh Allah forgive him oh Allah have mercy on him so being pure before going to sleep is one of the things that the prophet recommended us to do sallallahu alaih wasallam so we have conditions of prayer such as Purity such as the entrance of the time such as covering the such as facing the such as the ni of course there are other uh conditions required in all kinds of forms of worship such as Islam reaching the age of uh being able to differentiate things Tam they call and Sanity if someone who's insane and wants to make a form of worship this is not acceptable because because you have to be sane you have to be in the state that allows you to do this okay now let's let's take questions before moving on because this Hadith of Ni probably would take three sessions or more just for questions if we would like to have them so um brother KH you have a question uh shik you mentioned that if you start with your Salah then if you have the intention for Z and then in between you change it to ass I've read it in one of the books that if the intention in the beginning and the intention in the ending if it is the same then in between if there are any waswas that it doesn't matter yes is that right the waswas in between does not matter but here in the case that I've mentioned I was not talking about wias the man initially started prayer as and then changed it when he realized that it is time so this is not a wias this is actual changing from to now thew is I started it is time in the middle I got ideas of shall I change it into voluntary shall I change it and this is coming to me and I ignored it and I continued my prayer so there is a difference between the two scenarios and Allah knows best yes brother and then we'll move to you regarding intention uh the problem comes like uh when someone is earning through working in the field of dawa or else he's teaching the Quran he's AAR or teaching F and he earns his living through that now his intention is please Allah and he also intends you know that he will get money from that he might get increment and so on so how about this intention like when both of them you know reconcile okay I said it's an issue of dispute among Scholars and however if you look in the Sunnah you'd find that there were people who took money for things related to dawa or to Islam scholar said that it is permissible for person to charge for teaching the Quran and there's a Hadith that says that the best thing to charge money for is the Quran when you treat the Quran however they say that if someone is not in need it is befitting for him not to charge anything especially for the aan and that is why the prophet used to say take someone to call the aan who does not charge money yet the scholars said if the man had no occupancy no job except this what to do five times s a day how can I go to the mosque and give aan if I'm working somewhere else so this is okay to get to get money to get paid for your job as an Imam as a teacher as so and so but what is your intention if I work in a Masjid as an Imam and they give me for example XY Z or if I don't work as an Imam and someone comes to me and say sh can you become the IM of my Masjid and I say how much you going to pay me he says 4,000 says the the message next door gave me$ 7,000 you match that or I'm not coming now this is business this has nothing to do with getting something if you work your intention is to spread the dean and you get the job on top of that mallah what's wrong in that but if your intention is solely for the money not for the dawa then this goes clearly against your intention and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time"
