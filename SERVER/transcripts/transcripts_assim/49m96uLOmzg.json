  "transcript": "I will Yusuf's third question he is asking about the threshold known as nisab of gold so what amount of gold do I have to possess in order to give the cat the answer is scholars say that if you have 85 grams of 24 karat gold or more then you are ordered and obliged to give 2.5% of that as the cut can you elaborate definitely if I have 85 grams or my wife has 85 grams we would be rich but this is not the point if the gold is 24 as in the gold bars that they sell and it's 85 grams or more I have to calculate the value give 2.5% of it but if my wife has a necklace the and few other jewelry's that in weight there are 85 grams but some is 20 karats some is 718 some is 16 some is 14 in this case this did not reach the threshold how it is 85 grams yes but it's not 85 grams of 24 karats of gold if you take this to the jeweler a shop and he would calculate he would tell you okay this one that has 20 grams 20 karats means that there are 4 missing which is compensated by copper or other minerals so the 85 mixed grams of gold is equivalent to 70 and this means that you don't have to give the cut on that once it reaches 85 of 24 karat gold in this case you must give the cut for that most of our from Nigeria"
