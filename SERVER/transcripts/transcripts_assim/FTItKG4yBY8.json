  "title": "School does not allow me to pray in the mosque or pray in school, can i combine prayers? assim al",
  "transcript": "i asked him can i pray there then he didn't allow me even that so can i combine um okay uh brother abdulrahman says that he goes to a school where they do not permit him to go to the masjid to pray not only that they don't permit him to pray in the school itself so he's asking can i combine between the prayers the answer is no you should leave this school all together we have to set our priorities now if you are studying and you as a muslim must study in order to uplift your status to educate yourself and to be qualified to go to university and then to get a proper decent job but if you are studying in a hostile environment in an environment that oppresses the muslims and nobody dares to talk against that unfortunately which shows you how weak and humiliated the muslims are worldwide the muslims should stand together as a whole body when one of its limbs is sick the whole body shivers with fever this is true islam and true muslims what we see nowadays that the muslims are being stepped over used as a doormat they are killed lynched they're raped they're tortured they're made homeless relocated according to the disbelievers wishes and whims and desires and nobody among the muslims dare to speak and those who speak usually are voiceless now for you as an individual your priority is your religion yes in some cases you may combine but this is not the norm if you are in a hostile environment if you are in a school that oppresses islam and muslims and does not allow you to pray in their premises on their premises this means that you are in the wrong place and you have to leave that school do homeschooling or relocate to a school where there is an amount of tolerance the muslims in this that school should unite and they should pray against the authorities or the management whether they like it or not this is our religion and we are going to pray for our lord azzawajal the almighty and it takes only 10 minutes there is no a disturbance of the peace and yet they stop you for that no either pray or change your school and allah knows best you"
