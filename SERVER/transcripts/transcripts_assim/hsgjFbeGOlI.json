  "transcript": "what is shirk in love if i talk to the one who i am learning islam from in my mind all the time is this shirk in love how do i stop this this is one of the things that a lot of the people keep on confusing themselves on and on again what is shirk in love what is shirk in fear what is shirk in this and that and they keep on whispering to themselves and shaytaan utilizes this big time shirk is to associate others with allah so if you love someone love itself is something that's mutual there is natural love a hungry man loves a good meal adores a big medium well done steak is this love shirk no a person may out of compassion and mercy love his children out of being associated with others love his colleagues who share the same passion and hobbies with him so i'm a mechanic i love those who love cars like me for example a woman loves her husband there's no problem in that there's no shirk in that the shirk in love is when it is associated with worshiping allah with ibadah and ibadah means is to pave meaning it's paved and this is when a person worships allah azzawajal when you worship others when you submit your will to them when you worship them when you have total humility and submissiveness and total obedience to them whether they're present or not this is shirk in love and the idol worshipers as mentioned in surat al-baqarah they love their idols similarly to their love to allah so this is shirk and this is what allah made mention to us and then in comparison allah says but the believers love allah more so they don't associate others with allah because their love is purely for allah because it's a love of worshiping allah therefore loving someone and thinking like rumi on juliet all the time about one another daydreaming fantasizing this is not shirk in love this is either normal love or a sinful love but it is not shirk and allah azza knows best"
