  "title": "Dua & Dhikr (durood or salutations on Prophet ‎ﷺ) in Congregation an innovation? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "We don't invent, we don't make up things. Every day before Fajr, 15 minutes, 20 minutes, what's happening in the masjid? Huh? Before Adhan, they read Quran, they read Salawatun Nabi Alayhi Salatu Wassalam, and I'm sitting in my room. What is this? I'm looking in my books, maybe this is new Islam? I never taught us this in Mecca, in Medina. I open Quran, there's nothing mentioned. Books of Bukhari, Muslim, Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi, Nisa'i. Where are they bringing this from? So I go to Mawlana. No, his beard is not long. So I say, Mawlana, what is this? He said, this is dhikr, this is munajat. I said, don't give me the name, what is it? He said, it's good. I said, is it from the Quran? He said, no. Is it in the Sunnah? He said, no, but it's good. Huh? That's strange. He said, why is it strange? I said, because Allah Azza wa Jal says in the Quran, this day I have perfected for you your religion. What day was it? Day of Arafah in Hajjatul Wada' the last year where the Prophet performed Hajj Alayhi Salatu Wassalam. Today I have perfected for you your religion and completed my favour upon you and have approved for your Islam as a religion. So is the religion perfected? He said, yes. At the time of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam? He said, yes. So I said, now what you're doing, was it at the time of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam? Answer? He said, no. He said, OK, is it part of the religion or not? He said, but it's good. This is a problem. And people who bring innovation in Islam, they say that Islam is not perfected. So we have to add this something to it. And this is why Abdullah Ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him, the companion, says, every innovation takes you astray. Even when the people think it's good. Because it's not from religion. If it's from religion, show me. Was it at the time of the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam? Yes or no? Do we love the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam? Did the companion love the Prophet Alayhi Salatu Wassalam? Did they love him more than us? Yes. So now, mawlid. Oh. Dum, dum, dum."
