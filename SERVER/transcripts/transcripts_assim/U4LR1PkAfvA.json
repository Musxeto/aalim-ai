  "transcript": "Hamza from Canada um my question is um would um sorry I apologize for not saying my question yesterday correctly so what I meant by it was um do you have to R say exactly what you want in D for for it to be accepted because I get the thoughts to say if you do this action or say this you ask Allah for something bad happen so I'm just asking to refute this I don't have an idea what you're talking about um basic my question is if you for you have to verbally say what you want you have to verbally say what you want or you mean your lips are sealed and you just say it and visualize it in your head I mean like you have to like yeah verbally say like exactly what you want yes you do it is not sufficient for you to just verbalize it in your head lots of the people and I've said this before lots of the people say their AAR with their lips sealed maybe recite the Quran or do their Salat with their lips sealed they do their Ru and and recitation of the Quran without moving their lips or their tongue thinking that this is valid and the sad thing is that this is invalid their prayer is invalid and they say why we Allah knows what goes into our minds they say is correct but it is needed for you to move and articulate the words with your tongue and move your lips as if you're saying it silently not necessarily loudly but without moving your lips and your tongue it's like visualizing or fantasizing something Haram would Allah hold you accountable for that the answer is no Allah has forgiven my um for for my sake for whatever crosses their minds as long as they don't speak about it nor act upon it so alhamdulillah Allah has pardoned us from such intrusive thoughts but similarly if you recite the Quran do make Dua without verbalizing it without moving your lips and tongue it is not going to be counted and I hope this answers your question"
