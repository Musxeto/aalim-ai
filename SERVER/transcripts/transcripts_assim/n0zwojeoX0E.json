  "title": "Can a man learn Arabic from female teachers? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "basically muhammad sent us an email and i answered him today and it's good that i answered him because i was unable to understand his question until i remembered alhamdulillah so his question is he is unable to find suitable institutes that teach arabic except a particular institute the only problem is that the teachers are females so is it permissible for him because this is the most suitable in terms of time cost etc the answer is no learning arabic is not a necessity it's not an obligation staying away from haram is and for a man to go to a woman to teach him arabic which is not a necessity yet the possibility of falling into haram due to this sort of interaction is there then we close the door and say no look and you will definitely find other alternatives for male teachers inshallah you"
