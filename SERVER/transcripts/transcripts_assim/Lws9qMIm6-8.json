  "transcript": "an anonymous brother says can we sleep naked or sleep only with our private parts covered if there is a reason for that yes but generally speaking the answer is no the prophet salallahu salaam was asked can some one of us sleep naked and the prophet allah gave them the parable the comparison of being bashful and shy from allah's looking at them and from the angels around them looking at them so it is part of bashfulness yes there's nobody watching if there is a legitimate reason such as a man sleeping with his wife there's no problem in that at all but if he's sleeping alone and everything is fine why would he sleep naked yes he would loosen up a little bit maybe sleep in his boxers there's no problem with that if it's hot and humid and he needs to get rid of his clothes and the room is private and locked yeah this seems a legitimate reason but simply to to to lie down naked without any reason that is inappropriate and allah knows best"
