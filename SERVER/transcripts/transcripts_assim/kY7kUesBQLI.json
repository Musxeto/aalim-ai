  "transcript": "it is recommended to perform will do for every prayer now this is not mandatory because we know that the prophet ones are a solemn prayed fellow Arthur Madrid and Asia with the same Woodill and he what he was asked why are you doing this he said I don't want to burden my Ummah so if he were to order us to perform Moodle for every salat that would probably be difficult for some of us but if I am if I prayed rasa and soon after his mother if and soon after his ratio and I mean my world is intact why would I pray why would I offer a new one especially when it's cold there's no need for that so it is not mandated but is it recommended answers definitely why because with every wash with every drop that falls from your face from your arms from your feet Allah doesn't erases the sins that you've committed with these organs so definitely it is means of purification"
