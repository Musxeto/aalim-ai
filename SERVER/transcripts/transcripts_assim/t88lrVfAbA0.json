  "transcript": "we have asia from saudi oh my dad and my uncle have a dispute so my siblings don't also don't talk to my uncle to support my father i live abroad and when i go there i meet with my uncle normally which my mom did not like what is the right thing to do so your father is in dispute with his brother and and you are the only one who connects to your kinship by visiting your uncle and dealing with him uh normally and they're angry with you because of that correct [Music] am i correct yes what you're doing is exactly what islam tells you to do in islam it's not part of loyalty to sivir your kinship for the purpose of siding with one of your relatives like a father or a sibling on the contrary we have to abide by the quran and the sunnah we have to abide by allah's instruction to honor and withhold our kinship relationships even if my father says don't and unfortunately this is prevailing a lot of the parents when they are at dispute with their siblings or their relatives they instruct and order their children not to talk and communicate and in this case they're ordering them to disobey allah and obey them as parents and of course when you're giving the choice between disobeying allah or disobeying your uh parents definitely disobeying your parents is a must so keep on doing what you're doing go and connect with your uncle with your relatives even if this angers your parents but be diplomatic you don't have to show it to them or throw it in their face simply go and communicate with your uncle without telling them that you had seen him or met him and may allah make things better between them all you"
