  "transcript": "Sayyid from Singapore Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Okay my question is I made some vows in like I had a job application which I was waiting for so I made some vows that if I get the job I will fast for these many days, feed these many people then later on I got to know that this is Makruh in Islam so now I've still not heard the result of my application so can I make these vows void and still like intend to do more good deeds like pray Tahajjud and etc. Okay the Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam in an authentic hadith Man nadhara al yuti'a Allaha fal yuti'ahu whoever vows to obey Allah fasting, offering Tahajjud, giving charity he must fulfill that so if you made it a condition that if I win this job and I get appointed at this particular company I will go for Umrah you have to fulfill your vow you cannot simply say oops I didn't know that it was Makruh so I'm gonna waive it off no you have to fulfill it and Allah knows best"
