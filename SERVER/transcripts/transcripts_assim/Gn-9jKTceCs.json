  "title": "Is it permissible to give interest money to poor parents? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "rashad from tunisia he said i wrote to you an email and in it i said that my sister receives interest money which is haram so she gives it to her mother as a form of assistance because she's poor and she needs to pay off her medical bills and you said this is not permissible why the answer is your mom is a responsibility of yours which means it is your duty to provide for her from your hard hard earned money by taking a detour and utilizing the interest money which is haram in giving it to your mom you're saving your heart earned money and this is a conflict of interest the haram wealth earned has to be disposed of to the poor and needy muslims not to get closer to allah rather to cleanse my wealth from this haram and this is why if i cleanse my wealth by giving it to my mom whom i'm supposed to take a chunk of my savings my earnings to give for her to pay for her medical expenses then there is a conflict of interest because i'm saving my money and i'm utilizing the interest money which is haram for me in the beginning and benefiting from it so i hope this makes sense to you rashad and your sister"
