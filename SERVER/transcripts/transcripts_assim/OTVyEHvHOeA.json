  "transcript": "first of all this is how this happens a lot to Muslims they go into a house they say hmm where's the Qibla so some of them think it's this way it's that way put your finger in your mouth and do this maybe the wind would technically you're not gonna have a know the Qibla like this so scholars say if you are in a country or in a town or in a village where it has a message it though it's far from you you must not pray until you go and check with the message where the can blaze the message is closed you can tell by the structure when they have the place for the Imam the mohab then you know that the Qibla is this way there is no message here I'm in a city in a village no mass at all ask any Muslim you're visiting Muslims ask them what it is where the can place and they'll tell you well I share there are no Muslims I would have Billa don't you have a smartphone every smartphone has a compass so you can tell where the Qibla is if you don't have an app that shows you the tabla you will have a composites shows you the north west east and if at all you have nothing not even a clear sky that you can look at the north pole or the Stars etc nothing in this case called say you may do your best to think where the Qibla is and pray accordingly and afterwards if someone tells you that the Qibla was wrong your prayer is valid but if you don't take any of these measures and you are out of laziness say mmm I think it's this way and you pray and you discover that it is the other way in this case you have to repeat your prayer because praying to the table is one of the conditions of select if you have done your due diligence and failed to know where it is and prayed to the wrong direction your prayer is valid but if you did not then you have to repeat the salat and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
