  "transcript": "she's asking a second question but the sound wasn't very clear to me but I think she was referring to dice the hadith of the Prophet Isis M is crystal clear why this is something we don't know the Prophet told us vizier historico mallory mystery raka why we don't know and the people are checking their dials in their headsets and their TV what does this have to do with dice well I'm coming to you so when the Prophet prohibits dice why it's the same reason for having for two Rakas and three rockets for mother which is submission the Prophet says as some it's best for a person to dip his hand in the blood of swine of pork rather than to play with dice that's it full stop does there or is there any justification any logic this is submission why face the Kaaba and not put it on a right hand side when we pray this is submission this is religion you have to say we adhere and we listen and we obey so can we yeah and the sort of play around and beat around the bush and write numbers and figures on pieces of paper and randomly select them so I'd have a piece or of a card saying six four as if I played with the dice and it says six four four six six which is the highest so can I do this on a piece of paper it's the same concept and I believe that this is not permissible"
