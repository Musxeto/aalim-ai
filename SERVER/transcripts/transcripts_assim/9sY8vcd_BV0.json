  "transcript": "uh sabirah from india check a person has gas incontinence and watery flattens the person's gas incontinence and watery flattens are not continuous 24 7 but the person doesn't know when their gas incontinence and watery florence will come and stop so when should this person play each salah and should this person change their underwear for every salah as long as you say it is not continuous 24 7 this clearly means that there will come a period of time where there won't be such incontinence and therefore we have a beginning of the time and an end of the time during which i know there will come a time where i will not have this incontinence it will stop and i can pray without a problem if i know which whether it's in the beginning in the middle or the end i have to wait till that before doing that i have to change my clothes if it's soiled and i have to perform moodle and pray what if i don't know when it is going to stop therefore i have a beginning of the time i have to wait until it stops if it reaches the end of the time of the prayer by sufficient amount of time for me to make wudu and pray normally let's say 20 minutes maybe 15 minutes if during this time it did not stop 15 minutes for example before the end of time i change i make wudu and i pray regardless of what's coming out from me even if afterwards my clothes were soiled there's no problem because you've done the level best in your ability and allah azza knows best you"
