  "transcript": "Allah bless your family and your team and you as well there is an Islamic conference coming that was that is being organized by a friend of mine who had asked for my help so I was helping him doing that it was it is about the the hijab the problem is at some point he decided to insert a human woman like Quran competition so I told him that no this is not permissible unfortunately he asked the people of knowledge here and they all told him that it was permissible no problem that even one in front of me actually so the real problem is now I want to ask if I help him but not in the Quran competition but in everything else uh am I sinful for that should I just refrain completely 100% as I have trying to do right now this is something that is up to your own judgment you see Allah when he spoke about gambling and intoxicant in the Quran he said they ask you about intoxicants wine and gambling say there is great deal of sin and some benefits however the sins outweigh the benefits this is a rule in Islam the pros and cons whatever ways then it takes the ruling if you believe that this conference is beneficial for the umah and that there were will be a lot of good speakers good topics it's all according to and according to the most most authentic opinion and that you evaluate it to be 90% success and 10% for the girl Quran competition which is a minus in this case you can go for it if it's 50/50 then stay away from it if it's less then definitely it's a an an a um a deviant event you should stay away from and Allah Knows Best"
