  "title": "I look @ Calligraphy with Allah's name while I'm making dhikr & imagine Allah is talking to me shirk",
  "transcript": "Ahmadio from Indonesia Sheikh, in my local masjid there is a calligraphy of the word Allah and I tend to look at it and focus on it whenever I do dhikr and whenever I make du'a and I imagine Allah is talking to me, is this allowed or is this considered as shirk? No, this is not allowed because it will open the door for you to think that the word Allah is Allah and it would open the door for whispers of shaytan to corrupt and pollute your thinking as it's happening now, don't look at it, don't focus on it, don't imagine Allah, Allah is not talking to you, these are all whispers from shaytan, later on you're going to see, say that you've heard Allah's voice in your head and Allah is ordering you to do this and that and all of this is bogus."
