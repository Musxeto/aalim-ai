  "transcript": "she's asking about the ruling on marrying a divorcee or a widow if i understand this correctly that's a good thing for someone who has been previously married because the sunnah for a person who did not marry before to marry a virgin as per the hadith of may allah be pleased with him and with his father when he got married so the prophet asked him assam did you marry a virgin or a previously married woman he said no i married a previously married woman he said why why didn't you get a virgin where or someone who you can play with and she plays with you when you're both virgins you enjoy things better and more than someone who was previously married he said oh prophet of allah my father died leaving a half a dozen of girls my siblings sisters so i did not want to bring another young inexperienced girl to them and they become like seven or or more and this is why i married someone who's experienced who knows how to handle things so that she would help me handle them and the prophet made to made dua for him and the prophet himself al-sosam married widows he married um he married hafsah and the vast majority of the prophet's wives were widows the prophet married divorcees like zainab bin jash who was married to us ibn haritha once he divorced her the prophet married her so there's nothing wrong in that none whatsoever on the contrary this shows how close the community the muslim community is instead of going in to marry a christian or a jew or to look for something materialistic and worldly rather you see someone who is a divorcee or a widow in need of help that you go and help her instead and that would be more rewarding now i don't know if i if you asked about a divorcee or a widow marrying without the consent of her guardian because many people think that as long as she's a divorcee or a widow she has the right to marry herself to whomever she wants the answer is no this is not permissible she has to get married with the consent of her guardian and allah azza knows best you"
