  "transcript": "from Nigeria is asking how many times do we raise our hands uh during the Salat and this is an issue that seriously we should not be so um how to say it extreme about it first of all as Muslims what is the ruling on raising the hands in the Salah is it a pillar or is it mandatory or it is neither the answer is it's neither it's a Sunnah so if you do it and if you skip it it's not going to invalidate your prayer it's not going to affect your prayer okay having this over done with let's go into the Sunnah how many many times did the prophet raise his hands in Salat all Muslims agree that he raised his hand in the first known as so when you want to inaugurate your prayer you sayb the is the pillar of Salat not raising your hands so even if I say in the beginning ofat my prayer is valid now are there any other locations where the Prophet wasallam raised his hands the answer is yes the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam raised his hands as in the Hadith of who observed his prayer and reported that to us and it's in the most authentic book after the Quran which isi he said that the prophet sallallah wasallam used to raise his hands and this is from my pocket huh so the prophet raised his hands in two locations of the of the prayer only once and in two other locations in every single ra so the first location that he only did it once in Salah is in the beginning of the Salat the second is whenever he stood up from the first to the third and this happens in or so when he stands up to the third raak he said allahar and this happens only once now the other two locations that happen every single ra and that is when you want to bow for R you raise your hands and when you raise your head from you say and this happens in every now this is a Sunnah that is authentic we have reporting it to us to make an issue out of it and US versus them and they say so many awful things that this was in the beginning because some of the new Muslims used to put Idols under their armpit so when they raise their hands it would fall down this is pathetic and you can do something better than that to make it an issue that divides the umah as some of the brothers told me in Pakistan the Imam there if he sees them raise their hands he orders them to get out of the Masjid is this your father's Masjid to get people out of it you this Imam is an ignorant imbecile for doing such things to people who are following the Sunnah even if you differ with them it's their prayer not yours why are you angry about it because these people want the congregation to be like sheep and they are their Shepherds they only listen and adhere to whatever they say and this is totally unacceptable in Islam"
