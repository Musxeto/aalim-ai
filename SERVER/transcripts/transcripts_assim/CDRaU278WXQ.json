  "transcript": "I have a question basically sorry um so I told my friend that music is Haram and um I gave him all the authentic Hadith and the opinion of the four major Scholars and um he seems to agree with it but he keeps on asking me why it is Haram like why is has it been made har what what is what is it that you're saying to him is Haram music okay okay so how should I respond to him when he ask me why it has been made see Islam is to submit your will to Allah the almighty and to follow the teachings of prophet Muhammad Alat this is the manifestation of as and when Allah tells us something something we have no right to say why explain to me what's the justification in Islam to pray you have to perform woodoo wash your limbs if you don't have water you strike the ground and soil with your hands wipe your face and hands anyone would say doesn't make sense why ah if you say it doesn't make sense why you're not a Muslim because you're questioning Allah's rulings likewise when the prophet saysat men are not allowed to wear gold jewelries it's Haram it's permissible for women one says why because the prophet said it's Haram what do you mean why are you a Muslim likewise when the prophet saysat that music is Haram as per theith of and and other many hadiths no muslim in his right mind would say why because he is OB objecting to the prophet's ruling Alat so if your friend is not satisfied by the evidences you've showed him leave him alone and move on to befriend others and unfriend this person because he's not a real proper Muslim who's willing to accept there's a difference between someone who says yes I know it's Haram but I'm weak I'm listening to it I love it okay he's sinful but someone who keeps on objecting and why why why this is not a person to consider as a friend and Allah Knows Best"
