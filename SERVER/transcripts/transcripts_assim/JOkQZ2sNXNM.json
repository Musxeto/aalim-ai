  "transcript": "Salih from Saudi uh Sheikh I have a question \nabout if husband allows you to participate   or give Zoom classes Zoom Quran classes but \nhe says that you will not take the fee like   you can give the classes free of course but \nyou cannot take the fee is it permissible for   her to take the fee without him knowing \nit no he is not allowed to restrict her   from taking money so if he allows her to \ngive the classes she can give the classes   and she must not tell him about her collecting \nmoney because this is none of his business   so she can give classes and she can charge \nfor that without any problem insha Allah"
