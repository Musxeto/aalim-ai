  "transcript": "uh just a quick question I have a question regards to J and work in the west I know you answered this question sometimes but basically my question is um if a person works in the west has the intention of making hij somewhere along the line but at the moment he works at a job and he asks his boss or his manager am I able to leave for jam and he refuses and he doesn't find any Muslims uh to pray with is excuse from the first of all those who work in a cafir country and they as stated before the bread winners and they have to work to feed themselves and their families if it is time for jum prayer they have to try to reach a settlement with the management either to make them up later on on the same day or during the the week and if they agree alhamdulillah it's a win-win if they don't they are Exempted from praying jum because in the books of f if a person has merchandise or goods and the time for jum is due and he cannot take this merchandise with him to the Masjid and there's no one else to keep an eye on it no one says leave it go to pray and come back because it would be stolen and taken away so juror say this is a legitimate excuse for you to skip jum because you are unable to protect your earning your business and likewise with your job so there's no problem in doing this inshallah"
