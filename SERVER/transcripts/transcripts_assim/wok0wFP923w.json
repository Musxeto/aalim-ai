  "transcript": "now why are we creative say come on this is basic everybody knows this okay refresh my memory allah says i have not created the jinn and the humans except with the soul purpose of worshiping me worshiping allah so this is why allah created you okay do you have knowledge sure no no seriously do you acknowledge do you accept this fact yes this is why i'm praying i'm fasting and i'm a muslim okay this is not only the forms of worship because is far greater than simply fasting and um and praying and giving zakat yes it is one of the pillars of islam but is it everything no so what is it that you're talking about how many years did the prophet spend allah 13 years and after that he migrated to medina and stayed there for 10 years very good mashaallah you've done your homework what did the prophet islam do in these 13 years in mecca the he taught everybody islam such as prayer fasting hajj zakat wrong what do you mean wrong these are the pillars of islam wrong ahi because salat was ordained and obligated only in the last years of the makkah period after the israel mirage the miraculous night journey and this was one two or three years before hijra so for 10 years there was no salat for 13 years there was no zakat because zakat was obligated in medina after migration there was no fasting because fasting was obligated on the second years of hijra in medina there was no hajj in umrah because hajjun umrah was obligated on the 10th and the ninth year of hijrah whoa that's strange so what did the prophet do all of these 13 years in mecca uh he taught them how to worship allah okay but i thought you said all of these forms of worship were introduced in medina yes because that was not the only form of worship what is the first pillar of islam to bear witness that there is no god worthy of being worshipped except allah and that the prophet muhammad ali's son is his servant and messenger this is the shahada also known as the kalima this is what the prophet allah is spent all of his years in makkah as well as in medina teaching the people who allah is what the prophet allah is status in islam and why should we obey him simply manifested and summed up in tawheed so the prophet had spent all of his life teaching people to hate the core and what to do with the belief that the prophet is a servant and a messenger of allah to obey him in what he orders to stay away and refrain from what he prohibited and to believe whatever he told us about and not to worship allah unless he legislated it for us this is worshipping allah you"
