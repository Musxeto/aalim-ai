  "transcript": "Maham from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is that I don't like to eat the onions that are present in food so like would it be sinful if I separate them and throw them or would it be like wasting food? There is nothing wrong in not wanting to eat onion or garlic at all this is up to your preference. The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam refrained from eating any food that contained onion or garlic and when he was asked so that should we follow suit he said no no no no no I am not like you I speak with people you don't speak to referring to Jibreel the archangel Jibreel so when Jibreel comes the Prophet doesn't want to have a foul smell coming out from him not that it is haram and this is why he used to refrain from eating food containing garlic and onions though his companions would eat from it without any problem so there is no problem from for you when you are served such food to select the onions and garlic and put it aside if you don't want to eat it and eat the rest of the food the onion and the garlic are negligible it can be thrown away sometimes you would find others on the table would say do you mind and they would gladly consume it and eat it without any problem you"
