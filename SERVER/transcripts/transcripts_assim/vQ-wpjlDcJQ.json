  "title": "Should I always lower my gaze or only if I feel attracted to a woman or when her awrah is uncovered?",
  "transcript": "my question is um regarding the gase lowering that is ordered for men in the Quran so considering I live in a Muslim country so do I have to lower my gaze either every time a woman passes by me or is it only when um I feel that I may be attracted to her or her out I not cover Allah says in the Quran say to the believer men to lower their gazes not to not look because then you're going to hit the wall or you're going to crash so you're allowed to look we are the bread winners we go to malls we go to the market we go to the Masjid we walk in the streets we may encounter women walking maybe covering their a with proper hijab maybe not so Islam gives you the right to have the first gaze which is accidental which is for the purpose of looking and seeing your what's in front of you so I'm walking a woman walks I look she's a woman I lower my gaze I look elsewhere but if I look again and check her out up and down and try to see what is beautiful in her this is sinful now she may not be attracted and I may not be tempted this still does not give me the right to look and freely look because this defies the purpose of hijab and this is why men looking at women is far worse than women looking at men the FNA the Temptation from men looking at women is far greater and Allah Knows Best"
