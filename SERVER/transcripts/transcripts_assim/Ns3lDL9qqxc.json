  "transcript": "mahat says my question to you is my father is a Muslim but he neither offers salat nor fast I told him and he replied that do for your grave whatever you want to do but do not teach me he uses to watch TV at after time and whole day when he is free I'm worried for him as a daughter I really don't know what to do this is a common problem that a lot of the Muslims face with those who are ignorant those who are neglectful of allah azza wajal you can lead a horse to water you cannot force the horse to drink allah said to his messenger sallallaahu I seldom Lisa Ali kahuna home well like in a la jolla dementia it is not to you to guide them it's not for you to guide them it is for Allah Allah to guide whomever he wishes so your duty on earth is to keep on reminding him in a diplomatic way meaning that you can remind him 10 times a day and this would make him only further away from Islam or you can be diplomatic and smart and give him a week or two without even reminding of allah azza wajal and then try that once and you pause for a while and so on you have to make a lot of door for him you have to be a role model so even if he is watching TV you have to pray in front of him show him how you recite the Quran so bite a with time he would start to think she's doing something I should be doing I should be ashamed of myself and eventually insha'Allah with your dua Allah will return him back"
