  "transcript": "so our personality that we are about to attempt to talk about is a great muslim individual she is the daughter of the first man of the um of the prophet salam to enter jannah she is the daughter of the most beloved person on earth to the heart of a prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam she is asma the daughter of abu bakr assad may allah be pleased with her and with him she is the sister of isha sharing the same father but different mothers her mother is kothayla bint abdul uzza and asma was nicknamed as um abdullah because of her son abdullah ibn zubair may allah be pleased with them she was 10 years older than aisha and her rank among those who accepted islam was the 17th which means that she was among the very first to accept islam at a very early age she is known among the muslims by the nickname and the talk is singular is two nitak is a belt women wear on their dresses so that they would lift their dresses up on top of that belt so that they would not tremble if the dress is too long while working at home she's remembered for helping the prophet ali and her father when they escaped mecca and hid for three days in the cave so that those posse trying to kill them would not find them for three days she used to prepare the food and the water and walk the distance of two hours on foot hiding from the people facing the dangers of the dark and being alone just to deliver the food for a very just cause she took her belt divided it into two and tied the water container and the bag of food because she didn't have anything to tie it with and when the prophet saw this was he made dua for this young girl saying may allah substitute you with these two with two belts in paradise meaning that may allah admit you to paradise she was a blessed woman who suffered at an early age due to her islam she was a role model she wasn't someone who did not have high ambitions high aspirations she was like anyone else wanting to live to enjoy but she knew that she had a mission in life and that mission was to worship allah azza to spread the deen of allah to assist in any way this great religion of islam that she has absolute unconditional conviction in and this is a role model to our girls to our women who unfortunately are misguided by the fashion the catwalk the entertainment industry asma suffered at an early age may allah be pleased with her it was reported that when the prophet sallam escaped mecca and the idol worshippers came looking for him and did not find him and only found ali may allah be pleased with him pretending to be him sleeping in in his bed abuja the pharaoh of this ummah was furious came with other men with fire in their eyes wanting to kill so he knocked the door as ma opened it and he asked her arrogantly where is your father and she said i don't know this pharaoh of this umma this tyrant smacked her on the face so hard her earring fell she would not budge she would not move a step because she had iman filling up her heart knowing that she is on the right track and on the right on the straight path asthma was the daughter of abu bakr abu bakr in the early days of islam was responsible for five or six of the ten heaven bound to enter islam so imagine abu bakr managed to convince uthman ibn afan to accept islam as and many others among those whom allah guided on his hands was who was as was the cousin of the prophet zubair's mother so it was normal that azubair would propose to this man who had guided him to islam and to marry his daughter abu bakr could not find anyone more worthy of asma than zubair so they got married and asma was a lawful wife and allah azzawajal granted the couple many children the first of them was abdullah ibn zubair now we know that asma migrated late so asma ah isha and the daughters of the prophet who was the adopted son of the prophet hassam came to pick them up asthma was pregnant and she was on her final days expecting delivery any time but she could not afford to miss this blessed gathering migrating to medina so she took the risk and traveled three days journey of four on camel's back until they reached medina only to find the pains of labor and she gave birth in cuba which was a joyful event for the muslims the jews circulated among the muslims that we have spel we had casted we have casted a spell on the muslims that they would never ever give birth to children in medina and some of the muslims were afraid of this being true so when asma gave birth to the first born muslim in medina it was a joyful occasion and the muslims were happy this blessed woman would not breast feed her newborn infant which is a very natural thing to do instead she sent her firstborn directly to the prophet and the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam made dua for the boy and for his parents so this blessed woman gained the dua of the prophet israel not only that the prophet performed what is known as technique and this is a ritual in our religion that the first thing to be or to enter the mouth of a newborn would be a very minute and tiny piece of date that a person chews quite well until it is almost liquid-like and then it's put a small piece in the upper ceiling of the child's throat and the child would suckle it and swallow it and doctors say that this type of glucose of sugar is extremely important for the well-being of the child in order to prevent suffocation due to lack of many things medical things that i'm not well aware of but i know that they say that there are a number of benefits of it and that would help the child to suckle naturally and normally so the first thing that entered the abdullah zubair's throat and stomach was this small piece of date mixed with the saliva of the prophet and what a blessing it was asma may allah be pleased with her and you can guess that by now was very strong and committed to islam and to her religion after all the suffering she faced from the idol worshippers the pride she had in her heart was the norm among all muslims and this is what most of us nowadays lack muslims nowadays don't have any honor dignity or pride in their religion except few the vast majority would have no problem in bowing down to the disbelievers conceding to their demands simon says yes master not as man as ma was a typical muslim at the time of the prophet alaihis salazar where they had their dignity where they proclaimed say oh you who disbelieve i don't worship what you worship you do not worship what i worship you have your religion i have mine this is the pride of a muslim without any arrogance you have to be proud in your religion may allah be pleased with her gave us a beautiful example in the sahih she reports or she narrates she says that my mother came to visit me in medina so kotela came while she was still a disbeliever she came with meat with ghee with dates with so much food as gifts to her daughter so she asthma in the beginning refused to accept any of it and she said you're a disbeliever and i am a believer and i have to seek permission from the prophet is this possible yes it is possible at an earlier age when the prophet has migrated to medina with abu bakr abu bakr took all of his cash deposits about 6000 dinar o dirham and flat and left with the prophet and migrated this money is to be utilized in dawah purposes in spreading islam in supporting the prophet salam when abu kuhafa the father of abu bakr who was not yet muslim and he was a blind man an old man he came to the home of his son only to find that he migrated so he said to his grandchildren i bet that your father did not only frighten you by leaving that also he frightened you by taking all his his wealth as well leaving you in poverty asma being the proud muslim as she was she didn't want her grandfather who was an idol worshiper to criticize islam or to criticize her father so she came to a bag and put some stones in it and placed it in her father's safe and put a piece of cloth on it to hide it and she took her grandfather's hand and said no no grandfather you got this all wrong my father left a lot of money for us look and she put his hand in the safe over that pile of stones and when he felt it he said oh if this is the case then alhamdulillah he left a lot of money for you you won't need my assistance and this shows you how proud she was of her religion and this is why she rejected her mother's gift because she didn't want any favors from a non-muslim over her so she asked o prophet of allah my mother came to connect her kinship with me she wants to give me a gift so that i'm happy would i reciprocate with her would i accept that so the prophet said alaihis allah yes be dutiful and kind to your mother even said that the following ayah was revealed due to that incident allah says in the quran allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes allah does not forbid you from being righteous towards them and acting justly toward them indeed allah loves those who act justly subhanallah where are the muslims from such a beautiful verse where are those extremists those terrorists who kill any non-muslim because he's an enemy of islam have they ever read the quran no yes they are 0.0001 of the population they're not even a minority they're not to be even looked at but they make a bigger sound their bark is far greater than their bite unfortunately if they read the quran and saw this ayah non-muslims who do not fight us because of religion because of our islam and they do not expel us from our homes allah says it's totally permissible to be kind to them to be just towards them and to be righteous give them gifts deal with them nicely and kindly there is nothing wrong in that but people are so ignorant they are so far away from islam had they read the quran they would have found what the religion of peace tells us about this now asma was married to zubair who was one of the courageous soldiers of islam and she was the mother of abdullah and we all know who abdullah zubair was may allah be pleased with all of them yet she was not a fancy woman she was not a woman of aristocrat life she used to work with her own hands struggle suffer though her father was a rich man but she was with her husband now and her husband was stone broke he had only his horse she used to walk like two three kilometers to bring dates seed grinded and feed it to his horse and she used to do this daily do the shores in the home cook make dough everything one day while on her way back from the farm of azubair carrying those dates uh seats on her head the prophet came along with his companions ali and he was on his camelback so he said to her he didn't even call her this is a sound to draw attention and the prophet got his camel to sit on the ground so that she can mount the camel behind the prophet sallam knowing that the prophet is her brother-in-law he is her father's brother meaning uncle and that he is the messenger of allah is not any normal person so when the prophet offered her ali this right she remembered zubair's jealousy so she declined and she refrained refrained so the prophet hassam moved on with his companions remembering the husband's jealousy and acting upon that this is the formula of a happy marriage when a wife respects her husband's feelings whether wrong or right he has the right to feel jealous she respects that instead of fighting it ridiculing it and not paying attention to it and we get so many problems from men complaining from disobedience of their wives and not paying attention to issues of free mixing with the cousins posting their photo photos on social media doing so many things that islam does not approve of and of course we get so many complaints of sisters complaining of their husbands chit-chatting with non-mahrams and doing heinous things that this is not the time to discuss what matters is that asma remembered the jealousy of her husband and acted accordingly though he was not there he was not present he was not watching but it's the fear of allah that reminded her of that asma like all the mothers of the believers like all the great companions like all those close to the circle of the prophet islam used to spend generously in the cause of allah abdullah ibn zabar may allah be pleased with the man with his father said we're sisters but their spending in the cause of allah was different whenever she got something she used to pilot little or big she used to pilot until it was worthy of being spent she would spend it all at once asma was different whatever comes goes nothing stays and asthma was known that whenever she got sick she would immediately free all slaves that she has and spend all money that she has seeking the pleasure of allah this brave woman at a very old age she was she was almost over a hundred years of age when al hajjaj yusuf athakafi killed her son and crucified him and he came and sent from his palace someone to summon asma in his court so when the messenger came telling her to come and meet the hajjaj she said to him go i'm not coming tell him i'm not coming so sent the messenger again and said to him tell her if she does not come willingly i'll send someone to pull her from her braids from her hair and drag her all the way look at this disrespect from this person she said to him i challenge him let him send whoever he wishes to drag me from my braids so immediately alhaji came to see her in her house and he said to her what do you think of what i had done to the enemy of allah meaning her son abdullah who is a companion the son of a companion but this is the arrogance some people have and this is when you sell your soul to the devil for few dirhams so she said to him you haven't done anything i see that you have spoiled his dunya by killing him you spoiled his life on earth yet he spoiled your achira by you killing him he has pulled your achira when you meet allah azza and you'll pay for your bad deeds and she bluntly said that to his face i heard the prophet saying that in the tribe of al-hajjaj which is in taif in 30 there will be a liar and an executioner executioner someone who kills people a lot the liar we have seen him and i see that he is and the man who kills and executes people i see that he is no one but you she said that not fearing death for hajjaj was known to kill people discriminately without any cause he killed said one of the greatest tabi's and scholars of islam he killed zubair a companion without any problem to him as matt was a person of knowledge she narrated a lot of hadiths about the prophet allah and she narrated 58 hadiths al-bukhari and muslim agreed on 13 of them bukhari narrated five on his own and muslim four on his own she may allah be pleased with her was the last to die from among the muhajireen men and women and she died in the year 73 of hijrah may allah azzawajal be pleased foreign you"
