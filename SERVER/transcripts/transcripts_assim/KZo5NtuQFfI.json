  "title": "When to do sujood as sahu behind the imam? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother Zuhair and he says what to do when one makes a mistake or forgets something in mandatory salat behind the imam basically what the hare is asking about is are we supposed to offer through the cell the prostration of forgetfulness when we're praying behind an imam or not now it is important to understand the functions of the salat so that we know when to offer and when not to offer through the cell so first of all among the common mistakes that people frequently ask about is that do we offer SuJu the cell when we make a mistake in reciting an ayah after the fatiha so if I'm reciting surah al-baqarah and I skip an ayah or I make a mistake in an ayah would I rectify this by suit with a hood answer is no if I forgot to raise my hands when saying Allahu Akbar do I have to make sure to the south the answer is no then when to do so do the same so you do see who is done whenever you add or leave out or doubt whether you offered or did not offer a pillar or something that is mandatory in salat so voluntary acts or Sunnah acts in salat do not require so do the self whether you've done it intentionally or out of ignorance or out of forgetfulness you added you left out a sunnah act or a sunnah rhetoric this does not affect your salat so pillars such as standing up bowing raising up from bowing prostrating sitting between the two prostrations the tashahud in the last sitting of the salaat etcetera all of these are pillars if you left them out out of ignorance forgetfulness or deliberately your prayer is invalid you have to rectify it within the prayer itself otherwise there is no pillar the whole building folds down if it is an mandatory act such as saying Allahu Akbar when you move from one position to the other or saying Samir Allahu Liman Hamidah or sayings of Hannibal a theme while you are in the rock or position or soup honorable Ally in the prostration position or the first tisha hood in a prayer that has to dash out like mad rib or doha Rasul and Asia all of these are obligatory or mandate a acts if you forgot them or may or left them out or replace them out of forgetfulness you rectify this by offering to salute for so if you done if you had done this intentionally your prayer is invalid whether you add or you leave out now let us look at the highest question so here is asking about leaving out mandatory acts but while praying behind the imam so praying behind the imam is or has one of two scenarios the first scenario is that you join the imam from the first tracker so if he is praying for you prayed with the imam the whole four Rakas let us assume that you made a mistake during these four records by leaving an obligatory or mandatory act such as in the first tracker while in the bowing position in the record position instead of saying subhana rabbi Allah deem you made a mistake and said subhana rabbi Allah five times ten times or you did not say anything at all instead you started reading or reciting the fatiha in Derick or when the man said seminar l-'alamin Hamid a hue rose up and said o bana what i cal Hamden I said what have I done I left out an obligatory Act what to do in scenario number one the scholars say that the imam carries any mistake that you do in obligatory or mandatory acts and what does that mean meaning that if you left out or added something of the voluntary of the mandated or obligatory acts unintentionally or out of forgetfulness or due to ignorance your prayer is valid and you do not have to rectify it by offering to show you the self the evidence the Prophet said RA is salatu salam ala Mamo Baumann well mu add vino mock Taman which translates roughly to the imam is a guarantor meaning that he guarantees that whatever mistakes you had done in your prayer he rectifies it he carries out the burden and there is nothing on you and the more Advan is entrusted so when he calls the van it is his responsibility I don't have to make sure that the event is being called on time now in scenario one the Imam has the power to exempt you from Sudha so if you had left an obligatory or a mandatory act but when it comes to pillar this is not within the authority of the Imam meaning that if you offered only one sujood with the Imam because when he made the first suit you followed him you said subhanAllah BL Allah he said Allahu Akbar and sat between the two prostrations but you didn't and then he said Allahu Akbar and he prostrate it again and then he stood up for the second raka while you only managed to make one sujood this means that your whole raka is void likewise from the beginning you've started with the Imam in one of the four Rakas while you are standing you started reciting surah al-baqara and you forgot to recite al-fatiha it's a silent prayer so the Imam did not recite it loudly you it's a pillar for you to recite it silently but you forgot and you discovered that after the rock I was over this raka is void it is it does not count so when the Imam gives Salam you have to stand up and add an extra raka in place of the one that you had missed and then after you conclude your prayer and offer Salam you offer to sujood of forgetfulness and then you offer another Salam this was scenario number one now scenario number two is that if you join the Imam after skipping one Recaro more this means that when the Imam concludes his prayer you will stand up and complete what you had missed in this case you have to complete the prayer as usual and then before Salam or after Salam depending on the mistake you had done you have to offer to do the self here the Imam does not carry the burden from you because you did not pray with him from the very beginning rather you missed raka or more and I hope this answers your question"
