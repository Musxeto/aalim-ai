  "title": "Can I divide my wealth and give it to my children while I am still alive? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mohammed from Nigeria says that is it permissible for me to share my wealth with my children while I'm alive the answer is this is not sharing a fee Mohammed this is a gift so your question would be is it permissible for me to divide my wealth half of it 75% of it among my children the answer is yes if you want to give all of your wealth to your children while you are alive this is totally permissible providing you do not want to harm your wife so some people do this because they don't want their wives to inherit them I hate divorce her but keeping her as your wife serving you like a slave maid and then you deprive them from her right that Allah had given this is totally unacceptable so coming back to your question dividing your wealth is permissible providing that you are fair between your offspring and this brings us to your second question but I'll delay it later on so if I have like one boy and four girls should I give the boy twice what I give for the girls it's an issue of dispute the most authentic opinion is that they should all be equal because this is not inheritance this is a gift and the prophet alayhi salatu salam said to al Bashir al-assad the father of a Norman have you given all of your offspring the same when he specifically given had given a Norman a Bashir a piece or a plot of land so the but she said no the Prophet asked him another question do you want all of your offspring to be equal to you in kindness and being dutiful and and he said yes so the Prophet a son be equal to them in their gift so you must be equal to all of them boys and girls in gift"
