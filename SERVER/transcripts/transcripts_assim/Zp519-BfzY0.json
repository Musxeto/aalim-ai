  "transcript": "can you please explain to me about after the marriage contract is signed by the W but he said do not enter your wife until I have it signed by the court what does this mean not to enter the wife well if he said this then yeah maybe he did not mean it literally see when you have the marriage contract done and written and signed this means that legally she is your not leg let me rephrase that islamically she is your wife so if you sleep with her this is halal and if you have children from her these are your legitimate children everything is by the book and it's all a correct and and an accepted marriage however in so many countries the father usually requests that the marriage is not completed in the sense that the wife does not go out with her husband and the husband does not sleep with his wife until the paperwork is over until if there's a civil marriage until the Civil marriage is registered so that they would not fall into any problems in the future because it had happened so many times that the people are so Hasty in completing the marriage contract they feel that they can trust each other so the father says to the man I give you my daughter in marriage and he says I accept and and all of this in the presence of witnesses so now she's islamically his wife he goes with the woman sleeps with her for a night or two and then all of a sudden they discover that his intention was not correct so he fled he leaves her without a divorce without any support financially and when once she's pregnant and she delivers she tries to register the children in her name in her father in their father's name and the government says you don't have any marriage contract how can we say that this child belongs to that man she says yeah but I married him they say you didn't marry him and you didn't register that in the court or as a civil marriage or in with the government so we can't prove that he's the father and a lot of problems took place that is [Music] why it is the custom that the marriage or the wedding that's wedding does does not take place until the house of the man is ready where he can take his wife and live there the paperwork uh uh paperwork is all finished it's um yeah and all the formalities are done only then he could take his wife and inshallah uh continue or complete the marriage [Music]"
