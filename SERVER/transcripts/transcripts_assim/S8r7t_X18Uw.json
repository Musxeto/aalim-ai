  "title": "Punishment for Adultery / Fornication (Zina) in Islam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Abdallah says what is the punishment and expiation for adultery zina well as for the punishment there is a prescribed punishment in this life and there is a prescribed punishment in the hereafter without doubt fornication and adultery is one of the heinous and major sins in Islam and allah azza wajal associated zina with shirk and murder as in surat al-furqan however the punishment differs so if a person fornicates this means that he is not married and was not married before and this is sort of cold in Islam as a virgin so a man or a woman who have not who has not married in their life they are considered to be virgins even if they committed adultery or fornication many times still this they're still classified as virgin because in Islam we have virgin and we have Fayed a thigh hip is a woman usually a person who is either married has been married whether divorced widowed or still married he's considered to be a failure in Islam if a virgin commits fornication and that person he or she are caught or is caught red-handed and red-handed means that for male Muslim witnesses saw the actual act and they can graphically describe what they had seen specifically in detail or a person confesses so it's one of the two we don't refer to DNA we don't believe in video footage it has to be four eyewitnesses male and Muslims or a confession so if a person was caught red-handed his punishment would be to be flogged a hundred lashes and this is only for a virgin but if a person is not a virgin a person is a failure someone who is married or was previously married divorced or widowed then this person if he or she commits adultery the punishment if caught red-handed again with four witnesses or a confession is to be stoned till death and this is the only sin in Islam that the punishment is to stone and nowadays a lot of not a lot but most Muslim countries refer to execution there are normal ways of execution through decapitating or beheading that criminal one would say isn't stoning barbaric the answer is no because the one who mandated it is allah azza wajal so Allah is the most merciful and he knows what's best not for these two who committed this hideous sin rather for the whole of the community that chastity would prevail instead of having men and women running around after one another and stoning is not a first in Islam if you open the Old Testament in the Bible you will find it filled with stoning for many many sins so if a bull attacks a man the bull is stoned to death if a man fornicates with the daughter of the priest they're stoned to death if a man insults the king he's stoned to death if a person is not obedient to his parents the elders take him to the outskirts of the city and they stone him to death and so on in Islam it's the only hideous sin that is punished by stoning and Allah says Allah knows best"
