  "title": "When is a person not accountable for his actions? Child made oath, must he expiate? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the prophet said that the pen of accountability has been uplifted over three categories of people meaning that they're not held accountable on the day of judgment for what they had done a person who's asleep until he wakes up so someone who's asleep and while sleeping he would shout oh my wife I divorce you I divorce you I divorce you is this a valid divorce answer is no if he says words of kufur or shirk while asleep he's not accountable because he's not in the state of Sanity that Allah holds him accountable for the second category is someone who's insane until he regains his sanity someone who is classified as a wacko he's insane mentally unstable and he goes and breaks things is he accountable no yes his Guardian has to pay for what he'd had damaged but is he sinful the answer is no and the third is a child until he reaches the age of puberty so if a child swears or says words of kufur he's not accountable because he is not saying yet or he has not reached the age of puberty where Allah would hold him accountable and likewise if he swears not to do something are we obliged to tell him to go and expiate the answer is no because he's not accountable for his actions and hence expiation is not due for him and Allah Knows Best"
