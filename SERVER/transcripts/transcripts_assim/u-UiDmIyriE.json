  "transcript": "so Haley says can you kindly explain this hadith above all of the allahu anhu said i heard the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam say this world is cursed and what is in it is cursed except the remembrance of allah the vicar and what is conducive to it or to that or one who has knowledge or who acquires knowledge the hadith is a clear discrediting of the life we live in yes it's glamorous it's beautiful we enjoy it we strive to attain it from all means possible we enjoy life there's no doubt about it yet the Prophet in this hadith is highlighting effect that whatever you see is like a mirage whatever you see it's like quicksand it looks normal but without knowing you're gonna fall into it and end up somewhere unpleasant why is that because Allah created this life we live in as a test every single individual in this world is being tested from the person who is on the top of the list of the 100 Forbes richest men in the world to the poorest peasant beggar person in the dumpsters of the poorest country of the world both are being tested so the Prophet is highlighting the this fact and telling us this dunya is mal Runa Melora means cursed which means that Allah so Jill has cursed it that Allah has kept it away from his mercy this is one meaning and the other meaning is that it is this be putable something that is unwanted and this is the most highly authentic meaning of it Allah did not curse this life we live in Allah gave it to us and this life is not cursed for itself but rather for what it leads to so you tell me that if I spend my life worshipping Allah doing good staying away from Haram that my life is cursed on earth definitely not and this is why why the Prophet made an exception so it is disreputable except for whatever includes remembering of Allah which means all forms of worship setting the Quran making they care and whatever gains or helps you in gaining or acquiring knowledge about Islam so whatever you do in learning the Quran tuffsy Arabic hadith Sunnah anything that gets you closer to allah azzawajal from these Islamic Sciences then this is exempted now having said that we as stated earlier explained that cursed here means distributable and that the Prophet is encouraging us not to allow this world that we live in to live in our hearts rather to have it in the palm of our hands whenever we need we give it out away and we won't find any burden or harm from releasing it because it wasn't in our hands but when it's in your heart detaching it would become very painful if not fatal and this is how most people look at this dunya and have this intimate relationship with they're attached to it and they cannot leave it and this is why when Death Comes it's the most difficult thing for them to leave something they love and cherish to leave something that they belong to for them the unseen we don't know what's going to happen and this is why death becomes so painful for them and may lead to a bad ending may allah azzawajal protect us all"
