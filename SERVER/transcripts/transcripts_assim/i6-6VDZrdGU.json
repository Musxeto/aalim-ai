  "transcript": "people this is what concerns me and I don't want to waste more of your time Muhammad from Pakistan uh uh my question is that you said that you said that uh wiping the face after Dua is a but uh and the had of Abu Abu is but but but my question is that in a book of IM alkari Hadith number 609 is is saying thatd and abdah WIP their faces after making Dua this Hadith is not authentic this is not authentic again even if it's in it's not so this is not authentic and what we do as Muslims we follow the prophet Alat actions if it was authentic that the companions did this after making Dua we can take it and we can leave it because we could say that they had made and those who follow them we don't say you're wrong if the Hadith is authentic but the Hadith my knowledge is not authentic and Allah Knows Best"
