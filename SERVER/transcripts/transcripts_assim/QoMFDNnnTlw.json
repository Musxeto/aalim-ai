  "title": "She has OCD and constantly thinks she broke her wudu - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Mutulu says that she is an OCD and every single noise she hears she thinks that she broke her wood oh and she goes and performs wood Oh again and this happens gazillions of times she is always anxious so then she convinces herself that even if it's actual then it's incontinence and her prayer is valid but she feels extremely traumatized to repeat so she repeats prayer over and over again what should she do she must not allow herself to fold in the traps of Shaytan if she's OCD she must ignore these noises unless she's certain the Prophet said that is Aslam one must not leave his prayer and if he feels something in his stomach unless he hears a noise truely hears a noise all finds a scent or an odor or smell so if you did not it's just the Espace the whispers of Shaitaan you must fight this and convince yourself that nothing had happened and the more you do this the lesser pressure you would get from Shaitaan to force you to leave your prayer and may Allah so gel cure your OCD"
