  "title": "🆕 Listening Echo in Quran Haram? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Brother Munib from the US. I have a question. I've heard that the audio of Quran recitation in which an echo is heard is prohibited to listen to. Is this correct? How strong is the echoing? If the echoing is going to cause the Quran to be intermingled together and you don't know what is being said because of one word is being inserted in the other, غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ This is not befitting of the Quran. But if it's normal echoing, ضَالِّينِ, this is okay. There's nothing wrong in that. This is the type of sound effects found in the vast majority of masjids. But to put such sound effects into effect where the Quran is intermingled and you aren't able to focus when the Imam is reading because when he's reading live the fourth word, you're listening to the second word being echoed. So this distracts you from understanding the Quran. This is totally prohibited and haram and Allah Azzawajal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah Azzawajal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
