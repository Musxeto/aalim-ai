  "title": "Are we sinful for sexual fantasies? & types of discharges | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "uh from the u.s i have two questions please yes first question uh if a woman deliberately brings sexual thoughts in her mind and as a result emits something does this break her fast and is she simple for this okay as for the first question a man or a woman who fantasize sexual thoughts now scholars have differed schools of thought said that he's sinful all the way because he's bringing these thoughts to himself other school of thought said no we have the principle which is mentioned by the prophet islam that allah has forgiven has pardoned my um for my sake for whatever intrusive thoughts that they have as long as they do not talk about it or act upon it this means that if a person is sitting and he fantasizes or he thinks of his boss and say i wish i can smack him in the face and beat the heck out of him if he sees a woman that is a gorgeous beautiful woman crossing the streets and he looks at her he's sinful for this first gaze but if thoughts go into his mind and he doesn't talk about it and he doesn't act upon it he is not sinful for such thoughts because the prophet had told us allah has pardoned our ummah for his sake now the question is what if this person man or woman had discharge we know that there are different types of discharge that come out of a person's private parts so for a woman it's either vaginal discharges which are 24 7 continuous coming and the most authentic opinion is that this is pure and does not nullify wudu it takes the same ruling as sweat it just comes out there is what is known as urine and urine breaks your wudu and it snatches there is also what is known as methi prosthetic fluid and this comes whenever someone is in situations of intimacy flirting or thinking about sexual thoughts this methi or prosthetic fluid is emitted this breaks wudu and it is negis the other type of discharge is what is known as semen many and this is recognized by coming out in a gushing fashion not stealthly not slowly but it comes out in a gushing fashion accompanied with a feeling of sensation and lust and this obligates upon the person who ejaculated it to perform a major ritual uh russell to uplift his major ritual impurity known as rusul and he would be in the state of jennaba until he performs that so this depends on what type of discharge a woman gets but to answer the first question or the first part of the question these thoughts intrusive thoughts are not sinful are they recommended shaykh no of course not it's best for you to stop it because satan may utilize them not in the near future but later on when he starts building scenarios in your head if i did this if he did this if she did that and then it would make one's evil soul look up to it and say when would that happen so this is definitely not a good thing to do"
