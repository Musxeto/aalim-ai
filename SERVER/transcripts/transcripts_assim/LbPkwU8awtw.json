  "transcript": "my question is about thinking about Allah let's in prayer usually when I'm praying I think about let's say heaven and ask in my heart Allah to give it to me or hell and ask Allah for me to to put me away from it or like I think about the of Allah or talking to Allah directly in my heart saying that he is the Malik and so on but sometimes when I did a scene let's say for example and I'm standing in prayer it just keeps on coming back and coming back and coming back in my head uh maybe I try to formulate a question that I have to ask you and so on I just keep think about it and I'm wondering if that is okay to think about that or it should be completely disregarded until I I'm finish the prayer No it should not be included in your prayer these are worldly matters that you are thinking of formulating a question or doing this or that no you should devote your prayer to contemplating upon the greatness of Allah revering Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala also you should be contemplating upon the meanings of the verses of the Quran and the inv occs you're doing the T and the likes in the Salat"
