  "transcript": "so his third question brother Najib a person who became transgender meaning that originally he was male and then he went to the doctor took hormone procedures or whatever and made a surgery to himself and became a she in a sense and changed his name into a female's name etc then accepted Islam so what is the deal with this individual first of all such operations are not permissible in Islam the only way that it can be permissible is when an individual has the embedded organs of a gender that he's not actually holding or he has both so a child or a man who has both organs or he has embedded organs of a female and the doctors say that this person is originally a female in this case yes it can be given to him hormonal procedures and medications until he corrects his gender to the right one but a person who is a normal man or a normal woman and just wanting to change to the opposite gender this is totally prohibited and not accepted so what would this woman so-called code and code do because she is now a woman originally her name was John now she's Jeannette so what can we do with her after she accepts Islam we tell her the glad tiding Allah forgives all of your previous sins so now you are a clean book and your your your sheet is white there is not a stain on it but you are still John you're still a man even if you underwent the hormonal transformation even if you did the surgery you're still considered to be a man reverse it if you can the surgery I don't think it can be reversed but at least you have to look like a man act like a man and be with men and may allah azza wajal make it easy upon such individuals Aishah sent a question she says how to make pollute in Witter and can we recite our own doors in our own language as Connaught or any other doors from the Quran the scholars generally speaking say that Canute in Witter is a place and a location for DRA and other scholars may expand a little bit so they say that in Recor it's a place of dua between the two such there is a place of dry the most authentic opinion is that Institute is the best place for you to make dua or before concluding your salat with Salam after the salutation of the Prophet Elisha Salam until the actual conclusion of your prayer this is a gap or a time or a place where it is highly recommended for you to make time what about Knut who note in whitter this was reported by Al Hasan ibn Ali may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he was a child of seven or eight years of age he came to the Prophet Ali salatu salam and imagine this child of six seven or eight years of age coming to his grandfather and saying to him o prophet of allah teach me a dua i should recite in Knut so the Prophet taught him at is awesome ilaha medina femen had eight the short draw we know of so the scholars say that this is appropriate for you to do in in whitter there's no problem in that because the hadith is authentic yet other scholars have expanded a bit so some said that you can say other as well and these are the majority of the scholars say you can add good doers with good meanings which means that if a person States or says Dora from the Koran robbing a TNF in dunya Hansen or fidelity has a know Kannada but not as good if someone says do as from the Sunnah Elohim and they all do become in a hammy or has an ISIL castle this is great if someone has other types of dua and he makes it and forms it there is no problem in that none whatsoever but to say it in other languages it's an issue of dispute among scholars it seems to me that if a person does not know how to make the draw in Arabic there is no problem in saying it in his native language so you want to ask Allah for forgivness everyone knows how to say Allah mother fiddly but you want to ask a lot so a gel to grant your child recovery from its illness whoa this is too much I don't know how to say that in Arabic say it in your own language no problem do I say it in connote it's an issue of dispute I personally prefer that you restrict your dua to what is known in the unit of whitter and preferably to make it as short as possible what we see in Ramadan people and Imams doing it for like half an hour or 45 minutes this is too much this is more closer to a clear innovation than a preferred time for draw what are you looking for you want a lot to respond to you do it in your sujood and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
