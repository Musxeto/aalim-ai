  "title": "A woman refusing intimacy with her husband",
  "transcript": "This is Sophia from Niger. She says, \"What's the ruling of for the woman who rejects having an intimate relationship with her husband?\" Any woman who rejects having intimacy with her husband without any legitimate reason, the angels curse her from the time she goes to bed until she wakes up in the morning. Subhan Allah. And allahel is angry with her because she has no legitimate reason. And the husband needs this intimacy. He is exposed to so many things when he goes out in the street in the market at the workplace and so many uh uh fitness around calling him luring him to sin. So he has to discharge and he has to have the comfort and the love of his wife. And if he's unable to have this, the reason is this wife who is refusing without any legitimate reason. So she is sinful. See, she is cursed by the angels and allahel is not pleased."
