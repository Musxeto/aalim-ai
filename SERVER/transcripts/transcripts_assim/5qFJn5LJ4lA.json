  "title": "Can I give zakat to my grandparents? (People I'm obliged to provide for) - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay so my question is can we give zakat to grandfather meaning the father of my mother this is the scholars say that those whom your obliged to provide for you cannot give them zakat so my wife and my children and my grandchildren and my parents and my grandparents are those whom are immediately related to me and I must provide for them if I have money and hence if one of them is poor I cannot give them from the zakat money yes I can give my uncles I can give my cousins I can give my far neighbors or relatives no problem but these specifically my wife the children and whether they go down or the parents whether they go up they are my responsibility and cannot be given from zakat and Allah Knows Best"
