  "transcript": "sh uh eight around eight or nine years ago when I was a cfir alhamdulillah for being guided I had a non-muslim girlfriend and I can't remember if I gave her a plain bracelet or a bracelet which things dangle off which people don't um signify that like for example Hearts they don't signify it with a repelling uh like anything evil or if I gave her a bracelet which had dangling off that people associate with repelling evil which is shik Shake is this me overthinking or uh because I can't remember or should I investigate and see if I've given people gifts in the past which are not allowed and then you know enjoying good and for bid evil because even a friend of mine a guy friend who I don't speak to anymore I gave him a watch can't remember if it was gold or silver but the strap was burgundy so is this just me overthinking or should I go and investigate um well ja this is you overthink thinking in addition to Satan marinating these thoughts in your head to make a good meal out of it whatever you had done in the past as a Catholic or as a disbeliever or as a cafir has no impact on your life today being a revert being a Muslim erases all what you have done in the past so this is a new chapter of your life you should disregard any such thoughts not think about it and move on with your life"
