  "transcript": "so Missy's first question was about her friends coming to perform Umrah but they'll go first to Medina and then take the train to Mecca can they wear their Aram from the hotel itself we have to differentiate between two important things one wearing the alam - entering in the state of Ihram what's the difference share I'll tell you what the difference is I take a shower make whistle I wear my lower wrapper or what they call it waste rapper or apron and I wear my Rida which is the upper towel now I'm wearing the harem but I did not intend to enter the state of AHA so while I'm wearing this a friend comes and said listen I bought this rude this perfume take a good look at it you want to smell it yeah yeah put some he puts it why it he said why are you doing what are you doing you're in that set of Harmsen no no I have not entered the city over ham actually I changed my mind I'm not going tonight I might get go next week I take it off and I've put my normal clothes no harm done no problem the second scenario is that if I do all of this and then I say lebec allahumma umbra intending that from now on I'm in the state of Aram and then I noticed that one of my nails is long so I bring a clipper to cut it off and then I'm in a harem I can't do that so can I go to the barber and fix my hair I cannot do that at me hum can I apply some perfume nope not now so this is different so for your friends to wear their harem without entering in the intention of the harm from their hotel there's no problem the Sunnah is once they reach a be our ally which is the motto of the of medina known as the Haleiwa and there are big signs everywhere when you come neck close to it and you can ask the driver who's driving you before we reach them in hot notify so that we can make Umrah if you do this then you are clear now some say wallahi I am afraid that I may get confused the driver does not understand me I may make a mistake and neglect making a harm after I pass them apart so can I make it from the hotel the answer is yes you can but this is not the proper way of doing it this is not the Sun and I hope this answers the question"
