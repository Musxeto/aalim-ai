  "title": "Can we do Istikhara without praying the 2 rakahs? What if a Woman is in her menses? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "quest she says can one do istikhara without the prayer the answer is no the hadith of estihara states specifically that you have to pray two raka's which are not from the farida so it can be sunnah or it can be doha it can be night prayer it can be whatever two raka's that are not mandatory and then you say the dua so these are two related but when a person is in extreme situations such such as a woman who is on her menses she cannot pray in this case she's exempted from prayer and she can make that durability"
