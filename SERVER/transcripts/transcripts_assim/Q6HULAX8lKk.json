  "transcript": "um we'll take questions and answers now from the audience you'll take the answers from them as well sorry the questions from the audience and the answers from the inah if um the brothers have questions please raise your hand um and we'll ask the sisters if they can write them down inshallah and leave them to the left um they'll be read out to the s this is a um a common misconception among Muslims a lot of the Muslims refuse to memorize the Quran and when you ask them why they say because if I forget Allah will punish me and this is not true forgetfulness is something that is human nature so you memorize the Quran if you forget it no problem try to memorize it again if you can't or if you don't want to no problem the problem is in neglecting the Quran so you can memorize the whole Quran but you don't do anything that the Quran tells you you're doomed in hell but if you don't memorize a single verse except F and short verses but you apply each and every command in the Quran you're in the of the people in Paradise so forgetting a verse is not sinful because you did not do it uh uh deliberately intentionally if you can uh uh memorize it again alhamdulillah if you can't no problem the problem is in not doing what these verses are telling you to do this an issue of dispute among Scholars whether the listening is the same as reciting or not some say visualizing it and reading it with your vision is more uh rewardable because it helps you concentrate more but if you can listen and contemplate and Ponder if you have the same reward the prophet himself Alam requested this from abdah as we as you all know thei in theah when he came to abdah and said recite the Quran to me and abdah said prophet of Allah the Quran was revealed to you you want me to recite it he said yes I'd like to listen to it from someone else so he began witha until he reached the Ayah number 40 where Allah says that how is it when we bring all the nations on the day of judgment and we we bring you as a witness on all all of them the prophet said that's enough he says I looked at him and I saw the prophet weeping because of of of of uh these beautiful verses so yes if you Ponder listening does the job but unfortunately we all know we may Ponder in the first and second verse and then our mind shifts and drifts in in different valleys not like when you re read it and recite it then you go back and back to the verses that you missed an knows best which is okay [Music] as for the first question the Allah says don't ask me to translate this because it is not easy I have to read it from the translation but it says that whoever turns his back to my reminders and remembering me then Allah would give him a very tight and narrow life and on the day of judgment he would be resurrected blind so Scholars say that there are two punishments for those who reject Allah's reminders and Allah's words the first punishment is in this life where he will be depressed he would feel that his chest is so narrow and small that he is about to explode and this is extremely clear we can see this in the disbelievers we can see this in the Believers who are sinful as for the disbelievers they are the most depressed people on Earth they hide this depression by taking tranquilizers and these tranquilizers can be watching movies and sinful Muslims as well yeah lots of the Muslims who are not practicing they have to take these tranquilizers otherwise they would feel lost the minute they get into the car they turn on the music if they go into the house immediately to the TV set watching soap opras watching movies watching this and that blackbusters they go to the uh uh cinema theaters they spend their time in socializing mixed Gatherings they do things that prevent them from thinking and challenge anyone of them to sit in a room for half an hour without any iPods iPads uh laptops TV screens without anything that engages them in in in in in doing something that prevents them from thinking just tell them to to sit idle for half an hour they'll go crazy seriously I know a friend who refused to ride in his car and I said why are you not going to your car I said the uh tape recorder is not working I tried to go to work and 5 minutes I almost went crazy all what I hear is the tires and people honking me and and I'm unable to concentrate so I just left the car until it's repaired and I got a taxi there used to occupying their thinking either by reading a newspaper reading a novel reading a magazine watching something listening to something this is the depression they have a Believer does he have this does a does a Believer get depressed never Allah says in those who believe and their hearts are find its Tranquility in Remembering Allah by remembering Allah on the day of judgment they will be resurrected blind because on this life they were blind not cited But Blind in their chest they did not have the ability to distinguish right from wrong or they did not want to distinguish right from wrong so this is roughly what the verses are and in the end this is a punishment for you because my verses came to you my signs came to you and you forgot it in the sense that you've neglected it not forgot it in the sense that you used to memorize it and then you forgot it no in the sense that you've neglected it and that is why Allah has has punished him uh in this fashion as for your second question the boys who go to Quran to memorize the Quran two days a week Allah grant them the greatest reward they are much much better than those who don't go at all so you want them to do it full-time 7 days a week and then after 6 months or a year they flunk in their schools and then they don't even have Quran and they don't have schools no balance is the greatest character of Islam to be balanced so if someone tells me listen she I want to stay in the Masjid and spend s uh uh uh 24/7 all of my time I want to spend it in the Masjid and have a long prayer bead of 1,000 you know beads and say Subhan Allah Subhan alhamdulillah alhamdulillah and then say Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah Allah like these people who do is this permissible so definitely not where will you eat from said oh charity Allah would grant me risk like maram whenever Zakaria came where did you get this is from Allah so inshah maybe change my name toam you never know Allah would this is not permissible this is Haram you have to work you have to be productive okay she then I'm working 16 hours a day I've got meetings after meetings I travel a lot I don't see my children I don't I barely pray sometimes I pray all the five prayers at the end of the day because I'm working I'm trying to be productive I'm trying to do something for the society this is Haram you have to take care of your health of your kids of your prayer of your Dean so he says okay she I'm spending eight hours in the gym I'm taking uh steroid anabolic steroids and you know hormones and doing power lifting and uh all of these bench presses and Mah I I I jog 12 miles a day and bike like 15 miles and roll like couple of rivers and Mah I'm in the fittest shape I've ever been but definitely I don't pray I don't see my kids I don't see my this is Haram and someone says I'm 247 with my kids I homeschool uh uh them and I go with them to the park and we spend a lot of time together and I never attend because it would take me away from my kids I never go to lectures I don't recite the Quran well I I don't care about my cholesterol level or high blood pressure or my diabetes because I have to be with my kids I don't I'm they love me I love them this is wrong Islam is a religion of balance when Salman Al far may Allah be pleased with him visited Abu D his brother when they migrated the prophet made them brothers he saw that he sleeps he he he prays all night and he fasts all day so he told him this is not the right way of doing it you should sleep and pray you should fast and break your fasting he said four or five phrases that are so beautiful that the prophet said it also to abdah and it is in theah what did Salman say he said Abu D Allah has rights over you your wife has rights over you your body has rights over you your guest has rights over you so give each one its due right so if you manage to do this you are the perfect Muslim once you manage to balance yourself to take care of yourself of your body of your health of your children of your wife of your work of your religion of your fasting and praying then you have made it inshallah and Allah Knows Best um just to come into some of the questions from the sisters in um one of the sisters has asked with regards to memorizing the Quran I have difficulty with memorizing sometimes what methods do you recommend I can use in order to memorize and are there any Dua I can make or I can recite in order to help my memorization as for the Dua I don't know any specific Dua a lot of the brothers send me questions she uh my my sister is unable to get married can you give us some Dua the prophet did not specify uh uh uh certain duas for this for that I know that there are some you know Innovative uh books say for getting a husband for getting a wife for getting a child for buying a new car for uh polishing your shoes they have a certain Dua but all of these are innovated the prophet gave us certain duas that we all know but if I have something like this to memorize the Quran I ask Allah generally so when in prostration before fan before offering Salam from the prayer after T I ask Allah oh Allah grant me the ability to memorize your Quran General Dua alham that does the job how what is the best way of doing it it it's there's not one size that fits all it different it's different from one person to the other but the best means of doing it generally speaking is repetition you hear it you repeat it on and on and on again but there's no one shot that you take andd I managed to take Mah I took another one and Mah half of the Quran I wish they were but there isn't and Allah knows rest question basically you know what you don't have time to PR there is not such a thing as you don't have time to pray you have time to go to the L if you have 110 or 120 when it calls you're going Allah's call see are you talking about praying in the Masjid the prophet about work work you you don't have coffee breaks we have coffee breaks basically we have we have okay so uh meanwhile can't you take 5 minutes Gap and pray you can they say they say I have to go to the loop tell them I have to go to the L go and and pray in 5 minutes it doesn't take time see whenever there's a there's a way and your priority is your prayer there is no excuse for you not to pray on time at all and the prophet told usat that the Allah has given me and Favored Me with five uh uh characteristics that no Prophet has been given among them is that Earth has been made to me a place of worship and means of purification so whomever uh uh um the prayer time is due he should pray whatever he is so even if you are in a classroom or you have to take care of the kids from 12 till 1:45 you can spare 5 minutes and go and pray four raas without praying the sunah the four before sometimes we exaggerate no no no I have to take the four sunnas before and then I have to give aan and then I have to give and then I have to pray the four and then I have to pray two afterwards and then make my it would be time so don't take the whole nine yards just do what Allah instructed you to do the four the four mandatory prayers and inshallah Allah will make a way out um another question from the sisters inshallah um with regards to um education which was mentioned by the earlier the balance of Education a question from the sisters is it permissible to neglect education without being of University to educate oneself in religion and how much H does education dun education have upon the Muslims dun education has zero rights over you you need to learn what makes you a normal human being I am zero in physics zero in mathematics zero in calculus zero in not zero in chemistry maybe two in chemistry I I know nothing about the standard uh uh School subjects my girls come to me and say Daddy can you explain this no he said you didn't look said I don't have to I don't know what's written in in the fourth level it's all different than what I started to uh uh study hundreds of years ago but what is your obligation as a Muslim is it in the Quran or in the that you have to study you do your o levels and a levels and E levels I don't know about your educational system no however it is a communal obligation because whenever all of us sit back and say okay alhamdulillah we don't need to be Physicians we don't need to be chemists we don't need to be doctors we don't need to be mathematicians we'll sit back and relax all of us will be sinful so it is not something that all of us must do and it's not something that all of us must not do it depends so if a person finishes his what is high school a level J what he said if someone finishes it and does not want to go to university and he says I want to study religion but think a little bit beyond your nose what will happen in 3 4 years time time if you're a a man will you be able to collect money and get married would you have a job do you have another source of income is your father Rich mashallah if the answer is yes go ahead definitely and take me as a teacher I'll guide you all the way but if you're not and if you are taking allowance from the government benefits and you're lying and you're saying that I'm not married and you're married so that both of you can have it both ways and and you do this and you do that and you bend the rules a little bit and you break them a little bit this is definitely a major sin and it's Haram so it depends on what you are going to do you have to plan your life now you are young said no I want to study Shar I have M go ahead do that but what will you do in five years time because I've seen people going to Medina studying Shar coming back not finding a suitable job I don't want to work as an Imam it doesn't pay I am I'm young I'm 24 years old I'd like to drive a Ferrari one day and being a im if you get uh a bicycle alhamdulillah that's good it does from 0 to 60 like in 3 hours or so so you have to look deep down your sincerity your ability to tolerate and and to be patient because seeking knowledge is not an easy thing so if you want to make it a way of life if you want to make it a profession if you want to make a career yes go ahead providing that you can live up to it but if you if you know yourself that I can't I have to take a Big Mac every now and then and my job as an Imam doesn't allow me to to buy from McDonald's chill and do your gccf W whatever um taking another question from the sisters um ear on you mentioned in the lecture um that those who have memorized the Quran and do not apply it can be and should be judged does this is this the same for those that have only memorized a few aat of the Quran can I say they should be judged this is what the question says I ask me about something I said I didn't say they should be judged I say those who memorize the Quran and do not act upon it they are I'm not judging them they are judging themselves if someone memorizes the Quran he sheats and he lies do you know people who are practicing and lie do you know yes a lot a lot I know a lot of bearded people who lie and I know that they are not practicing they're growing the beard because Gillette is too expensive to buy nowadays so what the heck leave it no but I'm talking about those who who memorize the Quran someone who memorizes the Quran every single day I go to the Masjid in F he doesn't pray and he lives next door do I have to judge him I don't have to judge him I don't label people it's not my job Allah would not hold me questionable in the day of judgment why didn't you say this brother is so and so why didn't you lab with him this is not my job but I'm telling you to look into yourself not to look around you if you memorize the Quran and you're not practicing if you memorizing the Quran and you're lying then you have a big problem and you should be judged by people not for it's not an invitation from me for us to go and sit back and take you know a pen and paper and say nope no I look at his throwers below the ankles no that's good and I I keep on Crossing everyone in the room and the only one who remains is me no this is the wrong way of treating others and and and looking down at others and this is is a sign of arrogance and Allah knows best um coming on to another question from the sisters insh um I'm worried I don't have the correct Taj and I'm unable to take classes currently therefore should I still try to memorize or should I correct my Taj first you should continue to memorize this is from the Shan he is trying to prevent you from memorizing the Quran and he would say no you have to take tajid lessons and you find people going into tajid lessons spending like ours on saying no no no do it again what is this you end up seeing people in the tube doing what what is this this is insane this is not the Quran okay this is a level that Arabs who are so good in memorizing the Quran they want Perfection but remember the prophet said that the majority of the Hypocrites of my umah are those who are the reciters of the Quran imagine the majority of the Hypocrites in my umah are the reciters of the Quran why because they show off they use it as a means of showing off and whenever they pray or recite the Quran they try to beautify it as much as possible so that people would say Allah this is Salam it what is this it's is it a song you're doing this Allah so people don't think correctly when it comes to the Quran memorize the Quran understand study it Ponder on the beautiful verses of Allah and meanwhile try to perfect your so to take one of the questions from the online viewers um one of the online viewers has asked um if one is currently studying University how would you advise them to memorize the Quran I.E how much to give a day how much to aim to finish a week etc etc I don't know it depends on your time don't always depend on people to tell you when to eat and when to sleep and when to do this or to do that you are a person who is mashallah have your your your intellect you are studying in the University you're doing m a lot of activities in your life you are the one to organize your time some may find the best time of memorizing the Quran after F when the head is clear and everybody's asleep and there's no much there isn't a lot of activities around some say no after is the best time some prefer to do it before they go to bed so it depends from one person to the other and again we go back to the issue of balance if you have 4 hours free in your day then you should utilize it in memorizing portion of it that is uh the Quran and revising because memorizing is easy I know a lot of people who can in 10 minutes memorize two pages of the Quran and they can read it to you of the memory come tomorrow they cannot even remember one Ayah so the most important thing not me is not memorizing is revising it and that is why the prophet wasallam said keep on studying the Quran and revising it because it it escapes as the camels escape from their ropes when you tie a camel it can pull itself out and and and leave and the Quran leaves this quick everyone who memorizes the Quran knows this that you spend so much time on memorizing the Quran until you master the Surah masallah one month later you start finding uh loopholes and and you you've forgot some verses you keep on re revising it and revising it and you master it again and it keeps on slipping so you have to uh uh revise it on and on I'm taking another question from the online views um within your lecture you mentioned that particular chapters with in the Quran have particular benefits to them for example is a protection from the punishment of the Grave f is a healing are there any others which you could expand on yes there there are a lot for example Surah Bak kicks Shan away from the house Al is a testament or a declaration from uh uh kufur because it shows that you are choosing a way other than the is oneir of the Quran as the prophet said there are lots and lots of suras that have benefits but there are also lots and lots of suras that are fabricated the Hadith in them for example whoever recites it he would not be poor this is definitely a fabricated Hadith uh and and and we find that countries of Muslims recite it every night and they sell poor so it's clear evidence surahman is the Bride of the Quran this is also not authentic the Hadith of recite Surah Yin over your dead is not authentic uh if you check Islam Q&A and and write the virtues of the Quran or chapters of the Quran you will find inshallah a list of of the authentic hadiths any questions from the brothers I'm going back to the questions from the sisters is it permissible to hold and read the Quran during a woman's men cycle it's an issue of dispute among Scholars whether it's per permissible for a woman in her menis to hold the Quran the majority of Scholars say say that it is not permissible albani however uh following the opinion of ibim may Allah have mercy on their souls say that there isn't a clear evidence that prevents a woman from doing so therefore I do not have the guts to though Alban's allegation is very strong I do not have the guts to go against the majority and say it's okay especially nowadays when women have Alternatives so they can read the Quran from their laptops from their PCS from their iPads from their pdas from their mobile phones and all of this does not require Purity even if they have the menes even if they're not in the state of wo they can recite it if a woman does not have all the mentioned above then she is requested if it is uh uh she's in need to recite the Quran she cannot read it from a commentary of the Quran for example K or whatever if she doesn't have any of the above in this case when she recites the Quran she should not touch the verses She should only touch the edges of the Quran itself preferably with a glove if she doesn't have a glove then she she may touch the edges of the pages and this is inshallah would be a compromise between those who say she should not touch it at all and those who say she is allowed to to do the whole nine yards and Allah knows rest any questions from the brothers the pen is not big enough you said the story about the Pagan leader who was sick yes how did they actually do it no no no he the Hadith is clear stating that he used to recite the and blow no touching and a lot of the those who do they do touching this is wrong especially with the opposite sex this is Haram you know a woman goes to a she and say I have Jin I have so and and and they recite Quran and they sometimes touch the woman and this is Haram this is forbidden even for touching the Quran and there are so many people who are imposters and you go to someone and says yes you have this and that and it's an old woman in the family who did this and and they come to and ask me I say what is this is it a monitor that he plugs it in and says oh you have evil eye and ISS this and that The Cure it's not nothing like this it's a recitation of the Quran and if there's a means of healing that person would be healed but to go into details and say no it's a a black magic and black sorcery and it's an old woman in mid 70s she did this and uh it's been placed in a place uh behind the fireplace you have to excavate and look into it how did they know this they themselves are dealing with Shin so this Sheikh you went to is definitely not a a Sheikh and I hope this answer the question though I forgot the question what was the question how how you like say now pain yeah yeah for you it's a different issue altogether if I want to do for myself I usually and I I do this I I once got an evil eye on the spot and the man was upstairs and he gave me evil eye I used to play Squash a lot and I had I was a little bit too good and I was playing my third game and the manager of the club came and said I'd like to take a photo while playing so that we would advertise for the club and I said I don't want to said it's not Haram I said I didn't say Haram I am an IM of a Masjid and I don't like them see me you know jumping from one place to the other and say this is our Sheikh so thank you and I went into the court and I to continue my third game I was warmed up I was fit masallah I was young and he came up from the balcony and he said yeah I'd like to take a picture and I said there will be other guys coming in 5 minutes time take the picture he said by Allah I did not see anyone play like you I said no about 15 seconds later my knee cracked I heard something everybody heard something and I fell down on the ground I blacked out that was in 94 when I came last here uh uh to and I started reciting Quran they tried to pull it said no one touches it and immediately it became this big seriously literally this big and I could not walk I was carried home I went to the hospital the doctor could not touch it not do examine it they did so many X-rays and they said it's there's nothing wrong in it so I said okay what's the explanation one of the doctors a practicing brother he said this is this is evil eye so I started reciting three times to five times in the morning in the afternoon and before I go to bed on Zam Zam I drink most of it and I put few of drops and I wipe on it three months alhamdulillah strong as a horse nothing everyone I tell him to do this they do it and they're cured of their illnesses so this is one way of doing it if you have an illness in your body may Allah be pleased with him in Muslim I went to the prophet complaining of chest pain and the prophet told me to put my hand where it hurts from my body and say three times and then say seven times memorize it and he said I did this and Allah believe me W I've said it so many times I don't remember on different parts of my body aching crazy alhamd so this is different when I'm making Rya to the brother or to my children some people say you have to hold their head no if I'm making a r for him I just blow recite and blow without touching but if it's for yourself no you recite it in your palms of your hands as the prophet used to do whenever he wanted to do R for himself he used to gather his hands and then wipe over the places or his entire body I hope this answers a question any other questions from the brothers I have just two questions she took sh but then she fell into depression and I don't know what she believes now what advice would you give to her and the second question is um what should one do if their family constantly keeps inviting them to Christmas and birthday parties what is r the first question is that this sister who accepted Islam and then fell into depression and Allah knows what she believes in well we give her the benefit of the doubt and consider her to be Muslim and treat her as such until we see something that proves that she's not and in this case we try to give her dawa we try to strengthen her IM and the biggest problem everywhere is that we do not have a follow-ups we're keen in inviting people to Islam and showing the beauty of Islam once they're convinced and Mah accept Islam kiss the baby good night go leave no one follows up no one keeps on trying to contact them once or twice a week take them out check out with them if they're learning the Quran answer their doubts and they're neglected so they go back and The Temptations are so huge and great in this country and everywhere else so you should give her proper dawa not you of course unless she's your Mah she's your sister or she's your aunt but if she's your cousin she she's your no this is not your job she someone of a same gender should do uh that and hope for the best give Dua make a lot of Dua and it's a very uh it's a custom among the Muslims nowadays to blame their failure to Jin evil eyee envy and uh black magic so if my daughter was not married and she's like 19 years old and until now she's not married ah this is black magic if my wife nags a lot she has Jin I know she has Jin but this is beside the point if my son I don't have sons if my daughter fails in in an exam so this is uh envy and if my car has a flat tire this is evil eye so we tend to blame and to put all our failures on these things don't even think of them as long as you do your as long as you believe in Allah and Trust in Allah nothing can H happen to you and Allah knows best what was the second question ah if people if your family keep on inviting you for Christmas and birthday uh uh uh parties what should you do keep on apologizing and not attending it will never stop and don't be rude they invite you because they love you and they think that they're doing a favor to you so don't be rude if they're Muslim is you know this is Haram this is not permissible you give them leaflets give them FAS if they're not musl Muslims tell them I would love to but it it goes against my religion and and you know this make it a way of Da but never be rud to them um just some clarification on the Dua you just mentioned with regards to told a person to recite just mentioned can you please repeat oh repeating it you sayah and then you say which translates to I seek The Refuge in Allah's pride and ability these are attributes of Allah and you cannot seek uh uh The Refuge of anything except in Allah and his attributes I seek Refuge from the evil that I find or I'm afraid of the evil of the things that I find that means the illness or what I'm afraid of it's narrated in Muslim um any questions from the brothers I'm going back to one of the questions from the sisters with regards to the um prayer um our College restricts us from praying us on time and don't let us out because a poet which assumed was a she told them it was permissable Jo to for them to join the prayer what are we supposed to do about praying our Salah on time they already know that students say I'm going to the toilet but really they're not they are watching us care how do we pray our on time change your school change your University if it's this uh uh type of monitoring and and and closing in onto you even to this to to the limit to the stage that if you want to go to the to the toilets n you don't going put your hand on your eye and swear that I'm not going to pray ass what is this no change your University or your school just leave because your prayer comes as a priority and nothing you cannot compromise with this at all any questions from Brothers I'm taking a question from one of the online Sal is far is the greatest prayer of uh all prayers there is a whole chapter of the Quran calleda so if you cannot pray it because you're working you have to change your work or you have to reach an agreement with your manager saying that I'm willing to come on Sundays I'm willing to work overtime the four days that is Monday Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday an extra hour to compensate but you cannot skip jum at all no excuse the prophet said Alam whoever skips three jumas consecutively Allah will seal his heart and the meaning of sealing the heart is that so many Muslims you see and you tell them Allah says in the Quran and the prophet says in the Hadith they tell you forget it they keep quiet don't say their hearts are sealed they will not accept it so this is the type of the ceiling that the majority of Muslims are under and you want so many times you wonder Subhan Allah Allah says this and Allah and the prophet says that and they're not complying why simple Allah seal their hearts and Allah knows best any more questions from the brothers you said don't scar of the Gin what do you do my brother come take in some feel a bit scared plus you don't know that muchan he's coming to you he's saying come because they're doing Ria and they they want to come as well join in but you feel a bit scared even you shouldn't be scared of you feel you don't know enough when I say that you should be should not be scared of the Jin that does not mean you should go and bring it on Bring the G on I'm I'm willing to do this where are they no this is a different situation completely you should not be scared of the Jin when you see them or when something happens but you don't go with your own foot to a place where they're doing what they call it in English exorcism yeah and you say I want to watch and what see what's happening yeah this is not realistic so if someone tells you come and let's do this or that tell him Z I don't want to and this is not fear of the Jin but this is not putting yourself In Harm's Way the prophet said whoever hears of the D he must run as far as possible possible from him and he did not say confront him and it's not logical for people to do da and put themselves In Harm's Way some people tell me that they do da in in nightclubs you know they go on Saturdays and when the people are coming out in their costumes and you know uh stoned or drunk or and they give them dawa what kind of dawa are you giving they they can't even know and understand what you're saying and you are putting yourself in temptation's way in some of the revers say I'm giving that I wish I could just have one glass of that of of this you're putting yourself in HS so it's okay not to accept such an invitation and um any question more questions from Brothers yes your J is valid as long as you pray one ra of it the prophet said whoever prays one ra of J he should add another ra to it and whoever misses the two rakas he should pray four so you know the Hadith of the Prophet who comes in the first hour as if he sacrificed a camel a cow a sheep a chicken an egg and when the Imam comes in the Angels fold their records and they sit to listen so there is no reward afterwards meaning sacrifice and throughout the you are supposed to come and listen but if you miss it your J is valid but definitely you're getting the very least of of the reward if you pray only one ra or two raas with the IM if you miss the whole prayer then you have missed the J any more questions from the brothers I'm going into question from the SS my workplace keeps changing my work shift keeps changing me to work different areas when it's time for prayer I get confused where is the where shall I face you have to face the you have to ask and now is all mobiles have Direction indicators and it's application in some phones it's free and in some phones it's you pay like a dollar or two peanuts even though we buy for like 10 or 15 piece uh uh you can get a compass that tells you where is the uh Southwest South East for the so you have no excuse not to know where the especially in a country country that is almost becoming Muslim Now everywhere M there's a Muslim who can tell you where the is any more questions from Brothers student launch Haram Haram full stop it's interest they're telling you this is £99,000 you have to pay interest providing that your income is after so many years you is your income is more than 20 20% something like this 20,000 at the end of the day it's Haram it's like signing on a some people try to you know uh uh Escape it say okay I'm going immediately afterwards overseas and I will not pay them uh uh this you will eventually come back 20 30 years later and you have to pay the interest so any agreement for paying such a riba which is a major sin is completely unacceptable going into one of questions from the online viewers with regards to um sisters going to University if there is not a necessity for the Sisters to go to university in a mixed environment ask your ask your shakes I come from Saudi Arabia my opinion as a Saudi is that it is not permissible for a woman to go to a mixed un University because she is not the bread earner men if they were forced to do this they have to do it so that the Muslims would be able to develop and progress in their careers but they have to stick to the Islamic boundaries for sisters my opinion and my opinion has no value in this country because I'm talking about my environment you have to ask your your your Scholars who know the environment more than do and they may have a different opinion my opinion is that it is not permissible unless one can guarantee 100% that there is no uh mixing it's completely segregated women are completely far away from kids from boys um but still you will be faced with so many things that go against Islam as students as teachers as work groups but again this is my don't ask me any last questions from the brothers okay um upon that inshallah we will uh conclude this evening's lecture I'd like to remind everyone this uh today's lecture is a part of the companions of the Quran da
