el alamein nabina muhammad anwar ali he was so happy he edged marine dear brothers and sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh the fifth year of hijra was one of the difficult years upon our prophet alayhi salatu salam and his companions that was the decisive year that was a turning point to Islam and the Muslims when the troops and armies of garage and rata fan wanted to attack Medina with the collaboration of banakar IVA the Jews and the Prophet erase salatu salam was advised by salman al Pharisee may allah be pleased with him salman the persian in order to counter-attack dis offensive he was advised to dig a trench round medina that would prevent them from marching in so they did that it took them quite some time in sided with a time of famine drought and great hunger among the Muslims due to a number of reasons mainly little resources of food at the time Jeremih abdullah may allah be pleased with him and with his father abdullah a harem who was martyred in a hood tells us about an incident which is one of so many and all these incidents were authenticated in Bihari in Muslim and in other books of hadith to the extent that they have reached the highest level of authenticity and this is called al mutata Jabbar tells us that for three days and nights we were digging the trench and we could not find a single thing to eat at the site and abu talha complained to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he exposed his belly telling the saying to the prophet i saw some that look we have tied a rock a big piece of stone to our stomachs so that we would not feel the hunger and it would help us walk straight the prophet sallallahu alaihi salam exposed his belly showing them two big pieces of rocks tied to his stomach jabber when he saw this he went straight to his home after seeking permission from the Prophet at least a lot of Sun because we know that that the outskirts of Medina it was twenty-four seven working on-site digging the trench before the Army's arrive so they were racing time and only the believers would seek permission to go for an errand for something they have to do while the hypocrites pretended to be there and then they would leave and sneak out without anyone seeing them so jabber got the permission from the prophet is also he went straight home and he saw his wife and complained to her the hunger that the prophet is suffering from a little Sam and how weary and tired he looks and he asked her do you have any food that we can offer to the prophet alayhi salatu salam she said I have a very small goat and about two kilograms of barley this is all what I have in the whole house so he said to her prepare it and I will go and invite the prophet alayhi salatu salam she emphasized that only inform the prophet and a man or two with him not more because the food is not enough and this would be an insult to her if she were to invite someone to her house and the food wasn't enough people would say she is not a good woman and this wife of Jabbar we know that when his father died he left great debts and he had to pay them but he did not have enough money to do so so it was the prophet alayhi salatu salam who helped him pay it off and I will explain this later on and then he married this woman who was previously married so she was not a virgin she was either divorced or widowed so the Prophet asked him as some why did you marry someone who's not a virgin like you someone to play with and she would play with you and he explained that his father left behind a number of girls and he did not want another girl to be add to them he wanted a wise woman to take care of the household and to take care of his sisters this wise woman is the one who told him do not bring except one or two with the prophet alayhi salatu salam so jabber went and while the Prophet Adam was resting he came and whispered him in his ear because he didn't want to notify everyone else everyone is hungry so he said prophet of Allah we have prepared something for you so if you can come and invite one or two only because it's a very small goat that barely suffice is four or five people and asar of barley which we would make it into bread and baked it and that's it so the prophet alayhi salatu salam shouted to the whole of the camp they were over a thousand men working and he said come come to the food Jabbar is inviting us now Jabbar was shocked a thousand people so he rushed home and he told his wife the prophet has invited erase awesome the whole army and she started cursing him and saying bad words to him being elder being older than him and being responsible for catering for all of these men and she asked him did he tell you did you inform him that it is only sufficient for 304 he said yes and he's the one who called them then she said she felt calm because the prophet knows what he's doing salala hi o sanam the Prophet ordered Jabbar he told him tell your wife not to remove the pot from the fire where the ship is being cooked leave it as it is and don't touch the dough that you made the barley into it's not baked yet so don't touch it when the Prophet came out in salatu salam he blessed the dough and the pot with that where the goat was and he ordered jabber to ask his wife to bring another woman so that they can both bake at the same time prepare the dough into bread and bake it at the same time because there's a thousand man waiting so they did the Prophet came at is awesome and put a cloth over the pot and said bismillah and he started taking from the bread they baked and putting meat on top of it and giving it too each one of the thousand men or so and as a miracle each and every 18 till there were full and after the whole army and after everyone finished eating jabber says the pot was as it was not a single thing was missing from it and the bread and the dough was as it was this is an incident that was reported in Bukhari and Muslim and as Muslims as Alison now and Jamar we firmly believe that whatever is reported in Bukhari and Muslim is or has the highest degree of authenticity so there's no way to doubt it not only that there are literally tens of similar situations where the prophet alayhi salatu salam would put his hand and unlock blesses the food where the Prophet area is sought for example I'm drama even if ABI bakr may allah be pleased with him tells us that a similar incident happened with 130 men and the same scenario was repeated and the ol8 blessing of allah azzawajal through the Blessed mercy of Allah sent to humankind that is a prophet sallallahu are you are you sinner aburrio once brought a handful of dates and he said to the prophet of allah salah Larson Oh prophet of Allah pray to Allah that he blesses these dates for me so the prophet Adam took the dates and supplicated to allah azzawajal and ask Allah for blessings and then he put it in a small bag now that was probably in the seventh eighth or ninth year of hijra because abu hurayra accepted islam on the 7th year of hijra the year of high bar so he stayed with the Prophet item for approximately less than four years abu huraira says from that small bag which is less than a handful of dates i used to take and fill big bags and sent for the cause of Allah and I used to eat from it and give away from it until the death of Earth man may allah be pleased with him meaning that he kept on eating from that back for 25 years a small bag but it's the blessing of allah azzawajal in incidents where the Prophet Elisha was in an expedition he had 1500 men with him they ran out of food and they wanted to slaughter their camels but if they strut slaughter their camels they wouldn't have any rights with them so the Prophet orders abu salim i may allah be pleased with him the Prophet orders salomon acquire may allah be pleased with him to bring him whatever food they have and they gather the only amount in the whole army which is this big it's like a small goat of dates of wheat of whatever and then the Prophet I some covers it with a piece of cloth and he orders each and every one of them to come and collect and fill their bags and they come and come and come and collect all the food and save and store and leave without it being missing a single thing water used to spring out from beneath his fingers at a salatu salam in tens of similar cases that are authentic not our they're not just here say they are authentic in the books of hadith in the battle of heard a beer or in the Treaty of Hadiya the people were so thirsty the people of Mecca would not allow them in and they would send them back to Medina and it's a long journey to Medina but they don't have any water and they complain to the Prophet a little awesome so she takes one of his arrows and he puts it in an empty well and the water gushes like a river and they drink and they make their camels drink and they store in their water bags and they were about fifteen hundred or fourteen hundred men at the time all of these stories and so many more indicate to us that it wasn't the Prophet aerosol as I'm doing this it was a las blessing through the prophet alayhi salatu salam it was reported that once the Prophet ilysm also needed water and they didn't find any so he told them to look and check so they found a woman with two water bags on her camel transporting it from one place to the other so they brought the camel to the prophetess m with the woman and the Prophet ordered them to take these two water bags and just put a little bit in a pot and then tie it back again so they did and then the Prophet said Alice awesome bismillah and the water started gushing out of that pot and people drank got their camels to drink saved a lot of money in their water bag and the water bags of that idol worshiper woman was still intact and she was watching what's happening and is this sorcery is he magician isn't he the one day say that he is a liar a priest insane etc all these idol worshippers all what I see is a righteous man and a miracle so in the Prophet SAW I some how shocked she was he ordered them to give her some compensation to comfort her so they gathered some food and they put it in a bag and gave it to her and she left to her people and when they asked her why would you late she said I came from a man whom they claim to be an imposter and by Allah he's either a perfect sorcerer or a prophet of Allah because the things i had seen could not be done by anyone except a prophet of allah so she became a muslim from that incident and all of her tribe Subhan Allah the blessing comes only from Allah never ever think that it comes from an individual that it comes from acts that are not related to Islam there are things that are blessed in our world there are locations that are blessed makka madina boba masjid haram the kaaba there are months that are blessed where we offer a lot of forms of worship like our beautiful and blessed month of ramadan there are things that are blessed the word of Allah the Quran is the greatest blessing on us there are days of the month that are of the week that are blessed such as Friday there are times that are blessed and Allah accepts and answers your supplication in them such as the last third of the night between a dinan yama when you break her fast the last hour of friday etc so the blessing comes only from allah the almighty and if you believe allah azzawajal would make the whole world comes the whole world come to you on the on its knees all what you have to do is have the conviction of 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide that this is the world word of Allah Quran and that his messenger muhammad sallallahu wasallam was his prophet messenger and servant during this battle of the trench while digging this trench they were met by a big rock that their access that their shovels could not affect it the least so they didn't know what to do they didn't have any caterpillar bulldozers at the time so they went to the Prophet Elisha Lobster and complained there is something we're unable to move so the Prophet la salsa once again proves to us that he is not a tyrant that he is not a king he is merely a messenger of allah and a servant of his he comes with them to work like he did with Jabbar now imagine if you were starving if you were hungry and someone tells you listen I've got a hamburger for you and you have like 10 people who are starving as well the normal thing is for you to eat it not the Prophet Alice awesome he's not the type to eat and leave his men starving and this happened with all of his companions Omar may allah be pleased with him there was a year that passed by when he was a caliph it's called diamo ramada and everything turned into ash because of the famine and the drought and people starved did not have any food no imports nothing Roma swore as the Caliph not to taste any ghee and not to eat anything that is fancy until the people eat with him he was a caliph he could have easily justified to himself that I have to run the country so i have to be in my good state of mind and i cannot do this without eating no no ghee no wheat no honey nothing Noth nothing good only vinegar maybe and bread that was all they had to eat until the people find food nowadays we find tyrants we find presidents we find kings enjoying life while their people are in need and this shows you the gap between what we say in what we do we need to walk the talk so the Prophet came away salatu salam and he had the shovel with him and he said bismillah Allahu Akbar and he strikes the first blow and one-third of the rock breaks and turns into sand and a big spark lights the whole place and he says Allahu Akbar I was shown the castles of Persia and the red palaces I was given those then he strikes again and he says Allahu Akbar and another third turns into sand with one blow and he says Allahu Akbar I was given the palaces of a sham and this is in reference to Byzantium and then he hits the third blow and the last third of that big rock demolishes and turns into sand and he says Allahu Akbar I was giving the palaces of Yemen now the hypocrites started talking look at him we are unable to go and answer the call of nature because we're afraid of someone attacking us while they're besieging medina and he is promising us the treasures and palaces of the greatest super powers at the time Persia Byzantium basanti ax and Yemen what kind of promises is he giving us this shows us that the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam is a man of positivity he's a servant of Allah Sojin whatever Allah tells him to do he does it this shows us the amount of positivity he had unlike the negativity we have because a real leader is someone who's always positive who injects who radiates positivity around all those with him so they feel strong when he speaks they feel powerful when he is with them this is a true leader now the Prophet was not only a leader a lot of time he was the messenger of allah so he was radiating positivity because this was a prophecy and the strange thing is that when he was addressing the muslims about the moa kate and these are the designated places for people coming to pilgrimage to assume their state of ramen to change your attire and to become in the state of a harem when he was telling this to the Muslims in Medina he was telling them about sham area he was telling him them about Yemen he was telling them about central of Arabia and all of these places were not Muslim at the time yet he told them that those who are coming for pilgrimage from a sham area meaning Egypt Syria the Levant countries anywhere from the north then al Jaffa is their place of me hot but none of them was Muslim which tells you that this is a prophecy and radiating positivity you're weak you're vulnerable you don't have enough food don't worry it's a number of years and you will have everything you want and this is exactly what happened in less than 30 years the Persian Empire was a Muslim state and this is why the fire worshippers who inhabited Persia till today pretend to be Muslims and try to undermine Islam al-sham area Egypt north of Africa all of this came into Islam parts of Europe came to Islam Turkey all of these were unimaginable at the time and they all came into Islam because of the prophecy of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and because of the positivity the Prophet al-assal son was always positive unlike us we hear about terrorist attacks we hear about people killing others why are you doing this did you profit do this Alice option did he ordered something like this it was reported in the sahie that mother Aisha asked the Prophet erase a lot salam once Oh prophet of Allah what is the hardest day you had ever seen from your people that is the disbelievers what is the greatest abuse they did to you was it the Battle of hurt when 70 of your companions were martyred among them was your uncle Hamza the prophesied know salala haryana the hardest day was when I went to tithe which is about 200 kilometers or less no it's much less it's about 120 kilometers or so from Mecca and I went to give them doua so that they may give me safe haven because of the abuse of the people of Mecca so I gave them Dawa and they rejected me and they said that you're a liar and not only that they ordered their children and their slaves to throw me with pebbles until my heels and feet were bleeding so I walked down from the mountain of Taif for about four or five hours until I reached an area called carnal man a car nathaly he said I walked without knowing this I was in a state of shock I don't recall anything except waking up in that area so imagine the Prophet walked for five hours al-assad's annum depressed worried because of their rejection and could not help except waking up at that area gibril came to him peace be upon him he said o prophet of Allah this is the angel of the mountains Allah had sent him to you and the angel of the mountains said to him o Muhammad Allah ordered me to obey you if you wish I will collapse than a shebeen to big mountains on top of their heads and I will annihilate all of them just give me the order now in such a state of mind what would you do if you were in his shoes salama haryana you would definitely ask him to immediate we execute the order and get this over with not the prophet alayhi salatu salam the Prophet was a man of positivity was a visionary was optimistic he said no do not do that because by the grace of Allah I am hopeful and wishful that from their offsprings these disbelievers these idol worshippers I pray that from their offspring would come people who would worship Allah alone and nothing with him what kind of positivity is this what kind of belief and conviction does this man have it is second to none what the Prophet had in his mind in his heart salala horizon the great love to humanity even to his feast enemies who abused him who attacked him who killed his loved ones and he will try to assassinate him Subhan Allah it is our prophet sallallahu alaihi salam who had the mercy to all of mankind we have a short break stay tuned and we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back the lines are open for you to have your questions insha'Allah so if you have any questions related to the topic mercy for mankind please go ahead and call and if you don't and you have something that is related to Ramadan or you want to find an answer to which is within the context inshallah i'll try my level best to do that abdullah from Havana hello yes Abdullah yea or I'll be late yeah I feel high after high drama khurana yes I did I what's going to do for your fee hello oh why don't you pour test it is butchering of Saudi in Yemen ok very good question first of all butchering is done by butchers and they're usually butcher sheep and if you are unable are he to discriminate between what is happening in defense of the legitimate rights of the Yemeni government and they are many people then I cannot help you if you're blinded by the violence and the rhetoric and then the sheeds that is given by the ISIS and by the Boko Haram and by the Shabab and you would like to convey this to your country as well in Rana then you might be a sleeping cell okay what is happening in Yemen is for the defense of the people of Yemen if Saudi Arabia had any intention in Yemen they would have invaded them long time ago if we had any intention elsewhere we would have done this Saudi Arabia is known to be a peaceful country a country that loves goodness for their neighbors we have given trillions of dollars in aids throughout the 30 or 40 years we have given so many aircrafts for their Airlines all that aircraft is ours everything that you see is Saudi Arabia and this is not boasting about it they are trying their level best to help their brothers we have relationships between the Yemenis we are married to them they're married to us we have families living with us so the rhetoric of these how our age or of these terrorist groups go find a child to kill okay go find a place to blow up this is what you guys do what we do is we attack the depots and the weapon storages they have of the who thiis no one complained no one ever said a single word two years ago when the hoodies were killing and slaughtering the Muslims of Alison in domoj and elsewhere so now all what you do is say this and you waste our valuable time in this program instead of answering the Muslims questions that they go learn the karana he go learn Arabic duel go and learn how to purify yourself after answering the call of nature instead of talking nonsense like this and I do apologize for the viewers for such questions but it's inevitable these guys have the means to call and to publish in social networks and to attack anything that is Islamic anything that is pure anything that is based on the coronation because they hate the quran and sunnah and this is what they're trying to prove to the whole world that Islam is not a religion of peace how much from Nigeria South allah kareem and to you as well as he I have been forced to direct my question so it's there are not many people okay again the same question again okay I'm not yemeni first of all and i don't have any control over the coalition airstrikes but you should read the news go and ask the people of Yemen and they will tell you in sha la salle him from Bahrain SAT him hello Monaco Samson LA I I wanted to thank you forever yes at him and you say they have the means and I know that you have disease as well document number 11 6733 again against Adam we this is yeah this is not a talk show this is a Q&A program if you have a question about Islam go ahead and ask about it if you have questions about Wikipedia or WikiLeaks or whatever you want to do this is the wrong place actually this is a place where we try to teach Muslims their religion so if you know your religion you're in the wrong place if you don't know your religion ask a question about your religion as a man from Kuwait assalam alaikum you shake sounds Allah I people call in from different places and talking about issues that are not relevant to the program I just want you to be no actually at least have a program about you learning and you know speak about the brutalities your government is doing again again again iceman a key masha a lot of article i wish sincerely someone would monitor these calls and find out where these people are calling from because they are the nucleus of a sleeping sell all what they do is praised terrorist attacks all what they do is praised the killing and the brutality expressed by Isis and Boko Haram and as Shabaab and al-qaeda and all these people this is not the place where you will get a single word of remorse of over your brutality and your actions that go against Islam in this program we teach the mercy for mankind sallallahu alehiwassallaam and what you are defending has nothing to do with the Prophet Sal Allahu Allahu Salem has nothing to do with Islam so yeah get a life Danny from the Emirates Salaam alaikum sandton la shaken from London not giving the bias is Ramadan and I just wanted to thank you for your knowledge and everything that you do you know telling us on TV Michelle are you doing such a great job and I wish without TV was in London in the UK because what I've learned from this TV channel and from your show in the last 10 days is unbelievable and I just wanted to thank you for your time jazakallah head brother Danny and I pray to Allah so jeal that your visit is successful to the Emirates as for your wish that this would come to Great Britain I personally tried over the few past years to get a sponsor and I know that there are a lot of rich Muslims in the UK and in Europe generally and this requires not funding it requires someone who has the funds and means to come and say okay i will give you the annual fee for the broadcasting rights in the UK and europe imagine someone coming and putting a donation even if it's a million pound it's its peanuts for a billionaire but if he puts that amount of money which would cover for three years or two years of 24 7 broadcasting islamic material in English that is moderate and balanced to UK and to Europe imagine what great reward this individual would have while he's at home and even when he dies the meteor keeps on running and ticking and his levels in general keeps on rising if he does this for the sake of Allah maybe it cannot be done by one person but I know that it can it can be done by a number of persons etc so if you guys have the will there would be a way so i'll try to work for this maybe you will get dirty word for that in charlotte nadia from saudi hello family come sample la and to you as well shake i have three questions my question number one is I heard that if anyone talks between iran and a comma during that time he will not able to sail i highlight the time of death is it the true or it is applicable only on during as on time ok and my second question is if for i pray at home Ravi can I say it loudly the farthest prayer and also the Travie players alone alone but lovely and my third question is especially for the women what conditions are there to be for the Hajj obligatory I mean I know that if you have their financials I think I mean if you are in that condition is fun on our each Muslim but for specially for women who are married I heard that someone told me that even after marriage it is fun on the father to take the daughter to Hajj if for example the husband is not and if the women is not a thing I'm even if she is happening and giving them money to her husband then is it obligatory on her okay she doesn't find the mushroom to go like that anyone had the situation for the ribbon I will answer you inshallah big meal an idea I'm dollar from Saudi yes I wanna clear shirts and I'm too long what is it okay to swallow my oyster lover and what I'm unless did offer okay any more questions you know I would answer inshallah thank you you're quite welcome sister Nadia from Saudi she says that there is a misconception and it is a misconception among the Muslims that speaking at the time of the event that if a person talks weather than is on then he would not be able to say the Shahada when he dies and she had a little bit gone a little wider by saying that he who speaks between that and your comma so the time is even longer 15 minutes and all of this is baseless well there than is on you can talk you can speak you can joke you can do whatever you want there is no restriction we cannot restrict something that the Prophet that is awesome did not tell us that it is restricted we have a runner from Nigeria mute your television and listen to me only through the phone walaikum Salaam week why do you sound club ricotta cheese actually colleague in relation to any happiness again Yemen sorry we don't take any political questions because I've I'm fed up of this do go ahead and look for an answer elsewhere i'm here to give you only islamic advice Khadijah from nigeria Sam to LA my a basic for a while last year after your thoughts last three years of last year I haven't a president who I was sorted it to take the four so that every time whatever the faster the familiar okay I'm talking to the president absolutely why is she so that the sentence after not fostering diocese justifying it but we feel hungry why identity get back I'm not sure now enough ok i will last you i will answer i will try to answer yo Khadijah we have a mean from bahrain salam alayka sure sample la I shake I have one question yes sacred like I have a certain amount that i have to pay so much as a thought and if i pay more than this amount zakat will this extra mount will be considered as Sakha or will it be carry forward for my next year's as a car what is your intention my intention is that for example i have to pay five thousand saudi riyal Isaac us then I 6,000 it is a car so will it be considered as Ricardo I understand okay I understood the question the thousand real extra is your intention that it is of next year and zakah or is your intention of Sedaka Oh before I actually for diff here only okay I would answer the question shala the rocket was a caffee Nadia second question was about salata taraweeh and loud prayers for prayers in home if there is no nan muharram can she pray her prayers allowed the answer is yes a woman is allowed to pray in her home fechar maghrib and isha loudly as long as there is no none muharram and she is allowed to also recite the Quran loudly in taraweeh she says when is had an obligation upon women especially when a woman does not have a Muharram one of the conditions for Hajj for me women that she must have a Muharram the issue is that if her Muharram is not willing to go so sometimes a woman comes and says I asked my husband to go with me to hell she said no I did my Hajj 10 years ago and I don't have to do hajj I don't want to go to Hajj and I cannot afford it so if she has extra money that she could pay her husband to go for hajj on her expense would that be mandated upon her the answer is yes because allah azzawajal made hatch obligatory upon an individual who is healthy physically capable and financially in her case she's physically capable financially she's able to take herself to hatch and to take him as well with her as a Muharram so if her brother if a father of her husband would require her to pay money and she is a capable of doing this then she should do that Allah knows best I've brought man from Southie hello Molly said I'm Osama please um I'm asking about the everybo okay yes I'm a driver at saudi arabia e ok and someday i have a hours booing office keys and the drivers a police i give me a holla ok and Saudi Arabia you know lotto system can work about two months before kitchen joseline that much my salary food in case and the the next month my salary came I have to compete mahalo fun when I went it was dogma by my imma holla fire jump into double knot when it was 300 yeah jump to 600 so I'm asking that darton is not part of my back ok I will answer your question inshallah Fatima from Saudi she except Allah yeah I need to ask about Witter during during with her when the Imam is making du'a if he is praising Allah or calling upon him what are we supposed to say during that time I mean normally we supposed to say our me when he's making dua but when he is praising him what are we supposed to say okay any more questions no I will answer you inshallah was a key Abdullah from Saudi Arabia says what's the ruling on swallowing ones saliva while fasting this is normal okay this is not acceptable for person to split his saliva every couple of minutes on the contrary even if you wash your mouth in woodle if you do mod model and you turn the water into your mouth and you spit the water you will still have some residue you will still have something mixed with your saliva no one of the scholars say that you have to spit it out on the contrary this is permissible and doesn't affect your prayer now the other issue is what if someone has a spit that coming out from his lungs or from his throat due to infection and it reaches his mouth and he swallows it if this is the case then this is first of all harmful second of all if it was done intentionally then this breaks your fasting because it came to a place where you can omit it and take it out but you refuse to do so in this case this causes you to invalidate your fasting and it's an issue of dispute because some would consider to be part of the saliva but if it is coming from your throat Oh from your stomach like if someone hates something and then he didn't vomit but it reached up to his mouth where he could have spitted it out and he swallowed it this breaks your fast and illogical knows best so they man from saudi salam Armitage global cacho Angela please i want to ask the question about the way home okay the minim how to count the deal to actually not a theorem or any groups it's easy servant to be all they are top Kevin Smith activity and like that okay any more questions nah ne ne no more question I know that why would I say mashallah but Khadijah from Nigeria her question was long she says oh this is another Khadijah okay article sounds a lot yeah I think on behalf of our co signing and record because we women you know the casual world you know be good they are three times they have me happy white girl run school and the other goal so I think gold is gold young man you have to remove for all the three of them get the same okay i will answer in Shaba okay Khadijah from nigeria says that she has been sick for two years and did not fast and now she's well and she's making up for the fast and this is a confusion that most Muslims have when it comes for Miss days due to illness and feeding the food a poor person you do not feed four days missed except if you are too old too fast you're not going to get younger next year or if you are chronically and terminally ill to the extent that doctors say from today until the day you die you're not going to be able to fast if this is the case in this case you may pay the feeding or you may feed a poor person for every day you miss but if someone was ill for seven years or six years and the doctor say inshallah you will be recovering soon and you will be able to fast he should not feed anyone he may wait until he is fully recovered and able to make up for all these missed days and Khadijah is the same thing Nadia from south hello salaam aleikum sent a lot i want to repeat my last question again about Hajj okay actually my personal not that I afore I mean if I earn but I give all the money every month to my husband because we run the home to get that ok paying their fees of the children and everything but for exam but I have gold so if i do i have to sell it and go to the Hajj like it is if you don't have the money that much money to afford to people to go to Hajj so do I have to sell and the second question regarding this that's for example if you are you don't you and not you don't have anybody but their husbands in fact that both have money so what is responsible because of what will be that their father is obligatory 84 father son father to take the daughter to has even she is married this is my main question so that is it true even he was not there but he if he has money I would I say don't be disheartened responsibility got your question show got your question I mean from Bahrain says that he has a five thousand rial zakat and he adds a thousand reels and gives it to those who are eligible for zakat so is this extra thousand part of charity general Sedaka or is it part of next year no it cannot be part of next year unless you intended it for example my socratis 5000 reals but I know a patient who has to pay medical bills for his surgery and he doesn't have money he cannot afford it now he needs seven thousand so I give him five thousand of the cut of this year and two thousand of next year so when next year comes next Ramadan i calculate my zakat if it's 5,000 again then I did that two thousand which i paid last year and I pay only three thousand but if you did not intend this you already gave the money of six thousand five thousand second one thousand extra to the poor no this is general Sedaka and it cannot be of next year's succumb a black man from Saudi Arabia says that there is a system in Saudi Arabia to my knowledge ok this was abolished maybe it's still existing but there was a few allow a debate where the system is you get a fine of 300 reals for a traffic violation if you don't pay it within 30 days they double it so it becomes 6600 reals so some people said that this is river and this is an extra and interest / alone others said no this is not alone this is a fine so you have to pay this and you have 30 days if you don't pay it then define becomes 600 but it does not quadruple or triple as we go through time this is only either this or that so some scholars say that this is okay I personally believe that this is okay to my knowledge that the Mufti of Saudi Arabia said that this is not okay so if i'm not wrong i heard that they have stopped this practice because of the verdict of the mufti and even if the mufti did not say it i personally believe that this is part of the fine you pay on time you get now for the issue of the company is not paying their salaries on time this is one of the major sins and as a company owner you should fear allah azzawajal the prophet at least salatu salam ordered us to give the laborer his wage before his sweat dries so on top of each month you have to give him his salary to postpone and to delay for a month or two I know companies that postponed for four months and when you ask ask and talk to the CEO he says what can I do the government is not paying me the companies are not paying me I'm a subcontractor this is not my problem this is not the problem of the poor employee you have to give them their money on time he says if they don't like they can resign even if they designed this does not exempt you from the sin and the burden even if you have to sell your house to give them their money you should do so but you cannot leave the people hanging because you were doing who's benefiting when you get the big amount of money for your project you give them only bits and pieces their salaries but you're the one who's making the profit so you should also make the sacrifice when you don't have money for tema says during which ER the DA says allah huma dinafem and had a thesis invoking allah we see a me but if he says Allah American ham to hamden Kathy remember ography Allah Allah idalou manually it what is Juma you're praising Allah you're not asking for something so what should we say the what I believe you should not say anything you just listen and praise allah saw said as he is doing you just praise allah by your heart because we were not told to answer and make a reply to each statement he sense only when he makes do I we say I mean if he praises allah azzawajal or if he describes the status of the people in their graves we don't we don't say anything we just listen and allah knows best so lemon says how to calculate the seventh day for slaughtering the HIPAA the sacrifice for showing our gratitude to the newborn it should be done on the seventh day so if your son is born on Wednesday the seventh day would be Tuesday so the following tues you should slaughter if he is born on a Saturday then Friday is the day before is the seventh day Khadijah says that we know that gold have we have to pay zakat for gold but there are different types of gold white gold yellow gold and a third one I did not hear you only pays a cat for yellow gold if the white gold is yellow gold and plated with white color you have to pay the cut but if white gold is a different mineral is a different kind of metal it is platinum or titanium or whatever they call it then there's no sir cat in it because is it's not related to yellow gold so only gold you have to pay the cat for is the yellow gold we know of an idea a second clarification she says that she contributes to the expenses of the house she earns money and her husband takes it so if she doesn't have money enough except her gold and the gold suffices for her Hajj and for her husband who doesn't want to go from his own pocket in this case she is obliged to go and sell her gold and go for hajj because this is a one-time pillar that she has to fulfill and is the father obliged to pay for the expenses of the hajj of his daughter who is married answer is no if she's not married it's an issue of dispute some say he has to pay for that and others say no this is a personal responsibility and one must not involve himself in it if he wants to volunteer there is no problem if not then he's not obliged to it but I believe that the most authentic opinion is that a person is not obliged to send his child his daughter his son to hatch from his own pocket if he does this alhamdulillah this is great and he'll be rewarded for it but if he cannot afford it then he is not obliged to do this this is all the time we"
