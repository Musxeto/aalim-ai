  "transcript": "sh I heard recently uh the salf used to how do you put it they used to be happy with the bad and the good and what what is that that they used to be happy the salf used to be happy with the good and the bad meaning they accept the good and the bad and they'll be they'll be pleased with what whatever Allah gives them no this is not true who said this I was watching it YouTube there is a difference between being happy with the bad which is the death of your son the death of your mom the death of your father this is bad for you which is a Calamity you're telling me that the Sala when their children died they would throw a party say hey my my son died definitely not so they were not happy however they were content this is called yes this is a different thing when the prophet's son and I apologize for interrupting but they just wasting uh saving your time and mine and the viewers when the prophet's son ibraim died and he was an infant and he was the only male child the only male offspring that the prophet had at the time when he was like 62 years of age so he was very happy to have him as the idol worshippers were always mocking the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam for not having a male offspring that would carry his name and they used to call him Al the one who's cut off and that's why we read in the shortest Surah of the Quran the one who hates you and says these awful thing about you is the one who's cut off and would not be remembered or mentioned later on in time and this is a prophecy that is fulfilled till date no one remembers Abu jahal or or and the likes nobody knows who they are or calls their names but the prophet's name Alam is mentioned all over the world five times a day Round the Clock seven days a week and so forth so when his son whom he had Great Hopes on all of a sudden died he wasn't happy he was content so he said the heart is saddened the eyes weep and we do not not say anything except that which uh uh pleases Allah but by Allah we are saddened and heartbroken for departing you ibraim that's it end of story in life goes on so I hope this answers your uh uh doubt"
