  "transcript": "Okay, Ibrahima from Guinea. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. May Allah bless you and you Sheikh. And you as well. Sheikh, I have a question. My question is that I want to know for the people who have fallen into drugs, like whether it's weed or whatever else, like hard drugs, soft drugs, whatever it may be. We know a lot of brothers. We have a lot of brothers who have fallen into these things. I want to know about their prayer, for example. Is it the same reward as alcohol, meaning no reward at all? Can they lead the prayer once they are sober and so on and so forth? What is the ruling, the Islamic ruling? And please give a little bit of details. I want to share it like with those I can so that maybe it will kind of steer them away from it. JazakAllah Khayran. Wa Jazak. First of all, the Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam, whoever drinks intoxicants, wine, whiskey, booze, whatever, Allah will not accept his prayers for 40 days, for zero. And not accepting the prayers means that he will not be rewarded for it as a form of punishment. Of course, he cannot skip the prayers of 40 days, claiming that, okay, if I'm not going to be rewarded for it, so why would I pray? I'll leave the prayer. No, if he leaves the prayer, he becomes a kafir. So he's obliged to pray for 40 days without anticipating the reward from Allah due to his major sin, which is consumption of intoxicants. Secondly, the vast majority of scholars said that doing drugs is the same as consuming intoxicants. So if you do marijuana, hash, pot, meth, crack, heroin, cocaine, opium, whatever, filth you do, which intoxicates you, this has the same ruling as intoxicants, wine or whiskey or booze and the likes. Now, can someone whom we know that consumes drugs or alcohol, but now he's sober, can he lead the prayer? The answer is, if you pray behind him, the prayer is valid, but who in his right mind would pray behind such a person? The Prophet ﷺ saw a man once while praying and leading the others, spitting in the direction of the Qibla. So while praying, he spits in the direction of the Qibla. The Prophet ﷺ said, this person must not lead the prayer after today. For such an inappropriate behaviour while in the middle of the prayer, he's not fit to lead the prayer. How is it compared to someone who consumes intoxicants, which is one of the major sins in Islam? Definitely, it's even worse. So you must not pray behind someone who you know that openly drinks and has no problem with that. But if you do, your prayer would be valid and Allah knows best."
