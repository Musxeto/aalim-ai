  "title": "Is praying 4 rakat after Isha with one Tasleem is eqivalent to praying Layaltul Qadr, authentic?",
  "transcript": "okay mr ud from germany sheikh i have heard one speaker saying that praying for raqqa after isha with one taslim is equivalent to praying them online i would like to know whether this is true or not and if yes how do we pray this is an issue of dispute and the reason is is the hadith valid or not is the hadith authentic or not and the most uh reliable and authentic opinion is that this hadith is not authentic to the prophet alaihis salatu and this is our methodology we're inclined to only follow the quran and the hadiths of the prophet wasallam whatever he had done we follow it if there is another narration from a companion or from but it is not murphy to the prophet it's an issue of dispute among scholars should we take it because the companions most likely did not bring it out of thin air or should we refrain and stick to what is authentic and proven from the sunnah of the prophet sallam i'm inclined to the latter therefore i do not believe that this hadith is authentic and i do not believe that we should implement it or do it and allah knows best you"
