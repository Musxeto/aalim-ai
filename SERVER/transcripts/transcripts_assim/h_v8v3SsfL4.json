  "title": "Women Around The Prophet ﷺ‎ / Part 9 / Juwairiya Bint Al-Harith / - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so and welcome to this new episode of women around the prophet today we will attempt to talk about two of our mothers two great women whom the prophet alaihis salatu lived with and impacted their lives profoundly the first wife of the prophet is from the great tribe of huzzah juwairiyah was not her original name azim in abbas may allah be pleased with him and with his father said that her real name was barra and barra meant pious or righteous and it was a habit that the prophet salallahu salaam would change most names that had self-praise to them and he used to not like people saying he left righteous or pious when he leaves the house instead of saying he left hint or he left fatima which is a normal name because it insinuates that he has left righteousness and piety and this is why scholars say that it is not recommended to call or to name your daughter as tuka or iman so that when someone calls and says is iman there and he said no there is no iman meaning that it's a double edge a sword that can mean the person is not there but also it can mean that there is no iman there is no tuka there is nothing as such so the prophet islam used to change names bad names into good names names that imply praising one's self into normal names so for example he changed the name of hasan one of the companion's name was hasan which means difficult and he said no your name is sad easy so he used to change such names was now we don't have a lot about the wives of the prophet hallelujah and the books of sira only highlights what was important what had an impact on the life of that mother of the believer or generally on seerah itself and the life of the prophet was and the lessons that can be learned from it so what's the story with juarea juveria was the daughter of al harithim and benil they were a tribe that assisted the idol worshipers being themselves idol worshipers they assisted the people of quraysh in their battles such as the battle of uhud and they kept on intimidating the muslims and expressing hostility towards islam so when the prophet heard ali salatu that they were preparing their armies to attack the muslims the prophet alaihis had to take a preemptive measure and he went with the muslims to attack them and they took them by surprise being the enemies of islam an open enemy and there was a fight where men were killed others fled while the women and the children were taken as slaves and captive captives of war so juwairi bin talharith was given as part of the booty of war the spoils of war to one of the warriors and he was fabit may allah be pleased with him and thrabbit himself has a history with the prophet alaihis because he was the orator he was the spokesman of the prophet whenever tribes came and they met face to face they would appoint someone to give a speech praising his tribe and their achievements so he's known as the khatib so the prophet allah had fabit as his spokesman due to his loud voice and due to his fluency and beautiful language so she was appointed and given to him being who she was a woman of great honor and social status the daughter of a tribe's leader so so she was a princess and not a common woman she could not live with the thought of being a slave in islam there is an option for slavery they can buy themselves out a slave can go to his master and say listen i would like to buy myself out how much would you like and the guy would say if i were to display you for sale i would get maybe a thousand dollars so a thousand dollars is good for me so the slave goes and work depending on his expertise and knowledge and gains the money and gives it to his master and he's free to go so she went to the tabitha in case and she asked him for such a transaction and he agreed but she was penniless she had nothing no money no wealth and her father fled and all the men in her tribe ran away with their lives so she thought that the only alternative is to ask people to assist her by that time she had already accepted islam and this is logical and normal most people have resentment to islam due to what they see in the media and you can't blame them the media brainwashes them if they don't put some effort to research and read objectively on their own they are like the rest of the herd if the herd leader goes left they all go left even if it's a cliff that they're gonna fall off they just follow the herd leader so those who liberate themselves from the effect of unbiased or bias media and research it would find the truth joey was one of them yes she was taken as a prisoner aware of war yes she was enslaved but when she saw islam and she realized that all what she was hearing from her father from the other tribesmen about islam was false she accepted it so she went to the prophet to seek his financial assistance mother aisha narrates the hadith and she says that when she came seeking permission to speak with the prophet salaam the moment i set eyes on her i hated it this is what madurai is saying she said she was beautiful charming and cute any man would set eyes on her would be captivated by her beauty so she said i did not like this i hated it she's a woman she knows so when she talked to the prophet alison she said oh prophet of allah my name is jawed bintil the head of his tribe and their leader and you have seen what had happened to me and i was given tooth habit ibn kais so i bought myself from him and he agreed so now i am here to seek your assistance in paying off my debt so the prophet gave her a choice so he said to her would you like something that is better meaning that i can give you money to set yourself free but would you like me to give you something which is a an offer you cannot refuse she said what would that be oh prophet of allah and the prophet said i'll pay off your debt and i'll marry you now being who she was the daughter of the leader of her tribe the princess and being the one proposing to her is the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi the strongest man in arabia a messenger a prophet from allah who can come close to him no one so she immediately on the spot accepted this offer that no one can refuse and she says of course o prophet of allah i would take this offer so the prophet said i have done that meaning that i've paid your dues and i married you and the news came out to the people to the companions that the prophet was married so the people who were with the prophet al-islam who had prisoners of war under their control which was money they said how is it possible that the prophet's in-laws are enslaved with us this is not befitting we set all the captives under our control free for the sake of allah and after that for the sake of the prophet's new wife imagine how many people were set free the narration says by setting joaries free and marrying her she was the most influential she was the most favorable or she had the favor and the blessing over her tribe no woman could have done this to her own people she got a hundred household hundred families all freed and set free from slavery because of her marriage to the prophet alaihis salat was what more blessing can there be now people who do not have a man who do not believe they would criticize and say oh the prophet married her because she was beautiful and charming as if it is an insult when you as a human being want to eat something would you eat trash or would you eat a beautiful and tasty meal would anyone condemn you if you were to drink something that is sweet and cold instead of taking something that is bitter or bad is the prophet a human being or not he is a human being and he likes to eat to drink and he likes women he himself told us about himself that from your world allah made beautiful to me women and perfumes he loves to smell good things so only the idol worshipers criticized the messengers of allah long ago that they eat food and they walk in the markets they're normal human beings and this is insane no one said that the prophets are not human beings they are human beings and the more they have this urge to natural things the more perfect they are it is totally wrong to think that being celibate is something positive or something natural this is not natural what is natural is what allah has put in us this attraction to the opposite gender so that we can get married and we can reproduce so the prophet islam was a perfect man with desires but when you compare him to others you will see that the difference between the heavens and the earth he was extremely strong as a man yet he was satisfied with a woman 15 years older than him from the age of 25 until the age of 50. never ever had a second wife or anything of the sword and then he married someone his age who was in her 50s and was sauda benzema may allah please with her and he stayed with her for three more years we know that the companions used to talk and say that the prophet isam was given the power of 30 men he's not like us he's so strong especially when it comes to issues of intimacy he's the perfect man yet with all his fasting with all his night prayer with all his obligations which would normally wreck a normal person the prophet had the power of 30 men so it is not shameful it is not something that is bad to seek what is halal through marriage and look at the consequence of such a choice the prophet would not let someone who's like joarie who is a princess to be given as a concubine to one of the companions she would not be happy in her life her master would not be happy with her and she may cause problems and trouble to him she must be given to someone her equal or more superior so that she would be satisfied and fulfilled and this is what happened when the prophet married her allah and her barakah and her blessing of such a marriage was cascaded to all of her people who were set free and they were all freed how old was she she was 20 years of age when the prophet married her salatu how long did she live with the prophet salallahu not more than six years and the prophet died afterwards and this is also important to pay attention to nowadays girls and women fail to weigh things properly and their parents as well so if a person proposes to a girl they look at the age difference and said no no no he's too old for her why because he's 10 years older or 15 years older what's wrong in that said no this is a big gap this it should be like three or four years difference this is not realistic a man at the moment graduates when he's 23 or 24 years from college then he joins the private sector or the workforce he needs like three four more years to collect money in order to open a house and get married so by the time he's 28 years of age which is the average he will not look for someone who's 28 years of age or even 25 years of age he would look for someone who's 17 or 16 or maximum 18 and if women and girls continue to refuse they'll grow older and older and the proposals will get less and less the demand is far less than the supply for every man there are like 15 or 20 women candidates so she cannot pick and choose he can pick and choose i know a friend who's over 60 years of age healthy masha'allah and capable of getting married he's trying to get married to anyone that accepts him we propose to women in their 40s imagine and she says no no no he's too old for that for me he's not a patient that you will take care of he is a healthy man but still these misconceptions ruin our lives they hinder women from living their lives what's wrong if you marry someone 60 or 65 years of age who's still fit incapable of earning and all what you need is a husband you're not gonna be his nurse what's wrong in that the prophet married her alai salazar when he was 57 years of age and she was 20 years of age and she lived these six years with utmost happiness women don't think like this and they keep on postponing and delaying until it is too late for them so jawaria made the right choice a choice of a lifetime she became the mother of the believers and she loved the prophet like all of his wives her father al-harith came to the prophet sallallahu assalam after a while after the marriage was done so he said to him in a truce where he came and said o prophet of allah jewelry is my daughter and i am an honorable man my daughter cannot fall into slavery so ask whatever you want and i'll give it to you if you want a hundred camels which is a real big fortune i'll give it to you so the prophet said to him how about i'll give you a better proposal keep your money and i'll give her the choice if she chooses you so be it but if she chooses to stay with me then you will honor that and her father said well i you you leave me no other choice than this beautiful and fair and just choice so he goes to his daughter and he says to his daughter in a doubtful manner because he senses something fishy and he says to her julia do not disgrace us your family and tribe the man has given you the choice so what do you choose without any hesitation she said i choose the prophet of allah and her father said by allah you've disgraced us you choose this new man who killed your people enslaved your families and took you as a prisoner of war as a slave woman over me your father of course that would be the logical choice where would you find someone like the prophet to serve let alone to get married to so she made the right decision and she was one of the righteous practicing wives of the prophet muslim in the sahih narrated that ibn abbas may allah be pleased with him said that juera told him that once the prophet allah left her house to go and pray fajr prayer and she was in the place of her worship where she prays her night prayer and fajr etc so the prophet went and came back like an hour and a half later when it was morning and she was still where she was so the prophet asked her are you still in the same position i left you she said yes meaning a whole hour and a half so she said yes so the prophet said allah i said four words four sentences that if they were to be weighed with all what you had said today meaning this hour and a half it would overweigh them i said these four phrases three times what were they the prophet said subhanallah as many as creations allah has said as much as allah is satisfied with was as heavy as the throne is as much as the ink which allah's words and commands are written by so the prophet acknowledged her ibaadah her devotion to worshiping allah azza and he directed her to what is the best bukhari reported in his sahih that the prophet sallallahu salaam came into jewellery's house on a friday while she was fasting so the prophet asked her did you fast yesterday she said no are you going to fast tomorrow she said no the prophet said to her then break your fast meaning that it is not permissible to isolate friday with fasting unless you fast the day before and a day after this was jueria bintul harith a beautiful name rarely you will find people calling their why their daughters juwaria one of my daughter's names is julia and i remember going to a hospital once and the receptionist was taking the information so he says what's the patient name i said joaria and she said you what i said you and she's a muslim she said why what did she do wrong you call her this name i said subhanallah the mother of the believer your mother and you don't know her name she said i've never heard this name before in my life she's the wife of the prophet are you so some said yes she said i know only of khadijah and that's it and subhanallah about the ignorance we have jewish one of the mothers of the believers and one of the wives of the prophet sallallahu salaam and unfortunately we don't have time to speak about the second one so that we would insha allah talk about her later on [Music] see today i'm going to talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam reminded us through his guidance and example that islam is complete submission to the will of allah for one who submits a mere declaration or display of belief will not be taken for success but his or her heart and soul will certainly be put to test allah tested the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam severely in order that he sallallahu alaihi becomes an example for his companions to follow similarly he tests the believer to see whether he lives a righteous life in accordance with the instructions and commands set by allah all lives according to what his desires dictate whether the faith he displays is firmly rooted in his heart or is it merely on the surface he will be tested to see whether he will continue to have faith and love of allah when in a calamity as he does when in comfort whether he will continue to remember and worship him if given bounties and comforts of life as he does when he lives a modest life allah will undoubtedly test him to see if his faith trust and love of him is unconditional or is it conditioned upon good health and a comfortable life free from stress and anxiety the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam showed us through his own example that for a righteous muslim this life is a testing ground where he will continue to be tested until he meets allah for him tests will be conducted on earth while he lives and not after he dies he knows that as soon as death arrives and he steps into the next world his tests are over there he only receives the result of his tests and enjoys the fruits of the deeds that he committed during a short span of time called life and welcome back now we have a new system alhamdulillah that you can call free through skype and all what you have to do is type in the search box zad zed a d space tv and you will get the contact and you can call us inshaallah um audio of course not video and we will get you through if this works so it's a new gadget that we've introduced let's hope that it works uh isa says can we keep dog as a pet or for security reasons as a pet it is totally prohibited the prophet said alaihis allah that angels do not enter a house where there's a portrait a statue or a dog and he said that whoever keeps a dog other than a dog of a shepherd dog or a dog for hunting or guarding then each day out of his own good deeds allah will erase and deduct the weight of mount uh of good deeds of hassanat a friend of mine a relative actually who has a chihuahua in his house and so many times we tried our relatives tried to give him advice and he said no it's cute it's lovely it's this it's that so i said to him listen do you have enough good deeds every single day that would equal mount uh is that not even one tenth of that i said to him then in this case you're in debt because every day this is being erased and deducted from your good deeds and this my friend means that you're in real deep trouble so this is not permissible now for security reasons this is permissible providing that these reasons are legitimate so again keeping a chihuahua in your house is not for security reasons it can be eaten by cat so if you have a german shepherd a dopamine something that is really vicious and there is a need for it that you are in a really disturbed environment or a neighborhood that you fear for your life and without that they will not be deterred from breaking into your house this seems to be permissible providing that you keep the dog outside the house and not allowing it to enter the house and allah knows best aisha says i feel word for taking rookia water that has quran i feel word taking it into the toilet and then putting it down the drain as i put it over myself is this allowed in islam i know regarding quran in water and drinking it and washing yourself is good but even if it goes down the drain in the toilet the answer is yes there's no problem none whatsoever in taking water that has been recited and then putting it on yourself washing yourself and it's going down the drain there is nothing even if it's zamzam water there is nothing totally wrong in that or this there's no disrespect of the quran in that none whatsoever surah says is it permissible to make protection of car and blow it on our children or rub our hands on them after we do our atkar as they can't do it themselves surah there is no reason to do this i see a lot of people putting their hands on the heads of the children before they go to school and they recite aytel kursi and the three calls etc in different supplications but i don't know any authentic hadith that backs it up we know the hadith where the prophet salat was used to say the tawith which is this statement this is dua that the prophet used to say to hasan and hussein and he used to tell them that your great-great-grandfather ibrahim peace be upon him used to say this dua for his sons so saying this dua is not needing to touch your children but even if you put your hand over the heads or to their shoulders and you recite it there's nothing wrong in that however if you would like to have protection one of the best duas found in fortress of the muslim muslim which the prophet used to repeat al-hisalat in the morning and evening beautiful allah so the prophet is asking allah for allah the well-being the protection health in what in my religion in my world over my family and over my wealth sheikh means says may allah have mercy on his soul whoever says this in the morning and evening he would have got gotten his children protected because they are included in my family so this is better than going touching their heads and repeating the duas just observe this every morning and every evening with the athkar that you say and this would suffice for him says is hair transplant surgery permissible in islam there's a long discussion regarding this but the most authentic opinion is that such a surgery is permissible where they tend to take some cells uh or hairs from the back of the head which is usually uh um the last affected by boldness and then they transplant these in the skull or in in the scalp itself and it grows naturally so this is to counter a defect and to remove something that is not normal and there is nothing wrong in that cosmetic surgery is haram when it is only for the use of beautification or altering and changing the creation of allah but if it is to remove a defect or to fix something that is wrong or that impairs speaking or eating or movement in this case this is totally permissible and legitimate najib says my sister borrows my headphones sometimes she watches movies other times she has work meetings with it am i helping in sin the default is that we do not judge people so a headset or a headphone can be used in haram and it can be used in halal likewise a knife you can cut bread or meat with it and you can cut someone's throat or injure someone with it so it depends on how it is being used for you najib if you're a hundred percent certain that she will be using your headset for haram only in this case it is not permissible for you to give it to her because you would be assisting on evil but if she is 50 50 she may listen to the news she may listen to the quran she may listen to halal lectures she may have halal meetings and she may listen to something that is haram this to me is best to give her the benefit of the doubt if you advise her while giving her the headsets that would be a disclaimer so you say to her i'm giving you the headset but fear allah i am not in responsible for any sin that you commit with it then this is okay it's a reminder but if you don't know for certain what she's going to use it for the default is it's okay to give it to her sanya says how do we know the difference between shaytan's whispers and our own thoughts and nephs this is almost impossible to differentiate because they work side by side so you have to do your level best to seek refuge in allah and avoid it to the best of your ability in sha allah we have tabish from malaysia babish a skype call from tabish try to unmute your microphone if possible well i think we've lost tabish and i hope he tries again inshaallah this skype service is on trial basis so maybe we need a couple of more more or more trials to fix it a sister says am i sinful if i do not breastfeed my child without any valid reason the answer is no this was mentioned in the quran when there's a dispute between a wife and her husband over suckling if she doesn't want to suckle her own child then they will get someone else to do that so there's nothing wrong for a woman to refuse suckling her own child which is very rare because this is human nature but we don't know people's circumstances and this might be a valid for some but there is no sin even if she does not suckle her child for any good reason there is no sin on her inshallah um maryam says on what price should we calculate the zakat on our gold on the buying price or on the selling price after having the gold for a whole lunar year if you were to dispose of it would you sell it for the price you bought it a year ago or for the current price the answer is for the current price therefore yours a cat is calculated upon the selling price of today so you go to the jeweler's shop and say this is a hundred grams of 24 carat gold how much will i get if i were to sell it you said x amount of money you give 2.5 percent of that x amount of money ahmed says how does one pay back the amount of money if stolen from a person long ago and now the person is dead the property that you had stolen can never be yours for eternity so you have to return it back to its lawful owner if the person is dead then this property or money belongs belongs to his heirs those who inherited his wealth so you have to look for them and give it to them you can easily claim that you borrowed this money from him and you did not have the chance to return it now alhamdulillah you've gathered it and you earned it so now you're returning it back to them so that they would distribute it to his heirs children wife mother father whatever zainab says is it permissible for women to wear anklets the answer is this is permissible and it is not only permissible it is mentioned in the quran in surah nur where allah tells women not to strike the ground with their feet so that the sound of the anklets would not draw attention of men this defies the hijab imagine the beauty of hijab allah women from striking the ground with their feet when they're walking they hit it a little bit stronger so that it would make a sound and this sound would reach the ears of men and they would know that this is the sound of an anklet just the bare sound would lure them and tempt them even if they don't know whether this woman who's walking with this anklet is an elephant or a gazelle still shaytan works like this so allah prohibited them from making a sound with it in order not to tempt men so the norm is if you are at home among your mahram with your brothers and father with your husband and children there's no problem at all in wearing it if you're going out if it makes a sound you have to take it off if it doesn't make a sound but it looks nice you have to cover your foot by default and not expose it and show it to the people and allah azza knows best a sister says my query is regarding allah or is regarding debt or alone on a deceased person if a person dies and he has debts on him and after selling all his assets the debt is still not paid fully also the family cannot afford to pay it what is the ruling about it there's no ruling about it the children of the deceased are not obliged to pay his debts so if i die and someone had lent me money he comes to collect the money before we distribute my wealth to the heirs so the first thing to do is to clear off my debts of course after preparing the body and shrouding it and burying it so the first thing after that is to clear off my debts and if they sell my assets my properties my house my car my uh bank account and it's not sufficient to complete paying off my debt then this is it the children the wife the brothers they're not obliged to pay off my debt and he cannot come and sue them or ask them to give him from their own earnings he has no right to do that i will be held questionable on the day of judgment if i took the debt or the loan for a legitimate reason with the intention to paying it off but i died before doing that allah will pay it off for me if the children want of their own good self to pay it off this is nice this is okay but it's not mandatory yusra says i have a friend who post their own pictures on social media when i like their pictures am i also sinning with them and should i or should all these friends be unfollowed on social media because they post their pictures and what advice can i give them to not post first of all liking their posts which includes not wearing hijab or their pictures etc haram things definitely is sinful this is endorsing it and you should unfollow such friends because they're bad news if someone yusra came to propose to you the first thing they would do is check your social media and they would check who you follow on instagram and if they find that you only follow only trash not practicing muslims but literally trash then you are not worthy of being married to because you must have the same corrupt mentality this is usual so you have to advise them and if they don't listen just leave them finally anand says most of the scholars say that the particular hadith is authentic and another is unauthentic would like to ask what is this criterion that makes the hadith authentic or unauthentic this is like asking a doctor a neurosurgeon how is he going to operate on a patient and what are the procedures he's going to follow a lay man like me and you can't understand this you may not be able to understand how a neurosurgeon work and a neurosurgeon may not understand how you as a professional mechanic work on a car engine so each one has his expertise his knowledge and this is his bread and butter so you cannot understand this unless you study from scratch the science of musl hadith and then go and study the different types of men and all of these things that require lots of books lots of time and tutoring you need a tutor to come and direct you how to walk and move between these uh mazes that you will find to understand such a huge and beautiful science this is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow same time i leave you for a minute foreign you"
