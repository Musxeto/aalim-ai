  "transcript": "Abdul Rahman from Malaysia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, from watching your video I got the idea that this might be permissible So I wanted to ask, is removing the birthmark on your face especially if it's big and it's kind of like a red colour by using, I think it's called PDL laser, is it permissible? Ta'du Masalah Jazak Allah Khairan If it is medically safe and it is a birthmark that is not normal it's something that may not be presentable or looking nice removing it is totally halal providing it's medically safe then there is no problem or as you guys say in Malay, Ta'du Masalah"
