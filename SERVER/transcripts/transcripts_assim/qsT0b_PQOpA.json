  "title": "Can I follow opinions from deceased sheikhs like Sh  Uthaymeen  or Bin Baz if my Sheikh is unavailab",
  "transcript": "Yunus from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Sheikh, if we follow a Sheikh who is still alive but we don't find the answer of him to a specific question and we find him blind, what should we do? Can we make a list like okay I follow Sheikh Fulan, if he's unavailable I follow Ibn Uthaymeen, if he's unavailable I follow Ibn Baz or what should I do? How many options do you have? I have another option, can I tell you? Yes. I go to the next one on the list and as soon as the first Sheikh becomes available I ask him and and the other Fatwa I took out of necessity I ignored and follow him again. Or can I just? This is the right thing to do."
