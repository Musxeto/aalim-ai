  "transcript": "Uthman from Italy. He says he got married to his \nwife after she reverted to islam and her guardian   was her stepfather, who happened to be \nher mother's husband who was a muslim.   Now we know that, anyone who is not from the \npaternal side cannot be the guardian because,   this is the system that islam had put. So \nthe father has to be the guardian, who's a   muslim, same religion or, at least, of the \nbride. And if not, then the son. And if not,   then the brother. If not, the paternal uncle. \nIf not, then the paternal cousin, etc..   You cannot have any of the mother side, the \nmaternal side, to be the guardian of a girl.   Only the paternal side who share her name with \nher, with the exception of the son, of course.   So they got married. Now they heard that it's \nnot correct or valid. What to do? Very easy,   or very simple. Go to the nearest islamic \ncenter in Italy and the imam of the islamic   center would look at the marriage certificate \nand would renew the marriage for you on the   spot. Because the Prophet said, 'aleyhi salatu \nwa salam, 'there is no marriage that is valid   without a \"Wali\", a guardian.' And in another \nhadith he said, 'the sultan, or the muslim ruler,   or whoever takes his position such as the \nimam of the islamic center, is the wali,   is the guardian of anyone who does not have a \nguardian. And Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
