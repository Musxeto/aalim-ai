  "title": "ðŸ†• Female Circumcision: parents secretly got their baby girl circumcised, sinful? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abu Abdur Rahman from Italy Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Ya Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh The question is, we believe the real Muslim that female circumcision is the Sunnah. My country before, it was not a problem to do it. But now the new government, they ban it. If we the parents, we did it in secret without knowing the government, are we sinful for that? What is it that you're asking about? Female circumcision. Okay, female circumcision is an issue of dispute among jurors. And the most authentic opinion is that it is recommended. It's not mandatory. And due to the fact that it is recommended, if the government prevents it and outlaws it, then you have to and you're obliged to obey and refrain from doing it. And Alhamdulillah, as I said, it is not something that is mandatory. And staying away from it would be following the law and there's no sin in that at all."
