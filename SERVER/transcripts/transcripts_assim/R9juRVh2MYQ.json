  "transcript": "and I have a return ticket so I don't need you guys and I'm not being paid for this because alhamdulillah I don't need money you have to call a spade a spade when you suffer when you have calamities when you have depression when you have low IM this is your sin but is Whispering into to my head and I have these Whispers Allah says in the Quran do you believe in the Quran alhamdulillah the plotting of Satan is weak Allah is saying this in the Quran yeah but he's overwhelming me he's doing this he's beating me up no he's not it is you who's opening the door and inviting him in I always give the analogy the example someone knocks on your door you say who is it it says I'm a professional Thief I'm a house Burg burglar so you unlock 1 2 3 4 open the door invite him to your living room what would you like to drink shib or coffee said whatever so you go to the kitchen you prepare it 5 minutes later you come he's not there you rush to your bedroom open the cupboards or the wardrobes no passports no documents no jewelry no money you call 911 the officer comes he looks into the house windows door everything is intact excuse me sir there are no traces of uh forced entry no no breaking entry he said yeah yeah I opened the door invited him in thank you sir have a good day hey what about my money by documents he said you invited him in I can't help you you is consensual what you're facing and suffering from is consensual you want salvation this is the way but then you come and say oh this is very difficult I have to give up movies I have to give up music I have to give up free mixing I have to give up partying I have to give up sleeping at night night and I wake up for fer I have to give up so many sins tell you what I'll take my chances then enjoy your slums have a good time because you have very little on this Earth today I was coming from the bank yes I have a bank account so now I've exposed myself what can I do and my associate next to me driving me around is we saw a boy 12 years old crossing the street coming back from school W it came back to me looking at the boy said she you're married what are you doing I know I'm married this 12-year-old wah he reminded me of myself yesterday I was in his shoes crossing the street going back home what did I have in my mind nothing just to go and eat and then play video games and then go and play with the boys in the street I had no worries I had no problems no slums but now it all went I'm almost 64 and it felt like yesterday so enjoy life while you can soon you'll be 6t down under and if you fill your grave with good deeds you're the happiest man when death comes I've been waiting but if you don't when death comes you're going to grab to anything that you can and nothing is going to help you I don't want to die I don't want to leave my wife my children my grandchildren my wealth my cars my property my trade my I don't want to leave why because you don't have anything to fill up your grave so this I'm not here to depress you guys every everybody's taking the calculators I don't have anything this is the straightforward reality that nobody is telling you about tell me why is it that when I get into my car I have to turn on my DVD or CD or whatever they they call I don't know I don't have one in my car by the way it's all Bluetooth so why do I have to listen to something I can't listen to the tires I think maybe you need to change the batteries maybe just be ready experience so people listen to music listen to the news listen to anything that they have to listen the moment they go home they have four five remote controls they turn maybe two TV screens if not one and just are pinned to it watching listening like a sponge absorbing anything that they give 5 six hours later they're tired they open a novel they open a book they open newspapers and they at the end take their mobiles or in between WhatsApp uh in Instagram or whatever and they and they go to bed and they wake up the first thing they do turn on the TV screen check their messages check their emails you never get five minutes for yourself to sit and contemplate and what am I doing wrong why did Allah create me am I pleasing Allah is Allah happy with me nobody thinks like this because the moment you sit for five minutes and think you will find the truth Shan doesn't want you to find the truth and this is why we're in this vicious circle of occupying our minds you know the beautiful of Ramadan 10 nights at the end of Ramadan do what seclusion isolate yourself in the Masjid for 10 nights last 10 Nights from the 20th till to do what come on I prayed five times then what read the Quran I read the Quran do I did read the Quran do engage in worshiping Allah for 10 nights what does this do to your heart purifies it cleanses it makes it as white as cotton that's why you can't do it if you try to do it between and just sit in the Masid for 1 hour between and I can't I'm too tired I'm too exhausted I have to do let me speak to the brother where are you from you just want to occupy yourself you can't meditate islamically islamically because we don't have meditation in Islam but you cannot concentrate this is why we're being distracted this is what our vicious circle is doing to us and this is why we're having Iman slumps how to restore this maybe in the questions we will find some answers I hope this is sufficient for a talk that was a very good reminder actually even for myself that um you mentioned about everyone being depressed When you mention uh uh you know these things but this is a reality this is a reality that we have to face um I have some questions for you maybe we start off with u the first question which is related to if we go back to the time of the s in the time of the Prophet s wasallam we had the we had the companions who are the best of people who walked the face of the Earth right and they also went through IM slumps were they free were they free from this were they was there IM man high all the time and were they always uh you know uh ready to pray T and fast the Sunnah fasts and all of this or were were there times in their lives where the IM man was down they were struggling um you know maybe you could share with us some examples of some companions who actually went through these uh Iman slumps so without any doubt the companions are the cream of the cream may Allah be pleased with them they are the best generation to ever to walk on Earth after the prophets and The Messengers no doubt how do I know tell me show meith uh Quran um the best of generations is my generation the prophet is saying who's his generation so he himself is identifying them to be the best of generations ever may Allah be pleased with them now when we try to compare Apple to Apple there is no comparison none whatsoever there are of a different species yet they are human and they're not uh um infallible they make mistakes but be careful even the best of us cannot be compared to the worst of them even the best of them cannot be compared to the 10 heavenbound and the sad story is the very sad story of the Muslims they don't know their history Ronaldo CH Christino where is he Mah everybody from Saudi Arabia they know and if I were to tell you who memorizes the 10 Heaven bound the 10 not nine not four who memorizes the whole 10 who knows them please raise your hand I'm the only one this is a problem isn't it isn't it shameful and I always give this example but people sometimes are offended by it if I where to take you to paradise inshallah and excuse me I have to do this from my knees and from my back and and you look who's this uh this is who aash one of the great Companions of the Prophet Alam he is the best athlete ever to know to be known to history never heard of this name who's this oh this is Talha is the name of a man I thought it was a name of a woman who's this this is come on guys I don't know any of those in Paradise uh can we take a tour to hell so okay when we go to hell yeah I know these guys here they're all celebrities yes this actor this actress this singer this rapper man yeah this is the place to be in isn't this a sad reality the 10 heavenbound the best people who were beloved to the prophet Alam he stood once on jab and he says Abu Bak J Abu Bak in J Omar in j j in in ABD in in in in in J is in these are the 10 Heaven bound if you don't know them their stories who they were married to how they lived how they died how they accompanied the prophet Alam what do you know I know Hitler Sheik that he died in be my guest so we have a problem now when we acknowledge that they are the best of generations and we say that didn't they have slums compare their slums to our slums we can't there is no comparison none whatsoever but I'll give you one story Muslim which means the highest degree of authenticity whenever you see you hear in Sahari or sah Muslim take it for granted this is 100 false proof oh is it authentic she you don't ask about bukari and Muslim these are authentic by default so the Hadith narrates Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him see did number two in this umah metd companion so hamdah what's cooking goodlook I'm trying I'm rephrasing huh so hdah said I have become a hypocrite this is something you don't play you don't mess around with hypocrisy Abu Bakr was shocked why he said I have a problem slumps when I am with the prophet I feel that I am flying in Heavens my Iman is STP notch I don't care about anything in this life the moment I leave the prophet and go back home and mix with the wives with the children with the Farms with the Commerce and trade I don't recognize my heart Abu Bakr so hm well I'm feeling the same ah Houston we have a problem let's go to the prophet Alam he has to solve our problems so they go to the prophet and the prophet says so what's happening repeats his statement what did the prophet sayam he said hamdah are you out of your mind if you were at your house with your kids and wives like you are with me here the Angels would descend from the heavens and you will see them walk walking in the streets with your own eyes and you will shake hands with them you will reach a level of Iman that Allah would uplift the veil and you can see the angels in broad daylight and this is not possible no one can see the angels in broad daylight but this is the prophet commenting meaning one hour for your Lord that you have to strive to reach the highest level of IM man as a human being you need another hour to earn to mix with your wife and your children and your Commerce and attend your daily routine you you're a human being you're not an angel soah faced this fluctuation of Iman Abu Bakr faced the same fluctuation and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam confirmed it yet comforted us that this is totally normal so don't ever think that you can maintain this high level of Iman forever but you strive to make the best of it so once it goes down you uplifted so that when your call comes when the angel of death comes you're in good hands now the companions may Allah be pleased with them and this again when you want to compare Apple to Apple this is too much there are two stories in the bukari and Muslim different companions all together but the same conclusion one story was about Abu may Allah be pleas pleas with him and Salman Al fari in the beginning how much time do I have for each question no see when I'm happy which I AMD because I haven't seen anyone sleep yet this means I'm okay I'm I'm I'm captivating the audience I like to speak but as an old grandfather I sometimes become boring I can speak and speak and speak but I don't want to bore people if we time limited so I have to know exactly when to stop so um you can you can sh everyone is enjoying he's the captain so I'm I'm just just the co-pilot so in the beginning when the prophet migrated to Medina Alam the migrants from meccah were Stone broke so in order to make a social blend and the prophet made the Brethren between a migrant and the ansar he choose one from here one from here okay you Brothers one of you dies he inherits the other that was in the beginning but then it was abrogated and only your heirs can inherit youas the Brotherhood remains but no inheritance so among those Brethren was Salman Al Pharisee and Abu D Abu D was from Medina ansar Salman was not from meca but he came all the way from Persia Iraq Syria and was sold as a slave to Jews and you know his story I don't think so but assume assume yeah give them the benefit of the doubt so they became Brethren one day Salman Al fari visited his brother's house and he wasn't there and this was before the hijab was mandated so he saw his wife but he saw that she wasn't properly dressed taking care of her self you know any women sometimes glow even if they're wearing the hijab you know taking care of their skin and the body lotion their hair their makeup it's he saw that this woman was not interested so he asked what what's wrong she said your brother Sal Abu D has no interest in women he he prays all night long and he fasts every single day not missing skipping one day so when will he have time for hky puny no time because he's either sle uh praying or fasting there's no time so he said hm okay when Salman when Abu D came back home he saw his brother he embraced him he invited him to eat so Salman said okay you eat first he said no I'm fasting said break your fast said I'm fasting break your fast he's my guest he's my brother he's my elder brother so he broke his fast volunt fast and he ate after they prayed Isa AB all hey wait wait wait wait wait what are you doing praying night prayer from only8 hours so he said no no no sleep said but I want to pray said no no sleep so he went to sleep half an hour woke up and sleep sleep sleep until it was the last third of the night you know like an hour before fer said now you go and pray so he prayed after he finished prayer he said Abu your lord has rights over you and your body has rights over you your wife has rights over you and your relatives and your guests have rights over you so give each one its due right AB what is this humo jumo so he prayed F in the Masid then he went to the prophet he said oh prophet of Allah my brother Salman visited me and he did this and this and this and he said this and this and this the prophet said Salman said the truth The Identical story in theah happened with abdah was one of the companions accepted Islam in the eth year of Hijra one of the smartest Arabs ever known to the Arabs so he got his son and they say that his son was 14 maybe 15 years younger than him than his father so he got him married to a very reputable beautiful woman from quray couple of weeks later he goes and visits his s his daughter-in-law so he asks how's my son with you she says oh Uncle he is the best of men he prays all night and he fasts all dayas I got the message he's smart he doesn't he doesn't need any clarification immediately he went to the prophet Alat wasam and complained the prophet summoned Abdullah Abdullah came he said how much do you finish the Quran in meaning during prayer said once every night he completes from cover to cover once every night he said don't do that finish the Quran once a month this is the minimum if you don't do this you're a bad Muslim she yeah normal Muslims finish the Quran once every month new hij month they you see them in Bak end of the month and they that's why they finish the Quran 12 at at least 12 times a year usually in Ramadan they do five or six more so but let's go for the average so Abdullah says no no no I can do more than that the prophet said finish the Quran every 20 days he said no I can do more than that finish the Quran once every 10 days every day every night you only read three ju he said I can do more than that he said do it in one week he said I can do it more than that he no don't do it in another narration he said in 3 days but you will not be able to comprehend it in less than three days so 10 every night how many days do you fast he said every single day I don't skip a day from F to Sunset I'm fasting and I eat at night and then I fast the whole month said no fast 3 days every month and this is the minimum you should do otherwise you are not a good Muslim it's not mandatory don't get me wrong but you're coming here to avoid slums you want to avoid slums I'm showing you sh three days every month it's too much no it's not too much normal Muslims by the way fast Mondays and Thursdays and three days every white days nor Muslims but okay let's not go into details so he said no I can't fast more than three said fast uh uh 10 days fast this fast this fast until the prophet said fast one day and Skip One Day meaning 15 days every month he said I can do better than that he said nothing is better than that this is the best fasting the fasting of prophet dud peace be upon him then the prophet said to him exact statements that he heard from Salman to Abu D he said Abdullah your body has rights your wife has rights your uh uh um guests have rights and your uh Lord has rights so give each its due right this is the slums when they have slums to us we would love to have some of their slums that means that we are the best of the best in our generation and I hope this answers your question um another question this might be more on the personal side the similar question but you yourself in your life maybe you could share an example of uh maybe a time in your life where your IM has felt down and why what was the cause of it and how did you get back up again and back on track um if you have something you you're able to share from your personal life and personal experience no I do not speak about myself at all this is my system I do not share anything on social media about my visits my trips yeah the only thing you know about me is that I have 13 girls and 14 grandchildren and I do this just to make you feel sorry that the poor thing that's all I there's no benefit out of it but I do not talk about first of all second of all I don't remember definitely I had so many stories but I'd like to keep them to myself and I don't like to cry in front of public and make a scene out of it so ask me something beneficial okay maybe we can um ask crowd if they have any questions they about to ask the sh and he can answer them directly if they don't we leave alhamdulillah okay um um how do I start this um they said I'm intimidating now I understand why of course I'm fighting my Tyson so we we're we're from this movement called Gang it started from three Neighbors From the same neighborhood going to our mos in buket Damansara and then one day we we were at the back and then thinking how do we get from one sou to it and iten happen and then from 1,000 became 3,000 and then came 7,000 became 12,000 so how do you maintain that consistency for us to come for prayers for subo not just subo masallah okay first of all the most important thing in anything in our lives is consistency no ni Nia which is sincerity be careful because without sincerity we're just a bunch of showoffs ah did you pray fajer ah you didn't pray fuder shame on you meaning I prayed fer the second most important thing is quality over quantity so what's the use if we have 100,000 praying F no quality if you look through history you find that only quality prevails when you have strong Iman when you have sincerity when you have compliance 100% with the sun any movement I don't know about your movement with all due respect I don't know about any Movement by the way because I am a person who introvert I sit home I don't go out I don't mix with people I'm antisocial I don't I'm a boring person don't be fooled by the jokes I crack here and there I just do this to hide my uh um weakness maybe I don't know no don't believe this but anyhow so I don't know about movements but if you study movements you will find a lot of them politics how to become more popular dominating and so many of them break into different movements because of conflict of interest because of the board of directors are fighting among themselves look at mids in America in Canada the same old story dominance I want to rule I want nobody's easy no my word I have to give the speech I have to do the I have to control I have to appoint the IM I have to come down to reality you're one of the team no we're all chiefs no Indians again don't quote me I'm in Malaysia I'm not talking about Indians from India I'm talking about the red Indians this is a proverb they used to say old Chiefs you know the with the feathers H the pipe all chiefs no Indians no soldiers that go tomorrow in the newspaper wahabi cleric is saying that Indians and this and this and they're going to sue me I have to call Dr zachar n and I don't talk about politics please spare me this stuff I'm a poor Saudi coming to give a good reminder and leave so this is what breaks a good movement the lack of sincerity everybody wants to dominate and to be you know uh uh uh the vocal voice of any movement you want consistency you want to increase focus on the sincerity and the quality and make Dua Ya Allah Ya Allah make my actions sincere I don't want anyone to praise me or to compliment me I want this for your sake so if someone stands up and make better measures to increase and to have the people join in and I'm seeing the masjids are filled how do I feel inside envious oh I wish I I thought of that maybe if we close the mid and maybe turn on the lights they will not come and then what are you doing you're not sincere Muslim you're not doing it for the sake of Allah so I hope this answers some of the question Dua consistency focus on the quality and don't only make this objective to attend faj prayer and then what he missed he missed he missed no no no F we attended F we attended F no and Allah knows best any other questions from the audience I am intimidating nobody's [Applause] asking the child has a question um um my question is about um how do you balance between family and I let's say men like U we have children to take care we helping our our wife and perhaps we we are taking care of parents right um we have I mean we have different challenges at home but then if we go to some sometimes there's um that's guilty feeling that if we go to Mid then we leaving our partner or our parents at home right so it's a matter of balance how how do we do that okay first of all I did a lecture maybe 15 years ago on peace TV in in mumbay called the balance in Islam I don't recall anything of it but I advise you to watch it is a very good lecture now having said that the Hadith I narrated about Abu D and Salman your lord has rights over you your wife has rights over you your health or body has rights over you your guests have rights over you so give each its due right is a formula for Success the happiest man on Earth who can balance between all of these and I've said this before I could be the best businessman I have the logic and I have a very clear logic to know what's right and what's wrong I'm not a gambler but I know how to find Opportunities and to reduce threats and where are the weaknesses and where are the parts of strength I know a good Prospect Ive I can manage and Lead but if I do this I will be very rich shortly but it will impact my health because I can't go to the gym regularly and I can't attend my wife uh uh requests and demands and definitely not see my children because I come home late and I have no social activities so of course religion I can't pray on time because I have a business meeting F I sleep because I was until 1:00 in a meeting overseas in the Pacific and it's 14 hours 15 hours difference of timing so it was a business meeting so I had to skip fajer I can't fast three days every month because I have business lunches and so on I have to compromise my religion because there's a business meeting and there have to be women sitting from the other companies and she's a CEO I have to smile and wink every now and then and maybe she will sign the agreement maybe she drinks and okay I have to pay for the liquor and you get my point okay I'm not going to do business because it's a lot of Haram I'm going to be a Sheikh wow I have the ability you know those who are 60 years and older they know the 6 million man gentlemen we can rebuild him we can make him faster we can make him stronger we can make him so I think okay I have the ability to teach to uh uh counsel people to do this to do that and I can benefit people I can change lives I can say things that people are happy which means that I have to travel a lot I have to devote myself you know Abdullah Jin may Allah have mercy on his soul he used to conduct a at least 8 to 12 classes a day he was one of the highest levels of B that was the ranking that was 30 years ago 18 12 classes a day before fuder after fjer and then after fuder until 10:00 from 10:00 to 12:00 he takes breakfast and nap and then before after lunch before ass after ass before after till then after you crazy this was his daily routine so where did he get this Baraka this time this ability Allah puts Baraka in him but was he a good businessman of course not he did not have time on the social aspect with his wife and kids yes he had time because he was always home body wife was he a bodybuilder a good bad mingon player don't think so um and so on so okay he Masters this but nothing else you can be an athlete I can be an athlete I work I used to work 6 hours a day in the gym on daily basis 7even days a week when I was young so I did badminton I did squash I had trophies in squash I have medals and table tennis I do bodybuilding I do lots of sports karate aido and Kung Fu little little little but then what I I have to compromise my business I have to compromise my religion I have to compromise my social activ I can be the best of husbands sitting with my wife I do the cooking I do cook excellent Smash Burgers and steaks and I use a fryer to do the steaks beautiful after marinating it you will not eat any steaks after you taste mine I do this and I can sit with the kids and I can tell them bedtime stories I can do do do do but on the account of many things if I go to the Masjid my wife feels heartbroken I'm going to sit with you I'm we going to pray together I'm not going to the Masjid social activities my mom wants me to go with her to my aunt visit my wife is heartbroken no no I'll take the kids to the park Saudi Arabia it's a desert but we call it Park so I do this I do at the end of the day you cannot master all you have to compromise little little little little but be balanced the moment you're balanced you strike happiness and the happiest man on Earth is the one who can strike this balance is it achievable yeah very much very easy and with the grace of Allah I've managed to do this a lot yes I travel a lot but I also compensate my wife with the grace of Allah I take my wife two nights every single month to meca I get her a suite in the Conrad and I treat her like a queen but I abuse her the rest of the month let's let's be frank she's happy she he's happy all my relatives I call them at least once every 2 weeks single younger than me older than me I give them a call that's why we have handsfree in the car so my uh uh uh road trip is 15 minutes 20 minutes traffic jam I utilize my time my cousins my NE nephews my nieces my daughters I call everybody utilizing the time I go to the gym religiously for the past 50 years with the grace of Allah and I work out I try to but the Heart Is Made in Taiwan it's not original it's not Japanese so I do have three stance alhamdulillah but it's working till now alhamdulillah I'm not Tony Stark but it's working I try my level best to have a r in my and this is between me and Allah with the grace of Allah I have not messed it up till now so I'm constantly on the brink of the normal little minimum things the minimum things but alhamdulillah and I'm happy not not complaining I don't have debts I don't have any bu wanting anything from me financially my kids live like kings and queens yes I don't have a property I don't own a house I pay rent for two houses but I have four cars two drivers and alhamdulillah I'm living a happy life is it achievable I know everybody's achieving it but the problem is with the imbalance the moment you are she but I love my family you're going to compromise your Salat you're going to compromise your business you're going to compromise your health sh I love to to love to play sports I have to go and play with the boys every time every day we we go play soccer every single day we play cricket we play badminton okay when are you going to sit with your CH children when are you going to visit your relatives when are you going to attend your business she I love to work on business I'm a workaholic this imbalance makes you sad try to it do it and in it's achievable Allah Knows Best is there any other questions any other questions for the a quick question please um sit down um you know I say that I love Allah and I it feels genuine it feels real but whenever I get sick of any sickness whether it's a fever or something more intense I get really scared um it's like I get scared of death almost so I always ask myself then is my love for Allah real if it was real wouldn't I want to be run running towards death and um I think Allah say in the Holy Quran that if you love me you have to want that you have to think about that and so I was just not to say I'm a hypocrite but perhaps where did Allah say that um maybe Allah says I you know I could be mistaken but in the Holy Quran Allah talked about you should want like you should be thinking about that this is for the Jews Allah says inah this is for the Jews when it was prescribed to them that if you do sins you do this to kill yourselves or so so Allah challenged him so okay I'm sorry but I had to correct this before I forget it no thank you so that was my point is that is my love for Allah real okay if I I I understand your question I think you all understand the question the answer is the fear of death is natural nobody in his right mind would say oh I've done it all I'm just waiting for death this is a liar the moment he gets a flu virus he's terrified and he goes is my will written have I paid off my debts mother AA said to the prophet that we all fear death oh prophet of Allah he said no no no no this is not not the fear of death a Believer loves to meet Allah so Allah loves to meet him and a hypocrite hates to meet Allah and Allah hates to meet him this is not the fear of death we all fear the agonies the pain of death we all fear departing our loved ones we all fear leaving our home to a new apartment even if it's better it's cleaner in a better neighborhood I have emotional connection to this apartment that I've been in my apartment that I'm living in I've been living in it for the past 40 years 4 Z I'm paying rent and everybody in my family said for God's sake just move go anywhere no I can't I can't I'm emotionally attached so we don't like to change things things this is why we fear death not that we fear Allah on the contrary when any one of our loved ones dies we're saddened but we're appreciative that inshallah they're going to a better place I have no worries that inshallah this person was praying in the fer and the rest of the Salat with the JAMA in in the Masjid so I in I'm hopeful that he's in Jenna so I'm regretful to miss seeing him but I'm happy that he is in Jenna inshallah so be careful not to allow shatan to make you feel despair of Allah's mercy no we fear death but we love Allah so if I feel uh uh if I fall sick or afraid of death because I don't want to leave everything behind and I think that I can do better and this is why the prophet said the longer you live the better it is why it increases your good deeds it elevates your level in Jenna and I'll give you don't have time yes okay I'll give you a story from the authentic Sunnah one of the 10 heavenbound says two men came came from bah an area near Iran near Iraq somewhere I don't know where they were brothers and they accepted Islam and they lived with us one of them was martyred in a battle so he was a martyr and his brother lived after him one year and died on his bed says in a vision in a night dream I saw that the three of us were at the gates of Jenna and then the gates of Jenna were opened and the man who died last on his bed was admitted and the gates were closed me and the Martyr were waiting after some time the gates were opened and the Martyr came in I wanted to go come in and the angel said no no no it's not your time yet and they closed the G Gates so when he woke up he told the people about the dream the people were shocked how is it possible that the Martyr was admitted last doesn't make any sense the story reached the prophet Alam summoned T what did you see blah blah blah said so what's wrong in that in the year here that this man lived after the Martyr how many prayers did he pray how many days did he fast how many Charities did he give by Allah this is the prophet saying the difference between him and his martyr brother is like the heavens and the Earth so the longer you live the better it is for you the prophet says the best of you who his age is longer than others so you live 60 70 80 years good for you providing that his deeds are good if you're going to live 70 and you're looking around at girls and watching porn and and and doing Haram you're going to hell quickly man no matters well go and die and thirdly the prophet says that his moral conduct andl is good so many Elders when they get old like me they become grumpy grandfathers they're always on the edge shouting why did you do this why did you do that I don't want children don't watch the girl is hanging on the chandelier get her down don't the food is on the floor these are grandfathers they're grumpy no no if you want Jenna your age is long good your Deeds are good in in in the first row of the Masjid good but your moral conduct your tone it down become wise becomes become kind become loving and compassionate you will be in Jenna inshallah is more one more question I think s sorry brother there was a sister at the back that wanted to ask earlier is there a microphone the other microphone as you all know um we have to teach our children um based on their Generations right but then again when you look at generation today I do not know how to teach my child so how do we teach our children based on their generation when we see the downfall of the generation if you understand what I'm saying I do understand what you're saying but the easiest thing in this world is to put obstacles when you put obstacles in front of you you will never go anywhere number one be optimistic number two depend only on Allah not on your strength not on on your knowledge number three make a lot of Dua and number four exert all what you can and Allah will make all of your dreams true and I guarantee you now people differ from one environment and one country to the other people in America would not be the same like people in Malaysia people in Malaysia can't be the same as the people people in Yemen the different Society Community the Masjid the people they're totally totally different you have to tailor make how you upbring your child according to your environment so first of all the worst thing ever invented in mankind is social media iPad uh smart phones stupid phones and and the like because they are time consuming and Shan is next to you the moment you see the Sheikh opening it and giving his back to the wall know that he's watching something Haram why if I'm not watching something Haram I would be in front of you and everybody's seeing the moment you see your child doing this acknowledge so you can't stop them can you now schools force you to let them do their homeworks and textbooks and everything on this so how can you monitor it there are some softwares but it's not necessarily going to work our children they're so smart Allah yeah my grandchild four years of age does this and I don't know what's happening she she comes to me 40 years of age um grandpa what's what's the pin number what's the the internet passcode I only recently learned this I'm a dinosaur but these guys know how to do things so it's something that you have to work around some people I used to do this with my kids you have time to watch your iPhone or your your um social media between and an hour and a half that's it after internet is unplugged you don't have a network that 5G or 4G you're depending on the Wi-Fi it's done so they know they limit themselves to this in summer vacation all the children have to revise 5 to 10 pages a day of memory because 12 of my girls memorize the Quran by heart but after school everything evaporates if you don't force them it will go this is Quran the prophet said that it is easily forgotten as easily as a camel that is untied would run away so you have to maintain it if you don't memorize it and revise it over and over it flows away you have to make a good righteous companionship for your children children if your children have best buddies in the street you don't know of they'll teach him how to smoke how to watch Haram things how to listen to Haram things but when you live in a compound and everybody in this compound pray in the Masid with the and they go to they attend classes Etc you at least hope that the children would be like their parents so I'm trying my level best to put my child in a good environment school it has to be an Islamic school if you can afford it and some schools are well known to be real Islamic schools some schools are just Islamic like banks by name they Islamic school and they have music they have ballet they have free mixing duh what Islamic school is this say sh they're dancing ballet but with the thank you very much no you have to be selective so with these and you know your your environment your circumstances so each one has to do their level best with the Dua with uh uh depending and relying on Allah with thinking positively of Allah and Allah will never ever turn you down inshallah the brother want to ask I have a question probably uh little bit technical question in regards to Salah can you teach us uh what it means by b or innovation in Salah and um I'm attaching this to a Hadith uh that I'm reading in regards to when uh the prophet is praying in congregation with sallu alai wasallam is in uh ation with um um and from his position of R and then when he comes out he says and someone says yeah which implies um or implies to me that probably the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam haven't Tau anyone or said anything uh to that particular person yet so what in context of what would be b or what's the limitation uh can you teach us something about this it's very easy it's a b but because the prophet approved it it became Sunnah now if I do it today something new I say after and I say uh Hallelujah and I say it's good it calls the Christians to come and accept Islam uh do I have anyone to approve it no no then this is this is taking you astray this is rejected so whatever was done at the time of the prophet he approves it it becomes a Sunnah if he disapproves it we know that it's wrong for example may Allah be pleased with him prays is with the prophet goes to his tribe because he's the most learned one he leads them in Isa for them but he prolonged the by reciting Bak one of the companions F praying behind him said this is too long he left the Salat continued on his own and went to his farm cuz he has to irrigate his farm and go to sleep following morning he has to work after the prayer was over the good samans went to Mu said the guy left you and he prayed on his own so mad said he's a hypocrite the same good samans went to the man said says you're a hypocrite so the man said I'm a hypocrite okay he went to the prophet and he said a prophet of Allah m is doing so and so and so this is taking too long if the prophet said you have done a good job mu that would have been a Sunnah the prophet said are you causing chaos and F between the Muslims he was very angry when you pray and lead the prayer shorten your prayer so that those behind you there are the sick there are the elderly there are those who have errands to attend to would find it suitable so mu learned his lesson another man in the Salat and this is a good example for you inshallah and us to learn exactly how to differentiate in the Salat they're praying a man sneezes and he says alhamdulillah and the man next to him says the companions were outraged whoa so they started looking at him in Salat you know in Salat they used to look they used to talk in the beginning they used to talk in the congregation you join the congregation hey boy what's happening he said I'm cool and you go join the Salat until Allah says stand up to Allah in silence so that was prohibited so the man when he saw that the companions are looking at him said he said it loudly why are you looking at me may Allah make me die so that my mother becomes uh the mother of someone who's dead so the companions started doing this yeah he shut the heck up so the guy Kal zipped it after the Salat the prophet said bring the boy so they brought the man he said my nephew the the son of my brother these this prayer was not done to communicate and speak like this it was only for Quran and so the companion said by Allah the prophet did not reprimand me did not say harsh words to me those what no one more uh uh tolerant and merciful than him now the prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam advised the man who said what he didn't advise the man who said which means when you sneeze you say alhamdulillah it's not a b see the difference the one that was wrong the prophet corrected the one was okay the prophet left alone so I hope this answers your question inshallah thank you uh and one more question maybe how how long are we going to the last one last one last one so this question is on behalf of my friend um she said as she increases her I like her Salah fasting reading the Quran going to classes and Etc instead of becoming more energized there there and then is when she started to feel the slump in during this I so my question would be is there a hypocrisy in her I or is she sinning while she's doing her I that makes her feel this slump as she's um progressing towards this part you know that I do counseling sessions and I charge people money that's how I balance alhamdulillah and this money I don't take for my knowledge I take for my time when you demand half an hour of my time of my children's time and my gym time you have to pay yeah you pay peanuts you get monkeys you pay $10 you get monkey you pay $100 you get a gorilla anyhow in my counseling sessions I tell people why do you have depression why do you have anxiety why do you have OCD why do you have Whispers people don't go to the basics okay Enlighten us I'm going to give you some of my secrets of my trade but inshallah it's all for the good someone who's 60 or 70 years of age how many pages does he have in his resume his CV five 10 20 with the training sessions and so maybe how many pages does Satan have gazillion since time of Adam till date he knows every thought that crosses your mind he knows everything that goes into your mind your weaknesses your strength how to make you fall he has all the time in the world until the day of judgment his only mission and vision in life to get you on board in Hellfire simple as that agree how does he do that he does it through Whispers so don't ever think for a second that you're saved or that you can have it made without any Whispers no one on earth lives without Shan's whispering to him and these Whispers increase as long as you increase getting closer to Allah so many of us were not practicing true when you were not practicing did you have these Whispers that you're having today no huh this is unanimous all saying W she when I did not pray on time I was happy I didn't have these problems when I used to watch movies when I used to be negligent where I had no now I pray I pray five times a day I prayah I do this I read the Quran and I am overwhelmed I know the more you get closer to Allah the more shatan raises the influence and The Whispers so what to do you have two options give up and go back to your slums or increase in your I and your fight so he increases in his Whispers until you reach a breaking point where it's not feasible anymore a little bit more you're going to be with the companions what does Satan do he calls his thugs he says listen back off back off it's not feasible anymore the guy is he's going to jna so back off leave him don't whisper give him two three months he lets his guard down we attack again and this is the Vicious Cycle that is happening with me and with you sometimes I get Whispers of Shan by the way all the time but he may linger for 2 three seconds and leaves so you're dangerous no no you know I might accept Islam if I talk to you no no no I'm leaving he leaves some people he lingers with them for a week or two and some of them feel weak and fall prey to his attempts and give up this is why you need companionship you need mentorship you need a sister to remind the sisters a brother to remind the brothers and you need a community because the moment you're alone and the sister who asked the question most likely she's focusing on her I but not on her Sisterhood and everyone who comes to me I say to them with all due respect do you have a contact list on your phone yes how many said maybe 500 how many practicing two or three only yes how often do you hang out with them once a year seriously this is our problem we know one another but we don't hang out together we don't attend or Circles of knowledge we don't I have a buddy or two okay every couple of months let's go for us boys only okay we go on a journey of faith I shouldn't have used this we go on a journey of IM and we go to omra for two weeks we go to Medina we go together we pray together we wake one another we we sit between and we we boost our IM we come back how do we come back no strong is not is an understatement we come as firm as a mountain in imman for 3 four months then the thugs are back let's go for again let's go for a retreat let's go for this let's so the more you have an environment people around around you to hang out with to strengthen your IM to vent to to share things with you your IM man is as quick as a rocket and as high as it could be with the grace of Allah and Allah knows best we've now come to the end of our event we would like to express a profound gratitude to for most beneficial insightful sharing session for many more sessions to come our heartfelt thanks go to the organizing committee for the tiess effort and also to all our sponsors for the kind and generous contribution thank you one and all for this event can we leave what do we do sleep sh request from an organiz committee to take a photo with you uh organizing committee only males I don't take pictures with
