  "transcript": "i am working at a travel company and there is a there is a most of them there is christians in there working and there are few muslims and uh uh the christians working there there are there is one person who always uh talks behind behind the muslims i mean sometimes when the other muslims are not around and i'm there he talks with the other muslims are the christians saying uh we need to feed pope to the muslims and we need to uh you know he talks bad about the muslims basically so it really uh i'm trying to control my patients but getting is going beyond the limits here so in this case what do we do here you are living in a cafe country yes yes i'm living in a country so what's what's new he's a kafir and he is following what he was up brought to do this is how they live this is how they behave treachery and deceit is how they deal with others so for you when you learn about this you warn the muslims of him and you say to them that this person says so and so about islam about us beware of him try not to communicate with him boycott him and show him that you don't like what he's doing and this is simple this is your simple right in defending your belief you're not resulting to violence you're not doing something that is illegal he's backbiting he's slaundering his saying bad things you can warn muslims and non-muslims alike from this person who has two faces i don't see any problem in that but you have to control your temper because not every country or situation allows you to express your anger so if that that was in a country that's tolerant then maybe yes but if you were in a if you're in a country that might indict you or put you in jail for what you had done even if you were right then you should refrain from that just to be safe rather than to be sorry and allah knows best you"
