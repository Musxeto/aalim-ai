  "transcript": "is my salah valid behind an imam who says takbir of movement after he has reached the next position and not while moving this is a technical issue why do we say it's a technical issue because there's nothing specific that states that the prayer is invalid if you said the takbir in the beginning or in the end or in the middle we know that you have to move from one pillar to the other and that you have to say takbir while moving so if a person and this happens a lot in masjids where you have the microphone and when the imam finishes recitation he doesn't want to go down saying allahu akbar in the voice his voice would be a little bit weak so some of them inshallah for good intentions not that they want the voices to be loud and clear in loudspeakers i hope that this is not the case so after the finished recitation he finishes that um of course half of the message if not all have already been into record before him and this is totally wrong some of them to avoid this after finishing he goes to the full extent of the raku and says while he's in the position of and this is also wrong because technically because this is what the jurors say technically it's called takbiratul intikal this is takbir for movement it has to be between the pillars not in the beginning of it because then it would be while you're standing and not when you are in the core because that would be in record it should be in between however it is not at all correct to say that a person who defies this and says it while standing or while in the raku or while in the sujud that his prayer is invalid no the prayer is valid he is mistaking he's mistaken in doing this and he should be advised nevertheless the prayer is valid insha'allah you"
