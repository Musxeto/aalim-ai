  "transcript": "how do we thank people it's very easy express your feelings payback by doing good things to them saying a good word the hadith the Prophet says RA salatu salam whoever does you a favor repay him as much as you can and if you cannot repay him then make duaa for them until you feel this suffices make duaa how easy is that very easy and the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam whoever does you a favor and you say to him jazakallahu khayran then he has exceeded in thanking and appreciating him the word is very little jazakallahu khayran what does it mean may Allah reward you with goodness this is dua so you give me a favor you do me a favor you help me change the tire thank you this is not any bringing satisfaction but when you say may Allah reward you Allahu Akbar that I would expect my compensation to come from Allah if you compensate me peanuts but when Allah compensates me and rewards me this is beyond my imagination and this is why it is an old habit of mine that whenever someone does something to me I make dua for them and I say it without intending it oh sure this is not reward about we coming back to the same problem the issue of reward and intention the brothers have any confusion in that maybe I did not display it correctly maybe people have sensitivity towards it let me go back to my topic later on we will discuss it in Shona so it's a habit that whenever someone does something to me I thank them by giving dois and I intend the door but I don't pay attention to it but it has an overwhelming impact on them and when I consider what I say that's nice I would love people to say this to me I say allahu al they go for Allah Allah may Allah have mercy on your parents and forgive you for anything and the people take a step back and say just how come my hair may Allah reward you for these beautiful words I don't pay attention to saying it and having this impact but believe me a word has a strong impact on people so showing your appreciation especially to the nearest and closest people to you has a profound impact"
