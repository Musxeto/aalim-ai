  "transcript": "Ahnaf from Bangladesh So Sheikh, what is the ruling on painting statues of living creatures and earning money from it? The person who painted, who didn't make it him themselves, but they just painted it? Allah the Almighty says in Surah Al-Ma'idah in the beginning, So he says, O you who believe, you have to collaborate upon righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate upon vice and transgression. The Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam also said that the most tormented people on the day of judgment are those who make such images, sculptures, and those who draw portraits of living creatures. They are the most tormented people on the day of judgment. Allah tells them to give life to what they've created and they won't be able to do so. Therefore, when you collaborate with such people by painting it, by maybe softening the surface, beautifying it, by carrying it, you are sharing a great amount of sin with them because you're helping them. And whoever assists and helps on evil will get a fair amount equal to that evil, as well as whoever assists and helps on righteousness and virtue will get a similar amount of such righteousness and virtue and good deeds with the grace of Allah. I hope this answers your question. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
