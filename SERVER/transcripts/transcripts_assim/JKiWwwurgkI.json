  "transcript": "well okay uh Sheikh my question is uh me and my dad and also my brother we all want to pray Isha at majut but our mother is alone at home and also it takes more time today is the Ramadan and we have to break around so what should we do okay first of all this is not something that is scary or your mom is so little that cannot be left alone unattended if your mom was a a toddler I would say okay there's no one to take care of her but your mom is a grown-up woman if she needs to be attended 24 hours seven days a week as in the case of someone who's bedridden and may face a life-threatening issues if left unattended in this case yes one of you has to stay behind and this would not be only for Asia that would be 24 hours seven days a week but if alhamdulillah she's only scared there's nothing to be scared of or she is only lonely wanting someone to sit with her no this is not a legitimate reason all of you have to go to the Masjid and come back insha Allah and nothing will happen"
