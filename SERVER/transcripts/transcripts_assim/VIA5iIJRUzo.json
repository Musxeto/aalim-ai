  "title": "Threshold (Nisab) of Gold and Silver for Zakat - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "allah azza wajal mandated that we give zakat whenever we have gold silver or whatever carries their role so what is the threshold of gold scholars say after long means of calculation that the threshold of gold is 85 grams of 24 karat gold so if I have in my position to an 84 grams of 24 karat gold I do not have to pay the cut if I have 85 I have to give 2.5% of that after one lunar year is completed okay what about if I have a hundred should I give 2.5% of the whole hundred or only for what exceeds the 85 which is the 15 grams no you have to give the whole thing if I have a kilogram 2.5% that's a lot of money yes but the one who gave me the kilogram of gold also is so generous with you and did not say that this is a lot of money what about if it's less than 24 carats of gold if you have 85 grams but it is 20 carat of gold there's no zakat because the difference between 20 and 24 these 4 is made of copper of or other metals so the 20 karat gold is not 100 percent pure it has impurities mixed with it and this is why you have to do the calculation by multiplying the amount you have by 20 and dividing it by 24 and then you will have the actual what about if I have silver okay the threshold of silver is 595 grams of silver the same concept apply less than 595 there's no zakat whatever goes above there is a cat providing that it completed a whole loaner year in your possession"
