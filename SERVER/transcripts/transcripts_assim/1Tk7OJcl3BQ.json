  "title": "Reciting the Fatiha behind the Imam (loud & silent prayers) | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Phyllis says chef you said in an earlier time that one must finish reciting al-fatiha quickly even when Imam does require because without finishing al-fatiha prayer is invalid what if the Imam goes to recur as soon as I say takbir at Allah Haram or even seconds after reciting al-fatiha what should I do since there would be no time to finish the syrup basically for the last question was about reciting the fatiha behind the Imam if the raka is loud which means that the Imam has read the fatiha loudly we have no problem with that whether you come in the beginning whether you come in the middle or the end of that particular raka the most authentic opinion is the opinion of the Maliki school of thought which states that as long as the Imam had recited it loudly this surprises for the followers not to recite it if you want to recite it happen but if you don't your prayer is valid our issue is with the silent raka if I join the Imam in this raka from the beginning and he made Recor before I finished my raka this means there is one of two either he is too fast or am too slow if he is too fast this means that the whole congregation will complain and say oh hey I could not read my Fatiha the Imam was too fast in this case you guys have to go and speak to the Imam and if needed you have to change the Imam because his prayer is invalid he cannot recite it this quick well the hook of the congregation are suffering but this can't affect your prayer meaning if he goes to record you recite your fatiha as quick as possible even if he raises his head from the rock or you go and afterwards and catch up with him because there is no fault on you but if you were too slow then then we have a problem and if you're too slow this Raqqa which the Imam made Recor and raised his head from record before you catch up with him is invalid and this is your problem you have to work on reciting it quickly now this is in the scenario where you and the Imam began reciting the Fathead together there is a second scenario which is if you joined in this Rekha late so I came into the Masjid they mem was in the third Rekha which is the silent record by the time I was in the row and i said allah akbar al hamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen Devin said Allahu Akbar and went for record now I have one of two choices either if I'm quick in it and I can finish my Fatiha in couple of seconds or three seconds knowing totally that I will be able to be in the position of record with the Imam so be it so once he goes for Roku I say hundred or by me not him malakoma t near can we do Christian mythology and I'm telling you later model very model body I mean a look how old long did it take two three four seconds and the Imam is still saying subhanAllah be loving if a lot of people say whoa this is too fast I can't recite it this quick and the Imam will raise his head in this case you're exempt it just say Allahu Akbar and egregore sure I didn't finish Fatiha no problem because the time was limited it's not your mistake you came in late and likewise and this is even by default if you came while the Imam is in record so the thing you do is Allahu Akbar takbeer Allahu Akbar you go for record no fatiha no door at least if there no other store never ain't nothing you just go for record so I hope this clarifies it one if you joined the Imam from the beginning of the silent raka either he's too fast or you too slow too if you join the Imam late so there is not enough time for you to recite the fatiha because you joined in late or the Imam is already in Recor and I hope this clarifies it a bit"
