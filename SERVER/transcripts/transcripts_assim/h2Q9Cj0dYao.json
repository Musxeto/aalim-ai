  "transcript": "she says what's the ruling on swearing with other than allah swearing with other than allah is divided into two types minor shirk and major shirk so minor shirk is when you swear by other than allah randomly or not believing that that person you're swearing by can fulfill the things that allah can fulfill and you don't believe in him as you believe in allah azza for example people swear by al amana they say amanda they swear by the prophet like in egypt they always say with nevi and none of them intend that the prophet sallam is equivalent to allah that we can swear by him but it's something that is random used on their tongues this is prohibited some in syria and jordan and in lebanon like nariman is calling from they say usharaf all of this is haram this is miner because they don't believe that they are equivalent to allah azzawajal but rather they use this now sometimes a person may believe that the one who he is swearing by is equivalent to allah and this is total major shirk so and they give the scholars give an example if you caught a thief red hat uh red-handed and he said i didn't swear i didn't swear you said to him swear by allah he said well i didn't that is i didn't steal let me rephrase that i hope they edit it i don't think they're going to do that so he says i didn't steal so he swears by allah he did not steal so a smart person who knows the thief he says swear by al-badawi or by al-jilani or by ali and the guy says oh no no now it's getting serious no i can't yeah i did steal this is shirk why because he glorifies them similarly to his glorification of allah or even more and this is major shirk and i hope this answers your question you"
