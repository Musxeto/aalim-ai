  "transcript": "Shake I have a question regarding recitation during Salah so my question is if I'm being alone if I'm praying alone at home does the recitation during Salah does it have to be such that I have to hear an audible whisper or is it sufficient to just move my tongue without any audible whisper so what is the minimal requirement for reciting silently when I'm alone or within the congregation the minimal requirement is to just simply move your tongue and lips so if you just do this that is more than sufficient and it's valid 100 percent however it is a bit recommended that you hear yourself and this adds a great deal of for sure and concentration to your prayer so actually when you say it's a whispering like I can hear without annoying those next to me some people unfortunately can't control this so you may be praying next to a brother and he would say alhamdulillah thinking that he only can hear while two or three people to his right and left are also participating and listening unwillingly to him and this is annoying a lot of the people may be annoyed by this after the Salah probably they'll pick a fight I couldn't recite my own fatty how you you're distracting us keep it down and they're right so you should keep it down so if you don't make it a sound at all your prayer is totally fine and if you make a hissing sound where you can distinguish a little bit your own recitation that is more like it and and better insha Allah"
