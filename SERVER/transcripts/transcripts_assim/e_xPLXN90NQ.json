  "title": "Is it permissible 2 get riba / interest based student loans that offer some leniency assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I get student loans in Germany and I have to pay the half back five years after my good duration but only until â‚¬10,000 so if I get more than 20,000 I only have to pay 10,000 back and that's also my case I got more than 20,000 so actually what I will get in future I don't have to pay anything back from it but recently I found out that there is a late fee payment when paying it bet when paying it back but uh if you don't have enough money you can postpone the repayment without paying interest and so actually you have to pay the late fee only if you have money but don't pay or if you don't tell them that you have that you don't have enough money so my question is can I continue to get these student loans first of all it is not permissible to get student loans that is riab based so any loan that is offered to you by the the government or by any educational institution that requires you to pay them back with one dime extra as riba this is Haram whether they say that if you get this much amount as an income after graduation or more if you do don't do this we exempt you after 20 years if if if as long as there is the condition to pay them extra this is Haram and it's not permissible for you to opt for such loans"
