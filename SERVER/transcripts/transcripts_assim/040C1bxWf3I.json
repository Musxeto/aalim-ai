  "title": "Best time to make Dua on Friday for Dua Acceptance",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from the US the prophet Alam said and I quote Friday is 12 hours in which there is no muslim who asks Allah for something except that he will give it to him so seek the last hour after user end quote some Scholars have also call this specific hour the hour of response shake what I wanted to ask you today was at what specific hour is the hour of response during Friday after user that one should try to invoke Allah for something is there also a specific amount of Ras one has to pray during this hour as well before invoking Allah first of all it is uh worth noting that when the word hour is mentioned in Arabic it means a moment of time a period of time and not the hour which we translate it to English to mean a 60 Minute this is not the case so an hour means a moment of time and when you come to this Hadith the vast majority say that this particular moment of time is the last minutes of the day of a Friday just before Sunset and this is the time where lots of the Muslims go to the Masjid and they sit and raise their hands and invoke Allah after praising Allah subhah wa ta'ala and offering salutation upon the prophet Alam and they ask Allah for their needs do we pray the answer is of course not because this is a restricted time of prayer and the Hadith in sah Muslim which corresponds to this meaning and it's mentioned that a man praying and making Dua praying here means to make Dua and not to stand up in offering the units the two units of Salat of prayer that are known to us because the prophet prohibited Alat offering any prayer that is voluntary that has no reason after offering till the sun sets so this is a time of prohibition and Knows Best"
