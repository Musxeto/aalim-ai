  "title": "Praying Absentee funeral prayer on the one who was already prayed on? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now another trend in some message is that they offer the funeral prayer for an absentee someone who's absent so they say my uncle died in London and I can't go to witness the funeral he was buried last week so please can we make said yeah after a shall we make funeral prayer on a person who's absent this is not permissible why she isn't it is not permissible well don't you know share that the Prophet Isis am performed the funeral a prayer on the Najah she the Abyssinian ruler and he wasn't there yes this was true it was a single incident and the scholars said that the prophet alayhi salatu salam offered the funeral prayer because anna ja she did not have any muslim around him so when he died though he is a Muslim he was buried by non-muslims they were no other Muslim around him so nobody offered the salat to begin with and hence scholars say that whenever a deceased corpse has been preyed upon by Muslims we cannot pray in other countries for that deceased but if he was to die in a country and to be buried without the presence of any Muslim to give him his rights funeral rites in this case yes we can do that and I hope this answers your question"
