  "title": "How to avoid doing congregational dua (innovation) at masjid (waiting for ishraq)? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says you said that when the congregation is engaged in congregational dua or vikir or etc i should leave them what about if i'm staying in the masjid waiting for ishraq for the sun to rise how can i leave the message and lose the reward no leaving them meaning to leave their circle so if you go at the back of the masjid and remain away from them engaged in reading the quran doing your decade this is okay and nothing wrong about that"
