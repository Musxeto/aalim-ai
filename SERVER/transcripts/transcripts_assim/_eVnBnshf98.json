  "title": "They say we must not pray any prayer when adhan is being called, is it true? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "someone told me that I should not begin prayer as well the other is being called and that I should either begin it before the other or after it is it has completed is it authentic what kind of prayers are you doing okay first of all it is not permissible to offer fault prayers before the Adan so the instruction that was given to you is invalid to tell you that you should pray either before or after that then for prayer it is invalid if you pray Maghrib prayer 30 seconds before Sunset 30 seconds your prayer is invalid secondly what they told you that it is not permissible to pray while the Adan is ongoing is totally bogus and wrong whether you're praying Fork prayers or are you praying or voluntary prayers while the Adan is being called whatever you pray is valid thirdly is it best the answer is no why because we know the great reward that the prophet has placed over repeating after them every statement he says when he says twice and likewise and then we say at the conclusion and we offer salutation upon the prophet and then we ask Allah and whoever does this will achieve the intercession of the Prophet is the day of judgment so who in his right mind would jeopardize this great reward and pray for Sunnah when he can delay this couple of minutes until the Adan is over and he says and then prays nevertheless if a person insists and praise while Adan is being called the prayer is totally valid"
