  "transcript": "farooq from sweden and my second question is uh regarding my so i have a sister that wants to sell some clothes and she tells me that her clothes are a bit revealing and she fears that if she sells it to someone that person may use the clothes in an inappropriate way and she asks for the ruling of that is it permissible to sell it basically okay i will answer inshallah okay second question his sister has some revealing clothes now alhamdulillah she's a hijabi she repented and she's afraid that if she sells these clothes somebody would use them inappropriately so what to do such clothes if you do not know who's going to buy them and you have no hint none whatsoever it is permissible to sell why because there is a possibility that i may buy it for my wife that my uh um sister would buy it for her husband that my daughter would buy it for her husband so they're wearing it for halal things they're allowed to reveal themselves to their spouses and this is hella what's wrong in that so if you do not have a clue who's going to buy it or how they're going to use it it's permissible to sell if you know for certain that whoever is going to buy it is going to use it for haram it is totally haram for you to sell it there is a way that you may be inclined to know so if someone comes to you in a shop where i sell lingeries for example or not laundries revealing clothes and someone who's non-hijabi nanny wearing revealing clothes wants to buy a mini skirt selling it is haram sheikh maybe she's going to buy it for her sister who's going to wear it for her husband i'm more inclined to believe that she's going to wear it herself and she doesn't care about haram hence selling it when in in doubt is haram but when you don't have knowledge at all who's going to buy it from you and what they're going to buy it for then it is permissible to sell and allah knows best you"
