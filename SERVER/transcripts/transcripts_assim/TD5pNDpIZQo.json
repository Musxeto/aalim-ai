  "transcript": "how are you alhamdulillah okay I want to ask you about upholding TI of kinship and you said something which made big impact you said I might not know my second cousins at all and this if I follow this makes this makes things much easier now I have like a another specific specific question is it okay if I don't know my parents cousins at all like they are not angry at it's just it's just the culture so in Germany it's like non-muslim culture and in rocco it's I don't know whe whether it's normal but I think most of them I I didn't see them ever and like is it also okay so just this question is it okay if I don't know them at all no problem if you don't get to see them if you don't get to talk to them if you don't visit them if they live in another country there's no problem but if they live in the same neighborhood and they share the same name with your father and your mother and they're male to you just give giving them a call or visiting them or honoring your kinship would be fine but yes if they don't meet they don't visit you don't see one another you don't interact except in eids every blue moon or if they live in a foreign country there's no problem in that inshallah Zakaria from"
