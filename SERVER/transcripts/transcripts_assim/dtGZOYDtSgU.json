  "transcript": "my question for today is I went to a new MID to pray and I I'm I'm pretty certain that the IM in this fa he says instead of so I don't know how like is is theat valid or not okay first of all the utterance of the letters b and is very close and the exit and the are very similar and they resemble one another it's very close so for example the verse in [Music] Surah two different words one with a which does not have a stick and one was with a see I take my tongue out well the first one is and the language of Arabic is known as the language of the because it's the only language that contains this letter do so the right way to say it [Music] is now a lot and I mean a lot of the people in Arabia they say and this to some may be a distortion of the fa however if I recall correctly in the very beginning of of he mentioned this fact and said that the utterance of two the two letters are resembling one another and it is Forgiven and likewise the famous well-known reciters of the Quran say that this is a fact and some even in the Haram may do this uh um quote unquote mistake because this is how they were brought up and those who listen to it would not say they said a different word rather it's a but there's a it's very close therefore the prayer is valid inshallah and you have no problem with that"
