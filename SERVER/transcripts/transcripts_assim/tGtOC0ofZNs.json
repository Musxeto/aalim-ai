  "transcript": "eve from the uk um i am a reaver to islam and i've got my mother and my father now muslim of course may allah um they getting old and it's making me worried um i don't know if the if the death would occur my family already think that i'm kind of weird being muslim i don't know how my siblings would take it if i would not attend a funeral so anything of that nature also the weddings are coming and um my brother well my sister my brother i think they're planning to get married so i'm not sure how to tell them that i am not supposed to really attend your weddings too so i just don't know how to break they know i'm not celebrating christmas or bad just anything that uh they're getting used to it but i don't know how to represent them islam but we not that where we actually what we do is pride we've been through discussion so many times like that but i just don't know do not be rude to them as well i don't know what to do with the weddings or funerals or anything of that nature especially with this family okay eve first of all we don't have a say in these things this is part of our religion and it's part of our testing so if they're not fine with you not free mixing with your cousins and with your uh brother-in-law for example if they're not fine with you wearing the hijab if they're not fine with you not sitting with them when they're having some red wine after dinner or celebrating something and drinking champagne and giving a toast this is something that you can't help this is part of your religion this is the red line that we cannot cross this is what we say oh you who are disbelievers i don't worship what you worship you don't worship what i worship and so on this is the distinction and the dividing line between us so being a true muslim yes you mix with them you meet your siblings you're happy for them to getting married you give them advice you come every single day and say oh i like this address i don't well within the boundaries of sharia and give them advice how to be a good wife and to be obedient wife while giving them dawah etc blah blah blah telling them up front that with all this love you have to them you have love greater to allah and to your religion which tells you not to attend such weddings so make it clear to them you're happy you're giving them gifts you're trying your level best to help but without participation as for the funerals they know your parents know that it is not permissible for us muslims to participate in the funeral of a non-muslim relative or a loved one nevertheless i'm at their bedside 24 7 trying to help them try to assist them try to do all what i can to serve them but what's clear in our religion must be followed and that is we do not participate in your funerals and we do not participate in your weddings and you can see and tell that we love you we are compassionate about you we do our level best to please you and to help you and to assist you but when it comes to our borderlines that were set by our religion we cannot trespass or go across that and may allah make things easy this is your test from allah azzawajal some pass some fail to do so i pray to allah that he makes you among those who pass and succeed in conveying the message to them through the right channels and the right behavior insha'allah you"
