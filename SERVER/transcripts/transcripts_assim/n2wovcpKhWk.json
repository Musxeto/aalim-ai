  "transcript": "gelareh mana raheem alhamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa ABD he was allah he nabina muhammad while he was happy he had Jemaine the prophet sallallaahu re you re wa salem once asked his companions he said shall I tell you what is better for you than your prayer your fasting and giving of charity of course the Prophet al-islam was talking about voluntary prayers fasting and charity because nothing is better than the fault or the obligations that Allah so L had commanded us to do so the Companions said yes o prophet of allah the prophet told them to reconcile between two fighting factions reconciliation between the fighting factions or the people who have disputes among them hatred enmity who have boycotted one another who are not in contact as they used to be either due to a quarrel that took place a misunderstanding or for any other reason reconciling between them is among the best deeds it's more important and it's better than voluntary deeds of prayer night prayer fasting etc to the extent that Islam compensated a person who is reconciling between two families two tribes two fighting factions or groups Islam compensated him for his financial loss in the process so if there were two fighting tribes and I come and I reconcile between them and in order to do this I had to pay money for a number of sheep to be slaughtered and invite them to a meeting of reconciliation Islam says I can take from zakat money even if I'm wealthy I'm still eligible to get payments of the cat from the Muslims to compensate my loss not only that Islam allows and permits a person in his efforts to reconcile to lie imagine lying which is a major sin but it is permitted in three cases and one of them when a person reconciles between the two so I go to this person and I lie to him and tell him that the other person whom he is not talking to said so many things about you and they were all positive and good and he said that you were so generous and so kind and so loving and caring had it not been for Shaitaan both of you were would have been best friends and you convince him that he said that and then you go to him and you say the same thing about the other person so that you can manage to get them close together imagine the great reward though you may spend a lot of time doing so but imagine the immense reward that Allah has for you if you do this when a man is fighting with his wife and is about to divorce her and you try your level best to reconcile between them when she is adamant on seeking color and separation and you comfort her heart and show her the good things in him so that they can come back together reconciling between opposite sides is something that is highly praised in Islam or Salaam alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
