  "transcript": "about a concept of algebra what a deal Geor means that I criticize a person showing the bad things of him at a deal is praising someone to indicate that he is trustworthy this concept was used by the scholars of hadith like Imam Bihari like memory Razia upon etc what do they do they come to the narrator's of the hadith the chain of the narrators and they tell us about a person when he was born how he acquired his hadith and knowledge who are his shoe who are his students and they tell us what grade is he so is he premium grade we can learn from him without any problem so his Phaeton adilyn ceptin half of or is he someone that was ok when reading from his books but whenever he narrated something from his memory then he was not that reliable because his memory wasn't that good or is he not to be trusted because he was a man of innovation he was a roughly for example automata silly or he was from the Huaraz and he lied when he narrated the hadith etc so they gave us a full portrait of these narrators of the hadith lately since the 90s we have seen a surfacing of students of knowledge who wanted to implement this concept of al-jihad a deal on everybody so anyone people learned from they would do the giant ideal neglecting the fact that they themselves are not Imams to be reckoned with they don't have the righteousness and piety and fear of Allah like the our predecessors and they started having these criticism of anyone on the arena and they started making noise and if you look at what they give to the masses of the Muslims you find zero nothing all what comes from them does not benefit the masses of the Muslims does not teach the masses of the Muslims or what they do is they criticize this scholar this day this Mufti this this and they just slander people gossip about people and they're like flies the only see trash and they fall upon it and feed upon it so even if a brother had spent all of his life teaching Islam al-qaeda tafseer filk doing a wonderful job and people are benefitting from him this would be but on 2001 he said so and so and so and so and they caught a mistake he made okay would you overlook the mistake of he would you advise the brother between you and him no a mistake that was done publicly must be denounced publicly who said that this is a sin that you denounced publicly a mistake is a mistake we all are fallible we're not perfect so they continued to tarnish the reputation of everybody which made doubts in the minds of the people like myself hmm should I learn from Sheikh so so these guys say that he's an innovator he's a his be he's this he's that Allah okay and we ended up thinking bad out everybody except their four or five a llama or Samaha and if you're not with them then you're against them and they will haunt you and they will put you down if you don't acknowledge their shoe you even there she off themselves who used to polish them and say that these are the people who would succeed our a llama once they had a fight with each other they made him worse than a Kaffir worse than Pharaoh Wednes worse than a Bujold they turned against one another okay they have occupied the Muslim Ummah with their childish fights and falling on trash and feeding on it so such jar what a deal is not to be taking from such people such people should be fought and neglected ignored and a dog that barks does not bite even if they claim they have good intentions what they're doing is destroying the Dawa making the masses hate hadith and hate the Sunnah and hate the art either because of their actions and because of their bad attitude which is something that is not from the Sunnah or a prophetess Aram this is not from the doing and the teaching of the Prophet sallallaahu Selim and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
