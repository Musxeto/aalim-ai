  "transcript": "iman from australia yeah um i was just a bit confused the past couple of days just in regards to whether or not my husband's divorced me um we just had a bit of a statement amongst each other a bit of a wording where i was mainly doing the talking um and then he just kind of agreed with it so it kind of felt like an implicit statement so i just become a bit confused but he's adamant that his intention wasn't to divorce or anything like that um and then i had a bit of a text message with him so i messaged him just to confirm if he meant what he said um and then he said um yes just in a sarcastic way where he was like isn't that what you were praying for so i just wanted to know whether or not i'm divorced or not and do you want to be divorced no don't you think you're overdoing it by opening a can of worms when you keep on pushing it pushing it and asking and texting and asking the shaykh and maybe i'm the sixth or seventh person you ask yeah okay i will answer inshallah iman from australia she says that her husband said something so basically speaking lots of the women do this they keep on nagging their husbands you're not a man you can't divorce me you do this and the guy is you know building up pressure he's not responding and after six or seven hours of nagging and banging the doors and throwing things over insulting him and cursing his parents and his loved ones he says okay i divorce you she breaks down and cry after all these years you divorced me damn if you do damn if you don't you've been nagging for the past 10 hours to divorce you now when i divorce you you cry this is how women are made and i'll wait for your hate mails accusing me of being a male chauvinist pig no problem but unfortunately this is how women react you keep on pushing you're saying you want to divorce me don't you you this is what you want you always wanted to divorce me you never loved me before at this end of the day he says yes ah you've divorced me how dare you i didn't divorce i didn't intend to so she sends him a message so she's opening a can of worms and then she's asking this is not how it works if he divorced you he goes to the islamic center and talks to the imam or to the muslim court and talks to the judge or to someone who would give him a fatwa after listening from him and acquiring the proper knowledge from him not from the woman ever because she's not in a position to state whether the divorce took place or not it's the man who asks you"
