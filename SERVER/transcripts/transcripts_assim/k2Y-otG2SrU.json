  "transcript": "Halima from France. Yes, I have a question concerning the whisperings I've been having, insulting my religion, honestly, being aggressive, talking actually aggressive and rudely about Allah and all other people, adults, my family, my aunties, my uncles, everybody, insulting them and it's becoming really unbearable. What can I do in this situation? You have a number of options. I will not disclose them all, but the only option that is possible at the moment is to ignore. When you're walking down the streets of Paris in France, and a dog barks at you, you do not fall down on your hands and knees and bark back. You ignore. This is exactly what Satan is doing to you. He is trying his level best to provoke you, to depress you, to anger you. The only course of action you could do is shrug your shoulders and ignore, because he's shaytan. If you try to negotiate with him, he will curse so many others. He will open other venues. If you try to answer these venues, he will open 20 more. He will overwhelm you. He will overpower you. He will make you suffocate and not be able to breathe. Stop. Simply ignore and move on. These thoughts in your heads, Allah the most forgiving, most merciful will not hold you accountable for them, because you did not speak about it and you did not act upon it. So just ignore it and alhamdulillah, we have a great Lord as Allah the Almighty. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
