  "transcript": "Muhammad from Pakistan yes sir regarding wiping on air in evolution there is many others in bukhabi and Muslim regarding Voodoo and the majority of companions no other report writing on the air so can we say this issue like this is not part of the position this is optional this is not true because no scholar says that we only depend on bukhari and Muslim any student of knowledge knows that if you go through the bukharian Muslim and isolate them from all the other books of Hadith you will jeopardize 35 percent maybe more of the Sunnah so no student of knowledge no person who has proper Knowledge from the Quran and Sunnah would think like this and hence when you go to other books of Hadith if you go to um Etc all these books and so many many more they are part of our Islam they are part of the Sunnah you cannot just simply cross out these books and say no I rely on say bukhar and Muslim this nobody has ever said this my friend therefore the Hadith the ears are from the head is an authentic Hadith the way of the Prophet Allah in performing in so many other hadiths prove that this is something that has to be done and the action itself is so minute and small why would anybody be irritated to the extent that they want to cross it out of the model process this doesn't make any sense and it's definitely not in compliance with the Sunnah of the Prophet Allah"
