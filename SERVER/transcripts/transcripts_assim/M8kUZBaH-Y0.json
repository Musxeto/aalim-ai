  "title": "Is it Sunnah or Mandatory to recite a Surah after Fatiha in 3rd & 4th rakah",
  "transcript": "Ali from Germany: Is it sunnah to recite a sūrah \nafter the Fātiha in the third and fourth raka'āt   of Dhuhr, 'Asr and 'Isha, etc.? Is it sunnah or \nnot, it's an issue of dispute. Is it mandatory?   The answer is 'No', definitely. If you recite \nthe Fātiha, that's it. If you add a sūrah,   some scholars say, that this is part of the sunnah \ndue to the fact that, in the hadith, I think,   of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, where he said that the \nProphet (aleyhi salatu wa salam) prayed Dhuhr   prayer and it was so long - in the first two \nraka'āts, that one used to go and answer the   call of nature, go home, make wudū and come \nback and the Prophet is in the first raka'āt.   And in the third and fourth raka'āt \nof Dhuhr, it was half of that.   Half of that means that it's not only Al-Fātiha \nand a sūrah that is same length. It's something   that way much longer, which means that, he should \nhave recited the Fātiha and something else.   'Asr is half of that. Again, it's \nthe same concept. So some scholars   say that it is recommended, but is \nit mandatory? The answer is 'No'."
