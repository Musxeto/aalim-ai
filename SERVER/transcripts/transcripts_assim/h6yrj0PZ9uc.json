  "title": "Is it ok to eat with my left hand while breastfeeding my child? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "om Ibrahim from the U.S this is my left hand and I really feel bad about it is it okay because it takes a lot of time to explain okay first of all eating and drinking with the left hand is prohibited according to the most authentic opinion because the prophet Allah so a man once eat with his left hand so he ordered him eat with your right hand and the man out of arrogance said I can't and the prophet made Dua against him because he was a liar he said then may you never be able to eat and his hand was paralyzed and he could not raise it to his mouth as a punishment of his hypocrisy and lying to the prophet Allah and also the prophet said when you eat eat with your right and when you drink drink with your right hand because Satan eats and drinks with his left hand so this is to order us not to follow Satan in the fashion and in the way he eats and drinks and then also the prophet said that Islam that when a person eats and drinks with his left hand then Satan is eating and drinking with him sharing with him the food and the drink having said that it is permissible to eat and drink with your left in times of necessity however the word necessity must be looked into because not everything we deem or believe that is a necessity is truly a necessity for example it is permissible for us in times of necessity to eat dead meat or pork what type of necessity the type that would probably lead you to death out of starvation if you don't someone stranded in the desert and there's nothing for him to eat and he's about to die and there's only pork chops what would he do he has to eat a bite or two just to remain alive this is a necessity but for you who is suckling your child and you feel thirsty or hungry if you don't eat or drink for another 10 hours are you going to die of course not therefore this is not a necessity you must not use your right left or uh to eat or drink while uh you are suckling your child because this is not a necessity and Allah Knows Best"
