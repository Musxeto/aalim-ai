  "title": "When to say takbeer in prayer, while getting up from sujood or jalsatul istiraha? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "salaam to Allah my question is yes and my question is then when should we say Allah or when we are getting up from the difficult position I have my own opinion in this regards and this is my own opinion and that is the short pause where you sit when you rise from the second sujud of your first raka to the second raka or from your third raka to your fourth raka so when I Rise Up from sujud I pause by sitting down and then I stand up again and this is back by the Hadith of Malik may Allah be pleased with him when he prayed in front of his companions to teach them how the prophet used to pray and none of the companions or his friends or the contemporaries of the Prophet Sam commended by saying No this is wrong and the Hadith is so it's the highest grade of uh authentic Hadith and this is part of the recommended Sunnah also recommends it says that if you do it it's good if you don't do it it's okay as well so when does a person offer takbeer if you're alone or you are praying behind an Imam once you rise from the second you say Allahu Akbar you pose a little bit and you stand up there's no problem in that because nobody's following you if you are the Imam this becomes problematic because a lot of the Muslims don't know the Sunnah so if you say well and you rise and say Allahu Akbar and you sit everybody behind you would say subhanallah subhanallah thinking that yours you're mistaken and you're sitting for the shahud not knowing that you're a couple of seconds You're Gonna Stand Up to avoid confusion it's best that you rise up sit and while you're standing from this sitting position you say Allahu Akbar and everything it goes normally insha Allah"
