  "transcript": "Yusuf from Bangladesh Shiekh I read in the Quran \nin Surah AlShura that whoever desires the Harvest   of this world we will give them some of it but \nthey will have no share in the Hereafter so when   we do a good deed do we have to have the intention \nof getting rewarded in the Hereafter only or can   we have the intention of getting rewarded both \nin the Hereafter and in the Dunya so what you do   for the sake of Dunya and you are \nnot doing it for the sake of Allah   Allah may give it to you and Allah May deprive you \nfrom it but if you do Haram so I work nine to five   and I'm good at my job and all what I want from \nmy job is a good salary at the end of the month   is my job Halal it's halal I may get this job \nI may get this salary and I may not this has   no impact on my reward on the hereafter but if \nI work for worldly matters in a job that deals   with riba or with bribery or with selling and \nbuying Haram things then definitely I am sinful   I may get what I wanted that is \nwealth and money through selling Haram   and dealing with Haram but definitely on the \nHereafter Allah azzawajal would not give me   any reward and I would be sinful and I'll be \nheld accountable so this is the comparison   I can do things for the sake of Allah in this \nworld not anticipating wealth and money but while   doing this I find that Allah is showering \nmoney and wealth from all over the place   alhamdulillah this is a possibility that Allah \ngives me wealth when I'm working for the hereafter   and he may not but if it's the opposite if \nI'm working for this Dunya while doing Haram   then definitely I'll be held accountable and \nthere is no chair for me on the day of judgment"
