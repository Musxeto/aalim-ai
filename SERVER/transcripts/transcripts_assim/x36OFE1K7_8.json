  "title": "Angel on my left can't keep up with my bad deeds ðŸ¤£ Making jokes about Islam Kufr???",
  "transcript": "Imad from Sweden. Imad, Alaykumussalam I'm wondering what's the ruling on someone who's been lying all day and he says the angel on my left side has not been able to keep up throughout the bad deeds I've done. Whilst the angel on my right has done nothing, he's sitting and the person beside him laughed. What's the ruling on this? May Allah protect you. Wafiqun Barakallah. This is preposterous and very dangerous. This is mocking Islam. You're mocking an angel, a creation of Allah, appointed to write down your sins and claiming that you can see what he's doing and that angel on the right is not doing anything and laughing about it. This can be blasphemous. May Allah protect us."
