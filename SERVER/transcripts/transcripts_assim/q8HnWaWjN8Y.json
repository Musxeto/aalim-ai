  "title": "How should a woman cover her face in Ihram? #Assim #assimalhakeem #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "how does a woman cover her face in is a separate scarf okay to use and can it touch the face first of all again the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam did not specify how a woman should cover her face rather he prohibited a woman in the state of when she's performing or to wear the and the is a face covering that has holes in it so this is a and this is prohibited in the state ofam for women they can throw something on their faces a layer two three depending on the transparency of the that and how they are able to see because we don't want them to put a blindfold that wouldn't be logical so maybe one layer at night and two layers in the daytime would conceal her face but at the same time would not hinder her from seeing the road and seeing what's in front of her this is permissible whether it touches your face or not it has no relevance so what some schools of thought mandate upon women to wear a structure or a hat that has a structure in front of it so that they can throw the face cover on top of it and it would be like a car bumper it wouldn't allow the face cover to touch their face saying that this is Haram this is totally baseless this has no foundation in Islam none whatsoever and it's prohibited to wear because this is an innovation so like mother AA mother Asma her sister said in the Hadith we performed Hajj with the prophet Alat and we used to uncover our faces and the moment writers passed by us we used to throw something and cover our faces with that's it NOAB and uh nothing of that sort and Allah Knows Best"
