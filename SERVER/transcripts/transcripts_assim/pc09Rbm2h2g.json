  "title": "Can the Funeral Prayer be prayed more than once? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "shaheen says do you or can you pray salah twice can you perform salat and janeza the funeral prayer twice the answer is yes you can even pray more than that so if a relative was washed and shrouded and prepared in his home and we're about to take him to the masjid there's no problem if i pray funeral prayer on him then we take him to the masjid and there's no problem i join the congregation and praying funeral prayer again then we take him to the graveyard and there are people who are late did not offer salat so i joined them and we offer salat for the third time this is totally legit and permissible"
