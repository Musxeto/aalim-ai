  "title": "Ruling on selling & buying food in daytime of Ramadan? What about buying groceries assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign so basically the ruling on selling food during the daytime of Ramadan to others this is an issue of dispute but the most authentic opinion is that it's not permissible for a Muslim to sell food during the daytime of Ramadan to be consumed whether to Muslims or non-muslims because they're obliged too fast as the most authentic opinion of Scholars they are addressed the non-muslims they are addressed to fast to pray to give zakat with all Sharia related issues they are addressed by it and if they don't do it they're going to be punished on the day of judgment in addition to the punishment for their disbelief and therefore as Muslims as a restaurant owner I cannot sell food to such people who will consume it but I can sell food to a woman who's menstruating a sick person to a child because they're not obliged to fast these are Exempted from fasting so serving them food is permissible now having said that this has nothing to do with a grocery shop or a vegetables shop that sell food but not for immediate consumption this needs to be prepared so can I do shopping in afternoon and buy such food there's no problem and likewise when the restaurant tells you a food I come at four o'clock and I buy cooked meals that I would consume after Sunset which is in two to three hours uh later there's nothing wrong in that the thing the wrong thing is to serve such food to those who are going to eat it so if someone comes and buys from me uh a meal that I cooked even if it's 12 o'clock in the after in the noon at noon there's no problem if I don't know whether he's going to eat it or not if he's going to take it to heat it up and warm it up later on and eat it after uh the sunset there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
