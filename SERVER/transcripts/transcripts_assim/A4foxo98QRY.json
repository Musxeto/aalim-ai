  "title": "Is the hadith about music being haram weak? (Views of Ibn Hazm) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "b from bangladesh says there is a website that claims that the view of ibn hasem about music is valid and he did not name the website and he says that they claim that al-bukhari's hadith is the weakest of all regarding the music etc this is a big problem when people have confusion in their religion when people do fatwa shopping and label is not the only one i have been doing counseling for a lot of people with ocd and the vast majority of them their ocd is caused by reading fatwa websites why the website gives you a fatwa for a particular question you because of lack of knowledge think that this question fits you or part of it fits you so you assume that you have to act accordingly not knowing that this is not related at all to you why because you don't have the knowledge you don't have the tools to make the analogy or to make that fatwa fit your actual situation now eben has him says so and so with all due respect we all know ibn hasem of one of the great scholars of islam he has many good views but he has weird views without any doubt and this is why all the imams went against him and accused him of using illogical thinking when refusing to apply analogy but this is beside the point he was a great imam and he had many good things however when you compare apple to apple among the whole muslim ummah who's accepted and more reputable imam bukhari orbin has definitely imam bukhari who's more knowledgeable in hadith imam bukhari urban has him definitely imam bukhari without any doubt without any comparison there's no percentage so when someone like this uh anonymous uh website comes and claims that the hadith is weak with all due respect who are you are you someone like sheikh al-bani for example who's also infallible he could make mistakes but what website it makes me a bit agitated when someone says to me oh sheikh this publication house said that the hadith is authentic when sheikh al-bani said it's not authentic so you're comparing sheikh al-bani to a publishing house that publishes books for money who are their scholars we don't know they say authenticated by a group of soldiers who are they we don't know do you think i'm gonna pay a penny for their verdict on a hadith hadith is something that allah has preserved along with the quran this is part of the zikr that allah will protect till the end of time so i do not accept at all anyone to come and claim or accuse the hadith of the prophet sallam simply because he feels like listening to music and contemporary songs so he's looking and searching for anything that says music is okay and he catches it the hadith that they're referring to has been connected and authenticated in sunan abidahu the same hadith are they going to speak ill about that as well with all the narrators are 100 percent false proof they can't but they sell this allegation to people like you who do not know in the signs of hadith who had not done their due diligence unfortunately who have something deep down in their heart that yearns for listening to music and are looking for anything that says music is good so definitely this is a not good you"
