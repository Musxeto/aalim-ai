  "transcript": "can we befriend with shia the norm is that you select your friends as allah stated in the quran the best of friends on the day of judgement are enemies to one another except those who are righteous so the general trend is a muslim must not befriend anyone who is not practicing so you must not befriend an open sinner someone who goes to pubs and bars and nightclubs and you're best friends with him no good you must not be friends with innovators people who celebrate the mode who innovate in islam and have filled their lives with innovations and bid and forms of worship you should keep your distance away from them and people who may be from other sects or cults such as the shia such as the sufis such as the ahmadis not muslims but they claim to be muslims the rules the alawis all of these cults they are bad news and you must not be friend with them at all and allah knows best you"
