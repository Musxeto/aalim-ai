  "title": "Should women keep hands inside Shawal or outside when praying? | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Tahrim from Pakistan? Yes. Yes, what can I do for you? So, Sheikh, I had a question. Before you start your question, the Prophet ï·º said in an authentic hadith, whoever begins you with a question before giving salam, do not respond to them. This is an authentic hadith. Therefore, you have to give salam so that I can take your question. Okay, Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. What can I do for you? So, Sheikh, I'm from Pakistan and I've seen women pray in two different ways. So, let's say I'm wearing an abaya while praying and I have a shawl. So, the shawl is big enough to cover my chest and, well, let's say there are two sections of women. Some put their hands under the shawl and they cover them with the shawl, not in the rest of the prayer. However, others keep it outside the shawl. So, which one has to be done? The best is to keep it out of the shawl, meaning that it can be visible if there are no non-mahram men around you. Why? Because all scholars and schools of thought say that a woman must cover all of her body during prayer except for the face and the hands. So, this is the norm. So, a woman may not, in the comfort of her own home, decide to pray with a niqab. This is not permissible. A woman may not, in the comfort of her home or among women, decide to wear gloves. This is not permissible. So, she has to uncover these, the face and the hands, if there are no non-mahram men looking at her. That is the norm. Therefore, putting it above the shawl is what should be done and Allah knows best. you"
