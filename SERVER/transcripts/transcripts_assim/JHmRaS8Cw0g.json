  "title": "Ruling on burning ruqya paper & inhaling the smoke - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "arabic from bangladesh is saying what's the ruling on burning pieces of paper where i wrote the fatiha or a specific rookia and then inhaling the smoke that comes out of it i don't know if this is rookia or some type of pot or this is totally uh unheard of like the guy said i did not i smoked it in university but i did not inhale what is this burning it and inhaling it you're going to get cancer probably and maybe if the material you use you're going to get stoned and this is totally not permissible it is unfound in the quran or in the sunnah or in the actions of the salaf nowadays lots of people are coming up with new things and in my own opinion this is one of the ways of attracting the gin so they say you have to burn some sort of wood or incense incense i think it's called and the smell would ward off the jinn and the devils how do you know that this would not draw them to you as a form of sacrifice that you're giving to them and you're burning it to please them and they will come and control you more and more this is unheard of and it's not anything that is in the quran or in the sun then you should avoid this"
