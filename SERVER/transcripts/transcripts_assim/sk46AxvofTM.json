  "transcript": "oh alhamdulillah and welcome to to lessons in we are still studying the chapter that deals with menstruation and we have like three hadiths left inshallah and then we should move on afterwards so the first Hadith uh in today's program Hadith number 126 when we came to a place called sarif I mated and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said to me do what a pilgrim does meaning regarding the rights of and except that you don't circle circle Mumble eight the Caba until you are purified this Hadith tells us the things that a woman who has menstruation that she should be avoiding or she should not do now you recall a couple of program programs ago we said that she must not pray and she must not fast while she has her monthly period and in this Hadith may Allah be pleased with her tells us that she was with the prophet Alat during the and how many times performed Hajj only once and that was known as farewell ha Anda was with the Prophet Alat wasam and all of a sudden she had her monthly period so she cried and she felt sad with it and when the prophet came Alat he told her that this is something natural that all females have so you do exactly what the M the person who is performing pilgrimage or Hajj uh uh does with the exception of that you do not go around the Kaa you do not perform of course this you have to add this to the previous stated by the prophet that she does not pray or fast so if someone with little knowledge comes to this Hadith and says that the prophet says that you may do whatever a pilgrim does except do not perform ta then he said okay then I should add to this prayer is that acceptable Zaki prayer I don't know is that acceptable the question is is prayer acceptable from her no no because she is menstruating so this Hadith we have to put it alongside with the Hadith where the Prophet saysat that a minating woman does not pray and does not fast and also she does not go around the Kaa also she does not enter the Masjid you remember Mustafa the evidence we mentioned yet uh like six or seven uh programs ago where it states that a woman minating woman does not enter the Masjid do you recall it yes I do what what which one was it there was we talked about a Hadith where Prophet Muhammad alaihi wasallam tells AA to hand him something and she only uh stuck out her hand she she objected and she said that I'm menstruating so the prophet told her your menstruation is not in your hand so it's okay for you to put your hand inside the mosque which meant that the the prophet agreed that her objection was correct that she may not enter the mosque but she's not entering the mosque only her hand is entering the mosque and this tells us that she's not allowed or Mana woman is not allowed inside uh uh the mosque so from this Hadith we learn that if a woman wants to perform pilgrimage she may do every single thing except entering the M the Masjid and accept TA of course prayer is by default we don't have to repeat that again uh she may make she make she may make supplications and and and pray to Allah Asel ask Allah for forgiveness or to Grant her anything that she wishes this is all acceptable and this comes in handy especially for the sisters that come for or for Hajj and a lot of them they make their timing when especially when they're coming from abroad they make their timing to reach when she is in her Purity uh uh period the 23 or 24 days and this is not a must and they start to ask how do you say it's not a must when we cannot uh uh bathe and declare ouram it's very simple a a female Pilgrim or a female sister who has her menstruation can declare can say or can say regardless of her Purity because this is something different you need Purity in certain things so don't confuse things altogether the things that you need Purity in are a handful prayer entering the Masid for ta and this is a a disputable uh issue among Scholars um holding the Quran again it's a a matter of dispute among among Scholars but anything else Purity is not a prerequisite for example fasting must I be pure to fast do I have to be pure to fast Mustafa it has nothing to do with it it whether it's sexual impurity or the minor impurity if I want to fast I fast Purity has nothing to do with fasting likewise Purity has nothing to do with performing pilgrimage it all depends on circulating the Kaa or performing your prayer other than that it's okay whether a sister has the uh menstruation or not uh the following Hadith number 127 he asked the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam what is lawful for a man regarding his wife when she is menstruating he sallallah alai wasam replied whatever is above the is why is rapper is lawful so in this Hadith the prophet says that that whatever is above the waste it's okay so for a man to enjoy with his wife whatever waste and above then this is permissible the Hadith is not authentic it is a weak Hadith and the doing of the Prophet Alat wasam differs with this because the prophet sallallahu wasallam told us to enjoy oneself and he used to enjoy himself with his wife when they were menstruating does any everything except intercourse so whether it's above the waist or below the waist it's okay providing that there is no intercourse and again the Hadith is is is so we don't pay much attention to it the following Hadith and which is I believe the last Hadith narrated by um Sal May what be pleased with her during the time of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam the woman having bleeding after delivery meaning POS Nal W refrain from prayer for 40 days and in another narration uh the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam didn't command her to make up uh for the prayer abandon During the period of bleeding okay this Hadith tells us that other than menstruation women get the bleeding that prevents them from prayer which is the bleeding after they give birth and usually the period is you know it it's approximately 40 days and nights some Scholars say that it may increase up to 60 days and night some Scholars say that during the first 40 nights after giving birth birth she must not pray and she must not uh allow her husband to have intercourse with her regardless of she's bleeding or not and the authentic verdict of Scholars is that if a woman after giving birth is bleeding she has the top ceiling of 40 days a night other than that is considered to be normal bleeding it's not considered to be fast because women should stop praying and fasting if they have their menstruation and if they have neas which is the bleeding that she gets after uh giving birth but there should be a maximum and this is an issue of different opinion among Scholars some say 60 days is the maximum and some say only 40 days and the most authentic is 40 days as we have heard in this Hadith now what happens if she is pure Before 40 days some Scholars say nevertheless she should stay the full 40 days other Scholars which is the most authentic say Well it all depends on the blood so if the blood stops after one week then all what she has to do is perform obligatory bath and that's it she can pray and fast and her husband could have intercourse with her there there's no uh uh problem in that if it stretches up to 20 days again 30 days again 40 days yes she performs rul and she prays if it's 41 days the the 41st day is not included it's not accounted for because it would be just normal bleeding it would be a vein like in the case of so uh uh from this we learn that a woman that who that has the her menstruation and a woman after giving birth this bleeding must they they should not they must not and they it's not acceptable from them uh uh to fast or to pray they they don't have to repeat the prayer both of them don't have to repeat the prayer but they have to repeat the fasting in and why is that because you have five prayers every day so if you ask them to pray 35 uh prayers at once it's it's more difficult as for fasting it's 30 days every 12 months so and and they would only break like seven or eight days uh uh through throughout the year it's easy for them to make it up uh I think we have to break so stay tuned and we'll be right back insh ask Huda dear brothers and sisters welcome to a new edition of ask Huda I have two questions please go ahead you can read it in Arabic and you can also understand the meaning in your own language the different and interpretation of the meanings of the Quran are available in almost every language that exist on Earth by the grace of Allah the water of Zam is for whatever intention you drink it with from Egypt his father has the way and he asked about how can he help him very good question can we give to any of the the or the act of worship is a part of the unity of worship it has to be paid to Allah subhana wa tala and in accordance with the guidance of his Prophet s how and welcome back it's time now to begin a new chapter and this chapter deals with a very essential thing in our lives which is prayer so in order for us to pray we have to pray on time but a lot of Muslims don't know what is the time to pray until they hear the muin the person calling for the uh prayer therefore this Hadith tells us about the times of each and every prayer when it is pered permissible for us to pray now uh the chapter is called the times of Salat the times of prayer and Prayer by itself is different than any other form of worship because one all other worships such as zakat uh the pur do pilgrimage fasting it was all revealed and instructed to our Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam on Earth prayer was revealed to the prophet s wasallam in Heavens in the event of is and when the prophet s wasallam was uhh uh taken to the heavens and also uh uh prayer was revealed to the prophet wasam 3 years before Hijra so it was revealed to the prophet wasam while he was in Mecca before migrating to uh Medina and most worships and all forms of worship were given to the prophet alham through an intermediate and that is the Archangel Gabriel he conveyed Allah's instructions to the messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam in most forms of worship except Salah Salat was given directly in Heaven by Allah to the prophet sallallah alaih Al wasallam which indicates its importance it's not any other form of worship otherwise Allah wouldn't have done it himself and if you look at prayer you would find the blessing of Allah in it because our Prophet told us sallallahu alaihi wasallam that at the very beginning Allah wrote and decreed that we should pray how many prayers per day 50 50 prayers per day which amounts to two prayers per hour even when you're sleeping so 50 you have 24 hours this is almost a prayer every half an hour and this is a lot so when the prophet learned this he went down and he was met by Moses may peace and blessing be upon him we love Moses a lot and why is that because he asked the prophet Alam what did Allah tell you he told me that he has decreed 50 prayers for us to pray he told him go back again and ask him for forgiveness and to reduce because I've lived with the Jews for a long time and I know your people you know Muslims are the cousins of Jews they are the sons of Isaac and we're the sons of Ishmael so they they're brothers so they they are our cousins so the prophet went back Allah dropped five of them and five and five and every time he meets Moses Moses goes goes to him and say go back again they're not going to tolerate it until Allah made them only five prayers during the day and night Moses told him go back to him again he said I'm I'm I'm shy I I cannot I went so many times I I I don't feel like I don't think I can do it anymore so Allah with his great generosity said that I have said it's five prayers but I've declared that you will be rewarded for 50 prayers and and these wordings do not change if if Allah declares something it stays as it is now compare the difference zi between 50 and and five if Allah has declared it to be 50 on us would have would we have been able to do it no definitely not and nevertheless though Allah is generous with us and he made it 5 five yet still people say well I think I have 20% discount this morning why well I dropped fuder prayer I never pray fuder prayer it's only and and some people say well I'm better than you are I'm I have 40% discount because I don't even pray prayer and this is a major sin it's not something of your own choosing you know you cannot delay prayer because I don't feel like praying today it it's not it is something that is essential and that is why it is the second pillar of Islam immediately after the testimony the shahada comes Salat and Scholars say nothing of the worships the forms of worship that a person does nothing of them is considered to be Blasphemous not to do except Salah for example if somebody does not fast at all until he dies he has committed a major sin but Scholars don't consider him to be to be cfir now if a person does not pray period at all the companions of the Prophet Alat wasam considered this to be a sign of blasphemy and a sign of one of the things that nullifies Islam so any person that says muham and does not pray period he is not a Muslim why because the prophet alai says and the Hadith is in sah Muslim the oath or the thing that's binding binding us the thing that's between us and Them is Salat and whoever abandons Salat is not a Muslim it he states that clearly now again brother rushi we don't go to people and start to classify them I I I hear a lot of time a lot of times people come to me and say uh I have this friend in at work and he doesn't pray so shall I say yeah is he considered is he considered to be a Muslim or not yes he's Muslim still Muslim I mean uh there is there is classified kafir this someone we say kafir because he left the Salah even she she can do it you know even he can do it or someone who uh left the Salah because of I mean the I other reason explain to you what you mean you are asking is it the same that if a person does not pray because he's lazy and a person that does not pray because he doesn't think it's it's it's a f are they equal the majority of Scholars say whoever abandons Salah does not pray because he doesn't believe it's obligatory he's a CF yeah this is the consensus of all Scholars they differ in those who leave and do not pray because of laziness and the authentic opinion is that whoever abandons prayer who whoever does not pray out of laziness is a cafir because if you go to the first one the one who does not believe it's obligatory any person that believes anything from Islam is not obligatory and it is obligatory is cfir so whoever comes to me and say fasting Ramadan is not obligatory I don't believe in this this what would we regard him cfir if a person says Hajj is not obligatory we would regard him as cfir now if someone does not fast Ramadan out of laziness would we regard him as kafir no he's a sinful person and if he does not uh uh perform pilgrimage out of laziness he's still a Muslim but if he does not pray out of laziness the prophet tells us whoever whoever abandons Salah is cfir and he did not say whoever abandons uh fasting is kafir whoever abandons pilgrimage is kafir whoever abandons zakat is cfir he only mentioned Salah which means that only Salah if you abandon it out of laziness or out of believing that it is not obligatory and it's not a they're both uh uh alike and this tells us how important Salat is you have a remark uh pardon me uh maybe I just want to ask to make sure that uh what I'm believe is right or wrong okay uh but uh there is differences between uh we can say one things that we can say cfir but he's not uh he's not I mean he's not M he's not rejected from Islam from De of Islam but uh we know exactly that if I have an example I have a friend or I have a someone then he left the Salah he left the prayer five obligatory prayer he just left it like that he just left it like that I mean he lazy we can say he lazy he's not he's uh accept it it a order from Allah and from but can I say to him that you're not kafir I don't say like that I don't say that you are kafir but what you are doing is kafir is yes see again and we don't want to go into details because it needs time to explain this there's a difference between saying that this is kufur this is something that is part of the things that nullify Islam and saying that a person is a cfir designating a person by himself there's Difference by saying whoever does This falls under this category of kufur and by saying that pinpointing a person person and saying that he is a cfir there's a difference uh uh in in both uh scenarios I'll give you another example we we say that all non-muslims are in hell do we have any problem with this no all non-muslims are in hell now I know that John is a Christian I cannot go to him and say John you're in hell no this is unacceptable John Dies he's dead he's buried I cannot say John is in hell because if I say that someone is in hell then I am doing something beyond my knowledge and cap capability I I don't know if John embraced Islam seconds before he died but I can say that anyone that dies Christian and he has heard about Islam and knows about Islam and yet still refuses to believe and embrace Islam is in Hell Without identify without pointing a person in particular likewise I cannot say that a person is in Jenna I would say that a Muslim who prays five times and is good Muslim he's in Jenna I know Ali is a Muslim and he died and we buried him I cannot say Ali is in Jenna he's my brother he prays with me in the Masjid he fasts Ramadan he does this and that yes but if if I say that he's in Jenna then I have looked into Jenna and I can tell who's in there and who's not and this is not applicable and it's not possible so we don't uh uh Point people and say they are in Jenna or in there in Hell by the way the Christian bit if we say that all Christians are in in hell don't think that this is Extreme because if you go to the Christians themselves they will tell you that anyone that is not Christian is in hell so if you go to the Buddhist themselves they'll tell you yes Islam is a good religion Christianity is a good religion but they're all in hell and if you go to the seik it's the same thing if you go to the Jews it's the same thing everyone that believes in a religion thinks that his religion is the only religion that is accepted by Allah and that is that is why this is a test that's why you as a Muslim should look in other into other religions and see if they qualify to be the one or not and you will find that they don't only Islam qualifies but this is an allegation that I'm throwing at you and you have to cross-examine it also the Christians have to do this and the Jews have to do that I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time oh oh"
