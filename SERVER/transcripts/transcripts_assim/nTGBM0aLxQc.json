  "title": "Sufi whirling",
  "transcript": "religious ecstasy is mostly done by some sufis where they basically do dikkir and some continuous whirling and during this whirling uh around they tend to forget that they are turning around in circles and reach a point of ecstasy without having taken any alcohol is there anything wrong in this act the whole thing is wrong it's a great innovation it is opening the gateway for shaytan to possess them these people are possessed by jinn when they turned like uh uh uh in circles and and and i think they called them the darawish in turkey and in egypt in egypt they call them the czar where they beat the drums and they say and they say weird things and and it's very funny when you watch them it's very sad at the same time but this has nothing to do with islam the state they reach of uh uh ecstasy and forgetting whatever is around them and they think that they have reached levels of iman they have reached levels of insanity and innovation and it can be total blasphemy and kuffar and shirk especially when they say that we keep on whirling like this until we unite with allah and we became one this is total shirk so definitely this is a byproduct of deviating from the quran and sunnah and following these deviant cults and sects"
