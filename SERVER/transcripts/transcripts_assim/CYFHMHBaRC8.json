  "transcript": "Arise from Canada. Sheikh, I have one question for today. The question is, is it permissible to keep pictures of living things like humans or animals in the house as long as you would tape over their heads so it does not show the eyes? JazakAllah. Wa Jazakum. A photograph is permissible according to the most authentic opinion as long as it's not photoshopped because this is the creation of Allah. I see a lion, I snap a shot, then this is the creation of Allah. Having it in the house or hanging it is not permissible. And this would prevent the angels from entering due to it being hanged. Now how to rectify this? If you tape the facial features so that it would not have a face or it would not have a head, then there is no problem in keeping it as mentioned and Allah knows best."
