  "transcript": "in terms of topic today of course it's Ramadan the issue of Ramadan why is Ramadan the preferred month of undergoing the process of self-improvement and islah Ramadan is the best month of self-improvement as as islah because Allah says in the Quran in Surah Bak chapter number two verse number 183 oh you believe fasting has been prescribed to you as it was prescribed to people who came before you so that you may learn self-esteem so if you fast the main reason is to learn self-esteem tawa righteousness pety God Consciousness and as we discussed earlier that the psychology they tell us that if you can control your hunger you can control almost all your Desir so in the month of fasting when we fast inshallah whatever deficiencies we have it's the best opportunity to control them because if you can control your hunger you can control almost all the desires so all the desires which may be away from Islam away from Allah and his rasool's Commandments this is the best opportunity therefore Ramadan is the month of self-improvement and islah same way when we are doing islah correcting another Muslim who is also fasting it is the best time that he can agree with the Improvement and best time to correct himself first furthermore our beloved Prophet mam wasallam said it's mentioned mus Ahmed volume number two page number 230 Hadith number 7148 where the Beloved Prophet said that Ramadan is the month in which the Gates of Heaven they opened and the gates of hell they closed and the Devils they are chained so when the devils are chained there less chances that you can be Ed and there are more chances that you can go on the straight path there less Temptation from the devil that's the reason it is the best time in the full year for a person to is and for the person to improve himself both this is the time where he can be least tempted by the devil and since the Gates of Heaven are open it's inviting you towards the good and the gates of hell are closed so it is taking you away from the evil and the sin and the had again repeated in sunai in the book of fasting Hadith number 21106 that in the month of Ramadan the Gates of Heaven are open the gates of hell are closed and the devils are chained and it's also mentioned in s bukari volume number two in the book of fasting Hadith number 1 1901 where the Beloved Prophet said that anyone who fasts in the month of Ramadan with belief and seeking the pleasure of Allah subhana wa taala all his past sins will be forgiven so imagine this is the best opportunity maybe a person is a sinner he has done many mistakes and if he fast the full month of Ramadan all his passing will be forgiven so at least he feels like coming to the straight path the person has sinned a lot and say I've sinned so much and what's my chance of going to jna how can I go to paradise and how can I come on the straight path so Ramadan is the month where all his past sins can be forgiven and he can start his life a fresh so the best time for self-improvement as well as doing Islam same with the other Muslim brother"
