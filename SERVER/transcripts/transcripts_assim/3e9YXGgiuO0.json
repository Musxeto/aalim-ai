  "title": "Swallowed droplets of wudu water in prayer, prayers VALID? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Raheel from Sri Lanka. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam to Allah. Sheikh my question is if a person performs Wudu in the Masjid and joins a congregation and while praying the water droplets in the face reach the mouth and he swallows it either deliberately or accidentally does it affect the Salat? Where does it fall? It reaches the lips and maybe he swallows it either deliberately or accidentally. No he should not swallow it. If he does swallow it this is a form of drinking and it breaks his fasting and it breaks his Salat. If he does that unintentionally then there is nothing wrong in that and Allah knows best."
