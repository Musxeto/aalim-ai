  "transcript": "holocacho yeah in the subcontinent where I stay when one's daughter has reached poverty the parents of the daughter uh through a grand party publicize everybody that the daughter has gone poverty and this particular practice has been followed by a lot of non-muslims I just want to have your idea on that this is immodest and the Jews have this for boys when they reach the age of puberty and maybe the Hindus have it I don't know but this is a modest when you announce such a thing that normal girls at this age would be bashful and shy to say and you throw a party of that this is totally uh not ethical and not a a good thing to do and I would believe that it is more of something prohibited because it's not part of our religion it's not part of our culture and it's an immodest thing as well and Allah Knows Best"
