  "transcript": "Hassan says is it is it permissible to praise Allah and send salutation upon the Prophet is awesome while making dua Institute in Salah and before the sleep this is not from the Sunnah the Prophet said that is awesome that whenever you are Institute you are as close as possible to Allah as ojun so choose whatever you want from the door because you're worthy of being answered and he did not instruct us Ali salatu salam to praise allah or to offer salutation upon him nor before salam before concluding our prayer however praising allah is thicker so if you do it in your schedule this is valid offering salutation to the prophet Isom is doing so if you do it in your suit this is valid and if you do this before you make your places okay there's nothing wrong in that insha'Allah but again it is not off the Sunnah so would you say that it's a vida no it's not because it's an open place for the vicar and for drum so doing it is permissible would do would you do it share I wouldn't do it I would do it only in the last third of the night or between adhan Anupama or before the last hour of a Friday before sunset I would praise allah awj Elinor facilitation and make drawn to the to allah azza wajal on Allah knows best"
