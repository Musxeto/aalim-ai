  "transcript": "so sir uh so she I wanted to um actually ask about a Hadith where the Prophet sallallahu Al wasallam said that there are two people from Hell who he's not seen yet and amongst them are women who wear clothes and and yet are naked so my question was that sorry I've actually read the explanation of this Hadith from um great Scholars like IMI and and it seems that uh and correct me if I'm wrong that woman who you know wear the hijab but wear in an improper way such that they're showing their neck or the ears or the tip of their um U hair just above their forehead that they're also included in this no no no no no no they're not included in this this is inappropriately wearing the hij the Hadith refers to women who are dressed yet at the same time considered to be naked which means means that it is one of two either she's wearing real tight clothes like leggings and uh uh that's sports bra and the likes that may cover the outer skin but it shows the physique and the body curves and the bone structure of a woman so this is she's dressed but she's actually naked you can tell all her figures and her body curves or it refers to someone who is clothed but and and and it's oblique not tight yet it's seethrough so you can see what's underneath though there is cloth on the outer uh uh side of it but you can see through what's underneath this is what is meant by the Hadith showing the earrings showing some part of the hair showing showing the cleavage or the neck and the likes this is called but it is not falling under the category of the Hadith and Allah Knows Best"
