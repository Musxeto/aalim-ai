  "transcript": "Hill says I was on a Muslim environment and I was talking to a lot of Muslims and being introduced to Islam and it gives me interest to know more about it but it does not give me the chills to revert to Islam I just don't know why maybe because I hate religions after all because it separates races I've watched some of dr. zakir naik videos I agree on some points but then still it does not convince me so I need some help I feel like I'm lost Dale my friend it is said that you can lead a horse to the river but you cannot force it to drink our job is only to show you the way to show you the path guidance is in the hands of allah azza wajal if allah knows that you're sincere and that you are willing to submit your will once you accept and acknowledge the truth Allah will guide you but if you are not ready or if you're not willing then no matter what people do you will not accept Islam if you look around you you'll find tens of thousands of people accepting Islam every single day it is the largest growing religion on earth it's needless to say that the population of the Muslims is about 1.7 billion and in less than a decade there will be more than a quarter of the population of of the whole earth a little bit more a little bit less who cares the essence of the problem is you now you don't have the chills to revert to Islam and most likely the things that deter you from accepting Islam it's not the religion per se that separates people and causes racism among them this is not the reason you have to look deep down inside probably it is because it tackles a lot of your desires and the things you love and they're pulling you down you know deep down that they're wrong but you love them no one can blame you for loving them because this is human nature if no one loved in wine or booze if no one loved women if no one loved partying if no one loved hoarding money from halal or from permissible or prohibited means who cares if no one loved these things and looked up for them there will be no test so if I'm not tempted then there is no test in not doing what's prohibited because I'm not tempted I don't have the desire to do to be tempted so my friend you have to look deep down inside at the end of the day when you accept Islam the Muslims will not benefit out of it Islam will not benefit out of it the only person who will benefit is you you will feel a whole world of difference in your heart when you guided when you know who you submit your will - it's not your desires anymore it's not your Satan anymore it is the creator of the heavens and the earth and the evidences are overwhelming don't look at the Muslims look at Islam look at the divine book the Quran look at the teachings of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam if you don't believe in God what will you do with the Prophet he is a human being but his CL are his biography his life was out of this world no one can be like inspiring as he was peace and praise of Allah be upon him so my friend I can't do anything for you but to show you the way whether you take it or take another way this is your choice and you will bear the consequences of that I pray to Allah the Almighty that he guides your heart and mine and the viewers to the straight path so that we know him as he wants us to know him"
