  "transcript": "[Music] and we have a fan from the uk uh since i just wanted to ask is celebrating uh it in advance is it uh and as we know we are in very low volume is it a bidder and what is the definition of bigger if you could please explain okay in front from the uk what is the ruling on celebrating the maulit the birthday of the prophet and is it a buddha and what is a bridal or innovation is something created invented in islam to get closer to allah azzawajal which the need to do it at the time of the prophet hassan was there and he did not do it so you want to mimic forms of worship and you can want to get closer to allah azza now the question is it permissible to celebrate the birthday of the prophet point number one all muslims agree that the prophet islam died on the 12th of rabbi no doubt about that among any of the muslims however they differ whether the prophet was born in the 12th of rabbi or in the ninth as author clearly stated that this is the most authentic opinion that he was born the ninth so by celebrating his mawlid every single year on the 12th of rabir you actually are celebrating his death and not his birth secondly the prophet never celebrated his own birthday nor the birthday of ibrahim peace be upon him or musa or isa or any other prophet neither did the companions may allah be pleased with him who loved him the most and were the most knowledgeable people at his time and after his time nor did the tabi's nor did anyone of the taberet tavein and the prophet said that so the best of generations is my generation that is of the companions and that which follows them the taberine and that which follows them that is a tabula tavein so if these favorite generations which is which are the best of the best never celebrated his birthday do you have the love they had to him for him do you have the knowledge do you have any basis to do something they did not do other than being an innovation from shaytan now what happens during these birthdays or mawlid is not something to be proud of the free mixing the singing the innovation and the shirk there is blatant shirk in it especially when they recite these poems such as and they say things that o prophet of allah if you're not taking my hand on the day of judgment then i will be among the losers it is from your generosity that this whole world and the hereafter is created his generosity and from your knowledge is the knowledge of the preserved tablets and the pen subhanallah what did you leave for allah azza if this is all in the prophet sallam's knowledge and generosity and this is where people of shirk come when they say that the prophet in his grave is hazard and he controls the world as he controls the power of his hand from his grave and they take allah's beautiful names and attributes and give it and award it to him when they say to his grave so without any shred of doubt those who celebrate the maulid are innovators if they loved the prophet allah they would have honored his sunna they would have honored his akida they would have honored the way he lived and honored it throughout the whole year 360 days not only one day in a year like the christians do and they celebrate christmas and they do all heinous things that they claim that that night would forgive all of their sins so that they have a carte blanche for the next new year this is all not part of islam it wasn't done by the companions nor the the tabernae nor the tabernacle taverine all four imams of schools of thought say it's an innovation never celebrated themselves so now you know all more than all of these people that you have a different virgin of islam i can't help you no one can help you if people say that the heavens is blue the sky is blue and you say well i think it's pink or it's green sylvie no one can do anything for you"
