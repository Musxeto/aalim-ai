warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number 235 that deals with the chapter of hatch as we've studied a while ago and we're still continuing to do so inshallah who will read it for us yes brother Abu radaris yellow one who said the Prophet sallallahu wasallam saw a man driving a button the Prophet peace be upon him said right on it he replied it is a button the Prophet again said right on it abu huraira rajala one who said i saw him riding it next to the Prophet peace be upon him in another narration the prophet sallallahu wasallam whele or way hot or y hat in this hadith the prophet alayhi salatu salam saw a man walking while he was driving one of the camels prepared to be sacrificed for Haddie and the Prophet told him I'd assalaam write it so the man wanted to clarify the issue to the Prophet aliso some that this is a budino this is something which is being sent to the harem to be sacrificed so I don't own it anymore is that correct when you have a sacrifice do you own it hell us once you bought it and you designated it to be sacrificed it should be for Alonzo the man said it is a better name it is a sacrifice o prophet of allah so the prophet said I know ride it and the man repeated that again maybe the Prophet did not hear me maybe the Prophet did not understand me and the Prophet told him write it in another narration the Prophet said Ye laka or waiheke and these are all words that are considered to be a figure of speech but they're not intended in Arabic there are a number of words that are said when someone is angry or when someone is complaining about an issue he says this but he doesn't mean it because whale meaning that destruction and doom may fall upon you and if definitely prophetess m is not intending that this man to be doomed in hell so these are words that are used as a figure of speech and they're not considered to be a form of supplication this is something that the Arabs use as a figure of speech in form of reprimanding or in form of complaining or objecting so likewise here the prophet said way luck or why Huck I know right it so this is a strong form of saying this as the scholars say now we've answered this question before and that is is it permissible to write it dancer if it is not harmful for it it is permissible and if you need milk you can also milk it because this does not go against it being a sacrifice meaning that it is not to be used no it's on the way you may do this as long as it is not harmful for it moving on to Headley 236 alley-oop Nabi Talib may allah be pleased with him rodilla Talyn who reported a las messengers of allah allah salam put me in charge of the sacrificial animals then I should give their flesh skins and saddle quotes as Sedaka but not to give anything to the butcher saying we would pay him ourselves and this had a we learn that when you sacrifice something when you offer something as heady that this has to be for the sake of allah so agile and not to be used as trade so when you go to Hajj and you sacrifice your sheep you're allowed to eat parts of it right and the rest you may give for Sedaka a lot of the Muslims they just sacrifice and leave it so if some of the pilgrims said instead of leaving it why not sell it so i sacrifice my heading and i sell it for a hundred or two hundred realsies is permissible the answer is no whatever is for the sake of Allah has to be for the sake of allah and that is why i laid of the Allahu one who tells us that the Prophet told me not to give the butcher anything of it meaning not even the skin not even the head or the legs or the things that usually people do not utilize it is not permissible to give the butcher anything as form as price or as form as his wages for slaughtering this sacrifice but if he is poor and navigate with him for example that I'll give you this much money for slaughtering my sacrifice and he agreed and after he finished I've noticed that his poor he's needy so I gave him some of it as silica is permissible this is permissible what is not permissible is that before we started the transaction he said okay I'll slaughter it but i need the head the liver and the legs for example this is not permissible to give him in form of the payment he usually charges for that deed and the Prophet instructed Ali may allah be pleased with him the prophet salallahu selim told him to give everything as Sedaka the meat the skin and also whatever is on top of that animal such as saddle such as clothes such as thing that signifies that it is for Haddie it has to be given in the form of Sedaka and from this hadith we also learn that it is permissible for you to give the authority for someone to slaughter on your behalf some may think that no I have to slaughter with my own hands and this is recommended it is recommended for a person to slaughter himself if he's unable it is recommended that he witnesses the slaughtering if he is unable or he is busy or something else it is permissible for him to give the power of attorney to authorize someone to slaughter in his behalf as the Prophet so lost alum had Ali slaughter on his behalf hadith 237 yes brother narrated said been to bear I saw evening Omar passing a man who had made his Madonna said to slaughter it if no Merced slaughtering it while it is standing with one leg tied up as it is the tradition of muhammad sallallahu wasallam and this hadith ziad even jubail said that I've seen in Homer the companion of the prophet may allah be pleased with him and with his father coming to a man who had his camel which was ready to be sacrificed sitting on his forelegs he was just about to sacrifice it even amar told him no this is not the Sunnah for camels the Sunnah is that you make them stand and you tie one of its hands or front legs to itself like this so it would be standing on how many legs on three and slaughtering it is not by doing that to the sheep which is slaughtering the Sheep slaughtering a camel would be stabbing it in the upper area of its neck and this immediately kills it with the grace of allah so jeal and those who know how to slaughter they know the exact location once you do that it falls on the side which is the arm is tied up and that is what is mentioned in the Quran that when the animals fall from the standing position then this is when you start to distribute the meat and this would be considered as its sacrifice so this is the Sunnah of the Prophet eraser Absalom yet it is a Sunnah lat mandating if someone is afraid and if he says I have bad experience I try to do this with a camel I stabbed it and it tortured it and I could not kill it because i did not know it's so big so huge I was afraid in this case we tell him let it sit on his forelegs and then you may do that what needs to be done we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back hadith number 238 yes brother a blood in her name to the lower I narrated that they're cropped up a difference of opinion between our de la kidnap bastard ale our and huma & a miss 1 min Mahama at a place called a boy a blade now bass with a low on contended that a mushroom was permitted to wash his head whereas miss work intended that amorim is not permitted to wash his head so hip numbers sent me to Abu Ayub al-ansari to ask him about it so I went to him and found him taking a bath behind tuples covered by a cloth I gave him salutation whereupon he asked who is this I said I'm a blind man who named applied now bass 10 min to you to find out how the messenger of allah salallahu alayhi wasallam wash his head in the state of islam oh boy you through the Laran raised his hand on the cloth and know what it a little till his head became visible to me and he said to the man was pouring water upon him too or water he poured water on his head he then moved his head with the help of his hands and moved them the hands forward and backwards and then said this is how I saw the messenger of allah sallallahu alayhi wasallam doing in under the narration i'll miss was said to him now Basra the lower lumba I'm ulema dispute or argue with you again very well now this hadith is regarding the things or some of the things that I moharram can do and we discussed this before is it permissible for him to change his harm yes it is is it permissible for him to take a bath to shower to clean himself and the answer is yes the issue of alamos water urban Mahama saying that no this is not permissible because he thought may allah be pleased with him that this goes against the sooner however even our bass who was more knowledgeable and who was closer to the Prophet that I salatu salam said that it is permissible and both of them sent this tab eerie who is not a companion may allah have mercy on his soul they sent him to avoid you I'm sorry the great companion of the prophet and he asked him whether the prophet are they his awesome washed his head or not not only that he told him how did the Prophet wash his head and immediately he was taking a bath covering himself with a screen he lowered the screen and he asked one of his companions who was pouring the water to pour it on his head and he moved his head and he got washing his head from the front and from the back as well why would anyone think that it is not permissible to shower or to take a bath some scholars said that because if you do this you will cause hair to fall and that is why you find a lot of schools of thoughts say that it is not permissible for a pilgrim to calm his head to brush his head why they say by doing this hair would fall maybe three four five seven ten allahu alem depending on the hair on his head or in his beard and they said this is not permissible and this is incorrect the Prophet I racism never told us not to calm our hair we're instructed in the Quran not to shave not to cut but coming your hair is permissible and if hair falls because of combing your hair this is no problem it's like when you're making wudu and you wipe over your head a five or six help all because of wiping your head do we say that you don't make wudu know what is intended was to make wood or to wash your head or to come your head and this is permissible if you intend it to remove the hair now this becomes forbidden and it is not recommended also from this hadith we learn how the companions may allah be pleased with them used to try to know the truth and once they know it they stick to it and this is why ms what he said I will never argue with you again even our best you are more knowledgeable from now on if you say something I will believe it and I will embrace it and this shows you the humility of the Companions that they were not arrogant nowadays if this incident took place we would probably go and say Abu Ayub was an old man he doesn't know anymore and if five or ten scholar said said no no that someone bought them someone gave them a bribe this one is too young and this one is too old the companions were not arrogant if the hadith is authentic the Prophet digitalis Oh Salaam this is the end of the story and no need to argue about it moving on to hadith 239 this hadith was narrated by job you've nabbed allah may allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam and his companions assumed the Haram for hajj and none except the prophet are a slob slam and paul ha had the hadith the sacrifice with them Ali was in Yemen he arrived from Yemen and said I have assumed the ROM as the Prophet had done so sallallahu alaihi wasallam the Prophet ordered his companions to perform the Umbra with ROM which they had assumed and after finishing power off and going between safa and marwah he ordered them to cut short their hair and to finish their era meaning finishing the harem meaning becoming halong and this is a bit confusing what do we call a person in the set of a rom with him what do we call a person who is not in the set of a rom halal we call him halal which is in Arabic also equivalent to permissible but first we're not talking about permissible meaning that he is in the state of halal he can do anything that is restricted for emotion so the Prophet Elisha salam instructed them to become halal except those who had heady with them those who had brought their sacrifice with them they that the people the companion said how can we proceed to mina for hajj after having sexual relations with our wives now we're spending seven days in mecca you're telling us not to be in the set of a rom because we did or umrah and we have our wives and you're telling us to become hella to do everything that a Miriam cannot do such as clipping their nails perfuming and having intimacy how can we go to mina like this they thought that this is not like the hodgdon you and the prophet adam is teaching them the proper has not the hajj that you used to do at the pre-islamic era so when they said this to the prophet alayhi salatu salam he said to them if I had formerly known what I came to know lately I would not have brought the hottie with me had there been no happy with me I would have finished the state of a rom I would have done exactly as you are doing at the moment Aisha may Allah be pleased with her got her menses so she performed all the ceremonies of Hajj except the wife of the Kaaba and when she got clean from her menses she performed tore off of the Kaaba she said o prophet of allah sallallahu wasallam all of you are returning with the Hajj and Umrah but I am returning after performing Hajj only so the Prophet ordered salah salem a brahmana bin ABI bakr to accompany her to at a name and thus she performed the Umbra after hajj long hadith the same story the Prophet was in the state of Karen he instructed those who did not have had he to make Remora and then to become hella and under date to perform a hello again and make and continue their hatch now they objected to the fact that how can they have a period of being halal having intercourse clipping their nails perfuming wearing shirts and waste wrappers how is this possible the Prophet told him had I not brought my Hadi I would have done exactly the same I didn't know at the time but then Allah informed it so now in a sense I have to continue until I slaughter I shall may allah be pleased with her she went out with the intention of Umbra but when she had her menses this meant that she cannot make her umrah so what to do callers say that if a person did not start his power for umrah he has the ability to cancel his Umbra and change it into peer on now I am going with the intention of and to stay couple of weeks and then offer hutch on my way I said why should i do this or I had something of an importance to do and time was so limited for me I was supposed to have few days but I came at the eighth of the hedger how can I make ramen up and then offer Hodge again so scholars say it is permissible to make your ambra which you came initially with the intention of it and change it into an upper thing which is kieran so now instead of ramallah you're doing quran likewise they say if someone intended to do quran so I come out of my house I travel saying labaik allahumma am rotten wahaj but before I reach my cow before i start i say that i have four or five days ahead of me why should i stay in the state of a rom I don't have my sacrifice with me they say that you can cancel your Quran and make it tomorrow stay three four days and then make hatch this is a higher level likewise a person coming with the intention of a fraud I'm coming for the Hajj off a fraud I come before I start there are few days then I split it into Rome bruh and after that my afraid I change it into connector and this is what the Prophet instructed his companions to do so all of these are permissible what is not permissible is to change from for example from clear on to a fraud no this is not permissible or a person would like to cancel it altogether this is not permissible once you committed yourself once you made a farm you cannot cancel it at all you have to continue with it do you have any questions yes brother the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam sacrificed 63 camels 163 himself yes and give to Ali 37 yes there any meaning of 63 some said that this is relevant to his age is some say but we cannot say this is what he did that Islam and then he felt tired and gave it to Ali and Alonzo gel knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time pml assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
