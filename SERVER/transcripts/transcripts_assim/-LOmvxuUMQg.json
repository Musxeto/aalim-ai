  "title": "Can I lick my lips while fasting? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Shahid from India. Sheikh I had a question regarding like when we are fasting and if my lips are dry, is it ok to deposit a bit of saliva on the lips just to wet it? Like I have doubts like when I do hudoo I like the water is there on my lips so I need to wipe it completely and I keep my lips dry like the whole day. So what should I do? There is no problem in licking your lips if they are dry and having some saliva on it. This is totally permissible and it has no impact on your fasting. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you are entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they are poor, I will give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
