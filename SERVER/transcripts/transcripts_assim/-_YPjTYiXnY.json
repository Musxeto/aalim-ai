  "title": "How can we know when a dream is from Allah or Shaytan & what to do when we see a bad dream",
  "transcript": "Isa from the UK. Sheikh, my question is when can we distinguish when a dream is a warning from Allah or from Shaytan because sometimes I get dreams which like sudden and like depress me. The Prophet. Or that they preoccupy. Okay, I got your question Isa. The Prophet ï·º told us in an authentic hadith so we don't have to ask anyone else that dreams are of three categories. One a dream that you wake up happy. So this is a glad tiding from Allah Azza Wa Jal and this is part of Prophethood that remained after the distinction or the stoppage of Prophethood. This is the only remaining part which is a good vision. The second type of dreams are dreams that are nightmares. Things that you wake up sad, frightened, depressed. Things you don't like to see. So the Prophet says that these are from Shaytan. What to do when seeing such a dream? Number one, when you first wake up, say, seek refuge in Allah from Shaytan three times. Dry spit to your left three times. Never tell a soul about this dream and the Prophet gives you the glad tiding that this dream would have no impact on you, it would never harm you and Allah knows best."
