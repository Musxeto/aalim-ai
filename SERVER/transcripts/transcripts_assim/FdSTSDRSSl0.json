  "title": "Sinful for attending a Segregated girls school with free mixing with male teachers? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "So my question is, I know it's haram to study in a mixed university for women. So I study in an all-female college, but there are male teachers and however, except some students, most of the students don't abide by hijab and they sometimes joke with the male teacher and the male teacher doesn't lower his gaze. During practical classes, the female students stand very close to the male teacher but I stand a little bit far to our physical contact and sometimes there is physical contact between the teacher and student like showing them how to hold something etc. And there are backbiting sometimes. So there are so many haraam things and fitna going on in my college. In this case, is it haraam or undesirable for me to study there? JazakAllah Khairan. As long as you are abiding by the hijab, avoiding socializing with the male teachers or having any physical contact with them, keeping your distance, it's not your responsibility what other sins some other students may fall into with their teachers. You take your subjects and do your thing and move out. If you can give the other students da'wah, that would be a plus. But again, your studies are fine, in sha Allah, as long as you're not doing anything haram."
