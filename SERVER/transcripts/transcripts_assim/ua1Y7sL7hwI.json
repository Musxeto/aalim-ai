  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India - So Sheikh in my school \nwe have weekly tests, and sometimes I get really good grades in it with the grace of Allah, I \nhave some non-Muslim classmates who keep   on asking me my mark, so they get amazed, but \nthey don't say Masha Allah or Allahumma Barik   so I feel like I'm attracting \nevil eye so should I tell them my   marks or should I hide them, and also I \nobserve my daily Adhkar Alhamdulillah. Okay I will answer Insha Allah. Faizan from India says I do well with the grace of Allah   in exams and sometimes Non-Muslims ask me about \nmy results, so I am hesitant to tell them for   the fear of their evil eye bearing in mind that I \nobserve my Adhkar in the morning, in the evening,   after [ ] Salah, before going to bed, and before \nleaving the house, if this is the case Faizan   you have nothing to worry about, if they ask \nyou can tell them these are my grades and feel   confident that Allah Azzawajal will protect you, \nand they will not be able to harm you the least."
