  "title": "Is it Mandatory to get married (for both Men and Women)? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "an anonymous question from a brother or sister says is it obligatory to get married for both men and women to say that it is obligatory requires an evidence or a Delisle if a person does not want to get married out of religious belief and background this is prohibited and an innovation we know of the hadith of the three companions who came and asked about the forms of worship that the Prophet Isis um performs and one of them said I will never marry women meaning that I'll deprive myself from halal desires for the sake of Allah and the Prophet said as salam came out angrily saying that i get married to women whoever follows a son away a path other than mine is not from me so getting married is part of the Sunnah leaving marriage thinking that it is best for you one's religion is an innovation and it's not from the Sunnah so again the question is it obligatory mandatory upon a man or a woman to get married scholars say if a man has the desire if a man or a woman has the desire for the opposite gender and is healthy capable and financially able to get married it becomes mandatory why does it become mandatory because if he does not get married he will go to sin he will fall into zina into fornication because the desire is there the ability is there what's preventing him his righteousness and piety this would not last for long because Shaitaan will anticipate the right moment if not this month next year if not next year after five years eventually he will make him fall and this is why Rome Adam new hot tub may Allah be pleased with him said to apples OA it a man who was quite old and did not get married and Romar was frank straightforward so he looked at the man in the eyes and said nothing prevents you from getting married except impotency or being sinful and falling into fornication why would someone not get married if he is capable of doing this either he is impotent he's unable to fulfill his spouse's rights or he is having extramarital relationship so this becomes mandatory otherwise it is not mandatory but it is highly recommended"
