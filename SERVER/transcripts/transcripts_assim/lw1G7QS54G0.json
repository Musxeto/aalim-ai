  "transcript": "my question today is we know that if someone steals money this money that he stole becomes haram for him to use and if he uses this money to buy something like clothes or food this this clothing food is also haram for him to consume or use but sheikh my question is if this person uses the stolen money to buy something that would generate more money for him let's say he uses the stored money to buy a car and uses this car for uber that's uber driving with the wealth generated by this uber from this store the money now also be haram wealth and would the wealth also be success first of all the money that is earned through haram means either it's haram due to its nature or its haram due to the way it was earned due to its nature it's stolen money i stole this pen no matter what i do with this pen i give it away i sell it i um whatever i do with it it's still haram it belongs to someone else i have no control over it or over what it generates and haram money that is haram for its the way of of its earning so if i sell pork if i sell weed if i uh take riba or bribes all of this haram due to the way it was earned it's haram for me but it can be given out to my children to my wife as a gift and it's halal for them because the money itself is not haram the way it was earned was haram so now we come to the issue of stolen money some scholars say whatever is generated from investing stolen money this belongs to the owner of that money and you have no right in it and some say if a person repents and is remorseful and asks allah for forgiveness and if he were to return the stolen money with the interest he would be stone broke and that would probably compel him to steal again or would destroy his life totally here some scholars say we look into such an investment and we consider the ratio between the capital and the person working and this is called two people come one with a hundred thousand dollars and one with the know-how and they form a company the guy with the know-how runs the money he knows people and invests it and they've agreed upon themselves that he gets 20 of the profit and the capital gets 80 so the ratio is determined by the norm of the people whatever the ratio is we tell this uber driver you're entitled for this amount of money as you've been working as a driver or as a an employee or as a partner this is your share for your know-how but the capital and the rest of the investment has to go back to the one you stole it from because it's still haram money and allah knows best you"
