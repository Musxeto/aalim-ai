  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] uh and welcome back to another episode of life's adornments where we're talking about child rearing its benefits is virtues it's many ups and downs and most importantly how do we return this matter of raising children back to the quran and the sunnah of the prophet muhammad to help us with these endeavors we have sheikh asim luqman hakeem who is a teacher at zad academy and kiu and has been an imam and a teacher for over 30 plus years alhamdulillah without further ado we'd like to introduce our guest okay so today we're going to be talking about how do we raise children in a way that we sort of preserve their good manners good moral conduct and make sure they have a moral compass that's straight and pointing to the quran and the sunnah so we would like to discuss this first eye on sort of where allah instructs the children it says that and when the children among you come to puberty then let them also ask for permission as those senior to them in age what what is this ayah speaking about what does it mean to ask permission what is the significance of this in chapters of and also in the books that deals with usually we will find a chapter that deals with el is and is the then is taken from the arabic noun and it means to permit or permission so istithan is actually to seek permission and this is done usually before entering a room and the reason of a state then is obviously as mentioned by the prophet verily seeking permission is to seek permission for the eyes so when you ask permission it's not to listen to something or to touch something it's rather to look at something and this is why we have doors this is why we have curtains so that you prevent people from looking in an authentic hadith the prophet was once in his house and he was like using a small knife a small spear scratch his head with and there was a man from outside of the house looking through the cracks trying to snoop into the prophet's house and the prophet when he figured this out he was trying to look where the guy is looking and poke his eye and the prophet this is whoa what are you doing and the prophet justified this and said whoever looks into your home whoever peeps into your home without your permission if you poke his eye out there is no penalty or no sin on you because he's the one who's transgressing not me i'm simply defending my my home my privacy my aura and this is the essence forest event why do we seek permission so that i would not see someone's else and what is the meaning of means the area of the body that must not be seen by others so it differs from one person to the other a man's aura is usually from the knees to the belly button to his navel this is aura no one must see this except his spouse so a man can see his wife and a wife can see her husband there's no aura between them everything is halal for them but when it comes to mahram so what can i see from my mother and what my mother can see from me this differs i cannot see my mother's belly or back or thighs these are all aura i can see my mother's hair like my sister like my aunt like my daughter they are my mahram and i am their mahram so i can see what is usually accepted because we are mahram we cannot marry one another for life but when it comes to a strange woman or someone who is foreign to me she's all aura i cannot look at her now the issue of aura usually people tend to have loose beliefs in so when it comes to like my mother she's my mother when it comes to my daughter she's okay i i give birth to her so i can see whatever no there are limits and this is why a man asked the prophet he said oh prophet of allah when i want to enter my mother's room must i seek forgiven must i seek permission normal question so the prophet isalam is teaching us analogy how to think instead of giving us a fish teaching us how to fish is much better so he said would you like to see her naked and the man was startled and said of course not a prophet of allah so the prophet said then you have to seek permission this is why we seek permission now coming back to your eye after this lengthy introduction the ayah states and it's addressing the parents all parents or you who believe whenever the children want to seek permission you should teach them that that they must not enter your chambers until they seek permission and especially before fajr time and when you take your siesta that is when you sleep after or before in the afternoon and after isha prayer these are the private times where a couple go into their chambers and they loosen up you know they they wear their uh clothes of sleeping of adoring oneself to his or her spouse these are times where children let alone adults are instructed to seek permission so if i'm sitting in my uh boxes for example or wearing shorts if my wife is wearing uh something that beautifies her in my eyes and no one else is allowed to see that then definitely no one can enter without knocking and seeking permission because if the children come and see this even if they are beyond or below the age of puberty this sticks in their minds and a lot of the parents do a major major mistake when they think that it's okay that we have intimacy and that i change my clothes in front of my children they're too young they're five or four years of age they will not remember even if they were one year old it sticks in the memory in a way that we don't understand how yeah i got a call from a sister a few days back she's complaining that her husband is immoral in front of his grown-up children so he has teenaged girls and boys and he has no problem in sitting in his boxers maybe changing his clothes maybe entering the toilet without closing the door what is this and he says to her what's wrong in that they're my children subhanallah this is exactly what allah azzawajal has addressed in the quran the times when you loosen up when you take off your clothes and you want to relax and be comfortable slip into something comfortable that may reveal or definitely it will reveal your aura this is the time when people must seek permission before entering your chambers and what does this instill in our children to value to protect and to observe the raura and this is why when we teach our children that this is a taboo this is haram we are not allowed to enter a room without seeking permission because maybe someone is changing maybe this or that if we manage to do this if some pervert down the street meets our child and says uh show me your underwear lots of privates do this if the child is not aware that this is something that is sacred and no one is allowed to do this or see this he would probably give in and many cases of rape and child harassment and abuse from such perverts took place because we failed in teaching this beautiful aspect of aura and how to cover it and who to cover it from and how to seek permission before being introduced into a room or entering a room all of this would help up bringing our children in a smart yet polite way in islam you are taught that you seek permission three times in the islamic way before they had curtains rarely you would find doors so the islamic way was not to ring a bell because there was no doorbells and there was not wood to knock on so the islamic way was to stand away from the curtain or from the door and say so the islamic greeting peace may peace be upon you can i come in and you repeat this three times if no one answers then you have to go and by not going in allah would reward you immensely this exact scenario happened with the prophet he came to a companion's house he said three times and he left and immediately the companions came out and said oh prophet of allah come in so the prophet said why didn't you answer me in the beginning he said i wanted to hear your salam twice and three times to get more hajjir from your dua the same incident happened to uh when one of the companions and i think he was who was young and he came and said and nobody replied so he left umar came out and said come come where are you going he said i did the sunnah the prophet said give salaam three times seek permission if not then leave omar did not know of this hadith but omar was very strict when it came to things related to religion he said who said this and the guy said the prophet saws so he said you will bring someone to testify or i will flog you for lying so that what the man went back you know terrified of this and and guys look what's what's happening uh this is what umar said so they all laughed the companions and they sent the youngest from among them to show that this is something we all know of and they went to umar and he testified omar said to him listen man don't get me wrong i didn't accuse you of lying but i wanted people to glorify the hadith of the prophet and not to mess around with it or just say whatever they want to say we're going to stop here for a short break and we'll be back to continue this discussion on our another and the importance of seeking permission before you enter in a gathering viewer stay tuned we'll be right back after a short break [Music] and welcome back to our second segments of life adornments where we took off last talking about seeking permission before a child enters into a room and we know that one of the things that said is that the eyes are the windows to the soul meaning that what you see it affects the way you think it affects your heart it affects your spiritual state so one should be very cautious of looking at things that are impermissible for them to look at and this is why it's significant for a person to take permission before they see something that's not appropriate for them to see likewise things that people eat this is another way things that enter your body also affects your spiritual state as well so we want to talk about what is the significance of being mindful of the things that you eat and the things that go into your body and the way in which we go about consuming things well it goes without saying anyone who knows islam knows that it focuses on what is halal and if you read the quran the scriptures of the muslim you will find that it includes types of foods that are totally prohibited such as pork such as things that are slaughtered to idols or when slaughtered you mention other than the name of allah in the name of buddha in the name of jesus in the name of whatever or it is not slaughtered we are as muslims we cannot eat something that is not slaughtered by a muslim or a jew or a christian so if you understand the concept of food you understand that everything on earth is halal except what allah azzawajal told us to avoid and everything that we drink is halal except those that are allah prohibited us from consuming such as intoxicants then you get to know that other than this being a form of worship to allah it is something to do with our health and islam highlights whatever is healthy for you now we know that consuming pork that consuming things that were not slaughtered is dangerous for your health but when it comes even to the etiquettes of eating and drinking islam teaches our children from an early age how to do that the prophet islam taught um his stepson how to eat when he said say bismillah before you eat and eat with your right hand do not eat with your left and eat from what's in front of you in islam it's a given fact that a muslim cannot eat or drink or use anything to put in his mouth except with his right hand even if he was a lefty so you you're a lefty no problem what do you want us to do chop your left hand off no you can use that but when it comes to eating and drinking nope why is that because the prophet said allah islam when you give give with your right hand and when you take take with your right hand when you eat eat with your right hand and when you drink drink with your right hand because shaytan the devil satan gives and takes eats and drinks with his left so whoever uses his left in these things shaytaan is sharing that food that drink with him and we know that shaytan is everywhere the devils are everywhere but we don't see them yet we have the means to block them the prophet tells us whenever a man enters his home locks the door saying bismillah the devil tells his companions let's leave there is no resting place for us in this house and whenever he eats his supper and says bismillah the devil tells his companions let's leave we have missed a resting place and also supper but if we fail to do that then we are giving a safe haven for the devils to be around us and you never know what they will do to negatively affect our lives etiquettes of food the prophet told us not to eat from the middle of the food so if we have a plate of rice it is like a pile it is not permissible to eat from the top you have to eat from the sides why the prophet said alaihis that the blessing of allah the baraka comes on the top so when you eat from the sides you get a share of it but when you take from the top you're taking from the barakah itself and depriving the others and depriving the food from the barakah itself so this is the sunnah the sunnah from of eating we see children not abiding by the table manners what do you mean they take the food and go watch tv or go to their rooms or sit in the living room no this is not part of the islamic etiquettes the islamic etiquette is to eat from the same plate not to have your own plate and to join the rest of the family on this meal i sat a few weeks ago with a brother he was not practicing but he had a beautiful rule in his home no one dines alone so lunch is served when each and every member of the family is on the table this is our half hour of quality time dinner is served when everyone is on the table and while we're eating we are not allowed to use any mobile phones or watch tv this is quality time i gave it a thought and i said to myself subhanallah this is minimum of an hour a day yes i don't spend this with my kids in a week so this guy is far smarter than me because though he's doing it out of his own upbringing this is how he found his father doing and insisting so he's doing carrying on the family tradition that this is smart and if we can manage to have this with our children so many good things we can put into them in this quality time so the sunnah is that we combine that we join one another while eating because this is where the barakah comes in the authentic hadith the companions of the prophet is on a journey complained to him and said oh prophet of allah the food is not enough we run out of food quickly so the prophet asked them one specific question do you eat together or separate so they said no we eat separate each one of us takes the food and goes to a shade goes uh under a mountain or whatever and eat said no get together eat from the same food mention the name of allah saying bismillah and the companion says the narrator of the hadith we did this and the food was sufficient and we had surplus of it so these are things that the westerners may not comprehend the role of barakah a lot of non-muslims may fail to understand because they measure things materialistically 900 grams is sufficient for so many days 850 is not while we muslims believe that one gram can be sufficient if allah puts barakah and puts blessing in it at the end of times the prophet told us allah when the antichrist when the jail comes the first year the rain and crops are minus one-third the second year two-thirds are missing and only one-third of the rain and one-third of the crops comes the third year zero rain and zero crops okay if we don't have rain and if we don't have crops what are we going to eat from the animals will die definitely so as humans how are we going to feed no meat and no crops so the prophet alice answered this by saying the people would say subhanallah alhamdulillah and this would fill them up as if they had food now people say come on what is this what is this this is an authentic hadith do you expect me to believe this who gives what whatever i don't care you believe it or not this is what muslims believe and we believe that the barakah of allah azzawajal makes miracles the food is created by allah it give us power and nutrition subhanallah alhamdulillah is the vikr of allah azza and if allah wills it it does this for me and this is what miracles uh are all about so we believe in this and the concept of barakah by the way is a vast concept surat al-baqarah is a barakah is a barakah but nobody is making their children memorize it for protection etc you have makkah medina baraka the times there are times of the year months that are barakah there are nights that are barakah there are hours in the day and the night that are considered to be barakah and you can go on the sky is the limit having said that the etiquettes of eating so many times when it comes to children we are careful of hygiene you have to wash your hand before and after eating in the sunnah there's nothing prescribed so if you do wash your hands it's just out of cleanliness but you cannot blame someone and say no you have to do that because this is part of the religion no it's not part of the religion and sometimes we go overboard with the issue of part of religion or not in the sense that we tend to care for our children's hygiene which is good but do not cross the red lines what do you mean by that okay washing your hand is good keeping your clothes clean is good what about if a piece of food fell on the ground throw it in the garbage ah wrong answer the sunnah is to uplift it and look into it and anything that is harmful or impure remove it like soil like dust or whatever and say bismillah and eat it whoa why would i do such a thing because the prophet said alaihis do not leave it for shaytan so dropping food is possible but if you believe that the barakah is from allah you never know maybe the barakah is in that morsel and islam doesn't tell you to kill yourself or to get yourself contaminated with illnesses and and viruses and whatever but it tells you to clean it make sure it's clean and say bismillah which eradicates anything that's harmful with the grace of allah and consume it so we have to look in how to take care of our children's food in a holistic way the diet of our children nowadays is horrible it's all high calories all sugar all fried it's killing their hearts their kidneys their liver their bone structure and this is our own doing we have to take care of providing them with healthy food and teaching them the etiquettes of eating definitely that's a very crucial point that could be a segment within itself uh not only being thankful for the things that you have uh you know eating correct things but even closing with alhamdulillah after allah provides right you know given thanks and praise for the things that you have so you don't take it for granted and not only that it's relating everything that we have to allah and this is the difference between us and others everything we enjoy is a gift and a blessing from allah azza we talk we do not take this for granted and we don't attribute it to others so by acknowledging that by praising allah with his after consuming food or drinking and announcing this this keeps you loyal and a true servant and slave of allah this is the end of our segment there was much benefit that could could be taken from this segment uh thank you so much for your miss knowledge uh viewers thank you so much for joining us for another segment we hope that you benefited greatly and put into practice the things that you learn and teach your children and teach your family members so that we can uh consume healthy things and look at things that are appropriate so that we can grow up in a healthy islamic way and may allah accept and increase until next time assalamu alaykum [Music] um [Music]"
