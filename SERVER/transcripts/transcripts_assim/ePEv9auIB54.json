  "title": "Do Angels have free will?",
  "transcript": "so the sister says that do angels have free will the Angels are a creation of Alonzo agenda they are perfect and the question whether they have free will or not is not a proper question that the self you brought up so no one used to ask whether a human being is a person or a creation of Allah that has free will or he is ordered to do things like a robot and to ask about the angels whether they are acting and implementing Alice commands as a robot without any will like the wind and like the water they don't think this is not true Allah created them and gave them a high status but they do not disobey allah azza wajal due to their obedience due to their high ranking not because they are unable and there's a difference when Allah praises them that they do not disobey him it would not be something praiseworthy if they did not have the ability to disobey if I say that this door or this wall doesn't ever disobey me this is not something prayed praiseworthy because it doesn't have any free will to obey or to disobey while the Angels have their own will they ask questions they dispute among one another as in the hadith of the person who killed a hundred Souls and wanted to repent and then died in the middle of the way to a righteous village the angels of mercy and the angels of hell they disputed who is more worthy of taking him so Eliza shall told the solution the Prophet hasn't told us that Allah sent an angel in the form of a man to judge between them and Allah so Allah when he told the Angels that I'll be creating a human on earth they asked Allah would you create someone who would shed blood blood and spread corruption so they communicate and they may dispute and they love and they hate so to say that they do not have a free will is not appropriate to describe them as such is not the right thing to say they are a very high level of Allah's creation the best of the best and Allah praise them that they do not sin so we should keep it as such"
