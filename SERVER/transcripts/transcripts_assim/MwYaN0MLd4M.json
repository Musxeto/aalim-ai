  "transcript": "All what you see in life and death is a test. However, we all deep down in our subconscious think and believe that testing cannot be except with calamities. Allah's testing is with disasters, with illnesses, with poverty. But this is not true. Allah says in the Quran, We shall make a trial of you with evil and with good, and to us you will return. So Allah is testing us not only with poverty, but with wealth, not only by diseases and illnesses, but with health, not only by insecurity, but by stability and security as well. All of these are tests from Allah. So don't think that you're saved. Ibn Abbas, may Allah be pleased with him, explains this ayah, He says, Allah tests us with hardship and prosperity. With health and illness, with wealth and poverty, with halal and haram, with obedience and with disobedience, with guidance and with misguidance. All of these are Allah's tests. And Allah's test to us is not like our teachers testing. We can cheat, or we can get a tip, or we can buy the questions before the test day."
