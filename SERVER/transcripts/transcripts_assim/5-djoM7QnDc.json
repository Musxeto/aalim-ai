  "transcript": "what he says does playing rupiah from phone on speaker has the same effect as someone reciting it in person while the patient is there that's a good question where is rupiah Rokia is a set of verses of the quran prophetic sayings or normal duaa with good words that we recite over or upon a sick person so that Allah would cure him and the greatest of all rukia is al-fatiha chapter number one of the Quran this is the best rocket ever it has marvelous healing powers with the grace of Allah then you have al kursi then you have the last three chapters of the or an Surat al Clausura tell father surah tunis these are also great in curing evil eye and the jinn possession and black magic now the question as well he says is it the same effect whether I play it from my mobile or from a cassette recorder or to have someone reciting it in person without any doubt reciting it by a person who's present is far greater and more beneficial than listening to it recorded because this is a form of worship and when someone is reciting it live the impact of it is far greater and the benefit of it is way more noticeable than just playing it from a mobile or from a recorder nevertheless if a person is unable to have someone recited for him or he himself recited for himself in this case there is no problem in playing the Rukia because a lot of the scholars say that playing it has a positive impact as in the case of people who live in a house where they complain of it being haunted or suffering from few things in the house and they play Surat al-baqarah that a large the vigil would benefit them from the surah being played though no one is reciting it live you"
