  "title": "Why can’t we fast on our BIRTHDAY? The Prophet ‎ﷺ did it! assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The second question is from Muhammad and he says, ìThe Messenger of Allah ﷺ was asked about fasting on Mondays. He said, ìThat is a day on which I was born and a day on which I received revelation.î So the question is, can we fast on our birthdays? Now the Prophet had given two reasons, alayhis salatu wassalam. It was the day he was born in but he did not stop here. He said, ìAnd it was a day I received a revelation on.î So these are two reasons and this is why he is expressing his gratitude to Allah by fasting it. If you have these two reasons, you may go ahead and fast the day of your birth. But if you do not have these reasons, as the companions, may Allah be pleased with them, did not have it, then you might as well follow their footsteps and do not innovate in this religion because none of the companions or the tabi'een or the tabi'at tabi'een had ever done such a thing and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
