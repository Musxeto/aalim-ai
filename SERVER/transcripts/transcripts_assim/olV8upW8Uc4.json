  "transcript": "a questioner says can we help a poor girl by giving interest or the cat money for her wedding expenses knowing that they might use the money on haram things hiring a band or use it for the bride's makeup that would be revealed in front of nan mahram's as the wedding would be a mixed gathering if you know for certain that this interest money your charity your zakat money is certainly going to be utilized in haram you must not give it to them but if these are only speculations they might do this they might do that this is not my job to investigate again it's not my job to enter people's hearts it's not my job to interrogate the poor and demand they tell me where they're going to spend the money so i can't give them zakatman they said okay what are you going to do with it are you going to buy cigarettes do you watch netflix do you have this you have that and i check the boxes then i give it to them no this is not permissible but if i know for certain that the father of the girl comes to me and says we need the money to uh hire a big hole in a hotel it's going to be mixed we're going to we i need a lot of money because of the band that's coming to play music now this is crystal clear you cannot assist in that but if he comes to you and say i'm from the subcontinent and we have this uh um habit or tradition where simi men not real men simi men take dowry from girls and unfortunately this is prevailing in the subcontinent men don't allow this don't accept this simi men would dictate yes she goes to the father of the of the bride and says i need a toyota corolla i need a flat i need a golden wristwatch i need i need i need this is not a man he's a wimp real men don't accept a penny from the girl or from her parents because they have dignity they have honor these are real men but unfortunately if she's not going to get married except to such whims in this case it is permissible for you to assist them in paying such a dowry to ward the worst of the two evils and allah azza knows best"
