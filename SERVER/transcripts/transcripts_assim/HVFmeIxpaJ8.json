  "transcript": "[Music] um AA uh which is the last question in our emails unless we get other questions from the callers if not we'll call it a day uh is there any Hadith mentioning that one who memorizes the Quran and forgets it will be resurrected on the day of judgment as a blind man no there isn't an authentic Hadith there isn't there are a number of hadiths but they're all weak and this is an issue of dispute among Scholars used to consider it as a sin some of the scholars even considered it as a major sin to memorize an Ayah to memorize a Surah or a portion of the Quran and then forget it they used to consider it as a major sin but the most authentic opinion when you look into the evidences and to the other Scholars who uh uh said something else you'd find that there isn't any authentic Hadith stating that such a person would be resurrected blind those who would be resurrected blind on the day of judgment are those who neglected and ignored the signs and of Allah and the verses of the Quran they will complain on the day of judgment why are we resurrected blind while while we were in this life able to see and Allah Asel would reprimand them by saying saying to them that this is exactly what you did that my signs came to you my verses of the Quran came to you and you have given it your back and you forgot it and this is why you are forgotten today that Allah would not have mercy on them so if someone neglects and ignores the verses of Allah in the sense that he does not apply them he will be resurrected blind not simply forgetting an Ayah and saying that I used to memorize this Surah but then I was made to forget it no this is it it can't forgetfulness could be something that is natural and also it can be deliberate because you're not revising it in both cases inshallah a person is not sinful yet if a verse of the Quran States even if it does not memorize it states that riba is a Maj sin and Allah would wage war and his Prophet would wage war Sall alaihi wasallam against those who deal in riba and this we give as a present to the uh brothers and sisters who work in financial institutions in Banks and they deal in riba as if it is something normal you take a loan you pay interest you deposit your money you take interest to those Allah is W Waging War so if the brothers and sisters that deal in riba neglect this Ayah neglect the hadiths of the Prophet Alam they will be partly resurrected as blind because of their ignorance and their neglect of the verses of the Quran we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
