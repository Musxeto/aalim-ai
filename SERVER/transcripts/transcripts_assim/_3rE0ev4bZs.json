  "title": "Reading Scriptures of other religions to give Dawah - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Rita says is it permissible to read scriptures of other religions with the objective of giving that WA to non-muslims first of all our scholars from the Salaf say that it is wrong to give that WA to people through their scriptures the Prophet did not do this Holly salat wa sallam the Companions did not do this and the tab in and the tablet every they used to call them with to the Quran and to the Sunnah . so to go and study their scriptures and call them to Islam through their scriptures this is not something done by the Salaf now the Prophet himself alayhi salat WA Salam so o Madhava table once reading a paper so he said what are you reading all Omar sir Omar said o prophet of Allah this is a page from the Torah the Old Testament and I'm just curious looking and reading it so the Prophet snatched it from his hand and said angrily that if musa peace be upon him were alive he would not be able to do anything but follow me and he prevented Omar from reading it now some scholar said that this was in the beginning of Islam so that he would not be confused and things would not be mixed in his mind about Islam and other religions but later on the Prophet ordered Zaidan if Abbot may Allah be pleased with him to learn Hebrew and he learnt it in 13 days and he used to ask him to look whether what the Jews are saying and coating from their books is correct or lying as in the of the punishment of an adulterer and adulteress where they had put tar in their faces and made them sit backwards on mules and they started taking them round Medina and they claimed that this was the punishment for those who commit the act of fornication and this was not the case because it was stoning as mentioned in the Old Testament in the Torah so abdullah hashem who was one of the rabbis who accepted islam said that they are lying and then the story is is well-known so scholars now have different opinions some say yes it can be possible that we learn their scriptures in order to reply to their lies to their doubts to their confusion and clarify it to them others say no you're not allowed to do this we have the Quran we have the sinner who cares what happens in their religion we invite them to our religion if they like it at home they left they don't let them stay with their religion there's no compulsion and no oppression let them believe what they whatever they believe and it seems that the most authentic opinion is that only those who are knowledgeable in Islam and I mean students of knowledge who know Arabic who know the Quran well understand the hadith have sound Ikeda have studied books of Ikeda and know exactly what Islam is all about and not only hearsay or logic but rather actual knowledge of al Qaeda and of Islam Islamic knowledge only those are qualified to look into the books when needed of other religions nowadays unfortunately we see so many youngsters in their early in their teens and some are in their early teas dressed like the Honorable Sheikh Ahmed Deedat may Allah have mercy on his soul it was a great day to Islam one of the greatest eloquent fluent he was like a nice breeze coming and he used to give dowry and he was successful so now we get clones of him wearing the same suit wearing the same CUFI or the cap and doing the same form of Dawa which might be effective which might be good but if you check their Islamic knowledge you'll find that it is zero so they memorize few things here and there but entirely speaking or holistically speaking you have zero knowledge in Islam and this is not right they must be strongly founded in Islamic knowledge in al-qaeda in Quran in in the hadith and then be able to study to give Dera and there now should not be based on their books on the other scriptures rather it should be originating from Islam from Quran and from the Sunnah itself in a large social knows best"
