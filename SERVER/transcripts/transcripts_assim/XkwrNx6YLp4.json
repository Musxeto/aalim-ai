  "transcript": "I for Allah nothing but Allah but is the beginning of is for bearing of Allah and is for reward is for the garden of paradise is for the Blessed pilgrimage is for the Seal of the prophethood given to the prophet muhamed alhamdulillah dear brothers and sisters in Islam and welcome to this new episode of ask Huda coming to you live from jida Saudi Arabia and our first question for today comes from Ahmed Ahmed had sent us two questions the first one he says regarding killing animals for sport for example some people hunt lions etc for Pure Pleasure or some people will hunt fish without eating it is this killing Haram and is it a minor or a major sin first of all Islam is the dean of compassion and mercy and in Islam if you look at the general teachings and rulings of it you find that it does not allow Muslims to kill without a legitimate reason even if it were for Animals let alone for humans of course the prophet tells usat that a woman was admitted into hell because she kept a kitten kept a cat and locked it up so that it would not eat from the insects of the earth nor she fed it so she let the kitten until it died out of starvation the prophet said Allah admitted this woman to hell because of such an an action also the prophet Alat wasam cursed those who take a living creature as a target for uh uh shooting practice so the prophet cursed those who do this and this is a major sin but Scholars agree and this is a consensus that whenever the killing is justifiable so if you want to kill in order to eat from such an animal you want to fish to eat such a fish this is all permissible this is all Halal now the difference of a opinion arises if the Killing is Just for the fun of it not to protect yourself from Harm's Way or from an aggressor animal just for the fun of it and they have different opinions some say that it is not recommended and some say it is prohibited and this is the most authentic opinion of all Scholars and this is the choice of Al may Allah have mercy on his soul where he said that this is totally prohibited such waste such pleasure out of inflicting pain and Agony to animals for no legitimate reason this defies the general rulings and teachings of Islam and also it makes a person who does this fall under the curse of Allah Asel ahmed's second question is also about the ruling on killing dogs so we know that in the beginning when the prophet came to Medina Alat he instructed his companions to kill all types of dogs and they started implementing this directive of his until the ruling was abrogated and and the prophet saidham Allah prohibited me from killing a nation as big as the uh uh the dogs the canines so do not kill them anymore except for the black fully black dog and in another narration the prophet saidat wasam and gave us another description of such a black dog so not any black dog but a black dog that has two white spots or yellowish spots on top of his eyes so it's like on the forehead he has two dots whether yellow or white but the rest of the body is totally black so this the prophet told usat wasam and instructed us to kill and this is the most authentic opinion that it is not permissible to kill dogs unless they fit such a description or if the dog itself is aggressive and attacking there are dogs whether they have this uh uh illness that causes them to bite people rabies I think they call it or something like that or they are wild by the M themselves and they attack anyone in this case no you are entitled you have the right to kill such dogs and if the dog is black with the two white or yellowish spots over his uh eyes however we have to always be careful if the dog belongs to someone you're not entitled to go and kill that dog saying that oh the prophet of Allah ordered me to do so this is not your right the dog is a financial possession of a particular individual whether Muslim or non-muslim you have no right in trespassing your limits you have no right in going and executing such an instruction without taking the permission of the owner also you have to be careful not to be breaking any kind of law if if you are in a country because laws have to be obeyed and respected this is part of your Visa uh uh application that you f sign in or part of being a citizen of the country to comply with the laws other than that if it's no one's dog and there's no breaking of the law and it fits the description it's either a dog that attacks people and harms them or a black dog that has these two spots then inshallah you have no problem with that it seems that we have a problem with the phone calls or with the display of uh receiving phone calls so bear with us inshallah I hope they fix it uh uh quite soon otherwise we're going to wrap up the whole program Hussein says if I said that yeah Allah if I commit a certain sin again then punish me is this considered a bad Dua you tell me Hussein do you think that this is a good Dua it is preposterous how people think so little of Allah and of his punishment and of his curse and of his hell that they call upon themselves to be among those cursed or tormented if they drink uh uh fuzzy drinks or sodas for example usually people say such things to prevent themselves from doing it so a person who's diabetic who cannot resist chocolate he says the curse of Allah be upon him if he eats chocolate bar again and he doesn't think that what he's saying might be answered the prophet said and theith is in Muslim do not supplicate against yourselves do not supplicate against your children your family in general and do not supplicate against your wealth for you may meet an hour where Allah answers those who supplicate to him and then you will be doing doomed so imagine someone is frustrated of his son and he said may Allah do this to you and boom it's done how does he feel one of the prominent di here callers for Islam is a brother and this brother's name was Abdullah and he tells us his story that when he was in high school he used to smoke and his father used to tell him do not smoke and warns him and punishes him for it he says one morning my father caught me red-handed while I was smoking so he said may Allah break your neck on that day I went to school in the middle of the school day me and a group of boys we ran away from the school skipped school and went to h a house of one of our friends and there was a swimming pool so I went to take a dip and I did not measure the depth of the swimming pool so when I dived I accidentally hit my head in the bottom of the swimming pool which caused my neck to break and since then I am paralyzed from neck under and the guy is being carried on a wheelchair or whatever a bed that he goes to different masjids giving DA giving uh um preaching people to reflect on their sins Etc but this is the supplication of the father that now don't ask how does the father feel till date because this when he sees this every single day and he knows that this is the result of my Dua so no one in his sound mind would make Dua against himself some of them say oh Allah I will become a Christian I will become a Jew if I smoke another cigarette and then he falls weak and smokes it why would you do such a thing why would you curse yourself the prophet Alat wasam and the Hadith is authentic visited a sick young man who got so sick that he lost most of his weight and he was like a chicken or a hen very thin and without feathers without anything so the prophet Alam visited him and said have you been asking Allah anything and the man said yes oh prophet of Allah I used to supplicate and say oh Allah whatever you store for me of punishment on the day of judgment oh Allah make your punishment upon me now and not let do not let me wait and face My Punishment on the day of judgment so the intention was okay he simply wanted to skip the punishment of hell but this was due to his ignorance may Allah be pleased with him the prophet Alam was angered by this he said Subhan Allah who can bear such a punishment why instead didn't you ask Allah for forgiveness and for health wouldn't that been better so when you see something and you say may Allah destroy it may Allah do this and that to it why don't you say may Allah fix it may Allah guide them may Allah grant them hi instead because Allah answers both du so why do you always take the negative and bad one so definitely Hussein what you have asked Allah is wrong you should not have asked Allah to punish you for any kind of sin but rather you should have asked Allah to guide your heart to abiding by the Sunnah to stay away from sin and to forgive you if you were to fall weak and fall into such a sin later on okay the fourth question is from Kushi she says I'm from India and here most of the women say there their Salah in their houses so they offer their prayers in their houses uh and in her Society none of the women go to the Masjid for their jum prayer and at the time of Friday or J prayer they say Salah even I do the same so my question is am I sinning by doing this if I am sinning please tell me the right way to say Juma prayer first of all before I take uh kushi's question uh we have Aiza from qar uh sh I have a couple of questions yes the first question was uh uh staying up after F prayer and uh it's some of the scholars mentioned in the Hadith correct me if I'm wrong about mentioning about the uh reward of the sh okay as with the equal with the H and the second question about the FIA about the pring FIA for the woman's Miss up the fasting in Ramadan time why and the why for having a for movement problem for okay and for the third question was when someone perform my prayer and she just uh perform only without reading the opening Dua just read fa only is it allowed and the next following question will be my last last question about ruling of sending a prayer to the prophet s wasallam by saying okay now these are two questions or four questions that is my last question okay I will answer you inshallah Muhammad from Dubai how are you I am fine Muhammad alhamdulillah sh I have two three question number one is women are allowed to do EA while sitting in a mosque or just please highlight on that one and uh second question uh it's allowed uh to change the wife name to husband name after marriage or we have to follow the wife has to follow her father name okay if if if we are doing the same uh are doing a sin or what is the ruling on it okay and and number three I miss your answer on the patting of a cat can you describe because my son want to Pat a cat that is an important thing what what what is it Muhammad I said my son want to Pat a cat Okay cat I miss your program in the uh start when you are describing the cat thing okay any more questions sure thank you very much I will answer you inshallah so Ki question is about Friday for women we know that the consensus of all Scholars of Islam that women a traveler a slave and a child are Exempted from attending Friday prayer so it is not mandatory upon them so a woman is more rewarded when she prays home the issue of India's Masjid is a problematic because it is part of Islam to have a place for women or at least not to prevent women from coming into a Masjid and praying this is her god-given right the prophet said do not prevent women from attending the Salat in the Masjid however if a woman follows the Sunnah and does not pray in the Masjid she has to pray because J or Friday prayer can only be prayed in the Masjid with the congregation with the IM giving the two hbas Etc so for a woman when she prays home she must pray prayer as she did on uh the previous day of Thursday as she will do on the following day on Saturday so I hope this answers your question Asif from sa Arabia yes I have a question actually I have a flat you know in a pure non-muslim Society in India yes and actually the reason of buying where many one of the important reason was you know in a Muslim area the flight was very expensive and uh collectively I have to pay a big amount which I was not able to F but anyway I have alhamdulillah bought this flight and in long time I'm planning that in I will sell and move to Muslim Society but these days when I go to for vacation for 2 three months sometimes I am I have to stay in that flat itself because arranging is difficult so I'm telling is it sinful because you know it mid is very very far and most of the people are non-muslim so it becomes very difficult so first of all what is the ruling to buy a flight in the society is it okay or generally in India it's a trend that a good percentage of people have Society have flight in this kind of society is it true or not and second thing temporary I have good SP so is it manageable or I have to be strict on searching in Muslim Society okay I will answer inshallah sah from Saudi hello yes Sarah uh from bahin yeah I have two question and one is Quran saying that only M can go to jna not all the Muslims right uh my question is I was listening one Islamic program it's saying that exan it means a great Iman whoever have exan he or she can go to fad and see Allah always in there and also getting Allah's Rahim if anybody have exan so my question is if I want to be exan category what I have to do like more than M me this is the first question okay the second question is uh we know that uh Allah is merciful okay the if anyone live in makah or medina they are going always five prayers right and then they will get thousand of other getting other for for Salah so and also some people going every every years hjj umah you know like that but we are if anybody doesn't have maharam or anybody staying away from Maka or medina away from Saudi so we cannot do like that much we cannot get like that other like like you sh you you are going all the world and giving lectures Islamic lectures like that so Mah you people getting more but like us people even if we don't have Mahar to I got question you know it is so when how we get how Allah is Count him because it is you know very big different you know I will I will answer you in okay abdah from Iraq how are you I am fine I apologize for missing the three weeks uh ago and I got your email Abdullah and I it is my pleasure a to answer your questions no problem no problem sir I have a question you know about the verse of holy Quran verse number 54 it [Music] said this word meaning active caring or repenting to Allah okay the second question that's it I have just my question yes I will answer inshah um dear viewers we have like six fully loaded questions and inshallah we will try to answer them after the break so stay [Music] tuned today I'm going to talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader Prophet Muhammad sallallah alai wasam reminded us through his guidance and example that Islam is complete submission to the will of Allah for one who submits a mere declaration or display of belief will not be taken for success but his or her heart and soul will certainly be put to test Allah tested the prophet of Allah sallallah alai wasam severely in order that he s. wasam becomes an example for his companions to follow similarly he he tests the believer to see whether he lives a righteous life in accordance with the instructions and commands set by Allah or lives according to what his desires dictate whether the faith he displays is firmly rooted in his heart or is it merely on the surface he will be tested to see whether he will continue to have faith and love of Allah when in a calamity as he does when in Comfort whether he will continue to remember and worship him if given bounties and Comforts of life as he does when he lives a modest life Allah will undoubtedly test him to see if his faith trust and love of him is unconditional or is it conditioned upon good health and a comfortable life free from stress and anxy the prophet of Allah sallallah alai wasam showed us through his own example that for a righteous Muslim this life is a testing ground where he will continue to be tested until he meets Allah for him tests will be conducted on Earth while he lives and not after he dies he knows that as soon as death arrives and he steps into the next World his tests are over there he only receives the result of his tests and enjoys the fruits of the Deeds that he committed during a short span of time called [Music] life asalam alayum and welcome back so our first question from says what's the ruling on is is was mentioned in an authentic Hadith where the Prophet said whoever prays F prayer in congregation in the Masjid and remains there remembering Allah until the sun rises and prays two Ras Allah would register for him reward him with and ha perfect perfect perfect so the condition is that it has to be performed in a Masjid and the sisters who pray home they are not part of that reward however I pray to Allah Asel that if they pray home knowing and anticipating the reward and not going to the Masjid because they know that the prophet told them that their prayer in their home is better I pray to Allah that they will get the same reward without even been sitting that long and Allah knows best Ahmed from Libya how are you I'm fine Z for asking what can I do for you I love you for the sake of Allah may Allah love you as well I have one question yes sir called me and he was asking masturbation I told him I heard some shakes saying it is Haram but he still inist he said he also heard another Shake saying that it is Haram Hal so I want your your your your opinion on this please okay any more questions that's all thank you very much you're welcome so A's second question about fidya the issue of fidya is frequently asked about especially nowadays because Ramadan is like three weeks or less uh from today so women who did not fast did not make up for the Miss previous days of Ramadan they now are on a tight leech because they have like three weeks and they don't have enough time to fast Etc so they ask about fidya that is after Ramadan is over and they have to make up for the M days do they have to pay fidya or not the answer is no they don't have to once you miss a day of Ramadan for with a legitimate reason you're in you're supposed to fast it and make it up before the following Ramadan comes if if you do not succeed in doing so you're sinful if you do not have a legitimate reason to not do it and being sinful doesn't mean that you have to pay fidya but rather you have to fast and make up these days as soon as possible and that is it without any feeding without any paying fidya the fidya that is mentioned in the Quran is for those who are senile for example people who are too old too fragile too weak are unable to fast in this case they skip fasting and feed a poor person one single meal per day every day mist or someone who has a chronic illness that doctors say you will never ever be able to fast again until you die so such a person may feed a a poor person one single meal per every day missed and Allah knows best sfia uh from ukam I would like to ask you a few questions okay okay um I have U you know when sometimes I go work places and I find difficult to find the corre ker and I just pray is that problem okay and I also have my my employer offers life insurance can I accept that as well your your employer does what my employer offer offers a life insurance I'm not paying but the part of the job they offer can I can I accept that okay any more questions um uh I have another one but I forgot sorry I'll call you back if I have inshallah no problem okay aiza's third question is about which is the Dua the supplication We Begin our prayers with whether it is subh ET so she says if I don't recite this and go straight into fa is there's a problem no there's no problem your prayer is valid your reward is a little bit diminished because you've skipped a highly recommended Sunnah that the prophet used to doat but the prayer is valid because the Sunnah acts do not invalidate the prayer once left behind so the prayer is valid she says what's the ruling in her fourth question on saying say when we say say Muhammad sallahu alaihi wasallam so what's the ruling on saying that it's an issue of dispute the majority of Scholars say that it should not be said when reciting prescribed or Dua for example no one in his sound mind even those fanatic sufis who claim to love the prophet Alam they themselves would not say that we have to put s with every uh time and every time we mention the name of the Prophet Alam no one says that when I call [Music] for I don't say likewise in when we when we say we don't say we say muhamad and likewise or the as they call it sh we do not add so there's no difference of opinion in this now the difference of opinion is when I am talking and I said and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam say Muhammad did this and that and just casually talking is there anything wrong with that I feel that this is totally permissible and logical and acceptable but if someone refrains from saying it because the companions who loved him more than us never said it this would be a valid reason for him otherwise it's it's it's okay inshallah but it should not be an issue of dispute among Muslims Muhammad from Dubai says what's the ruling on seclusion in the last 10 nights of Ramadan for women in the Masjid totally permissible and accepted the companions of the prophet wasam including the mothers of the Believers used to do this at the lifetime of the Prophet alhat so this is permissible is it more rewarding or to stay home definitely to stay home is more rewarding what's the ruling on changing uh women their names or maiden names or last names to their husbands after they get married this is totally prohibited in Islam a woman has her own identity now in the west they make a fuzz about women covering her face and her face is her identity and so on we have to expose her face and if we can't expose the rest of her bodies then this is good news no in Islam we go to the basics we respect women a woman gets married she keeps her father's name her her uh family's name and her husband is nowhere in her name to change the name is a major sin that uh uh uh makes a person cursed by Allah even the mothers of the Believers the wives of the Prophet Alam who married the best man on Earth never changed their names but rather kept their names even if their names included shik by being the ab or slave of other than Allah they maintained and kept their names so this is not permissible brother muhammmad asks about uh uh keeping a cat as a pet this is permissible you're not allowed to buy it you're not allowed to sell it but as long as you are feeding it and taking good care of it this is totally permissible the Hadith of the woman being thrown into hell who had a cat because she kept it locked neither fed it nor allowed it to go and eat from the insects and from uh the trash can or whatever Alin from Gambia I think we've lost I hope he calls again so Asaf from uh Saudi Arabia says that he has a a flat back in India it's not in a predominantly Muslim area but rather in a non-muslim area and the Masjid is far away and he's is thinking of selling it um somewhere uh down the line and buying a Muslim in a Muslim area but meanwhile is it permissible for him to keep definitely it is it's Halal and you can live there and being away from the Masid is an excuse for you not to pray in the Masjid if you cannot hear the Adan or the Masjid is not within the vicinity there's nothing wrong in that a buying and selling is according to supply and demand if you have the ability to live there and you can afford that there's no problem definitely it would be best to live among the Muslims and near to a Masjid if possible but buying and selling there's no problem in that Sarah from bahin or before you take Sarah we have om Iman from Saudi Arabia Alum yeah I can my mother-in-law actually she cannot fast and she has has ulca problem and she has stomach problem and she cannot pass and uh because uh so my husband he pays the fidya before like as soon as Ramadan is uh going to start so he pays the fidya for her and she does not pass so he wants to know whether he can fast on her behalf if is it is it okay if he fast on her behalf but but my question is if he fast on her behalf who will fast on his behalf no like after he fast his Ramadan after that after like I don't know it's his question okay I I understand I will answer you second question yes yeah second question is about uh a name actually we wanted we are looking for a girl name of a girl and we found on Internet that EA is a quranic name what is it EA FIFA EA yes I can you can you spell [Applause] itam ham ham e i f okay I don't know this word but if you can recite the Ayah for me anyhow I don't know actually actually we are looking for a name of the girl and we found on Internet that this is a quranic name so I just want to verify whether it is from Quran or not okay any more questions no okay Sarah from bahin she says we heard that um only Believers enter Jenna andan which is the highest level of certainty and uh Perfection is very high so how can we reach this level this is not a Q&A that I can answer now it requires a whole lecture because we have Islam and then we have Ean and then we havean and the prophet explained that to us in theith of Jan is to worship Allah as if you can see him so it's a very very high level of Iman that is almost equivalent to certainity so you worship Allah as if you are so certain that you can't see him so if one cannot reach this level then he has to acknowledge that Allah is overlooking at what he does Allah is watching him all the time and to have this at the back of your mind whenever you do or say anything this of course elevates your Iman tremendously how to attain this so many things I I think I made last week I made a a lecture in Kuwait about how to elevate our level of Im so I I think it should be on the YouTube today or tomorrow you can find it and maybe benefit from it inshallah Muhammad from Dubai Alum again again yes thank you very much brother my question I have asked you for this change of woman name to husband name I am from Pakistan and in Pakistan to make a passport or some documents after married we have to change the name from father name to husband name to get the proper documents done regarding passport and all the ID cards that I want to know it's permissible to my knowledge to my knowledge brother Muhammad to my knowledge that this is something that you can change all the sisters who've been calling from India from America from Europe they have the ability okay they have the ability to change into the or to keep their own name even Hillary rodm Clinton kept her name uh uh intact so this is universal now women are seeking empowerment as they call unfortunately even some so-called Muslim women are falling under under this into this trap of shatan there's nothing as empowerment there is implementing Islamic Shar so we as Muslims have to be proud of our names now if at worst case scenario she was obliged to do it she's forced to do it otherwise she will be imprisoned or killed or harmed physically in this case this is a different story when it's by choice then you have to stand uh uh your grounds and say that this is against my religion keep her father's name her family's name and do not insert your name in between and Allah knows best um we have Hannah from Saudi Arabia yes yes hello CH yes yeah uh I I I I have many I will not go through details but I will tell you the main things which I have I'm trying to be a take on religion I'm reading Quran I read the Surah Al bakar three times a day or a night I'm trying to pray the five prayers at time but there is evil people who trying to always make because I marry a man from Pakistan I'm Arabic woman I'm from Yemen uh and they keeping trying I have no idea I can't explain now but they really do a lot I I used to eat from their hands I try I used to wear their clothes husband always baking me when when I I'm close these people when we have been there in his country um now I don't know just she I called you from Dubai five years back you give me you told me what to recite what to do um and I started stick on what you told me and drinking Zam Zam water and I saw something move from my head like a I swear of God I'm not lying where are you where are you Hannah Hannah where are you I'm at home where where which city which city in bahin in Bahrain do you have ability to come to uh to to Mecca um because I'm Yen citizen I will try to take a first um Visa like this anyhow I I will try to uh answer your question you can take my number from the control inshallah the director will will give you my mobile number for further uh communication later on um Sarah from bahin she says Allah is most merciful the Ence of her question is is it fair that sheh is living close to meca and Medina he gets to go there forra for praying and he gets so much uh uh of reward while we live far away we don't have a Maham to travel we're unable even if we have Maham to travel to find the chance to come except once every blue moon so on the day of judgment would we be the same first of all the this is Allah's grace and favor so if I see someone whom who was blessed by Allah to have mansions and and and and cars and wealth and can feed poor people and dig Wells and treat sick uh and the the the the elderly and I say I don't have this money so I'm not like him this is Allah's favor as mentioned in the Hadith authentic Hadith when the poor people of the M of the immigrants came to the prophet and said oh prophet of Allah the people of Medina the Anar so far they are too wealthy and they spend money in the ways in the cause of Allah while we don't have a penny but they pray like we pray we they fast like they we fast but they have this Edge over us this is Allah's grace and favor upon them secondly F you have to acknowledge the fact that Allah is wise Allah is fair Allah is just so if you have this conviction you are in good hands don't ever think that why did Allah do this why did Allah give those and he did not give me what don't ask these questions Allah is fair and just and Allah gives people according to their intention as well so even if you have a good intention to do something and you're not aable to do it Allah would reward you so don't think or burden yourself in thinking uh about this Abdullah from irq says Allah spoke in the chapter toah Al Bak when the Jews did so many heinous things and MSA their Prophet peace be upon him told them that Allah is telling you to kill yourselves so is killing themselves a form of repentance or is it literal no the the the people of tap say that this is literal in the sense that in one day 70,000 were killed Allah ordered them to kill one another so as form of repentance so there was Darkness upon them there was Shades and and clouds and they could not see and they just took their swords and started killing one another until Allah abrogated this and uplifted such a punishment upon them and accepted their repentance so this was part of the repentance of the previous Nations nowadays in the Nation of Islam in the religion of Islam we just seek Allah's forgiveness we repent we show remorse and that's it and all Grace be to Allah Ahmed from Libya is asking about masturbation Allah asael mentioned in two suras about those who preserve their private parts from being exposed or misused except by the wives and their concubines and then Allah says and whoever seeks that is the sexual pleasure other than these two then he's a transgressor and from this Ayah The Scholar said that masturbation is a form of transgression and it's a sin andam safia from UK she says I don't know the direction of so I prayed to a different direction this is unacceptable from you sfia when you are in the UK or in any country you can simply ask about the direction of sunset and sunrise the East and West in London you have Southeast you you know the places uh uh there and you can always use these gadgets to find the direction you can use use a compus you can ask any nearby Masjid so you have to repeat the prayer again uh the her employer registers uh a life insurance if it is not related to your consent and he does this out of his own good will I see no problem in that he's a cfir and he's sinful for doing this but you have no say in it so it is like a form of gift as long as it's not being deducted from your salary and you're not approving it it's just there uh as a gift I hope inshallah there's no problem in that IM she says that her grand her uh mother-in-law cannot fast so I'm assuming that this is a legitimate reason she is too old or she is chronically ill now her son pays and feeds 30 people before the month of Ramadan this is invalid and it doesn't uh uh uh it's not accepted except as a general charity the feeding must be at the end of the day of fasting so either each day after Sunset you feed one poor person or you choose to postpone this until the end of Ramadan and feed 30 person in a row but not before Han says um okay um she is facing a lot of trouble and problems there is nothing on Earth that can save you from these Whispers or from Jin or from Envy or from evil eye or from Black Magic except Allah if you have this conviction and you believe and you trust Allah and you supplicate to Allah and you offer R upon yourself upon zamzam water you drink loads and loads of it throughout the day and night and you wash yourself with it Allah will protect you and will cure you but there is nothing else you can do so you have to show your submissiveness you have to show you how poor and needy to Allah's help and Allah with his grace and favor upon us all will protect you and save you from that with this we come to the end of tonight's program until we meet next week same time I leave you bearing of Allah and is for reward is for J The Garden of paradise is for the Blessed pilgrimage is for seal of the prophethood given to the prophet muhamed bearing of Allah and is for reward is for the garden of paradise is for the Blessed pilgrimage is for the Seal of the prophethood given to the prophet muhamed Al"
