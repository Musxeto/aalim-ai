  "title": "How to pray Witr 2+1 or 3 rakat with Qunoot? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Nasir from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Sheikh I had a question regarding Salatul Witr Because I was, growing up I was taught to read Salatul Witr You read it similar to Salatul Maghrib Where when you're doing the Tashhadud And then you read the Waikunood Is there a specific way that you're meant to read Salatul Witr? Or is it meant to be, you do two Raka'ats and then Salamu Alaikum? Or, can you please explain to me? Thank you According to the Sunnah of the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam Salatul Witr, if you're going to pray it into three Raka'ats It can be prayed in two ways Either you pray two Raka'ats, like the Sunnah of Fajr Then you conclude that by salutation, Salam And then you stand up for the third Raka'at You make Allahu Akbar and start a single Raka'at And you finish it to the end So this is separating the three Raka'ats, two plus one The second way of doing it, also it's a Sunnah That the Prophet used to do Alayhis Salatu Wassalam Is to pray it into three Raka'ats You don't sit in the first, you don't sit in the second On the third Raka'at, you sit for the Tashahhud and the salutation Upon the Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam And you offer Salam afterwards Making it like Maghrib, and sitting for the second Raka'at For Tashahhud, the first Then the third Raka'at is prohibited As per the Hadith that was narrated And Allah Azzawajal knows best Dua'ul Qunoot can be offered before Ruku' And can be offered after Ruku' And I'm inclined that offering it after Ruku' When you rise up and say, As-salamu alaykum wa rahmatullah Is more authentic and Allah knows best"
