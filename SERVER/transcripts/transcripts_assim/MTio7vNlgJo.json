  "title": "Can I give my sister zakat to continue her higher education? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Joseph is asking about whether the sister who is intending to pursue her higher education legible for the cat or not so many times we stated that the cat is not something you give out of courtesy or to help a friend or because you were shy from rejecting others or to score a point with others no the cat is a form of worship allah azza wajal gave us the recipient of the zakat in eight categories and this is found in the Quran in Chapter nine to the Toba verse number 60 so Allah tells us in the very beginning that in the masada Cotterill folk allah while massaging the first two categories are those who are poor and needy so the classification the labeling must fit the person receiving the zakat so if I tell you how he give me from your zakat money you say okay sure let me first check are you poor what do you mean by poor the poor person who does not have sufficient means and funds to sustain a normal life so maybe he has food for lunch but he doesn't have food for dinner maybe he has clothes on him but he doesn't have a shelter to live in so the the bare minimum of decent life this person does not have so this one is poor he's deserving to receive from the zakat so I would say no I'm not poor so ok share are you miss Kim are you needy said find me a needy person is a person who has the bare minimum of sustaining a decent life but it is not full so I have a house to live in I have a car and I have food on the table but the problem is I need money to buy medication otherwise I'm gonna fall sick I don't have money to get my diabetes medication or my cancer the medication one of my children requires an operation and he will die if I don't have it but they don't have the funds and means so I have a car and I have a house but I don't have enough money to buy books for my children to go to school or to buy their uniforms to go to school so I'm needy this person deserves the so let's go back to your to the questions questioners a sister a sister has money she has gold and she has to pay the cat she looks at her sister now the father is retired which means that she's living with her father and she has a normal basics of living a standard of living is there she wants to pursue her education now education is something that is needed and essential so to do your masters or to do your PhD that's a good thing it benefits you it benefits the society it benefits Islam can we give zakat money to someone doing this if you go to the basic levels can I give money to someone who is devoted to studying Islam he wants to go to Islamic University but he doesn't have the fundings he wants to pursue knowledge or memorize the Quran but he doesn't have enough to sustain a decent life you can give him the cut he's a student of knowledge this person wants to go and study medicine and he is from a middle class or from a poor family they cannot afford the fundings you can give him from the cactuses permissible now the sister has to look into the conditions of her sister's studying if pursuing her higher education means that she has to travel to a foreign country without a mom or to study in the same country or elsewhere in a mixed university where it's not segregated in this case this is Haram hence giving the zakat money is Haram is not permissible for that purpose and reason otherwise this is permissible insha'Allah"
