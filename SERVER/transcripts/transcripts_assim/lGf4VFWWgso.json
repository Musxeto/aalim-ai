  "transcript": "are those who contradict the Shar of Allah and do not judge by it after it has been made clear to them disbelievers as Allah says in the Quran and whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed such are the disbelievers this is an issue of dispute among uh uh Scholars the most authentic opinion is that no they are believers as long as they believe that the the Shar of Allah is far superior and it is the authentic and it is the right thing to do but due to their weaknesses due to their ignorance due to their uh uh oppr uh uh aggression they uh decide not to follow it they have committed one of the most serious and major sins in Islam but they are still Muslim and the verse you've quoted there are three uh there are other two verses that Allah say says such are the disbelievers such are the aggressors and such are those who are sinful so Scholars say that those who believe that their laws are better than Islam these are disbelievers those who twist the laws a bit so that they would gain some money or they would favor some friends of theirs then these are the aggressors and those who um do otherwise for worldly Gam or just for uh being sinful or thinking that this is this might take them uh uh places rather than uh implementing Allah's rule they can be among the Sinners and Allah Knows Best"
