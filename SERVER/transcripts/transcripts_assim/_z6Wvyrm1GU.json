  "transcript": "from Saudi Arabia he says that he has a friend from Qatar who is a Sufi and he keeps on telling him that the Sufi way of uh religion is the best way we sit in a corner of a Masjid we make VI we make Dua we feel our hearts light with uh uh uh sins and heavy with Iman and our way of life is the best way of life the prophet wasam had secrets that he only gave to few of his friends and we share some of these secrets and he's asking what should I say the prophet told usat that there will be 73 sects of his umah they will be divided into 73 All In Hell except one and when they asked him which one your prophet of Allah he said those who are on the footsteps of my footsteps and the companions so those who are following the prophet and his companions are on the right track without any doubt now when we come to the sufis sufis are levels and grades some of them are very close to us and all what they have from Sufism is that they are not indulging this life so they don't ride a fancy car like we do they don't uh have U any connection with this Dunya when it comes to uh sort of uh living a nice and soft life which is by itself good this is their right to choose they're close to us but there are extreme sufis who go out of the fold of Islam when they pretend that they have things that are not found in the Quran and Sunnah like your friend is saying that the prophet has deceived and cheated his um when he only taught a handful secrets that the whole um do not know about and this is totally wrong and out of uh uh uh context all together so how do we address these people we address them that even the Christians have this light heart and this uh uh uh Tranquility they find though they are disbelievers this is from shaan you cannot get closer to Allah except through the Quran and the Sunnah and following the footsteps of the Prophet Alam and your practice is full of innovation ah"
