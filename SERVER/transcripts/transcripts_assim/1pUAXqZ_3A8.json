  "transcript": "Zadeed from Bangladesh. He says, 'we know that \nwhoever considers halal haram, or haram halal   and he has the conviction of that, that this \nwould nullify his Islam. So someone who believes   that drinking intoxicants - wine, alcohol, whiskey \n- he believes it's not haram. Though he doesn't   drink it but he said 'it's not logical. Why would \nit be haram? Why would doing drugs be haram?   Allah, Azza wa Jal, brought it from the ground. \nIt's Allah, Azza wa Jal, who made opium grow, or   cannabis, or whatever. So we're smoking it, we're \ndoing it, it's halal.' Even if he doesn't do it,   he gets out of the fold of islam providing \nthat the conditions have been fulfilled.   Not immediately. 'What does that mean?' This is a \nproblem and a mistake that most muslims fall in.   If you do this you become a kafir. Akhi, it's \nnot as simple as this - one plus one equals two.   There are conditions to be fulfilled \nand some people come and say 'well,   Sheikh (...) Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahāb said in \nthe 10 points that nullify or break your islam   is this..' This is not Qur'an. This is ijtihad \nfrom this great imam. But when he stated it,   you have to go into the explanation, what \nthe scholars say. Not simply because,   you don't think that a kafir is a kafir you're an \nimmediately kafir. Maybe you have misconceptions,   misinterpretation,s mistakes, ignorance. \nSo you have to be very careful before you   start shooting. And the issue of make \nthinking halal haram and haram halal   is, usually, something that nullifies \nislam if the conditions are fulfilled. So   if someone says 'I know is in the Qur'an \nit says that fornication is a major sin.   And it's mentioned in three, four ayats. The \nprophet, 'aleyhi salatu wa salam, mentioned that   it was one of the major sins. I, personally, \nbelieve that it's okay.' This is kufr   because, he acknowledges in the Qur'an, in the \nsunnah, yet he rejects it. This is kufr, khalas.   There's no need to explain anything. There's no \nneed to say 'but', because this is clear. When   you come to masturbation, is it something that \nall scholars agree upon? The answer is 'No'.   So if someone says that it's halal. Would we \nsay that he's a kafir? The answer is 'No'.   Because it's an issue of dispute and this \nperson saying it's halal, most likely,   is following some of the scholars who may say that \nit is makruh, or it is permissible when needed   and not necessarily when it's haram. So you have \nto be careful when you talk about these things."
