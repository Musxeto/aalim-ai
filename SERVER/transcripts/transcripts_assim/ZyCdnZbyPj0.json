  "transcript": "Yousef from the emra says that he has a cousin that prays only three times a day and he says that this is what was mentioned in the Quran and Yousef your cousin is a total ignorant and he's in great danger because if he insists with this ignorance of his he's not a Muslim now he is rejecting all the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam and we know that the pillars of Islam is to pray the five prayers and this was indicated in numerous numbers of uh uh prophetic tradition so the consensus of all Scholars of Islam that the prayers are five and to come and claim that only three are mentioned in the Quran shows his ignorance I betting Haram but I as a figure of speech I bet you he doesn't even know Arabic he doesn't know even how to perform uh wo properly now to say that only three prayers are mentioned in the Quran no problem can you tell me how many mentioned in the Quran for and for example or can you tell me how many prostrations in each prayer how many bowing or R what to do to what to say he can't where do we get this from from the Sunnah so you have a big problem this cousin of yours is delusional he's ignorant and he's innovating in Islam he's following the RA in what he says who combine the prayers and pray only three times a day and I I don't even have to uh comment on that so your cousin is in great danger because he faces an act of apost y his belief would be an act of apostasy you should try your level best to bring him back to his senses because falsifying or saying that I do not accept the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam takes him out of the loop of Islam Jank once again"
