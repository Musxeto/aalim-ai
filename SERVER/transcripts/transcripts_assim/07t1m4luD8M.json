  "transcript": "Salman from India Allah guide you and protect you from shaitan and you as well I know someone who had the intention of praying the repentance prayer for his sin but due to some reason he didn't pay it but he prayed other prayers and sought Allah's forgiveness by making General Dua for his sin so can he pray the repentance prayer with new intention now first of all the turakas of repentance are not a condition for your repentance and for Allah's forgiveness meaning if I don't pray these two rakas but I fulfill the conditions of repentance such as being sincere showing deep remorse quitting the sin pledging not to do it again asking Allah for forgiveness these are the conditions that are needed for my repentance to be valid and accepted now it's an added value if I pray two requires of repentance and then ask Allah for forgiveness but if I don't there's no problem in that so to answer your question yes there's no problem in doing it now and asking Allah for forgiveness afterwards and Allah Knows Best thank you"
