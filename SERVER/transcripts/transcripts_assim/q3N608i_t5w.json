  "transcript": "joseph from saudi arabia yes sir i have one question and it is regarding the difference in rewards for example i am praying in the masjid and her prayer in compression that if i'm praying for example in the gym with 25 people just the same jama what will the difference in the prayer rewards for example so your question is the difference between praying in the masjid and praying in the gym or in the office yeah praying with inner congregation in jama in our office yeah okay i will answer inshallah asa from saudi he says what's the difference between praying and congregation in the masjid and praying in my office or in my gym or in the market there's a huge difference among the difference says is that every step you make to the masjid allah would elevate you one level in jannah erase one bad deed grant you one good deed among the benefits is that it is higher in reward when you pray in the masjid then when you pray elsewhere and this is clear in the hadith of the prophet hassan that the prayer and the message is better than a man's prayer in his market where he sells and works etc so there's nothing that competes with praying in the masjid at all"
