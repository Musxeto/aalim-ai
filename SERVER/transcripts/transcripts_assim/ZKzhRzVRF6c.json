  "transcript": "I'm from Saudi says that there is a drink a healthy drink called I don't know if I wrote it right it's called kafir so I hope it has nothing to do with any disbelievers or kafir says I might have heard it wrong and she says that it's made of yogurt and milk and they put few things and to be fermented for 24 hours there is an amount of alcohol in it which is between 0.1 to 0.3 percent this is negligible even if you take like a dozen of these drinks or of these food items you will not be wasted or intoxicated and the rule is was given to us by the prophet alayhi salatu salam it is not the percentage of alcohol or the presence of alcohol it is the result of consuming a lot of quantity of it if it intoxicates a person then a drop of it becomes Haram let's take brandy brandy if you take 3-4 glasses you get drunk so even one single drop in chocolate would make it harm but for example inside there why did I ask do we have any salary because it goes through the standards organisation which governs and checks all food items that come in Saudi Arabia and to my knowledge they are very efficient in what they do may allah azza wajal any guide them and give them a power to keep up the good work they would have blocked it now there is beer that we buy on the markets and it has 0.5 0.6 grams a percent of alcohol but even this kind of beer if you drink it if you take 3 or 4 bottles or even a half a pack it would not affect your sanity it would not intoxicate you in hence this is halal it was the Prophet who said him self release awesome whatever intoxicates a lot of it the very few or the very little of it is Haram"
