  "transcript": "[Music] we know that while performing hot on the tenth abdulhazar we have to throw pebbles at zamartal akaba sacrifice an animal shave head and then go back to makkah and do tafansari now if i shave my head first then when the crowd is small i throw pebbles at that time and about the sacrifice of animal i do not know when it will be slaughtered because i have entrusted this with a reliable organization but they have not provided me with a specific time of slaughter my question is if i do not maintain the order on 10th abdulhaza will my house be valid okay i will answer inshallah masrood says from germany now in the tenth of the hija for pilgrims we know that pilgrims have to offer as the jurors say two out of three in order to be able to wear their normal clothes and these two out of three are not related to the slaughtering so if you throw gemaratel seven stones on the day of eight and this is the only jammer you throw and you manage to shave your head then you cannot wear your normal clothes and also the third one is to perform pawaf and the if you did not perform it on the eighth day of the hijab if you manage to do two of three you can wear your clothes and the order is recommended but it's not mandatory why because the prophet was asked on that day o prophet of allah i went and performed tawaf before throwing the pebbles of jamar to aqaba he used to say if do and there is no sin on that no burden on you and another guy says i shaved before i uh performed the throwing i did this before i did that and everything the prophet was asked he used to say if means that the order is not mandated you"
