  "title": "Taking turns 2 recite Quran in group 2 finish quickly permissible? What about khatam Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "yes my question is many ladies from the subcontinent we gather in houses during ramadan and uh with the niyyah of doing the khatum or dora quran we just take chance and recite quran so that we complete it very quickly within five days or ten days or something so is it permissible is it from the sunnah okay so let me understand this correctly sitting in a house where one of us recites the quran loudly and the others listen to it in order to gain reward in order to understand the quran maybe someone would comment on an ayah and it gives an explanation this is something that is highly recommended in islam and is highly recommended to be done in the masjid as the companions used to do there's nothing wrong in that doing this silently like in some places they distribute one jesus for 30 women and each woman recites on our own one jesus so in 20 minutes they've accomplished the full quran and they consider themselves as have accomplished the full quran this is an innovation and this does not count as reciting the whole quran but if one as the companions used to do recite one part or a part of the quran and then hands it over to the following person and they recite and it goes on like this this is permissible in sha allah this is different from what is known as which people do in funerals for example when they gather for mourning and they're deceased and they distribute quran to recite and give the thawab the reward to their disease this is a clear innovation allah knows best muhammad"
