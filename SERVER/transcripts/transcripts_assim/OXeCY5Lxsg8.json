  "title": "Can I prohibit my staff from smoking or listening to music while on the job #islam assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh my question today is regarding the fact that I have two people working under me who are keepers at the same time workers in my agricultural field but the problem is one day I went there and I saw cigarettes inside the field so I completely forbid them to have cigarettes whoever wants to smoke he will have to smoke outside of the field but when it comes to music I'm wondering if I have the duty or the responsibility to tell them not to listen to it they stay there all day and all night so I mean I don't know if I have the power to tell someone not to listen to music all day and all night even though I'm not his father basically but since they are not work they working in my field I don't want to have any kind of sin because of it so this is my question do they grow their beards one is a Muslim the other one is not a Muslim so do you ask the non-muslim to convert to Islam I'm planning to do da to him but we didn't reach that point yet okay the Muslim do you ask him to grow his beard no so why is that again you're not his father you don't have authority over workers that work under you unless they're abusing the facilities to their sin what they do on their own whether they smoke or listen to music as long as they're not using your plot and facility for their sin this is between them and Allah you just simply ask them please try not to listen to music or smoke and if you want to smoke you go out of the plot and and smoke there which is is not logical because they're going to stay all day long there and not work so you just advise them give them da and and move on and Allah Knows Best"
