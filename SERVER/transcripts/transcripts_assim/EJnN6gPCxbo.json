  "transcript": "Uh I'm a revert to Islam from India. Uh my parents are non-Muslim and I'm studying a charter accounting course right now. I'm planning my career as a tax advisor where I assist companies in legally planning and reducing their taxes where I won't be collecting any taxes at my job. Also I'm planning to do the same at UAE with corporate and international taxations. Uh is this allowed? Are there any any other career which I can choose as a CEO? Collecting taxes is prohibited in Islam because it's my lawful money that you're taking a chunk of. Who gives you the right to do so? No one. So this is not permissible. If your job is to help people file their taxes or file for their tax returns or to help them reduce their taxes on a private level, not as an employee for the tax department or the IRS, then in this case there's no problem in that and allahel knows best."
