  "transcript": "Omar from Australia. Sheikh I just want to know tonight, if both your parents are pleased with you, you know, if they're both pleased with you, is this a sign that Allah loves you and He's pleased with you? And is it also a sign that, you know, you'll be protected from the punishment in the grave and in the akhirah? So let me, let me understand your question. Are you telling me if my parents are pleased with me, is this a sign that Allah is also pleased with me and that I'll be protected in the grave from the torment of it? No. Yes? Yes. Okay. The answer is that no, this is not true. If your parents are satisfied with you, yes, this is a great sign that Allah is pleased with you. The hadith of the Prophet alayhis salatu wassalam is, Rid Allah fi rid []. The pleasure of Allah is in pleasing your parents. However, this has to be looked at and understood within the sharia law. If your parents tell you to divorce your wife, and this unfortunately is coming to me in counselling sessions like crazy. I get people coming to me and say, my mother doesn't like my wife. I love my wife. I love my children. And she and my father are insisting that I divorce her. I say to him, does she work in a strip club? He says, oh sheikh, she's a niqabi. Is she rude with your mom and dad? She never meets them, rarely meets them. So I said, don't divorce her. And he says, my mom is compelling me to do this or she will commit suicide. She will jump from the balcony. She would curse me till the day she dies. Your mother is a transgressor. Your mother is a wrongdoer. Don't ever obey her. And no matter what she does, don't even pay any attention to that, with all due respect. You have to be dutiful to your mom. You have to be respectful. But if your mom is of such a calibre, don't even look at what she's doing. Because she is disobeying Allah and not only that, wanting you to disobey Allah azza wa jal. If you want to go to hell with your mom, be my guest. But if you want to go to Jannah, don't divorce your wife. So not everything that your parents order you to do is part of pleasing Allah. On the contrary, there is no obedience to a creature in disobeying the Creator subhanahu wa ta'ala. So be careful. So your statement is not entirely true. Yes, if you please your parents and you are a person upon the sunnah, with the correct aqeedah, and they tell you to do good things and you comply, and you try to seek their pleasure in making them happy and laughing all the time, this is a sign that Allah is pleased with you. This has nothing to do with the torment of the grave, unfortunately, and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
