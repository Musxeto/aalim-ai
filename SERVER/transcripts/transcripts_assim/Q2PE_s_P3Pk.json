  "transcript": "Najwa from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. Because I live in a kafir country, do I have to read and read the ingredients? I don't understand your question. I do not understand your question. Because I live in a kafir country, do I have to read the ingredients of make-up products? Or can I just simply buy it without checking the ingredients? Originally, everything is halal until proven otherwise. And it causes a great deal of hardship if I would look into the origin of this mug, if I would look into the ingredients of normal soap or detergents or fabric that I'm wearing, because I have no reason to doubt it. And therefore, it's different from consuming things, eating things, where I have to be careful whether it's halal or haram, whether it has pork or not and the likes. But when it comes to normal things such as cosmetics and make-up and the likes, the norm is that it is halal and pure until proven otherwise. If I have no reason to doubt it, I don't have to look into the ingredients and Allah knows best."
