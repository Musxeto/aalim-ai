  "transcript": "again They're laughing this is a serious topic so let's be uh uh serious inshallah Justice or is one of Allah's attributes the prophet saidat who would be just and fair if I the prophet of Allah and Allah are not so this is one of Allah's attributes and Justice is something that is well known to everyone Muslims and cfir alike it is the inclination to truth it is the middle path between two extremes it is the opposite of Injustice and transgression no one argues about the definition of justice but when we listen to some of the western politicians the Hypocrites when they come to defend tyranny and occup ation of Muslim lands and the killing of civilians and they say that they have all the rights to defend themselves the war is wrong and the war has to stop and they ship weapons and we have to stop this war and this genocide and they keep on sending them weapons what is this is this Justice they themselves acknowledge no it's not so this Justice is one of Allah's attributes and when Allah is described to be just he's telling us to be just as well this these heavens and earth were not established except on Justice and Truth Allah says subhah wa ta'ala we did not create the heavens and the Earth and what is between them except in truth and Allah's words are full of justice and truth and Allah says and the word of your lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice so Allah's words are truthful and Allah's actions and rulings are fair and just everything that Allah tells us is truth without any doubt and everything that Allah does is just and fair without any transgression or and Allah's rulings are truth Allah says and Allah judges with truth his his Shar which is rarely implemented in the world which is very sad sh is the law of Allah tell me who practices sh we live in a CAF country yeah you're not practicing Shar in your own home unfortunately I'm not talking about the courts I'm talking about your own home you are a Muslim can you stand up proudly and say she let anyone of the scholars come to my home and audit it every saying sh can you give us a couple of days and and visit us and we have some cleaning to do no our own homes are busted they're not according to Shar and this is a problem Shar is based on Justice and on truth in in for of worship in transactions and this is what says is established and founded upon wisdoms upon the benefits of the creation in this life and the Hereafter it's full of Justice it's full of Mercy it's full of benefits and it's full of wisdom anything in Shar that you find it coming from Justice to transgression it's not from Shar from Mercy out of Mercy into uh uh uh or um punishment it's not part of sh it has no logic or wisdom it's not from sh because this sh points you to Allah and tells you who Allah is and also tells you that the prophet is telling you the truth these are fundamentals that you should not ever doubt in your life Islam Shar is suitable and perfect for every time every generation and every location on Earth you have little doubt you're not a Muslim you doubt that Islam is suitable with its Shar today you are not a Muslim you have to have have unconditional devotion towards that sh of Allah the rulings of someone comes to say chopping the people's hands is barbaric what do we say to him you're not a Muslim this is the law of Allah it's mentioned in the Quran either the Quran is not suitable for all generations and uh uh countries or you're not a Muslim simple as that so this Shar this Islam is a way of life that Allah has placed for the benefit of the human race and it has everything that is good for this dun and for the Hereafter this Shar is the ruling of Allah Allah says in the Quran legislation is not but for Allah legislation the sh the rulings is not but for Allah he has commanded that you worship not except him that is the correct religion nowadays I do counseling you know and I charge people for that so they come to me from Canada they come to me from America they come to me from Europe and they have a dispute between the man and his wife the wife is a hiji wears gloves Mah not to box but you know and Subhan Allah they come to me they have a dispute they are divorcing one another and the man says she it's okay divorce happens but the problem is my wife is suing my backside in cafer courts for half of what I possess for the house for my wealth and to spend for uh to on her for the the rest of my life is this Halal of course not this is against Allah's law can you talk to her sh I speak to this to the sister mashallah she comes in Zoom like the ninja Fighters mallah I'm not criticizing the hijab or the I am one of the biggest promoters of nikab and I believe that it is mandatory but I'm criticizing this Dr Jackal Mr Hyde attitude you're wearing nah and gloves and and you are willing to sacrifice your Islam for a few dollars what are you C with this is Haram what this is not at all permissible she say I spent 10 years with him and now I have to get compensation from Allah or from the devil she said I don't care I want money and this this shows you what Islam we have in our heart and Allah has ordered us to do the best form of justice and that ised because the worst form of Injustice is shik and this is mentioned in the Quran Allah says and mention oh Muhammad when lman said to his son while he was instructing him oh my son do not associate anything with Allah indeed associating or association with him is great Injustice now many people among us accus of Allah accuse Allah of Injustice true nobody's saying a thing ah no shotguns here don't worry this is true unfortunately due to their ignorance they accuse Allah of Injustice and many things the most thing that's prominent where people accuse of Allah Injustice is in risk and provision and most people don't know that the job description of Satan is to divert from the straight path to recruit you to be with him in Hellfire on the day of judgment how does he do this through two ways number one following your desires and lust partying boozing um doing drugs taking your hijab off not for you guys and uh for the guys being IM modest in how they behave so they only focus on following their desires until they lose their identity and they don't practice anything of Islam only thing that remains of their Islam is their name what's your name my name is Mo Mo as in moon no no it's Muhammad said why why why do you call yourself Mo it doesn't make any sense this is the only thing that remains of their religion now the other side of the spectrum are those who don't deal with desires and lust Mah they're out of nightclubs they don't go to bars they don't do anything Haram but their minds are infested by dubious things doubtful things they have so many doubts in a in religion in their belief of Allah but they look like Muslims so also they come to me in counseling sessions and I counsel them and I with the grace of Allah speak to them and I know exactly how they feel and I know how to tackle these things but the biggest problem is when it's deeply rooted in their heart so they think that Allah has done Injustice to them they dare not speak it they they not open their mouth but deep down I deserve better than this my neighbor has a new car why I remember one Uncle of mine a dear Uncle may Allah have mercy on his soul fell sick for a long time and I was visiting him one day so I said to him Uncle may Allah make this he said my son I'm not angry the only thing that bothers me is that I've been praying for the past 50 years in this Masjid never lost a Salah and look how I am and my neighbor never prayed in that Masjid for for 50 years and he's as strong as a bull he didn't say anything else but what did he mean there is Injustice how come I've been praying for 50 years and this is what Allah is rewarding me with and that person who doesn't pray at all is as strong as a and this is what most people are falling into what is your size compared to North America nothing what is your size compared to Earth what is your size compared to the solar system what is your size compared to the uh uh Milky Way galaxy which has hundreds of millions of solar systems and what is your size compared to the hundreds of millions of galaxies in the world nothing all these galaxies in this universe compared to the Coury of Allah is like a ring tossed in the desert and the Coury compared to the throne of Allah is like a ring tossed in the desert and at the end of the day you have the audacity to come and say um I object this ruling of Allah is not fair Allah shouldn't have done this Allah should have done this and that you are nothing Allah is the one who's allowing you to inhale and exhale without his permission it will stop your heart beats with his permission without his permission it will stop a small blood clot in your brain you have a stroke and you're paralyzed and then you're dead Allah is the one who's giving you this energy to go here and there and then you have the audacity to come and accuse Allah of being in unfair Allah says in the Quran indeed Allah does not do Injustice even as much as an ant's weight how how heavy is an ant nothing and the prophet said Allah says in a oh my slaves I've forbidden Injustice to myself and I have made it forbidden among you so do not be unjust towards one another and Allah will gather the whole of his creation on the day of judgment Allah says and we place the scales of justice for the day of Resurrection so no soul will be treated unjustly at all and yet you still insist that Allah is not responding to my Dua I ask Allah to pay off my debts I ask Allah to pay off my mortgages I ask Allah to pay my alimony and my allowances to my divorce and so on but he's not doing this and you're complaining and you are objecting now is there any Injustice in all of this yes or no everybody well I refrain I I abstain be brave you have to have kitos say it there is no Injustice why because you have to Define what Justice is Injustice is when Allah takes from you what belongs to you do you possess or own anything that's yours it's all for Himel to him we all belong to him and to him we shall return like Injustice is when Allah punishes you when you did not do any sin or crime Injustice is when Allah comes to your good deeds and he raises it without any justification or takes it from you and gives it to someone else or when Allah rewards you for your good deeds by throwing you in Hell Fire this is not what Allah is about no one and I say it clearly and loudly no one can question Allah Allah says in the Quran he's not questioned about what he does but they will be questioned so no one has the right to ask why Allah did you do this and why did you do that okay then explain to me why people differ in Risk why some are rich and some are poor why are some are given uh without any account and some are given very tightly you have to believe in Allah's beautiful names and attributes and this is a huge deficiency among the Muslims the best of Muslims how many names does Allah have 99 Names this is what the Hadith says Allah has more than 99 names but these are the 90 names that the prophet told us about sallallahu alaihi wasallam you ask the best of Muslims how many names do you memorize he said 20 Max 30 30 is good I'm I'm happy with that how many of the 30s do you know know the meaning of maybe three or two isn't it a shame that you know everything and you don't know Allah's beautiful names one of the shortest suras we read every single day gazillion times what is the one of beautiful Allah's beautiful names let me check it out she let me Google it she Google hey Shi don't don't don't speak please shut up okay I tried to change CI into a mail but didn't work anyhow uh so coming back we don't know Allah's beautiful names so this is a deficiency in US Allah is generous Allah is wise knowledgeable and he is he does not have Injustice or he is not unfair to anyone if he gives you this is his grace if he prevents you this is his justice so you're always between Allah's Justice and Allah's Grace how is that I'll explain Allah revealed the books sent the messengers told us this route takes you to Jenna and this one takes you to Hell Fire so if you do righteous Deeds you go to Jenna if you do sins and evil acts you go to hell this is Justice agree now if Allah comes and expands your heart and assists you and guides you and sends you people to talk to you and give you dawa and you're inclined to follow them and take the route of Jenna this is Allah's Grace you don't have the right but why didn't Allah Send Me Someone why would he he's treating you with his Justice now you know the route you should dig and work for it so no no no I'm waiting for someone to take my hand you're not a child you know what leads you to Jenna so this is Allah's blessing Allah says subhah wa ta'ala he the almighty selects for his Mercy Mery whom he wills and Allah is the processor of great Bounty is the possessor of great Bounty so this bounty of his he gives it to whomever he wishes this is Allah's Grace but he did not do any Injustice to you guys he showed you the way you chose you cannot say that well I had no Freedom of Choice Allah pre-ordained that I go to hell so I went to hell how do you know that you the one who did the actions you're the one who chose yeah I did not have any free will Allah wrote that upon me okay Allah wrote upon you to go to the highest building in Toronto and throw yourself from the roof let's see you do that said no I'm not going to do that how do you know why Allah pre-ordained that upon you yeah but my choice I'm not going to do it even if it's pre-ordained so you have a choice my friend the choice is all yours and besides when Allah gives Alan musk edit this H so that they won't sue us you guys are crazy everything you sue any I'm leaving a couple of days so they won't catch me really catch P um so when Allah gives a cafir billions and billions without account does this mean that Allah loves him no and when Allah deprives our brothers in Somalia in Bangladesh in Yemen from a an honorable life does this mean Allah is humilating them no look how the prophet lived was he Rich no look at Prophet a 18 years being afflicted by an illness that he lost his family his children his wealth even his own Clan his own family threw him at a dumpster because they were disgusted of him the only one remaining is his lawful wife and they did not have a preown they was a real marriage they loved one another they were loyal to one another and she stayed by his side 18 years and he's a prophet so when Allah gives you it doesn't mean that Allah loves you be careful if you have a big house with this swim swimming pool who would have a swimming pool in this weather maybe it's heated you never know tennis courts you have a Tesla one two three the whole nine yards and you think W Allah favored me I'm better than the IM of the Masjid the poor thing doesn't have except an accent handai and he Allah gave me so much no no no Allah is testing you there's no one on earth who's not being who's not being tested each and everyone is being tested and this is why Allah says in the Quran and as for man when his Lord tries him and thus is generous to him and favors him he says my Lord has honored me but when he tries him and restricts his provision he says my Lord has humiliated me no it's not the case when Allah makes it tight and the provision comes little it's not that Allah hum related you rather Allah is testing you and this D is a d of testing but if you have the content in your heart that Allah is fair Allah is just Allah would never transgress against you you will be the happiest man on or woman on earth the moment you have this doubt why is this why is that you will be the most miserable person not even Prozac would help you with depression you will be depressed all day long you'll be like a puppet walking you are not content you are not a slave of Allah you need to know who Allah is you need to learn his beautiful names and beautiful attributes on my YouTube channel it's for free I'm not charging you and it's not monetized by the way alhamdulillah Allah has sufficed me H what is your YouTube channel I don't know just write my name I I don't have anything to do with this I have nothing to do with my my social media I have volunteers who taken care of I think one word I think but there is a playlist called the beautiful names of Allah I describe in them the beautiful names of Allah in English and Arabic and where they're found and the implication in our lives W it will cement your IM I benefited it more than anyone else because when I research church I learn and I was I was telling to one of the brothers no one has the audacity to come and advise me who would advise he damn intimidating I'm not going to go and say things so Allah blessed me that when I give you a lecture or a reminder I'm reminding myself this playlist of the beautiful names W it will cement your IM when you say allahar and to start to pray you'll feel the tears coming from your eyes because I never knew that this was Allah now I know who I'm worshiping if I were to tell you who is [Music] Allah that's it you can't describe him because you don't know him so this is what you should do to avoid failing the test and finally I conclude with this beautiful Hadith which was reported in IM Muslim which means it's the highest degree of authenticity the prophet says the most affluent the most affluent of the people in this world of those who will go to hell destined to Hell who's the richest man the most powerful man in this life who's disted to go to Hellas it's over so Allah will bring him on the day of judgment and he will be dipped once only in fire in Hell once and he will be taken out then it will be said oh son of Adam did you ever see anything good did you ever have any pleasure now this was the most affluent the most rich the most powerful lived 60 70 80 years enjoyed every single second of his life one dip in Hellfire then he says no by Allah all Lord than the most destitute of the people in the world of those who will enter Jenna he's destined to enter Jen but in this world he was the most miserable person he was paralyzed his wife cheated on him his son was selling drugs his daughter was dating a cafair and got pregnant and then I don't want to go into Bollywood movies but yeah you get the point the guy was so miserable with debts with everything against him no one is more measurable than him on Earth he will be brought up on the day of judgment and then he will be dipped Once In Paradise once then the same question will be paus to him will POs to him whatever oh son of Adam did you ever see anything bad did you ever experience any hardship he will say no by Allah oh Lord I never saw anything bad and I never experienced any hardship this is exactly what it comes and sums up to your life on Earth is limited by days hours minutes and seconds your death has been already pre uh uh uh destined it's written it cannot be a second earlier or a second late what have you done rather what what will you do to prepare yourself for that time if you think that Allah has been unfair and unjust to you Rectify this on the spot feel content believe that he loves you w he loves you and if he did not love you he he would not bring you here to listen to my words this not because of my words huh but look at the other Muslims where are they they're out there having a good time watching Netflix I don't know playing around indulging in Haram or at least not doing anything beneficial but Allah chose you brought you this night and you're benefiting it's a reminder but it's a very heavy price I'm not talking about donations I'm talking about the price that you'll pay pay if you don't make it Allah brought you here the price you have to pay is that you commit is that you love Allah is that you are content with whatever happens to you because it's from Allah and Allah loves you if you do this you will be happy in if you don't Another One Bites the [Music] Dust where are the organizers coffee break hello organizers hello hello shall I sit down I'm here to organize no you can sit down that's fine can we have a round of applause for [Applause] sh so now we get to um engage"
