  "title": "Is not wearing the hijab a Major sin? Punishment for women who display themselves - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Safiya says is not wearing the Islamic hijab a major sin what is the punishment for women who display their makeup and clothes in public there is an Arabic word for this which is WG and this word was mentioned in chapter 33 where a large L prohibited exposing your hour as a woman like they used to do in pre-islamic era well at about Regina Taba brutal jahiliyyah and this by itself is sinful whether it is a major sin or a minor sin is not of great importance to us because when a Muslim looks at the size of the sin he neglects whom he is sinning against but if you look at Allah Almighty his greatness his excellence and that you are sinning against him who's all watching all hearing who provides for you who controls every breath you take you cannot inhale without his permission and you cannot exhale without his permission yet you insist on sinning that you are in great trouble whether it is a major sin or a minor sin is beside the point a major sin as defined by scholars is every sin that allah azza wajal has placed a prescribed punishment in this dunya such as slandering consuming intoxicants fornication adultery stealing etc so either there is a prescribed punishment in this dunya or allah azza wajal has placed a curse on those who do such things such as dealing in usually riba interest-based loans bribery all of these whoever do whoever does such things is cursed by allah azzawajal women who pluck their eyebrows people who apply tattoos to others or to themselves women who wear hair extensions etc or any sin that allah azzawajal told us that whoever does this will be admitted to hellfire and there are so many of them therefore if you look at not abiding by the hijab a woman who shows her hair or wears revealing clothes or wear makeup and does not care whether none muharram men look at her or not is this a major sin or not the Prophet told us alehissalaam and the hadith isn't the sahih that there are two types of people he did not see yet they are among the people of hell and he mentioned one of them to be women who are dressed yet nude meaning that either they wearing transparent clothes you can see through it so that she is actually nude or she is wearing tight clothes that reveals her hour of her body curves her bone structure as if she's not wearing anything and the Prophet said al Assad said that they wear their hair on top of their heads like a camel's hump when they walk they walk in a way that is a bit tilted and would make others tilted as well when they look at them because of their beauty and their charm so the Prophet told us that they are from the people of help in another hadith he said curse them because they are cursed by Allah Azza WA JAL which is an indication that this is indeed a major sin therefore whoever does such an act of exposing her hour or her beauty in a fashion that would turn heads towards her she's either committing a Kabira a major sin or a minor sin and this depends on the level of hurt a barrage a woman who covers her body totally only exposes her face yet wears makeup eyeliners shadow foundation on her skin she is doing tabarak but her sin is not as severe as a woman who exposes her hair or wears revealing clothes or tight clothes etc and as I said earlier one should fear allah azza wajal by not indulging in sins and asking whether it's a major or a minor one rather to look at a loss of hana wa taala who he is sinning against you"
