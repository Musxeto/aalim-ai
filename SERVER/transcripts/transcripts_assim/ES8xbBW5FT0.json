  "transcript": "we follow thousand times but because of the position of the sun like in time we are breaking our hearts which is 6 39 p.m we still see this one some of our friends follow the normal applications like there are some applications in there in the movement so they break their path so mustafa are you asking about breaking the fast earlier or later yes or no yes in alaska specifically in alaska so the people in alaska have different timings than us because sometimes they have like six months the uh the sun is visible and they don't have a sunset so it's all daytime and sometimes they have six months less or more all night time they don't see the sun if this is what you're asking about mustafa then the scholars say that you have to resort to the closest city to your country or to where you're living that has a distinction between day and night so let's assume you're in uh alaska and the closest city to you is um i don't know what can be uh the closest city to alaska somewhere up north um new york or or washington or whatever who cares that particular city is the closest to you that they have day and night so you should break your fast according to their sunset and you should refrain from eating and drinking according to their break of dawn where did they we get this from we got it from the hadith of the prophet haslam about the dajjal when the antichrist comes the dajjal and he spends one day that is equivalent to a whole year meaning the sun takes a whole year to set so the companions asked how should we pray o prophet of allah so the prophet said alaihis you should give it its due estimate so you should estimate in these 360 days each day five times a day to pray so for you in uh alaska to figure out when is the break of dawn and when is the sunset you look to the nearest city that has the distinction between day and night that has a break of dawn and sunset and follow their timings and allah azza knows best"
