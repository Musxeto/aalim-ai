  "title": "Is wearing perfume and using the Miswak mandatory on Friday? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "fume and there is a hadith again this hadith is one of the evidences for the scholars who said that a soul is mandatory because the hadith and I think it's inside Halima Muslim goes like this was lumati wajib Anuradha cool him or tell him what Tebow was c-walk so those who say it's mandatory they take the first portion which says wastrel Jawara the hustle of a Friday is mandatory upon everyone who had reached the age of puberty and they stop here while if you continue the hadith goes to say and perfume and see walk so now we have a dilemma because no one says that wearing perfume and using the sea whack the miswak using this no one says that during Juma it is mandatory wearing perfume and using the miswak is highly recommended so why do you say that also is mandatory so what does Rajab here means scholars differ it and they say that Rajab means that it is fallen like Raja ba I don't want to go into details because this would take much of our time and maybe it's not that important at this moment for an early stage of maybe if we go to the advanced level inshallah then we would go into details anyhow so to wear perfume and to to take care of one's cleanliness definitely is a recommended thing now the textbook says that"
