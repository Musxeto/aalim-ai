  "transcript": "sh I have fallen in the addiction of doing bat and I get too arrogant when trying to do Sal things and avoiding bat how can I not do bat because I became too arrogant and blind following person this is solved by fixing yourself becoming arrogant because you're following the Sunnah is a little bit cuckoo because this is the norm this is what we all follow so imagine someone's following the Sunnah and instead of pleasing Allah following the prophet Alam he falls in a major sin of arrogance so in order to escape this he abandons Sunnah and he falls into B and he falls into a greater Graver sin of innovation it doesn't make any any sense you have to refine your Islam by being humble to humilate yourself to the Quran and to the Sunnah to acknowledge your own sins those who think that they're above others just because they are following Sunnah and they are following salaah and they look at others as ants or roaches that they can step on with their feet they will go to hell and this is mentioned in the Hadith no one with an ants weight of arrogance in his heart would be admitted to Jenna and those who are arrogant in this dun will be resurrected on the day of judgment in the form of men but in the size of ants where people step on them with their feet so come back to your senses refine your Iman and your heart by humbling yourself to others whenever you see someone in yourself don't tell it to them say to yourself they might be better than me I have more sins than them and this would make you inshallah more and more humble and Allah Knows Best"
