  "transcript": "chodri from bangladesh i have a lengthy question my question is i started studying in a mixed university now i i want to be a die and i made up my mind to study in an online islamic university which will start on april next year a new semester will start in the mixed university that will end when the classes in the islamic university start but i don't know how to tell my parents as the university i study in is the top most in our country and they themselves are so proud and keep telling this to people so i was thinking of two options one is to quit the mixed university right now and tell them what i want to be like i want to be a guy right now so i fear they won't allow me to become one to quit the mixed university and i have another option that is to start a new semester in the mixed university and like within this time i will keep telling them about the rewards that scholars get and teach them about akida and the importance of akira over dunya because i think it will be easier for me to convince them this way but if i do another semester in the mixed university i will have to attend offline classes for two months more and i want to tell you this that the males and the females sit in separate columns i wear my hijab and nikab and i stay away from the males completely and they also stay away from me thinking that i am islamic so sheikh what do you want to say which path should they follow which is better for me how many semesters left for you in this uh university uh sikh uh i still have two years and one more semester but i'm not thinking of completing the university totally okay and i just want to finish one more semester because within that time my classes in the online university will start that's why i will answer she wants to become a guy and she wants to quit her um regular university this is up to you now if you are in a segregated class you're wearing your kneecap you're far away from men and men are far away from you there is no mixing nobody's chit-chatting with you it's okay to continue and as long as these conditions remain but if you feel that you're not be going to be productive and you can convince your parents of changing your major this is inshallah permissible what to do to quit or to continue one semester you have to weigh the pros and cons according to how your parents think you"
