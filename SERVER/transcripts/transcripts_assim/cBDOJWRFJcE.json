  "transcript": "Abrar from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, I have enrolled in academic coaching where I pay in the running months on a monthly basis. So, like, I will do coaching of April month, so I have to pay in April first. In that circumstance, if I decide not to do classes during a particular month fully by not paying in the running months, am I wronging the teacher and in-depth since I didn't inform him about this? No, as long as you're paying for that teacher on a monthly basis, whether you don't show up at all, as long as you're paying him three thousand taka or whatever amount for a month, if you skipped one day or two days or five days or the whole period, as long as you're paying him, there is no wronging of that teacher. The wronging of the teacher is when you don't pay him, though you've agreed to give him a lump sum at the end of the month for the whole month. You don't come. This is your fault. You should still pay him because he is wasting his time waiting for you. He could have taken some other students at that time."
