  "transcript": "oh ah and welcome to lessons in we're still studying the chapter that deals with evan and the hadith we have before us is hadith number 151 i believe that brother mustafa will read it for us narrated by abnormal and allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam calls for prayer when it is still night so eat and drink till even calls for prayer and he even was a blind man who did not call for prayer until he was told it is morning time it is morning time no what prayer is this of course dawn prayer or fajr prayer or prayer now from this hadith we learn that as you remember there are two types of fajr the actual fajr and the falls fajr so the false fajr it's okay for a person who wants to fast to eat and drink and he may not pray fajr prayer yet because it is false and we said that if you recall that it's the light that is vertical from the the earth to the sky and it comes like a while before the actual break of dawn which is horizontal in this hadith it tells us that it is sunnah to have to evan for fajr it is sunnah to have two events for fajr one is a reminder to those who are praying night prayer that listen fajr is close so if you want to pray witcher go ahead and finish because it's going to call in a while and to those who want to fast it wakes them up so that they would have their sahur their late night a meal before they fast and stop and refrain from eating and drinking and scholars have their different opinions whether this should be only for ramadan as the case in the muslim world or it's a general thing that people should do they should have every single day of the year two calls for prayer due uh for fajr prayer so it's an issue of dispute uh the holy the two holy mosques of makkah and medina do it throughout the year the whole year they have always to avan and apparently that this is the most authentic thing that it should be applied in our lives also in all mosques but unfortunately that this is not the case simply because people are drifting away from islam and they have working hours and they have to uh sleep at night and it's very rare that you find people praying to hajju or praying night prayer except in ramadan if you if you make a survey you'd find that 90 or 96 percent of muslims don't know how to pray night prayers or don't even pray night prayers they go to bed and sleep and only a small person portion of muslims you know wake up in the middle of the night and pray to allah the almighty to forgive their sins now in this hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi lam had was blind so he could not recognize if it is the break of dawn or not unless someone tells him so this teaches us that it is okay to have advent a person that calls for the adan who is blind providing that he has someone telling him that it is day or night because if he doesn't have anyone to tell him he would probably go at 10 o'clock in in the morning and call for adhan thinking that it's noon prayer and and this is not acceptable but if we have someone to tell him to indicate to him that it is time for adhan then this is permissible and this is acceptable and again abdullah ibn um was a companion of the prophet allah azzawajal has revealed asura to our prophet when he the pro that is the prophet allah was not cooperative with abdullah ibn maktoum the blind man who came to seek knowledge but the prophet sallam was engaged in teaching and calling those heads of tribes of the non-muslim tribes abdullah tomb also was used to assume positions in the in the case of the absence of the prophet allah so whenever the prophet salallahu left medina on journeys he would appoint him as a governor of medina which meant that he had the powers to rule to judge and to uh solve disputes among people and this again comes and and teaches us and we learn from it that it is permissible for a blind person to assume a position in the state because abdullah ibn maktoum used to be a judge and used to be a governor so it tells us that islam cares for those who have special needs those who are handicapped and this does not prevent them from contributing to the building of the society and in contributing and trying to to do good for the people your handicap is not a barrier or something an obstacle to prevent you from serving islam from giving aid to others and helping them in so many different ways and manners uh i think that this is all the issues we have regarding hadith of abu qatad of uh umar and aisha abdullah ibrahim may be pleased with them we move on to the following hadith hadith number 152. who called for the prayer before dawn and the prophet sallallahu alaihi told him to return and announce lo the slave of allah meaning bilal had slept hence this mistake lo or beware the slave of allah bilal had slept now this hadith is not authentic and you cannot correct things there are no correction uh uh measures to be taken if you had made a mistake and called for the adhan before its time it's not recommended that you go again hold the mic and say hey guys i made a mistake just you know rub it off and don't consider it and we will do it again within two minutes i'm sorry if you have eaten if you done this or you if you prayed you review it no this is not the case the hadith we cannot build any uh allegation according to it because it's not an authentic hadith we move on to the following hadith hadith number 153 and i believe nour will read it narrated by abu sayyaf al-hudari may well be pleased with him allah's messengers said when you hear the adam repeat what the muadin's meaning the call maker says and al-bukhari has reported similarly in the narration by mu'awiyam replaced with him and muslim reported nourishing by umar may be pleased with him regarding the virtue of repeating what the pronounces pronounce word by word except when the says come to the prayer and come to the success one should say meaning there is no might and no power except with the help of allah okay this hadith tells us what to say when we hear them and this is very important because the sunnah is that we say exactly what the muslim says and this is a sunnah that has been abandoned by lots of the muslims they hear that then they don't pay any attention to it they don't repeat after the caller for salat after the then and the sunnah is whenever you hear that stop what you're doing listen to them and then when he says when he says you say exactly the same except as in uh this hadith uh narrated by rama may allah be pleased with him that when the mother says you say there is no might and there is no power except with the help of allah what is the meaning of salat come come to the come to prayer yes come to the prayer okay what is the meaning of god come to success and prosperity and you cannot come without the help and power of allah and that is why it is relevant that you say and this is something that lots of the muslims are unaware of now if i have a presentation in my company and i'm provide i'm giving this presentation to the ceo to the general managers the vice presidents to customers that i have i would come and talk throughout the presentation by saying i did this i succeeded in making this i secured a transaction with the company and i did and i did this and i did that and all of this is unacceptable in islam why because you are attributing your success to yourself you're claiming to be the origin of the sex of success which is wrong you have to attribute everything that you know and gain everything that you succeed in doing to allah the almighty otherwise you would be associating someone else you would be associating your powers and efforts with allah with allah azzawajal and this is unacceptable we cannot do anything without the guidance of allah without the power might of allah and if we fail this is because of our own wrongdoing and if we succeed it is because of the grace of allah azzawajal so it's very wrong to say that i did this and i did that you should always say by the grace of allah i managed to do this by the grace of allah i managed to do that we have a short break so please stay tuned and insha allah we will be right back back to the prophet join sheikh ahmad in the program back to the prophet wherein he teaches us practical lessons from the prophet's life and how this can help us to overcome our challenges in the present we talk about the life example of the prophet muhammad peace and blessings be upon him seeking guidance for ourselves in the early days after the revelation of the holy quran the muslims were greatly persecuted so much so that quite a few muslims had to leave arabia and migrate to africa to live among christian people who followed the gospel of christ and welcome back before we move on to the following hadith i believe that brother mustafa has a question what if someone lives in a very high building so that he cannot hear the event from the masjid and he can only hear it on it on a record on from the radio or something okay can he repeat after the video or well this brings up another question and i think it's relevant that we may ask this question but remind me of the the second question after i answer yours yes whenever you hear the adhan you may repeat after him but some scholars said that if you hear the adam from the radio then it's not an actual adhan so you may not repeat behind him personally i think you may because it is thicker of allah azza so whether you hear it from a radio from a a tape recorder from uh directly from the mosque it's okay inshallah to call for the then you have any comments yes like uh do the scholars that do not agree that you should uh like follow the other than from uh the radio do they also know that sometimes the then could actually be saying it live and would it make a difference no that that that wouldn't make the difference because you're not listening to him on this at the same time you're not in the same area or in the in the vicinity of the place he's doing but as i said i personally think it's okay to repeat after the adhan whether it's from a tape recorder from the radio or you're hitting it directly the question that came up into my mind that i'd like to to share uh it with me is that the adhan if you hear it you must pray in the masjid is that correct if you hear that then then this it means it's obligatory that you pray in the masjid because of the hadith of the blind man who came to the prophet and he complained saying o prophet of allah my far my my house is far away from the mosque and medina is very dark and you know it's creepy at night and i don't have anyone to lead me to prayer and i'm a bland blind man and there are you know there might be dogs or stray dogs or uh scorpions and and things that may harm me so is there an excuse for me to pray home the prophet said allah do you hear the adhan the man said yes so the prophet said you have to answer the call of i i don't find any permission for you not to attend so it's obligatory no now in this high building of brother mustafa because he lives on the fourth or sixth floor and he does not hit the advan though the mosque is next door so is it obligatory that he prays in the mosque or because he does not hear that then it's okay for him not to attend answer fadi i think he has to pray in the mosque okay he doesn't hear that then even if he doesn't hear that then he has to pray in the mosque how would he say that where did you get this because uh the prayer of jamaica takes the status and that's where yes but the prophet said you hear that then then he made the obligatory or not obligatory depending on hearing so what do you think muhammad yes he must attend the prayer in the mosque because he know that this is a time for praying he he hears the dazan on radio on television it doesn't have any radio or television so if uh no no mustafa i think you should have done because he knew that this is the time of prayer even if it does not hear that then then the prophet should have told the blind man that as long as you know it's time for prayer you should come whether you hear it or without it's a blind man he has people to tell him what do you think about malik oh you know i have to say my you know same idea as uh which is which is you know that you know he should know the time you know he should time you know like have his watch or something whatever you know at four o'clock for thirty is us you know four thirty a bit mosque okay finally fatty like we said earlier you should look at the sun and measure it by the shadow no he shouldn't he shouldn't nor do you have anything or should i go on i think i have uh some opinion okay you have to come to the more sun to do pray together but is it a must if he did not hear the adhan or not see the problem is is that hearing the adhan itself the most important thing or was it meant to be the distance that the the voice of a normal person on top of a mosque whenever you don't have these concrete uh shacks and buildings that we live in it's not the actual hearing it's the distance that counts because if it's if it were to to be the actual hearing if i live exactly next to next door to the mosque and i live in an isolated and insulated room a well-insulated room then this means that i will not be able to hear that although it's a couple of meters away from me so scholars say now hearing the advan is a must but providing you are in the same circumstances where the prophet sallam had so this means that turn off the amplifiers and the loudspeakers but move away from the concrete buildings you're living in and move away from anything that is consists a barrier to the sound and then try to measure how far would the normal sound travel to so people say scholars say that it probably travels to two to three miles away from the mosque if in open environment normal houses made of clay and a one-story building buildings then this would takes them approximately two to three miles it would travel maybe more so scholars say if you live in the vicinity of a mosque of this distance then you have to pray now if you deliberately close the windows turn on the air conditioning put on uh turn on the tv and put some uh put on your walkmans and and listen to a cd or whatever and then you say oh alhamdulillah i didn't hear that then this is not an excuse for you uh before allah questioned accordingly so i hope this answers your question mustafa i don't have another question then you have another let's go okay so does this mean that if i live at the distance that's like five miles away from the mosque that i cannot i can i do have an excuse to not play the obligatory player yes sir you do indeed if you live away from the mosque in a normal distance that you could not hear the athan you have this excuse because if the man answered the prophet the blind man and he said no i don't hear that then what would you expect the prophet to tell him then you have an excuse see the problem is does the event reaches you or not now the loudspeakers don't count because you could blow the sound like 20 miles away or 10 miles away and it was it would be a burden to people to ask them to you know if you hear that and then people say well i hear it from the radio so this is an extra 50 or 100 miles and so on it goes on and on and on no this is not wanted for itself it should the normal voice how long it will travel how far would it travel in normal circumstances without any high-rise buildings without any concrete and so on fadi i have a question if someone keeps turning on the tv because he likes to listen to the azen from one channel to the other and we know that the zen is 24 hours per day all over the world on the timing and he has like thousands and thousands of channels on his satellite dish can he keep watching one event after the other after the other after the other saying like before and after each prayer 50 minutes of just listening to them personally i doubt that a person with a thousand satellite channels would spend this time moving from one channel to the other just looking for event this guy is obsessed with adani he's talking he should be away from anything because he would stalk them and probably harass them no but hypothetically speaking if we assume that someone does this well he would skip his own prayer he would skip his own repeating after his own advent who lives next door doing this you see you don't have to go to extremes saying that moving on from one uh tv channel to the other and repeating after every and each month then and this does not go 24 hours because no channels according to my knowledge uh uh bring the advan except like four or five maybe ten uh uh of them ten he thinks like the person who does this thinks it's like a form of getting closer to allah so like like a thicker or like yeah like well when it's to this extent i'd prefer that they don't do not do this so would it be a better if you're doing this i've mentioned earlier that some scholars say only repeat after a live event but something that is transmitted through the radio or something that is recorded you may not do this as it's a form of worship and this person is not present and i said that well any any thinking that this doesn't happen every now and then it happens once in a while that you hear the adhan while tuning on to the radio and there's nothing wrong inshallah and repeating after it but if you come to be obsessed in this manner in calling every single a couple of minutes from one place to the other no this would not be recommended uh any question any further questions okay i i we have the hadith number 150 1454 narrated by usman it's a long hadith but it's an important one i don't know if we have time enough for it but we'll just read it as a reminder go ahead please narrated by us many meaning leader of my people and prayers he is said you are the imam but you should follow meaning observe the strength of the weakest among them and appoint them who does not charge for the call of even now the hadith itself we need a lot of time to look into the issues of it but uthman ibn abilis is one of the companions of the prophet islam he was very young he came from taif district from another place came with his friends only to learn religion and this teaches us that it is sunnah to travel to acquire knowledge and this sunnah a lot of people abandoned they either travel to acquire money or to learn for this life not for the hereafter or just to brag about them being no students of knowledge and i did this and i did that and this is not recommendable at the time of the prophet sallam they traveled only for the sake of allah and to acquire knowledge this hadith as i've mentioned earlier is a great hadith inshallah we will try to look into the issues related to it next time but until now manila was"
