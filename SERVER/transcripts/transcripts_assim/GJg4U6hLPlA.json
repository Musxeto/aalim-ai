  "transcript": "Imad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh So Sheikh, what's the ruling on some podcasts or videos where people expose their sins as a nasiha? Will they be held accountable if they tell people today a sin that they did in the past but they didn't know that it was haram? JazakAllah Wa Jazakum. The Prophet ï·º told us that Allah Azza Wa Jal will forgive his ummah the whole entire ummah except for Al-Mujahireen and those who publicize their sins after being concealed by Allah Azza Wa Jal. Therefore, such podcasts, though the intention of the brother was good, but when he comes and says, I was an actor, I was a singer, I used to do drugs, I used to go to nightclubs and party, I used to have relations with women, I used to gamble, I used to do this and that, he's exposing Allah's sitr and what Allah concealed upon him. And the Prophet told us that such an individual will not be forgiven by Allah, though his intention is good. So one has to refrain from this and to refuse to be a candle that sheds light to the people while burning itself. Because this is exactly what he's doing. He's giving light and hope to the people but he's burning himself. It's like putting himself as a bridge between the edges of hell where people walk on his back while he's being burnt to save them and Allah knows best. you"
