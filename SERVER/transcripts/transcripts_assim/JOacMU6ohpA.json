  "transcript": "and he says that I wanted to participate or to practice the fast of prophet Dawood a day his salat wa salam as said by the prophet muhammad alayhi salat wa sallam every other day if it happens to fall on a Sunday and the next day is Monday can I fast for two days then till Wednesday and then next day will be a Thursday how should I be doing it so in essence rather Omar's question was about combining between the fast of David of the would peace be upon him and the Mondays and Thursdays is it possible or not if you go to the origin of this hadith you'll find that the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he advised Abdullah even and asked me Allah be pleased with them who used to fast every single day so the Prophet iris Ostrom directed him to the minimal best which is to fast three days every month and he said that he can add more so the prophet alayhi salatu salam gave him seven days a week ten days a week fifteen days a week which is every alternate day so he said I can add more to that and I'm fit I'm strong I can fast more than every alternate day the Prophet said as some know this is not permissible there is no way better than this way and this is the fasting of the water when scholars looked at this hadith and they also looked at the hadith in favor of fasting every Mondays and Thursday of each week and they weighed which one is better than the other they without any hesitation due to the clear directive of the Prophet re salat WA Salam they recommended the fasting of the wood because the Prophet said the reason there is no fasting better than that therefore scholars say that we understand from this hadith that you should fast every alternate day meaning not more than half of the month because then you would go to exceed the limit set by the Prophet eyes of Salaam and this means that if you fast every alternate day you want to fast Mondays and Thursdays you have to skip other two days from the week that you facet Mondays and Thursdays and this is not possible so by fasting the fast of that would peace be upon him you would be able to fast one Monday at this week and a Thursday at the following week and a Monday and so on but to combine this is not possible"
