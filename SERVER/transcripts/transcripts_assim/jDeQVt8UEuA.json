  "transcript": "I want to know when to use Masha online what are the difference between these two okay um first of all to word off to stop and prevent an evil eye from happening from you against others the Sunnah is to say Allah and some would say tabarak Allah but this is not very strong so when you make a Dua with Baraka from Allah blesses it this blocks your evil eye you won't inflict evil eye on that individual others say that in suratul kaf when one of the guys was telling his friend that had you said this statement when you saw your garden and how beautiful it is Masha Allah to stop and prevent yourself from giving an evil eye to your own possessions a lot of the scholars say that this also prevents an evil eye specifically to your own stuff not to others but a lot of the scholars say that it does the job mentioning the name of Allah by saying when you see a beautiful car or nice children playing around and and their uh hyper this blocks your evil eye as well but definitely saying is the strongest and the most authentic of all"
