  "transcript": "going to her second question this is some of the diseases of the hearts this is something that spoils our standards of living and that is hatred feeling the pain feeling that someone stabbed you from the back being oppressed all of these make our lives miserable so if someone that you used to respect and he does not reciprocate and show his gratitude to what you do you feel bad about it how would you feel if he stabs you in the back and spreads lies about you definitely this is even way worse so calcium is asking about such a person who now at the moment neglects what he had done is unaware of his transgression his home he's happy he's enjoying life who's on the losing end it's you consume you the one who's being tortured you're being envious you are filled with negative thoughts your heart is blackened by hatred and grudges while your opponent is happy so you are being unfair to yourself what's done is done if you have confidence in yourself it doesn't matter if the they praise me or criticize me who cares so you should be confident of yourself you should be grateful to allah azzawajal that he exposed that person who is a relative or whatever who you used to respect enormous ly and do a lot of things and go out of your way to help and please you should be grateful to Allah that he exposed him to you or her to you a brother called me a couple of days ago he said my father-in-law borrowed money from me and promised to return it in three months time and now it's been like three years four years and he did not return it I feel bad and the reason I feel bad is because my own father is demanding money from me and I don't have so every time I call my father-in-law he dodges my calls he doesn't reply and if he does he says once you come back I will give you your money etc and he is definitely not intending to do it so I asked her brother how much is the money and he said ten reals a ten thousand reals I said this is the greatest gift from Allah to you I said how was that I told him three four years ago when you you had good relations with your father-in-law had he asked you for a million reals and at the time you had the many million reals would you have given him no I said yes so I told him now look mashallah Allah Azza WA JAL has granted you nine hundred and ninety thousand reals a gift with ten thousand reals you exposed the nature of your father-in-law so now even if he comes and asks you for you for a dime you won't give him because you know so who cares about the ten thousand let it go as long as you have a good wife and you are happy with her let this be a gift to him and a lesson to you not to give him any single curse or a penny in the future and then I said wow that's good thank you consume you should do the same don't look at the empty half of the glass look at the full half of the glass though it's the same glass so be grateful to allah azza wajal and be thankful to the many favors and blessings that Allah had given you and don't be stuck in that hole or in that pit where you by your own choice decide to depress yourself to feel sorry for yourself to feel oppressed and saddened move on history is gone it's not gonna come back again so it's a lost cause forget about it move in your life and be positive and inshallah you will benefit from that"
