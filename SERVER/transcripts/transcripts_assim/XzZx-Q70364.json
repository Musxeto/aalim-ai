  "transcript": "Hala from France yes you know I have been taking accountable calls and counseling sessions from you against the whisperings of satans and gin attacks so my questions for today is how can I still stay strong and be happy most especially the happiness of living despite of my weaknesses falling into harams sham and mockable things because I know it is an obligatory Act of upon we Muslims to stay strong and happy in every situation even if they are overwhelming sir first of all this is not something that a person can adapt overnight this is related to the good life that Allah has promised those who do good deeds while being Believers so whoever whoever does good deeds and is is a Believer whether male or female Allah will give him a good life and this good life as mentioned in the Quran this is basically as Scholars interpret it to be content you can be the poorest person on Earth you could be the most severely affected person by illnesses and diseases and calamities and Jin and black magic and the whole nine yards but when you have content of what Allah has decreed upon you you will live a happy life and whenever your trust and dependence and Reliance on Allah is demolished and reduced you will not have a good life at all and this is when you will have depression complaints and lots of bad things happening in your life because you don't believe in the Divine decree and you don't have this content in your heart you need to practice over and over until you achieve this high level of Iman"
