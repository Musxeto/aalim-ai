  "title": "What to do with old stamps or paper with Allah's Name on it, how to respect it",
  "transcript": "Muhammad from the UK Assalamu Alaikum I inherited a stamp book which is quite a lot of decades old and in there there are some stamps with the names of Allah and there are some postcards as well and because it's decades old some pages are clean but others may be stained and there may be places with brown mould and stuff on and some of the stamps with the name of Allah well one of them there was ink on top of that from another stamp which is stamped on top of postage stamps I also have a lot of written notes in English, some in translation, some in transliteration of names of Allah and also Acts of Worship, Hadith and Prophets but I didn't take care of these because they're written in English so I didn't know if they should be respected or not so I left some on my floor, so overall I'd like to know everything that we must respect in writing form or in printed image form such as images of the two great Masajid in any of the Masjid and also in writing form so I'd like to of course I know names of Allah should be respected okay Muhammad, Muhammad this is taking too long you've combined so many issues in one question and this is not any fair so coming to your stamp book there's nothing wrong with the stains being or ink being on the name of Allah in a stamp or a postcard or whatever there's no problem in that at all you can keep it you can try to clean it if you keep it as it is there's no sin in that other notes that have the names of Allah or other Islamic material written in English or transliteration also do not have the same value and respect that we would want when it's written in Arabic has no amount of respect to it that we should pick it up from the floor and burn it or shred it similarly to what is written in Arabic for example Allah that's totally different so I hope this answers your question"
