  "transcript": "um for example frame from from something because it seems don't you don't people that that is the reason you're refraining would that be cooler for example if my um if my sister asks asked me for uh um for paper to wrap a Christmas gift and she says why and I don't tell her that I don't miss her because I'll be sinful would be regarded as kuffa no this is not kuffer this can be sinful for assisting her on a sin but it does not reach the level of kuffer kuffer is this belief and to disbelief you need to commit one of the things that nullify your Islam with the conviction and the belief and the intention to leave Islam so such a matter of assisting your sister in wrapping a gift for Christmas this is not kuffer it can be a a sin but not reaching the level of kufur and Allah Knows Best"
