  "transcript": "the next question is from brother of the rahman at what age should children start to fast i mean what is the minimum and maximum age to start fasting this depends on children first of all they cannot be left alone not fasting after reaching the age of puberty so this is the max once they reach the age of puberty it becomes mandatory when or how young that we should tell them this differs from one kid to the other i have grandchildren of mine that started fasting when they were five or six years of age voluntary they didn't nobody pushed them it was just a challenge for them and since then masha'allah they're still fasting and i have grandchildren that were 11 years of age and they used to break their fasting at midday so it differs from one person to the other you have to train them coach them and try your level best and yeah allah would make it easy allah"
