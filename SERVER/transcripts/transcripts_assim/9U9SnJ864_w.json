  "transcript": "Temptations and desires what would you say is the difference between when you were growing up and today to start with and then how do you think that has changed um in the Contemporary era like what we're facing now is it really the same just a little bit more of it or like what would you kind of speak to thatd the comparison is not fair because I come from the Middle East and when I grew up there were dinosaurs around me so I was born in the previous Century that this shows you how old I am so the Temptation at my time was nothing compared to today and I do really feel sorry for you guys and I would not even dream of being in your shoes today when I was like 50 years ago or 40 years ago because it's it's unimaginable the fitan the trials The Temptations are way way more than that we used to face and are much much easier to attain and get than it was my time and those who support you to do it and encourage you to do it far exceed those at my time so there's no comparison none whatsoever if we were to talk about temptation one of the biggest problems of the youth that I see and they don't see and this is one of the problems it's not that my eyesight is stronger but maybe because I'm older not maybe definitely I'm older and I can see things you guys can't because you're sometimes Blinded By the Light that you can see blinded by the Temptation blinded by the desires blinded by your wanting to do something regardless of the whole world is against you you just want you fixated it and this is one of the biggest problems and advantages at the same time one of the biggest problems of the of the of the youth is that when they're fixated to do something they're going to do it it but it's an advantage because if it's directed towards truth and beneficial thing they become an unimaginable power for the umah but they can be a nuclear bomb that destroys the umah and before it destroys the umah it destroys themselves so one of the biggest problems that the youth is unable to see is they do not have a strategy they do not have an objective in life imagine if I have a Ferrari Roma or a Porsche 911s with launch control nice cars and I fill it up with fuel and I leave home at 6:00 or 7:00 a.m. ready to go and I go where I don't have any Target any destination I will reach nowhere soon because I don't have a destination I have the fastest and most reliable car and it's filled with gas but if I don't have a destination where will it take me nowhere when the youth don't have an objective a destination unfortunately this is what happened happens why do you go to school duh my birds want me to go to school ask any one of them do you love school no so you doing something you don't like you don't love then what um I go to school so I can go to college then what I can get married and get a job then what I can buy a car I can get a mortgage then what that's this is their objective in life a true Muslim whether young or old has the route set for him before he was born you know what your route is I have not created the gin and the humans except to worship me this is your GPS this is where you should go and every every time you divert a bit routing and it puts you back on the track to worship Allah when you go to the gym you worshiping Allah when you play pad tennis you're worshiping Allah when you swim when you play football or soccer or when you simply sit with your siblings and play UNO or whatever you are worshiping Allah if you have the intention to worship Allah once you set your GPS then your schooling your work your life has a purpose you are focused now you become productive and this is part of the strategy to set your mission and vision and implement it but when you don't have it you're lost so what are you going to do I'm going to kill time what's the crime of time to kill what are you doing wasting time doing nothing days and nights pass and you are in stagnant Waters you're not producing you're not benefiting neither yourself or the community and then you start to go downhill you feel depressed depressed you feel sad you're bored why are you bored and sad and depressed all the desires you want to do you're doing it you're having fun you're always with your buddies you're always hanging out with them you're always doing things that people tell you not to do yet you are still bored one of the mothers told me that her son is addicted to watching action movies and people said duh action movies what is it people are addicted to porn people are addicted to something action movies is even imams of the Masid watch action movies nowadays unfortunate very unfortunate I was in London once and one of the brothers taking me from the uh hotel to The Venue his beard was mallah this long and his stove was this short and he was with me and we passed by a billboard with movie and he said in this movies hangover did you see it I looked at him said excuse me and then oh oh no I mean it's funny sh said how how do you watch such things it's normal in your country it's normal when you ask the youth those practicing even imams of the Masjid they have no problem yeah I saw it in 3D Cinemax but good but what what 100% you should see it these are the sh you asked them about mortgage and they said it's okay but nowadays no you have to be selective you have to know do I have a strategy this mom says to me my son watches 6 hours of action movie race cars and shootings and cowboys and after each movie of an hour and a half he comes comes to me and say I'm bored so I say watch another movie he goes and watch another movie for an hour and a half he's happy he's having fun he's laughing he's sad he's crying finishes I'm bored so this is what's filling your time and it's all downhill because you don't have an objective so in my point of view I don't want to make this a long talk is already falling asleep so I try to wrap it up you as the youth the Temptation you're facing you cannot counter that without a strategy what is your purpose in life what do you want to be"
