  "transcript": "we have abduli from Pakistan can you hear meum yes I can so sh have a question that in my mid the Imam doesn't sit properly between the two sujud like and I know I I have to first I have to go to the next pillar when the Imam has settled there so when he goes to when he sits between the two sjes he sits for almost a second and once I once I'm about to once I'm about to sit till then he's already gone for the second s then I know that I haven't I wasn't with him for at least one second so what can I do in this situation so my prayer is valid first of all you have to choose a proper Masjid that has a proper Imam who follows the Sunnah unfortunately a lot of the hanafi followers imams they don't consider sitting between the two suud as a pillar and they don't say so they just keep on doing this like the Ferrari Imam we saw in turkey and elsewhere and unfortunately such imams are so ignorant of the religion and blind followers of their peers and their teachers that they relate zero to Quran or to Sunnah so number one your prayer is the most valuable thing in your life choose a righteous practicing IM to pray behind so go to Mid who follow the way of the Prophet Alam and adhere to the Quran and the Sunnah and neglect these ignorants who don't know how to even pray if you don't have any in your vicinity and you're stuck with this ignorant Imam so you may pray behind him and his sin would be on him and your being late because of his quick movement and not following the way of the Prophet Alam would also be on him so there's no problem in catching up with him so the moment you sit you just say and go for another sujud and Allah Knows Best"
