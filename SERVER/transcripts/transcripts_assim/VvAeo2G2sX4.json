  "transcript": "'Abdullah from India. 'Must I follow a school of thought when I\nstudy Fiqh, or the fundementals of Fiqh? Or can I study a book that has a collection,\nor cocktail(?), of all different books?' This depends on your level of knowledge. If you are a student of knowledge and you\ncan go through one of the books of Sheikh ash-Shawkani, for example, and understand\nwhat he says without being confused and without cherry-picking. That's a good thing to do. But if you're a layman you cannot simply dive\ninto such books and not be confused, or not be distracted. You have to follow a particular school of\nthought. And this is the academic way of seeking knowledge. That you study the Fiqh, text from A-Z according\nto 1 school of thought. So if you're a Hanafi, you go through the\nwhole Hanafi Fiqh from A-Z from one of their authentic sources. Once you finish, then you can upgrade and\nstart comparing between schools and reading from Maliki, Shafi i, Hanbali and try to cross\nreference and examine their evidences. But to jump into the 4 schools and start looking\naround without having a guide to show you, this is not the appropriate way of doing this. And Allah knows best."
