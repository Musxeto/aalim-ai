  "transcript": "my question is uh is it permissible for me to uh because I'm graduating this summer in high school and they told me that I need to attend a graduation ceremony so I was wondering if it's permissible because they'll most likely have like music free mixing and all that well jazak this is not a necessity attending a high school to attend classes and labs and to get a certificate that enables you to go to go to college and un Unity is a necessity as a bread winner of your family so this is a must we we can't escape or Dodge this but the graduation ceremony is not a necessity you've graduated so it doesn't matter whether you go and take your certificate officially wearing their uh clothes and uh hats and the likes or not it's not going to impact your graduation so when you say that there would be music free mixing lots of Haram things the answer is definitely no you don't have to go there and you must not go there otherwise this would Cascade to the prom as well you might as well go to the prom and pick a prom queen and do the whole n no the whole nine yards and what follows that no we have our identity we have our Islam and beliefs to abide by and Allah Knows Best"
