  "title": "Are we rewarded as if we prayed whole night with imam if we miss a rakah (Taraweeh) assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so I just wanted to ask regarding the reward of praying the whole night if you play the the Asia player with the third week is it okay if you like miss one or two raka if the start a bit too early the Hadith is crystal clear whoever prays with the Imam until he's finished Allah would register to him as if he had prayed the whole night so if you miss taraka or more with your Imam unfortunately you don't fall under this Hadith so you will be rewarded but not as if you have prayed the whole night so the advice is that you go back home afterwards and you pray as much as you can and inshallah Allah will reward you for that"
