  "transcript": "part okay number nine yeah um of course part of the etiquette is that it is totally prohibited to drink in gold or silver utensils and vessels and this is found in many fstar hotels and I've been around the world in in in five-star hotels when you ask for a for tea they bring you in a jug of silver and you can see it's silver when you go to eat the utensils are gold or silver it's different than the room service the room service people put in their bags so they can steal it but in the hotel itself in in the restaurants it's made of gold and silver it is totally Haram to consume it and uh to eat in that and also it is totally Haram to eat with your left hand this is is a thing that the prophet sallam prohibit us from doing and he said that eating and drinking with the left hand is a treat of Shan that Muslims must uh avoid uh how much time 10 minutes okay so all of this was uh at Before Time and whenever wanted to gather the Muslims the Gathering point was always in the Masjid so whenever there's something of importance he would send b or anyone to call meaning that prayer gathers people come to the Masjid so they come and he would either speak to them about something he wanted to advise them about or if he wants to send an expedition or a group of the army to a specific place he would do so or if there is a revelation that came and he wants to announce it to them he would do that before time the prophet used to take his Siesta and this is a like a 10 15 minute that would energizes energize you for the rest of the day because remember the prophet was awake since when Alam since the middle of the night before f he was praying night he just took a small nap before F and then from F until you're talking about six seven good hours so this 15 minute breaks the fatigue and the lack of concentration and re-energizes you with the grace of Allah and is part of the the prophet says take your the middle of the day nap your Siesta because the Devils don't so it's part of the Sunnah and I know a lot of the executives in the corporate world who would take this sacred 10 minutes 15 minutes before time even in their offices they would tell you their secretaries that I have 10 minutes uh important meeting and they just doze off for 10 20 minutes and mashallah it gives them a lot of energy for the rest of the day so if it's time for the prophet Alam hears thean in his his in his house he repeats after the MU and then he prays fourah two by two and in the remaining time for the he would utilize it either to speak with his wife and to joke with her and to have a good time or to attend to his grandchildren and play with them and this was the norm because he loved his grandchildren and when Bal notified him that it is time for prayer he used to go to the Masjid directly"
