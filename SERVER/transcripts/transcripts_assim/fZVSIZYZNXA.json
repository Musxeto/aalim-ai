  "transcript": "from the mauritius says a girl had a relationship with a boy and she wants to cut all um communications but she remembers that she gave him an oath not to do so should she uh offer expiration if she just promised him no she there's no expiation but if she took an oath in allah's name then the answer is yes she has to feed or clothe 10 poor muslims one meal average meal and if she is unable to do that financially she should fast three days only but definitely she should not ever consider having any relationship with him"
