  "transcript": "what's your question my question is my question is what is the clear-cut evidence that we can pray uh missing prayer at prophet foreign that uh missing prayer pray immediately but that doesn't mean that we can uh pray at privation time because there is not any evidence at the time of prophet that anyone adopted first of all there isn't a crystal clear-cut evidence for everything in life there are general evidences mentioned in the quran and there are evidences that are stimmed and taken from the quran and the sunnah known only to scholars and this is why we have the difference between those who know and those who do not know allah says in the quran say do those who know are equal to those who do not know of course not therefore you cannot understand a lot of these things if you don't have knowledge if you did not study arabic read the quran know that afsir know the fair if you do this sometimes it's ambiguous to you even then you may not find it and you have to refer to scholars what do scholars say scholars say that we have what seems to be conflicting evidences and this is not possible in islam the prophet says allah do not pray after asar until the sun sets and do not pray after fajr until the sun rises times of prophecy prohibition but at the same time he said that islam when you enter a masjid do not sit until you pray two raka's so one says hmm what should i do here he says it's haram to pray and here he says it's haram to sit so if i come after us or prayer and there are two or three hours till maghrib should i just stand there waiting or should i disobey him and sit so these look conflicting but the scholars of islam who spent their lives studying islam and teaching it came and said no wait wait wait wait you can't just judge it like this without looking at the evidences any lay man would say no i don't do this because he doesn't have knowledge people like imam shafiri for example and this is what sheikhabin athemin said may allah have mercy on his soul asking questions number one if i came after assad prayer is this time of prohibition yes or no yes i remember that i did not pray fajr prayer i overslept and i went to work for for totally forgetting it and now i remember it question can i pray my missed fajr at the times of prohibition and serve definitely all scholars of all schools say yes thank you situation number two after assad prayer if there was a sun eclipse which is not usual but hypothetically are we allowed to pray of course this is the time for it and you have to pray but this is a time of prohibition no no this is exempted thank you after asa prayer they brought a corpse of a deceased muslim to be buried can we pray janaza prayer or have to wait three hours until sunset no of course we have to bury him as soon as possible we can pray and the list goes on so what do we understand we understand that to combine evidences without dismantling one over the other or disregarding one for the sake of the other in order to combine the evidences we say that the time of prohibition after assa and after fajr is when a person wants to pray voluntary prayers that has no reason no legitimacy i don't have anything to do better than to pray i just want to pray six raka's for the sake of allah or two raka's for the sake of allah we say no sit down this is a time of prohibition but if the prayer has a valid reason then you may pray it at the times of prohibition and allah knows best you"
