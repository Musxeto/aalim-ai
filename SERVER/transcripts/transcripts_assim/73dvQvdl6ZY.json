  "transcript": "Arik from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam. So Sheikh, my question is regarding the Friday Khutbah. So the masjids that they provide three khutbahs, like one of them in native language and two in Arabic. In those times, if someone talks during the first khutbah, well the khutbah in the native language, does that invalid the person's reward of Jumu'ah? Is this first native khutbah before the Adhan? Yes or no? Yeah, it's before the second Adhan."
