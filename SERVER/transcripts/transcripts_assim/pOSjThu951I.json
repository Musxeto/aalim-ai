  "transcript": "There is nothing wrong in wearing your from your home whether you're from Riyad or from any other town. But the sunnah is that you do not commit yourself to the state of the until you reach the heart. So if I'm and I live in for example or I live in uh anywhere else I put on my I shower I put on my but I myself I'm wearing my and I still can my nails. I still can cut my hair. I still can't put perfume on my body, not on my clothes. There's nothing wrong in that. About 20 minutes before arriving in Ja, the captain will announce that we are now approaching the heart for the place for whoever wants to uh make must make his intention now. Only then you will commit yourself to the city of Allah. So this is something verbal what you say but the intention is in the heart. This is the sunnah for you and Allah knows best."
