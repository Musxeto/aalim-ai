  "title": "Why did the Four Great Imams differ in opinion? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now if you look at the reason of these great scholars differing why if it's the same Quran and it's Ascension well this issue needs a lot of studying and examples which we are unable to afford in such a class why this is a booklet in Arabic I don't know if it's not definitely it has to be translated by even Tamiya may Allah have mercy on his soul it's called referral madam and in a metal atom it translates roughly to stopping the blame upon the great Imams why do we blame them because they differed why would they differ if it's the same Quran the same Sunnah even Jamie explains that the reason of difference of opinions is greatly attributed to the evidence whether it is authentic or not and if it's authentic whether it fits the situation or not and if it fits the situation whether there is something else abrogated it or not whether the understanding is complete or there are exceptions for that particular evidence and he gave a lot of reasons for example the Companions it themselves may Allah be pleased with them we're addressed by a command from the prophet alayhi salatu salam after the Battle of trench when the idol worshipers dispersed and went back to their homes the Prophet as Salam had to deal with the jews of banu Kaurava who broke the treaty not only that plotted to kill the Prophet as Salam and to aid and assist the disbelievers in attacking Medina so the plot profit Alice's them address the companions and said none of you should pray a sir except in Benny forever of course this was addressed to them at the time of the her answer was not called for yet so they marched and in the middle of the way the Sun was about to set yet they did not reach Benny her even so they were divided into two groups one said we have to pray answer before the Sun sets because then the time would be over and the Prophet only said what he had said at his salat wa salam only to encourage us to be haste and to quickly make it too many horrible not to skip salah the other group said the command of the prophet our son is crystal clear and he is the one that gives us direction whether to go or not whether to pray or not so they differed and hence the second group did not pray until the sunset and the rich man agreed the first group they prayed their prayer and then continued to march to Bunnicula reaching there like ten minutes after the second group when they are arrived they told the Prophet erase a lot of some of their dispute now why would two great groups of the Companions differ over a command of the Prophet Allah salatu salam once you understand that they had differed in such a command then you can cascade this down to all or an and Sunnah and understand where differ our ulema different scholars different companions differ and where they're coming from so if you understand this then you start to appreciate the great work of the companions and the great work of the ruler made themselves the scholars"
