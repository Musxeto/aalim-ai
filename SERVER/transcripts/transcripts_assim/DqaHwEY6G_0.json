  "title": "Ruling on expiation for killing someone accidentally - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "and the first email is from brother Sani Tambi uh and he says Salam alaikum I'm driving a truck and while people sat on the top of the truck unexpectedly an electric cable that crossed the road loosed down and hooked one of them down and he died on the way to hospital do I need to perform the fasting now may Allah have mercy on all Muslims who died in such tragic accidents the reason the brother is asking because in Islam if someone is killed accidentally the killer the person who was responsible for such an accident if it is his mistake then he should give expiation and the expression is he must free a slave a believing Muslim slave should be freed and he has to also as well give blood money to the relatives of the deceased if he is unable to free a slave the blood money is there he has to pay it whether they take it or if they have the mercy in their hearts and they would like to forgive and pardon this is up to them as for the free slave this is for the sake of Allah he has to free a believing slave if there isn't any Muslim slave to be freed in this case Islam tells him that he has to fast two consecutive months and this so that allah azza wajal would repent over him now if you look at this situation we find that the brother is talking about an incident where he is driving a truck and there are people on top of his truck if the rules and regulations of the country his n forbids this and considers this to be something that is not legal in this case it is his fault it is his mistake for breaking the law and hence he has to fast these two consecutive months but if this is the norm as in the case where we find people in ruler areas in Africa in Southeast Asia for example where there isn't any traffic laws and this is the only means of transportation for people that they get on top of a truck and it takes him from some place to the other and if this driver did not do any mistake in this case he is not obliged to fast any months at all"
