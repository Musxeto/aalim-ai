  "title": "How to wipe the inner & outer Ear in Wudu & does the water have to reach scalp & roots of head?",
  "transcript": "Mohammed says when wiping the ear do we have to wipe the entire outer and inner ear or just a part of it the same question that Mohammed asked about the ear people usually and often ask about wiping over the head now in the Koran in chapter 5 where it talks about performing ablution Allah says as though a gel to wipe over the head and so many people come and say wiping over the head after finishing it I find them there are spots that are not wet or may not have been reached by my wiping so do I have to do it again we have to understand that there is a difference between washing and wiping when you wipe you do not wash you simply pass your hand over the organ whether you're wiping over your socks with or wiping over your hair so when I wipe over my hair and come back definitely not every single strand of hair would be covered because one my hand is not filled with water it's just wet so maybe by doing this it would have been dried in not sufficient to wipe over the rest I don't have to take new water only one time where I wet my hands and wipe with it likewise when it comes to wiping over your feet or socks that is you don't have to see it all wet otherwise I would have washed it and when it comes to the ears the same goes for that with the same hands with the same water that I use in the initially and I wiped over my hair or my head I don't have hair then I just simply do this put my index finger in my inner ear my thumb's in the outer ear and do this and that's it and this is not to say it's symbolic but it is not washing it's just simply wiping it it doesn't have to cover every single a centimeter or millimeter of the ear you don't have to go into the cavities as well only the inner side that you can wipe with your index fingers and the outer side and that is it and Allah knows best"
