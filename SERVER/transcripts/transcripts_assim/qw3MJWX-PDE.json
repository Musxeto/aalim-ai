  "transcript": "foreign [Music] how would I know if Allah loves me and is pleased with me and he has accepted my duas and so on that he will not punish me in the Hereafter how can I be certain of this you can't simple as that last week I did a lecture in the province of Perles in Malaysia and this is one of the furthest provinces to the north of Malaysia a very nice place to be in to retire in very nice people and Community upon and and they're proud of it and I did a lecture by the name of the balance between fear and love of Allah it is on my YouTube Channel watch that the beauty of it is that we live our life balancing like a bird's wings between the fear of Allah and the Hope in Allah so these Wings must be synchronized and balanced because if one overwhelms the other or overpowers the other the bird will fall and they have to be balanced so when you are certain that Allah has forgiven my sins and accepted my Dua and he loves me I always get the notion of shaytan whispering in my age and say tell you what why don't you watch a movie listen to a song visit the pub go to a nightclub sinful yeah but you have credit Allah loves you Allah accepted your Dua you have credit and this is how shaytan drags our feet to Hellfire you have to have this fear maybe Allah did not accept my Dua what should I do make more Dua maybe Allah did not accept my Salah what should I do offer more voluntary prayers give in charity continue to fear that Allah did not accept so you are positive in doing good deeds and hopeful that Allah will accept it until you die and then after your death you will see that you have mountains and mountains of good deeds and that Allah loves you and that Allah has accepted you Dua but while you're alive be careful of Satan dragging your feet telling you you have got credit"
