  "transcript": "Sammy from the US so my question is in what sense \ndoes riyaa invalidate the good deed does it just   take away the good deed like if I pray or I do \nwudu do I need to repeat it if it had riyaa it's   very hard to repeat over and over over and over \nagain and start over and over and over again   first of all riyaa is to intend someone \nelse other than Allah with the deed you're   doing as a form of showing off and it \nis of two types one is something that is   passing through something that comes \nand goes like intrusive thoughts   if that thought comes to you and you entertain \nit for a while then repel it or fight it off   and try to be sincere to Allah \nthis does not impact your Salat   but if it continues throughout the \nwhole Salat and you notice that you are   pretending things that you wouldn't normally \ndo for the sake of the people watching you   and you're doing it for them not for Allah this \ninvalidates your Salat so to recap one gets when   when a person gets these intrusive thoughts if \nhe entertains them and acts upon them throughout   the whole prayer it invalidates his prayer if it's \njust a feeling and then it goes away or he fights   it off or he rectifies his intention by saying \nI'm doing this for the sake of Allah I don't   care about who's watching me I'm going to continue \nto pray slowly or quickly according to what I want   to pray to Allah not to impress people then this \nhas no impact on your prayer and Allah Knows Best"
