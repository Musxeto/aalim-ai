  "title": "What counts as completing One full rakat before prayer time is over?",
  "transcript": "the final question is from fahim he says the hadith regarding the prayer being valid if we prayed at least one rakah before the time of the prayer finishes does a raqqa and when we rise up from the second prostration or when we stand up from the prostration the hadith whoever attains one rakah before the sun sets he has attained asar and whoever attains one rakah before the sun rises he has attained fajr this is in regards to completing one full raqqa with two sujud unlike the other hadith whoever attains one rakha he has attained the salat which is referring to being with the imam in the bowing or position this is different so if the imam is in the record position imam and we're both in the required position this is a valid salat and a valid raka but in the case of the sun setting and i wake up late and i make wudu and i go ahead and offer answer prayer i have to finish one rakah and the rakha is concluded by accomplishing the second sujud and rising up not by only offering the raku like with the imam and this is a big difference because here we are attaining the time while in the other hadith we are attaining the congregation so here you have to because there is another narration by abu huran and mother aisha and others that whoever attains a sajdah which refers to a full fledged raqqa knows best you"
