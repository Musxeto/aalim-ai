  "transcript": "oh ald dear brothers and sisters and welcome to lessons in F we're still studying the chapter that deals with the manners of answering the call of Nature and last time we talked about Hadith number 90 and I think brother n read it can you read it again please narrated by Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him Allah's messenger sallallah alaihi wasallam said Beware of mirring yourself with urine because it is the main cause of punishment in the grave very well we talked about smearing ones themselves with urine and we said that one should try his best not to get any dripping uh uh uh rebounding on his clothing or on his body while urinating and the prophet in this Hadith tells us that uh getting these smearing on on one's body and clo clothings uh are the main cause of punishment in the grave and this is something that all believe Muslims believe that there is punishment in the grave and that is why the third khif may Allah be pleased with him whenever they buried a person he used to stand watching them bury that dead person and cry and his companions would come to him and say oh khif oh companion of the Prophet Alam we mention heavens we mention hell and you do not cry yet when you come to the graves and you stand on on a grave you cry until you're You Weep until your your beard is filled with tears why why is that he said he tells them he answers them that the grave is the first step for the Hereafter so on it depends your results and the Hereafter if it's good if it's a room of paradise then alhamdulillah you have a clear way or as I say you have a Stairway to Heavens you have no problem but if there are punishment this means that you'll be punished on the day of judgment and we are told by the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam that there are certain things that make per a person uh be make him face the punishment of Allah in his Graves yet he told us to prevent them by avoiding them such as in this case if one takes care and while urinating stays away uh uh uh uh keeps his distance keep his clearance for not smearing his body or clothes with urine then he's in the clear also there is a Sur in the Holy Quran if a person recites it by heart he knows it by heart Allah will prevent him from being punished in the graves does anyone of you know this Surah come again what's the name of the Surah originally chapter 67 of the Holy Quran it is comprised of how many verses that's a difficult question is it no it's not it's not because the Hadith States this if we study the Hadith of the Prophet it's easy for us to know lots of things the prophet says sallallahu alaihi wasallam I know a chapter a Surah of the Quran comprised of 30 Ayah whoever knows it by heart Allah will save him from the punishment of the Grave Al so this is about what couple of pages and a half of the Quran if you recite it you will be saved from being uh a a punished in the grave now do Muslims recite it by heart do Muslims know it by heart no why because they don't see what they're supposed to believe in so it's because we're living in this world we only believe in the things that we can feel and see otherwise me I don't know I I I couldn't care less maybe it's true maybe it's not and and this is the greatest trick of Shayan not believing except when you see or touch now as Muslims we know there's a a verse in the Quran where the Prophet says whoever recites it after the end of every prayer nothing will prevent him from entering Jenna Paradise except death which means that the minute he dies he will enter Paradise what is this verse N I think somebody cheated you huh this is not allowed in classrooms now I made a survey and I've asked a group of high school students and it it it's about 150 of them and I've asked him who knows the verse by heart you would be surprised only 20% knows this Ayah this verse by heart and you're talking about grownup men you know 18 19 years old when I've made a bigger survey in in in all kinds of of uh people you know employees uh merchants and all kind of adults about who recites who knows Sur alul by heart I got only 3% which is strange because if you ask any of them who has stocks in the stock market you get 90% if you ask them about the prices of the Euro or or or of the dollar if you ask them about politics if you ask them about real estate if you ask them about traveling everybody has knowledge of it but when you ask them about Islam when you ask them about the things that saves them from Hell or from being punished in the graves you seldomly find people answering you and this tells us that one should be really careful in knowing his knowledge it takes seconds minutes for you to do what you're supposed to do but the consequences are far greater than what any of us could imagine because you will be at the side of Allah Asel Allah will be pleased with you and this means that Allah will bless everything that you do now you have to be careful not to have what we call whw wiw it sounds good huh fish fash whw what's what's whw it's the whispering of Satan Now by saying you should protect yourself from the smearing of urine this does not mean you have to start to have the to have obsessions that I'm not clean I'm dripping I'm doing this I have to do that and you stay half an hour or an hour in the toilet trying to relieve yourself no this is intended and it's not recommended and it's a sin it's a natural thing urinating is a natural thing everybody does it no one says that well I'm I'm clean I don't do it no everybody has to do it it's it's a natural thing but don't be obsessed by trying to do things that are not natural things that may cause you to be uh uh uh chronically ill and it's not a pleasant thing to do uh I think we move on to the following Hadith Hadith number uh 91 I Believe narr by Malik Allah Allah's Prophet s wasam thought us concerning Meers of Al the meaning is place on of answering the call of nature that we should sit on of our left foot that we should sit on our left foot and keep IR our right foot okay this Hadith is has a weak chain so it's not authentic and this means that God alhamdulillah I don't have to follow this way of sitting when defecating well you don't have to uh it's a weak Hadith we will not go through it just as part of curiosity um to the brothers here do you know who Surak is do you know anything of of this companion any recollection of him he did something something was done to him when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam migrated from mecah to Medina the mus made a bounty whoever brings the prophet or shows us his direction we will give him so and so so s Malik was one of those trying to follow the prophet and he spotted him he spotted him and Abu Bakr so he was on his horseback riding and the minute he saw the prophet Sall alhi wasallam and the prophet looked at him the legs of the animal went into the Sands and he fell so he said oh Muhammad let me go and I will not follow you so the prophet moved on the guy brought in his horse back again and followed the prophet and again the legs of the animal went into the Sands which meant that he was being prevented from following the prophet alham so the guy knew that the prophet was protected by Allah so he told him that he will let him go and he will not uh uh uh follow him so the prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam the guy was knew that that the prophet was sent by Allah and he was being protected so he told the Prophet oh prophet of Allah give me a sign I will I will ask people uh I will redirect the people you know divert them from your way I will tell them that I've seen you going somewhere else so that I would hide your tracks from them so the prophet gave him the good Tiding he saidak how would you feel when you wear the bracelets of the uh the Zar of Persia so Saka thought what is this guy saying he is being chased by the non-muslims from everywhere he's hiding in caves and the desert and he is giving me the Good Tidings that I am to wear the bracelets of the Zar of Persia the King of Persia well let it be Subhan Allah 20 or so years afterwards the Muslims conquer Persia and they bring all the jewels of the zar to Omar the second khif and he displays it in front of him and Omar says Subhan Allah the jar of Persia's treasure is in in front of me where isak Malik soaka comes in as a Muslim and he says wear the bracelets of the pro of of of the Zar he saidar you know that this is not permissible for me because these are go gold and and silver he says to him wear it because it was the prophecy of the Prophet sallallah alaih wasallam they believed in what the prophet said Alam and they saw it come to reality and that is why they conquered the whole world not with their Weaponry they conquered the whole world with their Islam with the generosity and with the belief to share all the goodness with all Humanity uh I think we're going to break here but inshallah we will be right back let's talk so this is something that you have to point out to the to them in the Bible something which is I think very darely needed by the youth which is um staying firm on the truth this is just one of the greatest examples for me of how to control your anger within the framework of of being the cleanest religion the cleanest jurist prudence and in the meantime uh uh the kindest religion to animals watch let's talk with KH amonet as he interviews guests and discusses a variety of topics everything from youth issues to religious issues join us here on Huda TV and welcome back the following Hadith is Hadith ofb or Brad they have a uh they're not sure of the how it's pronounced and why is that back in the day with the day of the companions when they used to write the words in Arabic they didn't put the points on top that's that's correct they did not DOT the letters at the very beginning of uh uh the time of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so you could have one word that is pronounced in two three different ways depending on the dotting of the letters themselves so uh Hadith number 92 narrated byad from his father may Allah be pleased with them Allah's messenger sallallah alaihi wasallam said when one of you passes urine he should forcefully push any urine remaining in his penis three times now thisth again is not authentic so we don't have to elaborate a lot on it but what is pushing it forcefully how does one push urine forcefully three times now here in the Arabic version it says and there's a another word that is one which is Nutter is done without touching your private parts by internally squeezing yourself so this Hadith if it were to be authentic it meant that after urinating you should squeeze yourself uh uh the muscles of the bladder or whatever you should squeeze yourself internally three times so that you ensure that there's no urine left and salt is is doing it with your hand by squeezing it so that the passage is cleared out from urine both methodology both methodologies are not accepted though if you read few of the books on F in some of the schools of thought you would find this mentioned they tell you that you should do it from the anus to the top and others tell you you should do this and you should do that now if we look at the Sunnah we find no mentioning of this so it is okay to do it may Allah have mercy on his soul says it's not okay to do neither n nor s you neither squeeze yourself push it uh internally or externally you don't do this you just simply urinate and his student he said that I've asked my Sheikh T so many times about Nutter and salt every time I go in you sure and I go on and on he says no do not do it and he said that finally he said urine in uh uh uh your private parts is like the milk in the breast of a feeding mother if you squeeze it it comes out and if you leave it it remains inside so urine is the same thing you you could keep on squeezing and pushing it and it comes out and out and dripping and this makes you chronically ill this harms your organs and your private parts and would would cause you to have a disease that uh doctors know about I'm not a physician so I can't even I can't even mention the the profession that deals with uh these private parts and so on nevertheless it is logical it's a human thing to do to urinate so don't make it a surgical operation it's it's a human thing so let it come and and urinate naturally and then all what you have to do is just sprinkle water put some water on your private parts and move on live your life don't be obsessed of well I I feel that there's a a drop came out I feel that I did this or that I have a string feeling inside don't listen to The Whispers of Shan just sprinkle your private parts with water and go on with your life uh the following Hadith narrated by abas may Allah be pleased with him the prophet sallallah alai wasallam asked the residents of KU what had earned them the praise of Allah he sallallahu Ali wasallam said indeed Allah Praises you they replied we use water after cleaning the private parts with stones um brother Muhammad do you recall a few programs ago we mentioned that cleaning oneself after urinating or defecating has three steps or stages do you remember them either with water alone first one water well start with the the lowest of all Stones alone stones or hard uh uh uh uh matters Stones then water then with water alone alone and then with stones then water then with both Stones first water that follow and this Hadith though again it is not authentic the Hadith is weak but it tells us that this is the highest of all because it ensures the amount of cleanliness to be 100% but again it is the same thing if you do this or if you do that uh Mustafa what do you think is best to wash or to wipe with dry stuff or to do both will it wouldn't it depend if there's a specific text that says well we've just mentioned this we've we've said that this is a text but it is a week one yes yet the scholars all agree that the best stage of all is both to use both but what if you had the choice to use both and you wanted to use only one so can we say that you have to use water for example if I have water and I have toilet paper I don't want to use water is it okay for me to use toilet paper though I can use water does anybody has the answer yes yes yes you have the answer or yes you know yes the question the answer is yes you could use toilet paper if you have water okay this is the authentic and accepted uh uh answer a lot of Muslims think how do we use isar how do we use toilet paper when we have water it's very simple because Allah tells us it's it's either you choose this or that and the some of the companions did not see it's suitable for them to use water they used to say that how do I wash myself with with water this can't can't be I would still have the the the fil in my hand I only use stones but the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam doing the prophet Sall Ali wasallam Sunnah is to use either and alhamdulillah the choice is yours to choose from of course water is more of a cleansing uh uh agent than Stones because it can clean and remove filth and dirt uh we move on to the following chapter the chapter that deals with and the ruling regarding the sexual impurities or impur uh this chapter deals with what is the translation of taking a bath taking a bath actually it's more than that and we will come to explain this inshallah is removing the state of sexual impurity by taking a total bath so a dip in the water does the job providing that you have the intention the Nia and we will come inshallah to explain more and more of uh uh this but before we go into the chapter there are things that require it's a must if you are in this state that you perform wul so that you can pray perform ta read the Quran do any of the other rituals so can you give me an example other example where I do no what is required for when isul required Muhammad to enter Islam you're a disbeliever okay that's very good and it's a disputable disputed uh uh issue when you enter Islam when you revert to Islam you should have a total bath and we will come to that explain that inshallah in details uh another reason FDI before F prayer before Friday prayer and and then this is again disputed upon a third reason for performing after intercourse after intercourse can you be specific more specific because this is one issue ejaculate when you ejaculate ejaculate okay that in the case of ejaculation then you have to perform uh a total bath whether you do it uh while sleeping whether you intercourse whether whatever you are in the state of a major uh sexual intercourse um f but shouldn't we also perform without like if you had intercourse without ejaculation also oh yes that is completely true if the Intercourse takes place without ejaculation the minute it takes place then the rul is becomes obligatory Muhammad do you have anything well um for a woman after the periods excellent for women that have finished their menstruation or for women that gave birth and the bleeding that comes after the The Birth has uh finished then in order for them to pray they should have the total bath so these are all issues that are that govern Al having uh uh the total bath and there are few things that are not uh uh agreed upon Scholars such as Friday uh uh total bath such as Al the festivals the eat um such as when you have cupping when you extract blood from the back of your neck or or shoulders do I have to perform or or not we mentioned uh uh um few programs ago if you recall that at the beginning of time of Islam it was obligatory to perform R when you no well this is still it still exists uh fat when if if you have uh if you have performed for a dead person if you wash a dead person so that's that was at the beginning of Islam whenever you wash at that person it's a must for you to uh uh take a a bath complete rul and if you carry a de person it is a must that you perol perform Evolution and there are many aspects that govern uh the book or the chapter that deals with rul uh we will go into details inshallah we will explain the Sunnah and the thing that does the job without following the Sunnah and uh inshallah all of this issues all of these issues will be cleared in the following program s but I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program and until we meet next time oh"
