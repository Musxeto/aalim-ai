  "transcript": "Neela from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alhamdulillah Sheikh, I know that believing in shrines is a form of shirk But you know there are almost 2 or 3 shrines in every village What is? Shrines Ah ok, Dargahs Yes, yes And I exactly don't know what to say or how to explain someone who believes that they are the Awliya and all Would you please tell me what exactly to say to our elderly family members that why is this shirk? There is a very better way of doing it and that is to go to www.islamqa.info This is the most highly trusted Islamic website in the world www.islamqa.info Not www.islamqa.org because this is a deviant website Don't mix the two So go to www.islamqa.info and write about Dargahs or seeking refuge in graves and the deceased And they'll explain to you with verses from the Quran With authentic Hadith How this is a major form of shirk That takes a person out of the fold of Islam And he's not a Muslim anymore Even if he prays five times a day Fasts Ramadan Gives Zakat Performs Hajj Because Allah Azza wa Jal stated in the Quran in so many many verses If you associate others with Allah You will lose everything and you will abide in hellfire for eternity They say we're not worshipping others with Allah We are calling them so that they would intercede for us with Allah This is mentioned in the beginning of Surat Az-Zumar They say the idol worshippers We don't worship them, the idols Except so that they could intercede to us and get us closer to Allah And Allah still considered them to be committing major kufr and shirk And Allah threw them in hellfire for eternity So Allah Azza wa Jal does not accept a person to invoke To fear, to love, to ask for protection To hope, to have tawakkul on dependence and reliance other than Him And those who go to the dargahs don't even think of Allah They think of the person dead They write them letters They beg them for children and to pay off their debts And they say that they control the universe Subhanallah, what more shirk and kufr you want So go to that website and inshallah you'll find your answer"
