  "transcript": "us as previously announced tonight's lecture would be on entertainment in Islam and one would ask why is it such a topic to be addressed especially at our current times where we have lots of tribulations lots of calamities people are dying people are being killed and you are talking about entertainment yes because this is part of our religion to discuss things and to know what Islam has to say about them and especially at these times when we have our youth our youngsters being drifted being driven away into valleys of doubts into temptation and desire it is essential for us to to look at the options we can provide for them it is essential and important to give them a way out so I thought that talking about entertainment in Islam would be a suitable topic and Allah May guide us to what he loves subhanahu wa'ta'ala but before we go into entertainment in Islam we have to set some ground rules so that you can know where we're coming from without these ground rules it would be chaotic to speak in on any topic you have to set the policies the procedures that allow you to look into this matter with perspective with conviction and with understanding first of all what is the objective of us as human beings being created if you ask any Muslim he would immediately tell you that Allah says in the Quran that Allah uh uh he says in the Quran I created not the Gins and the humans except they should worship me so Allah has set the objective for us you cannot say no I'd like to do this and I'd like to do that the one who created you told you that your objective in life is to worship him but now you go to another understanding of this verse does worshiping Allah mean that I have to sit at the back of the Masid with prayer beads and saying Subhan Allah alhamdulillah Allah abbar 6,529 times is this what Allah wants from me does this mean that I have to sit without work and I say I have full taul and Reliance on Allah if Allah wants to bring me food and provision and money Allah would do this so I will not work definitely not so what is the understanding of worship in Islam may Allah have mercy on your soul defined this in a very beautiful fashion and he said worship Allah is a terminology defined by any act whether it is by action or rhetorical by speech verbal or by conviction so anything that you do or say or believe that pleases Allah Asel is considered to be a form of worship and this enlarges the scope of worship in Islam this means that if I would like to pray night prayer and I go to bed at 11:00 so that I could have four good hours of sleeping my four hours of sleeping are considered to be form of worship if I wake up couple of hours before F and I'm still drowsy and I make a cup of tea so that I'm well alert for my prayer drinking cup of tea is form of worship not only that our Prophet Alat wasam told the companions something that blew their mind away he said that whenever you have intimacy you have intercourse with your spouse Allah will reward you means of Charity this is considered to be S and the companions said whoa this is too much we have sex with our spouses and we have fun and we enjoy it and Allah rewards it rewards us for it and the prophet said yes sallallahu alaihi wasallam he told them and he gave them the analogy and he said if you do it in Haram will you be sinful and they said yes so the prophet said likewise if you do it in halal you'll be rewarded so now now this for those who are married it's a it's a a good way of entertaining yourself if you're young enough so now you can go and have lots and lots of Charities yeah but not let's at least finished the lecture so by intention you are capable of changing habits into forms of worship by intention I don't feel like taking my kids to the carnish I don't feel like taking my wife to the restaurant for dinner I don't feel like it but if I change it and I say I'll make it for the sake of Allah so that I would please my wife I would please my children Allah would would regard this would reward me for this with good deeds so this is uh uh yeah one of the main ground rules that we have to first of all look at second of all does a Muslim have free time yes or no Muslims have free time definitely they have free time the prophet saidat there are two blessings which many people do not make the most of and thus lose out what are they one good health two free time so the prophet is acknowledging that we have a lot of free time in a latest study that was conducted about couple three years ago so it's not that late in this country the boys at school have in their vacation or in their holidays a surplus time a free time between 8 to 10 hours a day our children have 10 hours a day of nothing doing no responsibility theyve gone through their chores they've done all what they need to do they have 10 hours 8 to 10 hours what do they spend it in this will we uh talk about inshallah the prophet also sahu alaihi wasallam told us make the most of five things before five others there are five make the best of them before other fives come and you know the Hadith life before death now you can work when you die it's gone Health before sickness so many of us are healthy but when illness befalls upon one of us we're unable to do the things we're capable of doing at the moment free time before becoming busy youth before old age and well Health before poverty this is the instruction of the Prophet Alat so we're created to worship Allah this is rule number one we have ledure time free time but we have to utilize it you have we have to make the best of it now can we live without entertainment is it possible no some and I'm talking about out out of experience when I talk to my children when I talk to my relatives the youngsters do do you think that they praise Islam a lot no Islam is boring Islam is depressing there's no fun in Islam what is this every time I come and speak to my father about something he says go go and pray but what pray I prayed go read the Quran do something useful just go I don't want we have a problem of community Comm unication we do not communicate with our children those who are wealthy among us when our children come to us take 50 go and buy drugs buy anything go just go do anything don't don't talk to me those who don't have the the money they kick their children on the street where they can get drugs free they can smoke they can learn bad habits we have a problem so our children our youth the Muslims they think that Islam is depressing is boring we don't have so many things that would entertain us well entertainment is in Islam the prophet and theith is in Muslim a companion by the name of he came and met Abu Bakr and they talked for a while and then they decided that they have a problem and they both went to the prophet am and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam asked him what's what's wrong what's up and hamah said oh prophet of Allah when we are with you you remind us with paradise and what's in it you remind us with hell and what's in it and as if we can see it in broad daylight because we're taking it from The Source Allah but when we go out and return to our families and we sit with the wives and with the children and we look at our Farms we forget a lot all what you've reminded us it's going away from us Escaping The Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam smiled and said by Allah whom my soul is in his hands if you are with your families like you are with me here in the Masjid if you are in the with your family this is another word that the prophet said if you are in the with your family as you are with me in this Masjid by Allah the Angels would shook would shake hands with you on your beds and on the street meaning that you will be capable of seeing them in Broad day light but an hour and an hour what is this ambiguity an hour and an an hour everyone every Arab knows that an hour for Allah for remembering Allah for things that draw you closer to Allah and an hour to for recreation for entertainment for refreshing yourself and we've not gone into what is halal and what's Haram uh regarding entertainment but we're just setting the ground rules now when we come to talk about entertainment it is obvious that there is no competition there is no comparison and this is ground rule number three we as Muslims raise the White Flag why because we will never ever be able to compete with the non-muslim entertainment is this correct there is no way why because we have boundaries we have limits they don't their limit is the sky they can do anything they want as Muslims we are restricted to a certain area unfortunately it depends on your vision it depends how far you can see some of of us can only see the tip of their noses that is why they're bored they're fed up no I'd like to have that kind of Haram entertainment this is much more uh uh uh pleasing to myself I'd love to do this and I'd love to do that because it gives them temporary satisfaction but after a while it runs out so they seek something else and they seek something a third and a fourth I had a friend who before practicing he says I used to watch three to four movies a day DVDs and and cassettes he said the first movie I'm happy I'm having fun lots of racing cars and beating people and blood and you know it makes me feel like ramble he too too too thin and too skinny but he says after finishing it I feel like I can conquer the world after the movie is over he said I become depressed so I put another one and I'm happy and it finishes I become depressed and I put the third one after three movies are over I'm still depressed so I go out with the boys in the hood we just go to the malls and have fun and do this and do that six seven hours play cards do anything that do does not make us closer to Allah takes our minds away from Islam and when I come back home at or 9:00 in the evening I look at my mother and I tell her mother I'm fed up I'm bored she said Subhan Allah all day long you doing fun things watching movies out with the boys and you're bored does it say on my forehead I am bored every time you see me you say this why is that because the fun you get is temporary it's like drugs the minute you're on drugs you're high the minute you're off you have a problem you have an addiction and that is why it kills you not everything that gives you pleasure is good for you islamically our kind of entertainment is long-term we may not have the same satisfaction that is temporary and harmful but we have a form of satisfaction that is good for you and we will talk about this inshallah a while uh later now the trend with the people unfortunately everybody is not what it is meant to be people are not worshiping Allah Asel they were created to worship Allah but they're not doing this on the contrary the trend the norm is that you entertain yourself and you have a short portion whenever you have free time you use this free time to pray to do mandatory things it's not the other way around our lives are not built on the foundation of worshiping Allah our lives are built on the foundation of being entertained and this is what everyone seeks they believe that happiness comes only if I watch a standup comedy happiness comes only if I do something that involves Haram things and this is not what we are created for now in the Quran Allah Asel tells us that the norm that what you're supposed to do is to worship Allah full time and do not forget your entertainment do not forget your livelihood do not forget what benefits you but in the spare time Allah says in the Quran seek with that wealth which Allah has bestowed on you the home of the Hereafter this what said to whom this was said to whom I I'll recite it in Arabic so the Arabs this was said to Arun was one of the people of Musa who was filthy rich at the time they did not have Forbes so he was not ranked but he was extremely rich to the extent that the locks and the keys of the of of his treasury was carried by a number of men so Allah says seek with that wealth which Allah has bestowed on you the Hereafter or the home of the Hereafter and forget not your portion of legal enjoyment in this world so my life is based on worshiping Allah say that my prayers and my slaughtering or sacrifice and my life and death is for the sake of Allah so what kind of entertainment is permissible in Islam and what is not permissible permissible is we we'll give inshallah a criteria that you can judge what's permissible and what's not but the prophet himself did he entertain himself or was it always yeah prayer and fasting the prophet was a human being he was the perfect human being sallahu alaihi wasallam and his life was extraordinary precious in the and balanced and this balance is what a Muslim must try his level best to attain we have a problem and we've mentioned this before we have a problem in Balance you you're either a 100% scholar but you're poor and you don't have a penny in your pocket or you're 100% business man enrich with mansions and cars but you don't know the or you're in between but you have cholesterol high blood pressure diabetic and or you are good physically uh islamically and also financially but you don't know the names of your of your children who what's your name it's Muhammad Muhammad who I'm your son oh nice seeing you there are Muslims like this there are Muslims I know when you ask them mallah this is your son he said yes said what what uh year is he in school this is embarrassing I don't know do you know if he goes to school or not they don't know so we have to try our level best to get this balance that would make us inshallah perfect Muslims the prophet used to entertain himself and I'm going to give you simple examples I'm not going to take inall a long time doing so he as ja samur may Allah be pleased with him said that we used to sit with the prophet Alam and he would prolong his silence and he would not laugh a lot so we would in front of him sing poetry and remember the days of jilah we used to do this when we were not Muslims I remember doing this I had an idol I used to worship Him and after made of of dates I used to worship Him and pray for him when I got hungry I eat it and then I make it and the prophet Alam would smile he would join them but only by smiling he used to play with his grandchildren Hassan Hussein may Allah be pleased with them he used to make himself he used to walk in four and he put them on his back as if he is their mount or right and they used to enjoy it and he used to play with them sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam sometimes they would even prolong this Ledger time the time of playing to the extent when he's praying and prostrating making sujud they think that he is doing this for them and they come and mount him s alaihi wasallam and the prophet would prolong the suud until the companions raised their head thinking that he he's dead he couldn't there's no SJ this long and they would see alassan Hussein on his back and they he would go back to prayer again the prophet used to joke sallallahu alaihi wasallam our prophets used to joke and the companions used to wonder and say oh Prophet you're joking with us and he said yes but I do not say except the truth a woman an elderly woman in her 70s comes to the prophet and says oh prophet of Allah pray for me that I enter Jenna he said a woman old men old women don't enter Jenna and the woman started crying listen listen I didn't mean that you will not enter Jenna it is that Allah would restore you to be 33 years of age so no old women will be admitted to Jenna they will all become 33 years of age one of the companions jul he comes from behind him the prophet he was the ugliest companion so ugly that nobody agreed to give him in marriage until the prophet interceded and said give him in marriage he used to come from behind him and grab him and he says who buys this slave from me and the man does not doesn't know who's doing this and he looks and he finds the prophet Alat and then he turns he pushes himself back so that the prophet would not let go of him because he want to be close and touching the prophet Alam so the prophet is calling him slave he's a Slave a slave of Allah but he is playing with him this is the prophet with his companions his wife had dolls now imagine having dolls in the house of the Sheikh oh you're Infidel having dolls this is the prophet it's in his house and he permitted that why because this is part of the Halal entertainment for the children it is permissible for them to play with dolls and to have them and one of the Dolls was a horse with wings and the prophet said AA what is this a horse with wings she said yes didn't you know that suan had horses that used to fly look at how young she is she's saying the prophet didn't you know man he knows his brothers and of Messengers and Prophets but this is how his house was of course these dolls were not Barbie huh one would say is it is it permissible to buy my children my daughter's Barbie and I say no it's not because not because it's beautiful it's blonde it's nothing to do with that because it's a cultural trick Barbie come does not come alone huh Barbie comes with the boyfriend what's his name Kane and Kane they go to parties they go clubbing and he has a sports Corvette I think and she has a a whole wardrobe of bikinis and n and girls and and and and yeah dresses that are not befitting a Muslim girl so you want you don't want this to be your the idol of your daughter and this is not the topic anyhow um the prophet wasam used to allow in the Masjid the abans to play with their Spears you know when they play with their sticks and Spears it's a form of fighting he used to allow this kind of training in the Masjid now the Masjid has been transformed into something different now people don't want you to cough in the Masjid if you sneeze in the Masjid everybody's looking at you what did I do so don't make a noise the Masjid has to be quiet it's like a church if a if one of our children runs from this door to that door maybe six or seven of us would go and hang him in the chandelier or do something to him or you know cut him into pieces why if someone cries a child an infant of 8 n months old cries in the Masjid what happens especially the elders especially the like us H with with white beard after the Salah why are you doing this it's a child 8 months old and we storm the father the mother the Son and the Holy Ghost we storm them all anyone who got has this child why is this it's strong this is what what not what the prophet used to treat the Companions and this is not what the Masid was yes don't shout if you're an adult don't use it or abuse it or not treat the Masjid in a nice way don't talk about worldly things but the Masjid at the end of the day day if it's not for prayer it is can be utilized for some things that are not uh uh things that are befitting the Masjid the prophet used to allow the abans to play with their Spears not only that he used to allow may Allah please with her to put her chin on his shoulder to watch them because this is form of entertainment by the way would what the prophet us used to ask her are you through and she says no and after 5 minutes okay are you through and she says no why she said I wanted my co-wives all the wives of the Prophet to see me with the prophet Alam and eat your heart out so this is what she wanted them to feel she wanted them to feel jealous this is this go this is natural huh those who are blessed or menaced it depends on how you look at it with two wives or more they know that this is natural it comes with the territory you have to take it as it is the prophet used to race on race horses and he used to encourage the companions to do so and spend their times in racing horses he used to encourage the companions to use archery so nowadays we don't have archery if you can go to shooting gallery and uh uh I think it's they call it shooting gallery and you just go and train on shooting this is part of Islam this is part of the entertainment that they used to do there are so many things from the Sala not only the prophet wasam also the companions also the scholars that if I keep on telling you about the examples it would take us a long time Al bukari you know Al bukari we all know that he's the compiler compiler of theah the most authentic book after the Quran on Earth but what we did not know that he was the best Archer of his time so he was not only a compiler of Hadith his companions say that I've accompanied the bukari may Allah have mercy in his soul for so many years only once or twice he missed usually he no Robin Hood forget about Robin Hood this is the real bukari this is The Real McCoy and he used to be headon mallah on what he's doing and whenever he used to raise someone he was never beaten and this is one of the greatest Scholars of Islam so they had this balance in them they had the humor in them may Allah have mercy in his soul one of the IMs he was knowledgeable but he was funny you can say humorous he's always joking especially when it's obvious one man came to his Masjid and he asked where is the shabi and the shabi just went out and he was talking to a woman asking him a question so the man comes and says allum who is the sh he's asking the sh who's standing with a woman so he's asking who's shabi he says she is yeah if you're that blind if you're asking about me and there's only a male and a female who do you think it would be another one comes to him and says IM is allowed to rub his hand can I rub my hand if I'm in the state ofam the man said yes you can he said till when until when what kind of question is this so sh tells him until you see the bone keep keep doing it until you what so they had this humor in them another one comes to him and says oh Imam I have a problem what's your problem he said I got married said M he said yes but my wife after marriage I discovered that she limps shall I return her to her parents because she's limping sh says well if you want to race with her yes you may return her because a limping horse you cannot race with what are you asking about this is marriage you're not going to race with this one so they had this humor Islam is not a religion of grumpiness being always uh uh depressed so what are the guidelines that we can list to know whether this is halal entertainment or Haram entertainment well first of all anything you do to entertain yourself it but we're not going to go to Hal first anything you want to entertain yourself you should not have a lot of it you should avoid excessiveness why let's let's say for example um if we had and a big if we had uh um a place where we can play sports for example cricket and I had on my my Facebook when I announced the lecture and I said give us some IDs everybody saying cricket cricket cricket what's the cricket is Hal what's wrong they are Mah modestly dressed we don't have any uh shorts and it has no gambling it has no music attached to it and it's being played in times where prayer is not there so it's Hal but to have it in a lot of taking or consuming a lot of your time this is not permissible why is isn't it Halal yes but to spend so much time on it is not is Haram the evidence the prophet told us avoid excessive laughing avoid excessive laughter what's the meaning of excessive laughter laughing all the time why the prophet said because it kills the heart anything you do a lot that is not part of remembering Allah will cause your heart to die not physically not get a heart attack but when your heart dies you hear the verses of the Quran it doesn't move a thing you hear the prophet saying it doesn't affect you you pray those on in especially in Ramadan those on your right those on your left in front of you and behind you they're crying and you in yourself you say these guys are crazy where am I everybody's CRA am I in in a a prison these are definitely you know murderers and rapist and why are they crying you finish the prayer saying the people are crying I don't know what's wrong with them what's wrong is you your heart is dead that's why you're not being affected by the verses of the Quran their hearts are alive so you should avoid putting so much time on entertainment now with laughter I know people who spend money to laugh they buy standup comedies they go i' I've heard that they they had a standup comedy somewhere here or in the Gulf they PID like tickets for 500 R 700 r to watch people making fun of you are you that crazy Subhan Allah people just want to laugh and if you are in a gathering and you say Allah says so and so in the Quran everybody say we're not in a funeral please bring us another topic they don't want to hear Allah's name they don't want to hear a Hadith they want to hear anything that makes them laugh and this is a problem second uh uh secondly entertainment should not include anything Haram so someone tells me can I play computer games Nintendo uh Xbox uh Playstation 2 3 4 5 I don't know they have so many uh names and titles is it permissible and I say okay what are you playing says I'm playing uh football does it have music I can mute it so there's no music and you're playing uh in the men's league or females League this this is important said no no men's league said okay H go ahead no problem I had a brother coming to me asking me after J he's in his early 70s he's saying yes I love to watch sports uh uh Sports in general matches and so on but I like to watch female sports in particular you know basketball volleyball I love the sport I don't don't sport we all love the sport if it's like this this is har how can you look at said yeah but my intention your intention my with all due respect is has not has no value it is not permissible to do this because this includes Haram in itself so it should not involve Haram it should not involve Haram such as music one always people usually POS this question is music Haram everyone knows music is Haram how do you say music is Haram convince me convince you do you know Arabic said no how would you want me to convince you and those who knew know Arabic I'll tell them that there are three locations in the Quran where it's mentioned in Surah Al is verse 64 in Surah and in at the end ofah in theith inar the prophet says that there will come time that my nation people from my followers will make permissible fornication wearing of silk drinking of intoxicants and listening to musical instruments and this is in alari and also in there are overwhelming not only that the four schools of thought yeah you definitely hear either Hani Maliki shaf or H you cannot be one except one of those they they're consensus they all agree without no differences that listening to music is Haram hanafi school of thought is a little bit extreme they say if you listen to it this is sinful and you are a bad Muslim if you enjoy it you are a cafir this is too extreme no if you enjoy it you're not a CAF but this is what's stated by some of the Scholars of the Hani maab so music is Haram without any doubt if I had the smallest iota of doubt in it I would be the first to listen to it if I had this much room I would be the first one to listen to it but it's Haram Allah said it's Haram the prophet said it's Haram we have reached a conclusion if you have entertainment that includes nudity people say I'd like to play Mortal combat and there are two or three girls in there not very decently dressed but they're good Fighters so can I so no these are cartoons she cartoons even cartoons are Haram you cannot look at the opposite sex because now you look at the cartoons tomorrow you're going to look at the real thing so this is also not permissible it if it includes mockery if it includes backbiting if it includes uh uh uh pretending or mimicking others so you find someone I say I'm going to act like shik so and so or I'm going to talk like this politician or that making things up all of this is Haram as a Muslim you cannot watch and you cannot uh have this of course it goes without saying uh yeah movies soap opras all of this that a lot of the Muslims think think that they would die I met a a young a youngster and I was talking to him his English Mah was good so I was telling him your English is mAh good where where do you get this he watching movies mhall do you know that watching movies is Haram said yeah I've heard this but I cannot if I don't watch a movie I'm going to die but Subhan Allah if this is one of the greatest weapons that we can direct to Israel we boycott them and we tell them that you don't get any movies to Israel and they'll die what is this a Muslim dies if he does not watch a movie people's lives are based on this some of the brothers not practicing they work and they work for 10 hours they do everything they can do only to come back at the end of the day to relax and sit with the remote control and watch a movie or watch a soap opra or one of the these Series this is what they live for and this is not what Allah has created it for Allah created it to worship him so um among uh the things that must be in halal entertainment is it should not lead to something Haram in itself it's Halal but it may lead to something Haram then it becomes Haram such as if you play cricket but during the match it's m time and you will not pray you want to continue and finish the the game this becomes Haram because it by itself it's Halal but because it's leading to something Haram then it becomes Haram um for example Facebook what's you reading on Facebook one of the brothers told me to write this what's the ruling on Facebook voice Facebook generally speaking is a good thing if you use it for good things but the majority of the Muslims who are involved in Facebook use it for Haram things especially I was shocked sometimes I get a remark from uh uh the brothers on one of my posts so I feel strange about this remark so I click it and then I go into the brother's page and then I see his posts and I'm shocked and then Shan comes and says says look at his photos just to see if he's a practicing brother you open the photos and say and you immediately close it a lot of the Muslims women men into Facebook they're exposing their sin they're showing it to the people listen yeah I know my brother is a good brother he's a good practicing friend we pray in the Masjid once I go to his Facebook I say I didn't know that he was that bad I went into some youngsters and it says interest interest what does he say women in the Facebook in the info interest women I went to some of the sisters interest men what is this and you look at the photos I went to one I know and I've seen uh Christmas 2011 parties liquor booze dance ing mixing and he's all exposing it the prophet says on the day of judgment all my will be forgiven except those who do not conceal their sins Allah conceals your sin in the evening you wake up the prophet says and you wake up in the morning and you tell your friend didn't you know yesterday I did this and this so he exposes Allah the sins that he concealed it over him and that is why Allah will never forgive you if you do your sins on your own in your house no one knows about it inshallah Allah will forgive you inshallah but don't continue huh don't make it a habit I've been doing this for 40 years nobody knows about my sins no you have to have remorse you have to have fear of Allah I mean if you feel weak and make a sin this is inshallah part of the things forgiven it should not lead to Haram this is number three I think but there are so many sports that we love a brother was asking me what's the ruling on base jumping you know what's Bas jumping is they wear the parachutes and they throw themselves from a cliff not from an airplane this is more dangerous because the height and the the the the they're close to the to the uh the mountains or to the buildings another one is asking what's ruling on jumpy uh what called bung bung jumping you crazy you tie yourself with a a rubber band and you see yourself going it's going to stop it's going to stop it's going to it didn't stop oops sorry malfunction this is not this is Haram say the sh come on this is fun the adrenaline is is there is pumping and I it's Haram because you're throwing Yourself In Harm's Way parachuting is Haram except for those who are using it or training it for Jihad for example because you want to gain this skill but to throw yourself just for the fun of it there are fatalities there are people who die because of this Islam doesn't allow you to throw yourself In Harm's Way uh likewise Formula 1 racing one says I'd like to race cars this is a waste of money and this brings us to criteria number four that what ever entertains you must not involve extravagant and wasting money so it might be Halal in itself it might be uh little not so much and it has no Haram in it but because of the money involved the wastage of money it becomes Haram one says that I'd love to uh do y y tracing y tracing is only have you need like half a million dollar or a million dollar and buy a that's it time alhamdulillah is is is being consumed I pray on time no music no nudity what what about the money you're throwing one says I'm an items uh collector's item I love to gather a lot of collector's items so I have this car which is $3 million it's uh 70 years old it doesn't run but it's it's a collector items I have this vase I have this so and so this is entertainment you're entertained by it but it is Haram entertainment because you you're wasting Allah's this is not your money so I worked hard for it you worked hard when you were born you did not hear you did not see you could not understand so it's not your money it's Allah has given you the knowledge it's giving you the sight and the hearing and the heart to understand and comprehend so you have to uh accordingly nowadays unfortunately the types of entertainment we have are overwhelming there are movies theaters soap operas TV series music shows that are maybe not here alhamdulillah yet but I pray to Allah that it will not be here permanently but if you go abroad you'll find that it's an evening to go and listen to to the Oprah people shouting and you don't understand anything but you have to be a little bit you know sophisticated show them yes it was a nice Opera what was it about I don't know men and women shouting and throwing things at each other they have the theater they have the the movie uh uh Cinemas the Blockbusters this is their life for us Muslims we have our own unique life that we should always attain Sports what what's the ruling on sports sports is Hal providing that it falls under the four criteria mentioned above so let's take any sport give me a sport tennis tennis if you play tennis I go and play tennis with my brothers is this okay yes I go I I play tennis myself no problem but you have to watch out for the so if someone wears a short this is Haram he should Expo he should cons uh cover his thigh a man's thigh is this is the most authentic opinion and nowadays alhamd the shorts of the game tennis is to the knees even the Nadal and and and what's his name they all wear mallah Islamic shorts let's let's hope inshallah they grow a beard and become Muslim what else football football is halal providing you don't harm people I know people when they play football they're only good in breaking people's legs they don't see the ball they see only the other players legs and they keep on hitting and breaking this is Haram but if a group of brothers gather and play football together islamically mallah you give your ball to the other say and you throw it to may Allah bless you and if you're running uh behind the other play team's player you say stop and give me the ball can use Islamic terminology this is mallah becomes good not to that extent but it's there so this is permissible now when you come to something like martial arts is it permissible yes it's permissible providing that you don't harm others and you don't hit the face islamically you're not allowed to hit the face period neither in spiring nor in uh uh uh competitions training or or you have you avoid the face so if you play Tean do if you play karate uh uh shano whatever if you play kung fu avoid the face if you play grabbling uh uh uh games such as jiujitsu or aido or haido or whatever they call them or Judo all of this is okay but don't harm because these involve a lot of locks and and and and and breaking the joints and they is choking and you can practice but you cannot implement this on a Muslim a brother sent me an email last night said she I I know the ruling of of martial arts but we compete against kafer so it's okay you could when you compete against a cfir in a competition are you entitled to kill him say no no no but it's the game but I can break his nose I can you know choke him but what about if he does this to you a har subh you will stop him and say listen I'm a Muslim you're not allowed to do this you're it's okay for me no this is not at all yeah acceptable because you are in this competition in a form of friendship and you don't have any islamically involved and this is not permissible in Islam so it depends on what kind of sports you're playing the sisters can play Sports yes they can't play sports it's Hal but providing that no brothers no men can look so if they play and and the and the sport should be the sport should be good for them yeah if if a if a sister wants to for example uh uh play skiing she wants to ski water ski well she's going to wear the hijab masah and big Aba andah is flying behind her and she's skiing in the middle of of the of the sea this is not acceptable she plays games that are suitable to her feminine side to uh uh her nature and this is inshallah halal parts of the entertainment that is Haram and with it I conclude inshallah my talk which a lot of the Muslims love to watch wrestling I was talking to one of the boys in a in a gym here and he said do you know this this and that I said no I don't and he said now I did this in India and I did it in England in a Masjid and everybody was laughing I said is it possible that I'm the only ignorant one apparently this is a move that one of the wrestlers usually uh does he's very famous he's CF but this youngster his yeah Idol the one he looks up to is this man and he so he loves him so much and he knows did you see what he he did with this and that he giving me names masallah and I told this youngster he's 16 years old and I told him do you know the name of the 10 Heavenly Bound in Islam the 10 who the prophet died said Abu Bakr said no no not said not even yeah something like this B he doesn't know them but when it comes to wrestling uh uh uh what do you call them stars to movie stars to celebrities everybody knows about them and we have a problem and it's a big problem wrestling is not means of entertainment it's Haram for you to watch if it's not for the if it's not for the costumes and it's not only the thighs it goes up to more more than that if it's not only for the hour if they were properly dressed it's still Haram because all whom you see are usually Americans and this is part of the brainwashing that they do so even if it's a you know someone who's like this high but because he's wrestling if you see him tomorrow in the street you'll be terrified why oh this is a wrestler he will do me the super Superfly snooker whatever move or he will jump from the ropes and he will do this and that what is this it's brainwashing no you have to have your dignity you have to have your Islam entertain yourself in Fashions or means that are permissible likewise wrestling we have bull fights we have fights we have pitbull fights even dogs fight whatever all of this is Haram islamically and I hope that I know that the topic needs a lot a lot to discuss about but inshallah this would [Music] suffice Muhammad"
