  "transcript": "did the prophet discourage uh the poor from begging from soliciting from asking uh whatever means they do it I mean even the wealthy the most wealthy persons that we admire the most are politicians in the US election process they're going around asking people to give them money and many of them like the current US president is a is a wealthy man but he's going around asking for money it's very different kind of money that the needy are asking for uh did the prophet uh peace be upon Him discourage the needy from asking for money for begging the prophet Alat prohibited a Muslim from humilating himself and ask others companions say that we gave the pledge of allegiance to the prophet Alam to obey him and not to ask anyone for anything the companions say that a man would be riding on his camel or his ride and his whip Falls from his hand he would not ask the the pedestrians to hand him that whip he would Dismount take it himself and get back on his ride the prophet saidat that it is best for one of you to take a rope and collect wood for fire firewood yeah from the Jung from the forest from uh uh the outskirts and put it in a a pile on his back and sell it rather than begging people may they may give and they may not I I appreciate you making that claric you it's not just that he discouraged it you said the prophet peace be upon Him prohibited indeed the in the other Hadith which is scary the prophet said Alam one of you may continue to beg people until on the day of judgment he would come without meat in his face so in the day of Resurrection when you can see one another and you see someone without meat without Flesh on his face because he had spilled all his dignity and honor honor in this life by begging people this is how we would recogn him on the day of judgment so definitely this is sinful this is Haram and it's uh uh indignify to a person to beg and extend his hand in the Quran Allah tells us that the upper hand is better than the lower hand so the giving hand is far greater than the lower one which what kind of guidelines should we follow in terms of interacting with people on who are needy who approach us and ask us for money uh some are very clever and are they recognize this guidance from the prophet peace be upon them and they have done the equivalent of collecting wood and selling it maybe it's a packet of Kleenex tissue maybe it's a mint to put in the tea maybe it's whatever uh if they're not doing that and they're just asking for money which should be the correct which should be our response see people differ sometimes we tend to be judges we tend to be uh um Sherlock Holmes or Columbo or uh whatever investigating you want money why where how much do you uh own show me your bank account where do you live and this scrutiny May spoil your charity and others may give without even thinking now those who give will be rewarded no doubt in that even if the recipient is not needy so participating in something that prohibited by the prophit by giving money Prophet says don't beg but if they come to me and I give you are rewarded without any doubt however it is like telling you I have an investment that if you invest $10 it will generate 100 and I have another investment if you invest $10 it will generate generate a million which one will you choose higher the million and this is exactly when it comes to people begging from you he said I'm going to give because I'm going going to be rewarded so here is 50 yes but if you kept this 50 lb and looked for real needy people a widow an orphan someone who people do not recognize and give it to him would this would would be equivalent to the million rather than the 100"
