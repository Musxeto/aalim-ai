  "transcript": "foreign huh it took us a while to talk about the night journey of the prophet salam to jerusalem and from there to the seventh heaven heavens of allah azzawajal once this miraculous night journey ended the prophet salallahu went back to makkah and it was still nighttime so it only took two or three hours but he had seen what would probably be enough for a lifetime he came back feeling the comfort and the faith in him that reached its optimum he felt satisfied of getting the revelations of allah he felt insured after meeting the messengers and prophets of allah and being greeted by them and welcomed as a brother and as a son he came back and he told his people told his followers and told everyone that was around him that he had made this night journey and that it took place in these few hours the whole of mecca heard about this and the pagans almost fell to the backs with laughter of this incredible but unbelievable story that prophet muhammed is telling him telling them some of the muslims that had weak belief and iman soon rejected islam and died as non-muslims because they could not comprehend and understand because they did not have any faith and belief other muslims believed it but still they were not that sure of it because it was so incredible and unbelievable except abu bakr may allah be pleased with him the minute that someone came to him and told him that haven't you heard what your friend says haven't you heard what your companions say so he told them what was it the man told him that he claims that he has been resurrected to the heavens and came back passing by uh jerusalem in one night and less than even one night immediately abu bakr's response was as true i believe him and they were astonished how do you believe such a thing he told them come on this is logical if i believe that news and instructions from heavens from allah azza come to him immediately in matter of seconds don't you want me to believe that he went to jerusalem and to the heavens and one night and came back definitely i believe him and from then he was known to be abu bakr which means the one that believes the pagans wanted to make the best of this because first they knew they knew that the prophet had never traveled to jerusalem in his life so among them were merchants who've been to jerusalem for for a number of times and of course one of the greatest structures in jerusalem is the mosque the holy mosque of al-aqsa so they wanted to test the prophet alaihis allah they told him we're going to ask you questions so answer them if you had been to jerusalem as you claim and the prophet sallam felt a little bit worried because he had had seen the place but he did not go around it and aside seeing many places that we go to when asked to describe it it's difficult it's hard but to his comfort allah azzawajal told him not to worry and he revealed the holy mosque of al-aqsa to our prophet as if it's in front of him so they started asking him about little details that only people living there know and the prophet sallam was looking at it in front of him and he is describing every single thing the doors the windows the mattresses the number of windows the number of windows the number of windows number of doors every single thing that no one would take notice of even if he went there 10 or 15 or 20 times the prophet sam saw it in front of him would that be enough to convince the pagans no it wasn't they still insisted on not believing him so the prophet alaihis gave them another example of his truth by saying on my way back we saw a caravan being led by so and so and he named the leader of that caravan coming from a sham coming from the north of arabia and while coming back they lost one of their camels and they were trying to locate that camel and bring him bringing him back and they did and the first camel on this caravan his colors are so and so and he looks so and so he give gave them a detailed description of that caravan not only that the caravan left mecca about 40 nights ago and it takes about one month to go and another one to return so the prophet estimated when where he saw them and he told them that they will arrive to mecca on that particular night the night of so and so and the pagans anticipated that the given date and exactly on the same night that the prophet sallam told them the caravan entered mecca with the camel that was described to them by the prophet leading that caravan so they had no other choice but to believe in the story that the prophet sallam told them yet they still insisted with their arrogance not to accept what the prophet alaihis salatu had said going back to our story to the seerah of the prophet this night journey has increased his faith more than it was though it was in the optimum but it gave them a a vote of confidence that he was on the right track the prophet sallallahu sallam though was under the protection of nadi in still wanted to look for a city a village a place that where he would be able to migrate to and find a peace of mind and find the freedom to call to allah azzawajal without any body interrupting him he kept on presenting his religion to the people in the pilgrims or in the pilgrimage season and also the arabs had what they call markets or bazaars they used to join and gather there for uh the case of poetry buying and selling they had this market of akav or of that majaz and majinna and so on these sooks were attended by a lot lots of the tribes of arabia and the prophet sallam used to go to them and present his case hoping that someone would become a muslim and give him protection on and on he used to go ali until it was the eleventh year from the first revelation given to our prophet on the pilgrims uh occasion on that occasion of pilgrimage the season of pilgrimage came men from the tribe of al-khazraj and these men were six but they came from medina which was then called yathrib it was a 500 kilometer city away from makkah but it was a village but it was a city known for farming and known with the bravery of not of the bravery of its men unfortunately not a while ago the two main tribes of yathrib had a clash had a very big and serious war of bohat and the house and the hazraj fought together for a very long time 40 years maybe 40 years a lot of the people died yeah the house had the prevailing hand and the majority of dead were from both sides but from the hajjraj at most and in the same city or village there was a number of jews that came ages and ages ago the khazraj going for pilgrimage they were talking when the prophet sallam heard them so he sought the permission to speak and present his case so they accepted him and the minute the prophet salallahu sallam spoke they knew that he was saying the right thing that he was a messenger and a prophet of allah how did they know that the jews whenever they had any clash with the arabs they used to threaten them and tell them soon a messenger of allah will come and we will fight you under his flag and we will annihilate you we will execute each and every one of you and they kept on repeating this repeating this until the arabs knew that there definitely there will be a messenger coming and the jews will fight with him will fight the arabs under his flag so the minute these six men heard the message of the prophet allah and they heard the verses of the quran they knew that this man is telling the truth and that he is a messenger of allah we do have a short break so please stay tuned and insha allah we will be right back if you're 18 or if you're 18 if you've been muslim for 50 years or five minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day i've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people that are muslims we want to serve allah almighty with all our hearts in this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve allah we'll have studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you met those firs fortunate six men coming from yatrib from the tribe of al-khazraj they were fortunate to be among the first to accept islam they were fortunate to have met the prophet alaihis was they were fortunate because they were so tired of the wars that have claimed so many lives from their tribe and from the other tribe in yathrib or medina which was called the house they needed someone to unify them and to make these feuds and wars stop and come to the end to an end once they heard from the prophet his presentation of his religion once they heard the holy quran being recited to them they believed immediately that there is only one god and that the prophet sallam is his messenger and servant they immediately turned to him they have accepted his call and the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam asked them to give him the pledge of allegiance and this was called which is the first pledge of allegiance of al-aqba and what did the prophet sallam ask them to do he simply as we were told by one of the companions of the prophet allah the pledge of allegiance was to believe in allah and not to associate any other with him and not to steal not to steal and not to for fornicate and not to kill your own children whether because of the fear of poverty or because of the fear of shame and we have something nowadays that people call shame killing or the killing that is caused by feeling ashamed of something in this they claim when a woman goes out with a man of course this is forbidden in islam her family the brothers and the fathers go and kill her they assassinate her and this is not permissible in islam so the prophet says alai salazar that the pledge of allegiance that you do not kill your children and you do not present or come forward with something that is false and also the prophet allah is took their pledge of allegiance not to disobey him in whatever good things he instruct them to do and and this is a very important criteria the prophet sallam was not asking them to do something that was evil there is a hadith where the prophet says al-salam that obedience is only in marouf obedience can happen and must happen only in things that are good and this also applies to him who does not ask us to do anything except and once they accepted this accepted islam and gave the prophet sallam their pledge of allegiance the prophet sent with them one of his companions he was a companion but what was he famous of the ambassador he is known to be the first ambassador in islam because he went to medina but before islam ibn amer was one of the most handsomest the most handsome person young man in quraysh among the pagans he came from a noble family his family was a rich one and he was very very elegant and handsome to the extent that whenever he passed by an alley hours later people would know that he passed there from his perfumes the people of mecca used to ask to wash his laundry for him so that they would mix it up with their own clothes and the perfume in it would become like something to make spread the perfume to their dirty clothes when it becomes white and clean again this man was among the elite of the youth every woman in mecca wanted to marry him because of his elegance because of his uh wealth and because he was a handsome man the minute converted to islam his mother waged a full-scale war on him she immediately stopped all the financing he used to get and he didn't care he didn't mind all what he was interested in was to be with the prophet in a number of years was completely transformed to another person it was reported though in an unauthentic hadith that the prophet sallam saw him being carried between two men because of the weaknesses because he was so weak of his weakness he was carried between two men and his skin almost fell off because of the dry atmosphere and the lack of nourishment and food that he used to get they were surrounded you remember in for so long the prophet looked at him and said subhanallah look at the difference between 5 10 years ago and between now but nevertheless is one of the greatest companions of the prophet salatu was salaam who was knowledgeable with the quran to medina with these six men so that he would spread the message of allah to prepare the floor for him to come and to see their acceptance to uh this great religion of islam though was so wealthy when he was young when he died it was so tragic in one ins in one case or hadith may allah be pleased with him was fasting and then just as it was sunset the break for him to break his fast he was presented with some food and just about to break his fast he started crying and he left the food he was fasting for 15 hours 14 hours and now he's crying he's unable to eat so his family told him what's wrong he said i remembered musa ibm who died who died in the battle of uhurt muslim ramayana was one of the richest men in arabia when he died in uh we tried to wrap him up so that we can bury him we could not find anything except the garment that was on his body when we covered his face his feet showed and when we covered his feet his face showed he is better than i am and now he's dead and now i'm here sitting and eating by allah i think that allah is giving us our good deeds in this life and those who were better than us allah azza accepted them as martyrs and he he kept on weeping and crying and left the food this is allah be pleased with him went with these six men to medina and he started to spread the word of islam mosab stayed at the house of assad evan zurara now assad was a muslim and both of them were so keen on calling others to islam that they were really active you know it was not a nine-to-five job it was their obsession to call people to islam so whenever there was a possibility to make dawah they would immediately approach it and go to make tawa to people calling them to islam their call was a success and the people of medina knew that there were there was this stranger from mecca who is delivering tawa and spreading the message of the prophet salaam usa went to call the people for islam and they stayed with them at one of uh uh the gardens or one of uh the places there so sad brahmat who was the head of his tribe bani abdul ashad and he was from the house he was the head though he was about 30 28 years old that he was a very gallant and strong warrior he talked to us and told him usaid go to assad and to musab and kick them out of our city if it weren't for assad i would have done this myself but assad happens to be my cousin is saying to us i cannot go and talk back to assad because he is my cousin so you go instead and you talk to mossab and assad and tell them to stop what they're doing so usaid also a strong warrior took his spear and went to the two to talk to them and the minute he came in and as i had saw him as i had told musab this is a master of his tribe and he is a strong warrior so be careful in what you say to him because if he reverts to islam then this is a great victory wasab said it's all in a day's work no no problem what we're doing is doing for the sake of allah so i have no problem and the minute usaid walked in he put his spear in the floor and started shouting swearing yelling at them what are you doing you know accusing them of things and they were so calm they did not do anything to affect that they were trying to show the people unfortunately our story has to come to an end but insha allah i promise you that next time we meet we will go over it again and take the fruits out of such stories until then allah um"
