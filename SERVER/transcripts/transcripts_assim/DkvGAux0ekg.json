  "transcript": "roach's second question is if someone has urine incontinence meaning that he's always dripping so such a person no matter how many times he performs wudu his voodoo breaks so what can such a person do scholars say that after the adhan of every prayer he performs wudhu cleans himself of course changes his soiled clothes and performs wudu and prays that prayer and whatever require is required will do such a stuff for example for those who say that woodward is required for tawaf then he can with that wudhu perform tawaf hold the quran etc now once the time of that particular salat is expired whether by the other prayers time being due or if it's like asia by midnight if he were to pray again another prayer he has to perform mudu so you cannot perform mudo for maghrib when you have your incontinence and then when we reach isha you continue to read isha with it because you have urine incontinence you have to clean yourself and perform a new wudu and i hope this answers his question you"
