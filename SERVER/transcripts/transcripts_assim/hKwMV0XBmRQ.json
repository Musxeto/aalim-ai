  "title": "Was religious in Shaban but commits sins in Ramadan & does not feel remorse, what to do",
  "transcript": "Ummi Muna from Bangladesh What this person should do, this is a very strange question. He's sane, he's an adult, he has the choices on the table. He chooses not to make ibadah, he chooses to commit sin and enjoy it, he's choosing not to repent and to come back to Islam properly. What should he do? This is his choice. You have two roads in front of you. One leads you to paradise, one leads you to hell. It's your problem. You can't just sit back and say, it's my OCD, I don't know what to do, I am forced to do this. No, you're not forced to do this. If someone comes to you and punches you in the face, takes your wallet and your money and says, sorry, I'm forced to do this, would you set him free? Or you will fight with him and call the police? This is not logical at all. You cannot blame anyone for your sins and your lack of ibadah other than yourself. You're the only one to be blamed. Even shaytan, you cannot blame him. Because Allah says in the Quran that shaytan would say on the day of judgment in hellfire, I had no control over you except to call you and you responded and answered me. So don't blame me, rather blame yourselves. I'm not going to benefit you and you're not going to benefit me. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal. I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
