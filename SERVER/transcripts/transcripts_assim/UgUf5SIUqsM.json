  "title": "Divorce does not take place without INTENTION | assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sadiqa from Bangladesh First of all, when you ask your husband or you state to your husband, if you don't provide for me, I'm going to file for a divorce, this means that you have the intention and the willingness to break the marriage. This is not normal. It's not normal for a wife to go and address her husband in such a fashion. Nevertheless, the word divorce has to be accompanied by intention. In the sense that if I, for example, was giving a lecture in the masjid and among the audience is my wife and I'm discussing the chapter that deals with marriages, divorces, custody and the likes. And I come to the chapter that deals with divorce and I'm teaching the students and say that so if a man says to his wife, if I say to my wife, I divorce you, this is a clear statement of divorce. So if I say I divorce you or you are divorced, then the divorce takes place. My wife cannot jump and say, Alhamdulillah, he divorced me three times. He says, I divorce you, I divorce you, you're divorced. So now I'm final, finally I'm divorced. This was like a life sentence. Whoo, let's go. So wait, hold your horses. What are you doing? She said, you divorced me. And I asked the students, did I divorce her? Every single one would say, of course not Sheikh, you were teaching us the phrases of divorce and we were dealing with fiqh issues. So this is not a divorce and what your husband said, this is not a divorce. He was just merely repeating what the Sheikh had said on the video. And also when he asked you to ask or to file for divorce, this is not initiating divorce. This is what you said and he said, if you want to get a divorce, get a divorce. But he did not say, I divorce you. Likewise intentions, if a husband says to his wife, I will divorce you. Next week, I will divorce you. This is not a divorce, it's something in the future. Divorce has to be in the present tense or in the past tense and Allah knows best."
