  "transcript": "ald may peace blessing and mercy of Allah be upon all of us today alhamdulillah although we are reaching like lunch inshallah in few hours but I can see the hall is fulled let us express our harest gratitude towards Allah the almighty due to his will and permission we are able to gather here with the international eminent Scholars to unravel to discuss a very pertinent issue ladies and gentlemen everyone of us here tested different some of us are tested with children some of us are tested with M with properties some of us are tested with spouses we are be tested differently so this topic today we are going to unravel that particular issue in Malaysian context for example as the audience can see the statistics one of out eight one in eight of Malaysian population has Suicidal Thoughts one in 10 attempted suicide this is from the survey of Mobility Health survey by the Ministry of Health involving our younger generation because of what because of the effect of the trials and tribulation this is in Malaysian context what about our relative our brothers and sisters in Palestine up to today 14,775 how are you shik alhamdulillah alhamdulillah then yeah maybe the mic is working testing testing yeah alhamdulillah alhamdulillah me to press a little bit let me check yeah it's good okay maybe you can it's working maybe that is is working can you guys hear us no no okay maybe we they will change the mic ald and on the fur the left our masallah shimamu alikum good masallah so his voice better than me with a mic inshallah ladies and gentlemen to start our discussion I want to direct the first question to shik Muhammad Salah sh Muhammad Salah in Malaysian context when we talk about FNA the term FNA in Malaysian context usually refers to deformation slander and Etc so maybe we want to know the terminology based on Quran when Quran mentioned abouta when Quran mentioned about FNA what is the context that we are talking about please sh let me address first before we start this is a pure conversation about test and trials so no jokes you stop make me l laughing while we're talking about test and trials okay the word FNA was mentioned in the Quran as sometimes an ambiguous word has have various meanings so it refers to test and trials indeed your wealth and your children are but trials tests and trials Allah is testing you with your wealth and with your children or in both of them and also it is mentioned so sometimes the fitna refers to when the person is tested in his faith sometimes it refers to causing Discord and sing the ties between the Believers and sometimes referring to tests and trials pertaining to wealth Children Health you name it the almighty Allah stated in Surah chapter number 21 verse number [Music] [Music] 35 so the the word FNA is mentioned in this verse as well when the almighty Allah summarize the story of life and death simply by saying every soul shall taste death then the almighty Allah swear using the letter wow which is for Alam Allah is saying I swear and Theon and the lamb for or confirmation most certainly we shall try you between life and death with the following we most certainly shall try you with what is evil in and with what is good in order to test you so the word fitna here in verse number 35 chapter number 21 confirms the meaning of being at test and a trial but it adds a very important addition which is that tests and trials not only with sickness or poverty or the loss of loved ones as it is mentioned in verse number 155 chapter number two but it also could be by what looks like a blessing so poverty is a test and richness is a test having children is a test and being deprived from having children is a test sickness is a test and health and fitness is a test as well each and everyone most certainly will be tried but our tests and trials will be different in variant though mashallah M very good explanation so we can see that in any of the blessings in any of the things that Allah give to us either good or bad both can be considered as a test as mentioned in Surah chapter number 21 verse number 35 just now so now I want to direct my next question to our respected shim uh dear dear shim Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is described as the most merciful the most loving 100 of times in the Quran some might be struggling to understand this concept because mentioned just now it can be good it can be bad so they were asking they were questioning was saying that if Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is so merciful so loving but at the same time Allah punishes so they can't see the understanding of it so is it that when Allah become most merciful or not Allah cannot punish they couldn't see a contradictory position of Allah subhana tala how do we make make them clear what first of all we have to believe and understand the beautiful names and attributes of Allah and without doing so you will fall into a lot of problem s and confusion Allah is most merciful most compassionate most forgiven subhanahu the kind however he is also the most knowledgeable the wise and he owns this whole whole universe and he does what he pleases and what he wills and as mentioned in nobody dares to question or interrogate Allah Asel While others are investigated interrogated and questioned so if you understand this concept and and believe it you will have content in your heart you will never say why does Allah do this or that yeah it's none of a business Allah owns the whole universe you have no right if I take 50 rings and I burn it nobody dares and say why do you do this I think your currency is waterproof uh fireproof I don't know I never tried it but maybe we should give it a shot if I do this this is my money I could do whatever I want with it and Allah has the highest of all examples now we know that Allah is knowledgeable and wise and just and fair so whatever he does you have to digest this and believe in it a young child and Allah has the highest of all examples goes to the doctor with his father the doctor says you have appendix we have to extract it the young child 7 years of age looks at his father and the father says everything is going to be all right they take the child to prepare him for surgery they strip him out of his clothes they start to uh uh disinfect here disinfect the area and the the child looks at his father duh said it's okay everything's going to be fine they take him to the operating theater and he sees people with masks oxygen and and and anesthesia and the doctor gets his knife and starts sharpening it I don't know if it's or not but something close yeah you you get the point the the son's dad this is not good and the father says it's all right you have to trust your father's judgment because he knows more than you and Allah has the highest of all examples without night you you can never appreciate sun light without illness you can never appreciate your health without feeling hungry you could never appreciate the taste of food and without calamities you could never appreciate the blessing of Iman huh how many calamities returned us back to Allah if not we would have gone astray and in indulged in this dun and did everything left right and center but Allah returns us back to him sometimes an illness a sickness a disease an operation gets you back on track so many people come to me and say sh Allah blessed me with cancer so may Allah bless you alone is why he said I was indulged in partying womanizing doing drugs but when I got the cancer I returned back to Allah and I saw the light so these calamities can be one of the greatest blessings of Allah I remember in 1990 when the Bosnian war was ongoing in Bosnia HOV I met few people from Bosnia and they said wall the war is one of the greatest blessings of Allah we returned back to Islam we were not Muslims so so everything that Allah does w he does it with wisdom with knowledge and with complete fairness and for your own good all the tests and trials that our Prophet Muhammad alaih wasam went through they were all for his benefit and he was content he was happy with whatever was happening because he knows that he is in good hands and Allah knows best mashallah alhamdulillah very good I like the example when the doctors is sharpening the blade you know maybe the child was thinking is it is it doctor or butcher you know this shows to us that some things that assume to be bad there are good things behind it for a doctor in order to do surgery he must cut the body to remove the tumor or the cancer and I'm also asking blessing from Allah not to be from cancer inshallah um another questions very pertinent questions I want to direct to sh Muhammad Salah um Sheik we were talking about the issue of suicide which is one of the effect of like feeling hopelessness and committing suicide according to W one every 40 second someone in the world committed suicide and in in the Muslim World there are cases although we are less compared to the non-muslim but yet we have that 10 cases out of 100,000 population and if you want to relate this to a particular Hadith of a sahaba t when he was mentioning about another sahaba cutting his fingers and when he was resurrected when he saw in the dream that sahaba was forgiven but without the finger so putting this all in context how is the view of committing suicide because of Hope hopelessness how you respond to this Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala blessed me and I travel the world by the grace of Allah and I came to realize that the most advanced societies the societies where the living standard is the highest they have the highest rate of suicide Japan Sweden people in Sweden as I was filming there I thought this is heaven on Earth you know and people don't have to worry about earning or Finance because if you're not making money the government will take care of you we give you housing a louns welfare very decent life the nature everything around you is so beautiful what will make a person think about taking his or her life while they have everything but they don't have Allah they don't have God in the lives so that is a secret brothers and sisters when one is not connected to the almighty Allah then he's connected to Shan he's connected to the evil thoughts and here allow me to differentiate as I always like to do between two conditions one which is a clinical medical condition either pschological or psychiatric condition where the person is going through psychosis or depression or you know severe depression or Mania they don't know what they're doing they're forgiven may Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala give them shifa and may Allah spare them and protect them by the way whether they are Muslims or non-muslims so this is a different condition but the other condition is what we're handling right now a condition of a person in his or her uh full uh sense of mind they understand what they are doing but you hear that um you know a girl took her life and she's only 17 why I was living in the states and it was normal to see some of my our students at the schools or at the universities why did she take her life because her boyfriend broke up with her you know she saw him cheating on her and things of this nature very silly very insignificant and the reason is not the only thing which is insignificant life itself is insignificant that's why it's easy to take the lives listen and enjoy how the messenger of Allah peace be upon Him describes the condition of a Believer who perceives the concept of of tests and trials as a blessing whether it's a cancer whether it's a divorce whether it's a loss of a loved one a Believer would perceive it so whether he or she knows the reason behind it or the hikma is totally concealed in the said how amazing is the condition of a Believer he's always in a good condition whether he is tested or whether he's enjoying his life without any SS and trials for a certain period of time he said [Music] he said a Believer who's always in a good condition whenever Allah blesses him with a bestows upon him a blessing he is grateful he knows what to do he he's been promoted he got married he received the child immediately he makes he bows down in prostration and says alhamdulillah with his heart full of joy and happiness and appreciation to Allah believing as Allah the almighty said in if you're grateful I shall give you more and if he's tested with something which is harmful bad loss of properties loved ones uh sickness whatever he is patient he endures a calamities patiently then he added s Al wasallam and no one behaves like that but a Believer he didn't say but a Muslim rather he used the higher term which is a Believer and in order to achieve this level of satisfaction even whenever you're Afflicted with something which is harmful you have to study you have to learn the concept of balah in the Quran you have to know that wasallam said the most severely tested people on Earth are the prophets not the wicked how many kids did Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam I have how many kids eight seven right six out of the seven died in his life you know I didn't talk about him being orphan before even he was born and at the age of five losing his mother then at the age of eight losing his grandfather what is this the most severely tested people on Earth are the prophets then whom the Believers every everyone will be tested and his test will be in proportion with the level of his or her IM if Allah wants to do good to somebody he will test them why I don't want to take much of your time and your time and she's time I will just share with you one Hadith because when you come to learn about the outcome of your patience upon being afflicted then you will most definitely choose to be patient with pleasure and happiness wasallam sayb the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam said when we all inshallah say inshallah when we all enter Heaven alhamdulillah we're not going to be all on the same floor no there will be a basement ground floor you know so many levels so those in this Dunya who have not been tested much not much of sickness loss of children or poverty or whatever they live a very decent life they were not tested much when they see some people up there there much higher than them why they were not like you know great worshippers no but they have been tested more than others and they endured it patiently so they would wish that their bodies have been clipped with clippers in order to achieve this status the messenger of Allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam has said Allah will not decree nor test or decide anything for his believing servant but what is always good for him and that's why when we say it's goodness and it's evil does Allah do evil what is happening here we have to understand this concept what it means sometimes from your own narrow angle you look at the test as evil but W it is best for you one person as I was speaking about the approached me and said 1999 there was an Egyptian flight taken off from JFK returning back to Cairo there were only two flights a week and they didn't have back then the soft copies it was only the paper the copy the cartoon the hard copy so he lost it he and his brother they looked everywhere and when they didn't find it they were not allowed to board the flight so they returned to the hotel room and he was really upset with his brother who lost their tickets when he turned the TV on on all that channels the news that this particular aircraft and this particular flight crashed and no survivors everybody died so he jumped off his bed out of Jo in the light he said alhamdulillah now he's saying alhamdulillah from his heart but after he realized that Allah chose for them what is best for them you should always keep in mind Allah would not would not choose for you but what is best for you alhamdulillah alhamdulillah very good explanation by Sheik she mentioning about we should always reflect whatever happens to Prophet sallallahu alai wasam take example from it try to reflect it but now I want to direct the next question to shim sometimes she askim I personally also receive this question when they were saying that yes we agree the prophet Sall alhi wasallam suffered so much in his life and he's close to Allah subhah wa ta'ala but they said that we are very far we are not like the Prophet The Prophet are close to Allah Allah Ables to confort him but but we are far from Allah subhana wa tala what is your n for this kind of people get close to Allah very short one masallah that is the only sh you want to there is nothing you could do either you get closer to Allah get the content and the comfort in this life or go to hell yeah there's not no third option you could and whne excuse my French all day long and nothing is going to change when Allah tests you with a Calamity if if your son dies you have two options you have option one is to be content and say in and be patient and say alhamdulillah is your son going to come back to life no no he's not but you will get a house in Jenna Mansion called because Allah tested you and you were patient and praised him option two you can bang your head against the wall you can tear your clothes you can slap your face you can uh object and complain why me why not anyone else and shout and scream for a whole month is your son going to come back to life no the same result but you will be sinful you will get a lot of sins on the day of judgment and you will lose all your reward so Allah sent us the messengers Allah revealed his Al ultimate and final Revelation Al Quran the guidance is in al Quran if it was enough Allah would have given us each a copy but no it's not enough it's not enough in the sense that he has to he had to send out of his mercy and compassion to us a role model a teacher who we would see him in front of us doing what we think that this is impossible it's undoable so now this role model has faced so many calamities and was tolerant and was patient you can do the same so you do the same you'll be with him in you fail to do so then you have only yourself to blame Allah knows mallah M very wonderful answer from I need to press it more you know to get the pears out M then Muhammad Salah coming back to the questions of optimistic and pessimistic about this world because we know there's a particular mentioned that so they were saying that okay I'm content with this world I know that we are suffering from trials and tribulation Etc and Etc but because of that they lead to a situation whereby they try to avoid enjoying good things they remain in a state of sadness deprivation because they believe this world is nothing more right so as a Muslim how do we correct this particular view the great companions may Allah be pleased with them described Ras wasallam who the greatest man ever walked the Earth and he's our role model and best example to follow as every time the companions saw and met the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam they would only see him smiling and that's why he said you know when you meet people then you smile you spread optimism and he used to like optimism even to the extent he would change the names which give the opposite meaning for pessimism for inance he meets Somebody by the name hen he changes his name to sah a girl what is your name honey she said means sinner said rather you name is huh pretty beautiful during the Treaty of alud there were negotiators going back and forth on the sixth year when the prophet went for omah and he was not able to enter and the mechans would send negotiators so many people came four or five every time somebody's approaching from the mecan side wasallam would ask who is it they know them all so and so so and so until finally they said oh that is so he smiled he rejoiced and said alhamdulillah the case will be solved how do you know his name from which means easy the minimization of ease so we are required to spread good alins optimism share good news to the extent and said when you visit a sick person what does it mean even when you visit a terminally ill person they say that it's cancer gate four is only have one week to live when you visit the person you're supposed to do what to say masallah the doctor saying you doing very well you will make it I know a person who had even worse condition than you but he survived alhamdulillah on the other flip you find some people when they visit a person who sick say Subhan Allah my uncle have the same and he only Liv for a couple days and he died this is wrong then when sent what did he tell them both he said share good news with people and do not offend them do not word them off make things easy for people do not make it difficult and hard upon them and there are so many examples in this regard by the grace of Allah it's such a beautiful religion if we were just to learn it then to practice yes mashallah mallah so as a Muslim we always become Optimist in our life we don't despair we ask Mercy from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and we mix all these kind of trials and tribulation makes us better now I'm directing the next question to sh aim about the community itself because sh Asim sometimes when someone have been hit with Calamity or disaster or something like that people like to comment for example they say this is because Allah punishes you some other might say that no this is because it's a test for you so what is the best for the community when someone or some calamities or MBA hit from others so as a Muslim brothers and Muslim Community how do we respond to it there is no one size that fits all depends on the situation it depends on the Calamity sometimes when a woman comes and complains of her husband's betrayal you give her an answer different to someone who lost his wealth or someone who is Germany and chronically ill so there are different situations all in all we try our level best not to be rude in the sense that this is your sin you deserve this you deserve this because you allowed your husband to go to free mixing and Allah asael punished You by him marrying two three four wives you go to a sick person and said yeah these are the sins that you've did done five 10 years ago and you posted on Instagram now you have to pay pay back is a yeah something bad and so this is not the right way of doing it like the sheh said you have to give the Glad Tidings you have to be optimistic you have to show people how Allah is merciful and bring them back back to Allah and at the same time yeah walk a very thin line by showing them that this is a test from Allah so you have to endure that test whenever the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam visited a SI a sick person what would he say may this be a means of purification so this is a means of purification because Allah is erasing your sins as a community we have to stand by one another so if a person is in a Calamity and he's starving and you go to him and say Mas look at you you're getting thin allahallah it's a good diet you're giving this is for your digestive problems and you give him something to help his digestion the guy is not even finding food and you're giving him digestive uh uh uh medication you have to stand by them when their need of food you feed them when they need of medicine you give them when they need of money to pay their rent or to pay their utility bills you give them from zakat from Sak you lend them money so you stand by your brother or your sister as if you are a firm strong wall one next to the other like bricks this is how we stand with the communities and Allah knows best mashallah M wonderful explanation by shh so ladies and gentlemen we don't always judge people we always assiste others as what mentioned by she when someone hit by Calamity we try to assist them don't judge them and they are our brothers at at the end right now um I myself got a now the time is coming so I'm going to in to give the final message to both she maybe Sheik last final message just one or two minutes for us to command when Allah subhana said chapter number 39 chapter verse 53 just a simple comment to close up all of the discussion today start with first everybody's telling the chapter number and I'm learning I'm learning I'm learning in this conference maybe we start him first one minute eight before Beauty okay what if you have both okay maybe she ask him just one minute and what was the question just a final so much Beauty in it just one simple last comment on the words chapter 29 verse 53 Allah is the most merciful most compassionate W if you know Allah you love him I swear by Allah if you know Allah you love him and whatever the one you love does to you it is more sweet than raising and and and and cupcakes huh so you love whatever Allah does to you but you're always balancing between hope and fear so you hope in what Allah has for you and you wish that Allah gives you more and more and you fear your sins and you are afraid and trying your level best to improve if you contemplate upon this and do your level best strive to reach the highest levels in Jenna you will reach that thank in no need to mention the chapter and the AY Allah the almighty [Music] says most certainly Allah loves whom is plural of and is an extensive form of a person who frequently repents a person who repents on regular basis whether because he or she have sinned or not Allah loves those who keep saying so keep repenting unto Allah subh until you become loved by Allah and if you achieve this status of being loved by Allah then you would only love what Allah loves and you will Destin yourself from whatever Allah abhor as the almighty Allah said in the sacred Hadith meaning once Allah loves one of his servants the almighty will become his hearing with which he hears his eyes with which he sees his hands with which he strikes meaning whether his faculties of senses or his limbs they would only do what Allah loves as a result of being loved by Allah do not wait until you recognize or you remember you've committed a sin rather frequently make how many times since the morning you've madear today did you make a 100 times today in the morning if you didn't you're at loss because wasallam would not leave after until he would make at least 100 times so there something that make it a routine in the morning and in the evening and after every prayer as we all know make may Allah forgive us all W brothers and sisters Allah loves loves us Allah says in the [Music] Quran by the way if you ever say or repent to to Allah that's a sign that Allah loves you because you only made because he loved you so he inspired you to repent may Allah love us all and may Allah accept our repentance and grant us all forgiveness thank you very much sh thank you very much alhamdulillah alhamdulillah in this almost 45 minutes we learn so much we learn about the definition of trials and tribulation in the Quran we learn how ourself going to Bear all of the suffering we learn the concept of Good and Evil we learned the concept of how to cope and finally we end up how the community responds ladies and gentlemen I really hope I myself personally for all of the audience here we are very benefited with all the Sheik thank you very much he really enlightened us and hope that we become a very optimistic individuals and we never despair in the mercy of Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala with that thank you very much all and I return back to our Hall MC thank you very much"
