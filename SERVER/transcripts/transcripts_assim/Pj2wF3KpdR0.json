  "transcript": "uh ahmed allah from india she says that i told her a an issue people who have continuous doubts is this a third raka or fourth rakah did i perform the second sujud on or only one sujud and this is continuous every single prayer or most of the prayers we usually tell these people to ignore the doubt because it's not logical to prostrate for forgetfulness every single prayer this pleases shaytan because he feels that he has control over you so what to do the best thing to do is that you ignore the doubt and act upon your gut feeling so while praying ya allah this is third or fourth usually you have 70 or maybe 80 percent certainty that this is a third or a fourth raka and 20 or 30 percent doubt no cast it out away and act upon what your gut feeling is and don't prostrate for forgetfulness so now she says okay i've done that and it's gone now i get this every now and then not continuous it's random if it's random then welcome to the club you're like us we may get the same feeling once every blue moon it depends on the person so some people get it once every eight months some may be getting it every three months some may get it every month but still this is not regular not continuous in this case yes you have to act upon your gut feeling if you have one and offer prostration of forgetfulness after salaam if you're totally blinded don't know whether it's third or the fourth rakah totally forgot you're totally lost then ignore the extra which is the fourth and act upon what's certain which is three in the case of sujud if you're doubtful whether this is the second or the first then ignore the second and and and consider this to be the first and offer another sujud and also uh offers to you the sahu before salam not after because you are totally blinded and allah knows best"
