  "title": "Family does Fatiha on food, ask me to bring items from shop & force me to participate, can I?",
  "transcript": "Irfan from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh like sugar, water, etc. What should I do in the above case and can I sit in the corner of room hating in my heart? This is a clear innovation in Islam and it is not to be found anywhere in the Qur'an or the Sunnah or the actions of the companions, may Allah be pleased with them, or the Tabi'een or the Tabi'at Tabi'een. So definitely what your family is doing is an innovation and a bid'ah. Having said that, you cannot assist them on such a bid'ah if they specifically tell you Not because they want to use it throughout the whole month, rather they want to do a gathering revolving around this bid'ah. And you cannot be with them when they're engaged in such a bid'ah sitting in the same room even if they force you because this is unheard of. They will not hold you at gunpoint and force you to sit and you just simply say to them I will sit if you show me something in the Qur'an or in the Sunnah that the Prophet did it alayhis salatu wasalam. If they say no the Prophet didn't do it, but say if the Prophet did not do it alayhis salatu wasalam, so you know more than him? Or are you inserting and creating and inventing something new in Islam that the Prophet did not know of and he did not recommend us to do and he did not do himself? This should be an eye-opener for them and Allah knows best."
