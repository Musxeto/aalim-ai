  "title": "Punishment for depriving siblings or any heirs from their right of inheritance - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Yusuf's question about the distribution of the property and wealth of a deceased person it seems that three brothers who used to live in the property deprived their other siblings who were two brothers and a sister who got married and they were living elsewhere they deprived them from their inheritance I don't have knowledge of this why didn't the brothers complain why didn't the two brothers and the sister go to court was there a settlement or not hypothetically speaking if there was nothing and it's simple straightforward transgression from the three brothers living in the house they took everything that the father left behind Millions now many reach billions Allah knows and they sold it dealt with it distributed it between them three and deprived the other three from it now they're all dead and the children remain if the children of the transgressors of the wrongdoers want to rectify and correct it then this is okay if they don't want to rectify and correct the mistakes of the parents and the other cousins have documents to prove that they stole the money from their fathers that they did not fear Allah in distributing the wealth and property they can easily take them to court most likely because they're asking this question they have nothing they don't have any documents and in this case you don't have a case you can't do anything except make dua to allah azza wajal to avenge your rights and to ask allah to either punish them for what they had stolen or that allah would compensate you with other means they have committed one of the most heinous sins and forms of triangle transgression when you deprive someone from his god-given right the inheritance was not divided by people it was divided by allah himself in the quran in chapter 4 so it was allah azza wajal who gave each and every one of the heirs their share and portion of the inheritance to come and deprive them from it this is a major sin that Allah would punish them in Hellfire because of that now the children if they know that if their fathers did such a sinful act yet they don't they shrug their shoulders and they don't want to change it and they say status quo is nice my cousins it's their problem it's not mine well they were will also be held accountable on the day of judgment may allah azzawajal protect us and save us all"
