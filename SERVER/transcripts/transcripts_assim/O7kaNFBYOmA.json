  "transcript": "what is the ruling on someone's prayer when he feels the urge to answer the call of nature namely gas during during prayer 90 of the time and most of the and most of the time he is also senses a smell along with it but at the time and but other times when he's not praying he doesn't have that feeling or is unconscious of it and can he go to the masjid in this condition the hadith of the prophet alaihis salat was salam when he was asked about a person finding these feelings during salat that he may have past wind so the man is not certain because if there were certainty he would not have asked he would immediately break his prayer but he's doubtful so the prophet allah is taught this man and the umma at large that certainty is not affected by doubt your certainty of being in the state of wudhu cannot be invalidated until you're certain that you have past wind i'm not certain of prophet of allah i'm just doubtful well if you find a smell or hear a sound that you've passed wind that indicates and strengthens your doubt to approximate certainty then you have to break your salat this is the norm so if a person gets this feeling 99 percent every single prayer ah did i pass one or i did didn't i i'm doubtful and then he finds the smell but the smell is of perfume or the smell of someone's socks or the smell of anything other than passing wind and if you were to ask them was this smell from you said no i'm certain of that what that sound from you said in this case this is attributed to his ocd he should continue to pray rarely you will find someone saying yeah this was me this is certainty he has to break the prayer so i hope this answers your questions"
