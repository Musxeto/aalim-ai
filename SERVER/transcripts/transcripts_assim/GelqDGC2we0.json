  "transcript": "to becoming part of that Vision to then you know going about it day today I think the biggest issue we face today with the Instagram uh you know Instagram Snapchat generation is you might have like motivation when you're scrolling and then it's gone cuz you continue to scroll uh and then you have these like Grand dreams but that's what they are they're just they're they're not there's nothing more to them how do you go about cleaning yourself up enough to be able to become what you see and then take steps towards that and then how do you kind of balance that out between people who you know a lot of the times especially here in the west and it's the same kind of within the you know within back inia people who find Islam they're like no no everything about it is just this I don't want to do anything else I don't want to earn any money I don't want to do anything else or in parts of life it's like H the only thing I need to do is earn money you know for the sake of it I'll go to the or I'll go for that's that's all I'm going to do so how do you how do you go from Vision to action um and what are some of the hurdles today that need to be overcome particularly now you touched over so many topics that will take us to F in so I don't know which to address first and last number one social media is an illness and a disease now you may say that okay she you're famous on social media this is something I did not pick this is what my team is doing meel reward them I have a team of volunteers I've never met in my life and I've never had any contact with and they're doing all the work and I don't know what they're doing number one number two social media has benefits but Allah also mentioned in the Quran that intoxicant and gambling have benefits don't they if I have a wine seller and I sell vintage wine you know like 1986 good wine beautiful huh I make a lot of money so there's benefits for me but the harm and the sins resulting from it outweighs the benefits so it's Haram so now you tell me you can do da on Tik Tok or on YouTube or on Instagram how much harm does it impact you a lot and a lot of the brothers come to me and say sh we have this we have have that and we learn a lot from YouTube but we get bad things on the side and they're distracting us these bad things are algorithms if you didn't click on one link that is Haram you would not have got them the moment you by accident or intentionally fall weak and say I'm going to watch this it is going to generate thousands and thousands of similar Haram uh uh links for you to distract to be distracted so cancel your account make a new account and make it only for Halal things and never be tempted social media is is problematic the prophet said that lower your gaze we don't lower our gaze we pay money to Fascinate ourselves and feast on what we can see nudity not necessarily porn we're not that filthy I hope but we would like to watch beautiful uh uh images this and that and this hardens your heart it makes it black it tarnishes it and it impacts your Salat and then you come to me she why don't I have this is why this is why you're distracted and this is what what draws you to walk the talk okay you've seen this for six seven months don't you like to go you know a further further maybe talk maybe date maybe go for dinner maybe just casual walk in the park and maybe who knows you may get lucky well who knows we may take it to Third Base hey you where you going I'm talking at baseball okay so this is the problem you don't see what Shan is planning for you now how can we take our mission and vision into action you can't do that alone you cannot rarely you will find someone who's gifted and blessed by Allah to be able to see things for what they are without mentors without a sh without a helping hand the vast majority of us need companions Allah says Allah says to Muhammad s wasam our prophet and messenger and be patient with those who call Allah in the morning in the evening seek his face be patient with them so you have to associate associate yourself with them you tell me on your contact list who do you have how many righteous practicing individuals that you hang out with rare if any then this is your biggest problem you want to carry on your mission and vision and implement it you have to have people that would help you that would be your rock that you can depend on that will always take your six but when you're alone so many fitnas out there they're going to attack viciously and mercil Merc will you know what I mean huh it's not my language so I I don't have to even a try hard so you can do it but it's difficult to do it alone you need companionship and this is why this Masjid is your safe house is your lifeline because when you come here you're different you feel different you're not eager just to go out or to check your emails or to check your WhatsApp or to check messages no you're happy you feel your heart is filled with Tranquility not because sheim is this is one of the reasons but it's seriously the Masid is your safe haven this is where you find your protection and this is what Shan is doing his level best to get you out of let's go to the message I have a match I have something I'm following I have some Shores at the house I have homework I have the more you are in the Masjid the more your mission and vision is to be materialized with the grace of Allah and Allah BL"
