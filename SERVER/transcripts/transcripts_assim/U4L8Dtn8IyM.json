  "title": "Interest given by conventional banks vs profit given by Islamic banks - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Ahmed says what is the difference between interest rate and profit rate provided by banks to open savings accounts one Islamic bank says if deposit five thousand dirhams then profit rate is 0.35 percent from 0.2% same case in conventional riba based banks where they say return is given but based on how much is deposited so both are dealing with percentages and not giving fixed return in my understanding fixed is haram but not percentage return is not so mainly brother ahmed skirts in cern is when Islamic banks give a percentage and this percentage is variable as a profit isn't this like conventional banks riba based when they give the same variable percentages the answer is no because conventional banks deal mainly in RIBA so the Treasury Department deals in like 90 to 95 percent of all the money that people deposit in it by lending it or the vast vast majority of it in RIBA whether it's short term or long term big amounts small amounts so they lend others they lend your money to others and they get RIBA in return and then they give me the one who's depositing his money the one who has the bank account savings or to a fixed time deposit or whatever they give me a percentage that is variable but it's silver based while in the Islamic banking they do not lend money what they do is they invest so they come to X Y Z who is a businessman who's an investor he's interested in building a factory he's interested in importing goods they study it they partially financed it so they pay and they go into a partnership with that investor and they make money and they give from that profit halal profit to the one who deposited or who has a savings account a percentage small or large so the difference is in the source of income conventional banks deal in RIBA deal in money versus money Islamic banks if they are truly Islamic and their Sharia board fear Allah Azza WA JAL and they're not just simply people who sign and get the bonuses at the end of the year if they fear Allah as there was your real scholars who audit and say that this is halal and this is Haram their transactions are hala halal because they deal through the Sharia windows and opportunities so that nothing Haram is there they're investing they are entering into partnership not giving money and sitting to return to expect the return plus the interest no they are in a transaction that may win and may lose and this is trade this is okay while the conventional back they always win they lend you money you fail to pay they take your house they take your dog they take your car everything leave you on the street on the pavement with nothing it's la Micmac s-- is different we are both on the same boat and we're partners we when we share the the profit we lose we lose our capital and you lose your effort etc so I hope this answers your questions"
