  "title": "The 4 Madhabs - Marriage without a WALI? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sara from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh The answer is We do not take our verdicts from madhhabs. Because this is not a grocery shop or store where we just go and pick and choose from the shelves whatever we like. So it's not how it works. That I want to do something, hmm, what should I do? Shafi'i madhhab says no, Hanafi madhhab says yes, Maliki and Hanbali madhhab says no, I'll take the Hanafi madhhab for the time being. And over another issue, when Hanafi madhhab says no, Maliki madhhab says yes, I'm going to choose the Maliki madhhab. This is not how it works in Islam. Allah says, If you ever dispute or have a disagreement over a topic, then refer it back to Allah and to His Messenger Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam. Meaning, refer it back to the Quran and to the Sunnah. So if we go to the Quran, we find that the Quran speaks about marrying women through their guardians. So it's not the women who get married, they are to be married by their guardians. And the Sunnah is crystal clear. The Prophet said, there is no marriage valid without the consent and approval of a guardian and the presence of two Muslim trustworthy male witnesses. And this is the vast majority opinion of scholars of Islam. The Maliki madhhab, the Shafi'i madhhab, the Hanbali madhhab, even the majority of the Hanafi madhhab is with that opinion. The only one who differed was Imam Abu Hanifa, may Allah have mercy upon his soul. His two greatest students, Al-Qadi and Al-Hassan Al-Shibani, Qadi Yusuf and Al-Hassan Al-Shibani, his students opposed his opinion over that issue as well. So we have no choice but to follow the instruction of the Prophet Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
