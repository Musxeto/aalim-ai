  "transcript": "mbah from Pakistan uh sh I wanted to ask about the time of necessity for ass prayer here in my area the congregation player starts at 5: and hanafi starts uh as at 4:40 and shaffi at 3:30 so and by 5 the shadow is at least three times the original length can I pray with them in congregation do you have any other alternative most of the mocks around my area pray around that time if you don't have any other alternative and you're stuck between praying alone but at the beginning of the time or praying with the congregation but by delaying it to the time of necessity the answer would be pray with the congregation and Allah is most forgiving most merciful but do not pray alone"
