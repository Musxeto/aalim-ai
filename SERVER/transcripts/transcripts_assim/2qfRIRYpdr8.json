  "title": "How to make up missed prayer due to working the night shift for a woman? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Alfre says my question is regarding making up for prayers I work at night from 11 to 7 a.m. from 11 p.m. till 7 a.m. and by the time I wake up at 5 p.m. I miss for asar and malorie prayer how do I make up for these prayers should I pray them immediately when I wake up one prayer at a time or do I pray them as I normally would just 3 prayers in a row after completing each one so first of all Afra your name tells me that you are a woman and for a woman to work night shift or they call it the graveyard shift is inappropriate this in dangers your safety your health and your marriage if you are married it's not normal for a woman to spend the night outside even if it was for work now I'm speaking in general terms a woman should not work outside at that time let alone work in a mixed environment there alone it's unsafe for her to commute or travel from her home to the workplace etc but this is something you have to consider and to think about as far as sleeping if you finish work at 7:00 a.m. by the time you reach home it's 8 o'clock maybe have breakfast and go to sleep you are one of two persons either you are totally dead and you set the alarm you ask people in the house to wake you up for the or for asar and for mashup and there's no use you're totally dead you don't hear anything you're disconnected from the whole world in this case Allah does not hold you accountable because I've as mentioned in the hadith Allah has uplifted the pen of accountability upon three among them the person who's asleep until he wakes up you're unconscious people try to wake you up you set to three alarms and it does not work because you're dead tired then there is no accountability upon you what you do the moment you wake up which is five o'clock p.m. you have to pray the whole four Rakas hassle for Rakas moderate free Rocca's immediately you do not as people some people do postpone the whole for next day's the pray them together double for a calf or raka and assert the same and model with the same no you must immediately pray them in sequence the then a sir then multiple but if you are from the second category which is you can wake up and people can wake you up easily and you can wake up if you set the alarm but you don't in this case you should not pray neither the whole house or normally if mother if Asia prayer was called because you deliberately skip the prayer you intentionally skip but the prayer and it was premeditated that you go to sleep and not wake up until it's five o'clock which is a serious major sin so I hope this answers your question"
