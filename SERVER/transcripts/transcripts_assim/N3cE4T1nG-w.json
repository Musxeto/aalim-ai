  "transcript": "Salman from India. Sheikh, a woman, I know of a woman, who does not have good relation and does not stay with her husband, a son or brother. These men don't spend on her. Neither she convinces them to take her responsibility, nor she herself wants to stay with them. So this woman stays with her son-in-law and daughter, who looked after her for a long time, but now he does not want to spend anymore, which leads to fight between the husband and wife. So there are a lot of reasons why her son-in-law or her family members don't want to stay with. In short, this woman is like Fir'aun. So now the question is, if these men are present who are responsible for taking care of her, does it become obligatory for her daughter to find and do a job and look after her mom, who herself is dependent on her husband? First of all, the son-in-law is not at all obliged to accommodate his mother-in-law. At all. This is not mandatory upon him in Islam. It's not a charity organization. His wife has no right in pressuring him to accept her mother to stay with him in his own house. So whether she has a husband and siblings that are willing to provide for her or not, he's not obliged. So it's his house. He can ask her politely to leave. And if she doesn't, he can kick her out. Is his wife permitted to work against his will? Of course not. And if she insists, then, Alhamdulillah, Allah can substitute him with a younger, more beautiful, more practicing, and less troubled wife. Who's wearing the pants? And I hate it when such questions come to me showing the dominance of the wife over the man. Who's wearing the pants, Ya Khidr? Be a man and act like a man. You've tolerated your wife and her mom for so many years. You've spent on them. Jazakallah Khair. Allah will reward you. But enough is enough. So if your wife is insisting on working to provide for her mom, who has people to provide for her but she doesn't want because she's evil or she's arrogant, then no, this is not permissible for the wife to do so and Allah knows best."
