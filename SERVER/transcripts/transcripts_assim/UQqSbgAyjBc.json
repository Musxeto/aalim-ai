  "transcript": "so allah azza among his signs that he created for us wives from among ourselves that you may find reports in them in them in your spouse you will find this tranquility this calmness what did the prophet salallahu do when he first saw jibril peace be upon him he ran to khadija what did khadijah say why are you late why didn't you bring the groceries did she say this look at that wise wife your allah if i could have a wife like that seriously among the men allah says a lot of them were complete and perfect among the women only four among them and why because she is the wisest the kindest the most loving to the extent that the prophet is whenever he remembered her he could not get hold of himself one day what's your name the sister of khadijah no no the sister of khadija her name is it will come inshaallah sheikh hala her name is hala bit hwa and she asked permission to enter so the prophet heard you know they did not have bell what is the islamic way of requesting to enter a salaam alaikum may i come in so he heard the name the voice and he said allah which reminded him of khadija so he mentioned the name of khadijah because she was her sister she was admitted and the prophet gave her food gave her the only things to honor a guest it was in her night she said prophet of allah why why every time you mention hadith is dead almost 10 years now yet the prophet remembers her and aisha is jealous of a dead woman look at the jealousy of women huh we will get to this inshallah and then i will show you my high heels and then the prophet i just said why do you remember a woman who is so old that her teeth fell and all what you can see is the gum the red gum when she laughs look at the description it's not very beautiful description but accurate the prophet salallahu gets angry because she said allah has substituted you with someone much better than her meaning her because she was a virgin she was young she was extremely beautiful so she is boasting about it the prophet got outraged got really angry he said by allah i was not substituted better than her allah gave me children from her and he deprived them from you she took me in when people kicked me out she gave me her money when people deprived me of her money she gave me comfort when people were attacking me by allah allah did not substitute me better than her look at this love that the prophet said by allah prophet of allah i will never mention her in a negative way again so what did the prophet do is peace be upon him he immediately went to khadija because she is the comfort what do i do when i have problems with my boss my work who do i turn to to my friends i turn to my wife and i tell her this happened and i don't know what to do hypothetically i don't but this is what we're supposed to do now again i'm joking i'm mixing jokes with with a serious issue but this is true when you go when you need advice you go to your wife because she is the one who will comfort you and you know what khadijah did she comforted him and she took him to work now for her cousin and she told him that by allah you will not be disgraced a beautiful stand from khadija um on the battle or on the uh expedition of houdini they prevented the prophet from ali salaam going to mecca for umrah and he told the people go and shave and slaughter your sheep we're going we're coming next year did they comply the prophet was agitated was angry went to um what to do she gave him the advice so whenever you have problems you go to your spouse but this is with limits men usually go to their wives not frequently women go to their husbands hours seven days a week your mother did this your sister did that well we will come to this inshallah at a later stage so the sisters will wait inshaallah so alhamdulillah we have this repose in them and not only that he has put between you affection and mercy this affection and mercy is between the spouses it is the norm no matter how troubled you are no matter how problems you have with your spouse the norm is that you will always find this affection and mercy it may increase it may be decreased depending on the people and allah also said in surah nisa thank you okay you"
