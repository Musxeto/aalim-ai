  "transcript": "what is the ruling on personality tests does this fall under suit saying what are personality tests a lot of the corporates nowadays mandate that a potential employee that he or she must undergo a personality test so that they can figure out what this person is made of what are his inclinations etc and these tests are not all the same some of them are scientific and they are credible and some of them are totally totally bogus and not permissible so the permissible part is the one that relies on facts scientific facts so they ask you about what you would do in particular situations how would you react when you're angry or were you pleased and through such questionnaires they would determine the type of a person you are so if you say that i don't like to be in a crowd i don't like addressing people publicly they know that you are an introvert you are not the person who likes to meet people so definitely in marketing you would not be a good person but maybe you will be a better person working behind the desk pushing papers etc and accounting you don't have to meet the public other questions may reveal some of your characteristics based on psychological analysis which is scientific such tests are okay some corporates give tests to determine whether you are good in hr or in marketing or in sales or in um operation etc according to their your answers they can tell your inclination now there are other tests that are totally bogus totally uh fabricated not based on science rather it is more likely to be based on soothe saying and fortune telling like the one that sells you right to us a particular paragraph and then we look at the lines and the curves and how the straight the lines were and the dots where you place them and the stress of your pen and we can tell that you go to bed early that you don't like chocolate cake after a a heavy meal what is this this is totally fabrication and soothe saying or by the way you sleep so how is it that you sleep is it on your stomach do you uh crunch yourself like a child in his mother's womb do you do this do you do that accordingly your personality is so and so and you will be a good leader a bad leader etc all of this is nonsense unfortunately a lot of the the masses of the people are so hooked on knowing the unseen on predictions so they pay money and a lot of those imposters would gain a lot of money by saying okay your first name the first letter is so and so the middle letter is so so the last letter so and so this according to our calculation and to the zodiac you were born in into your mother's name all together means that this is what's going to happen and this is your character your your personality analysis results all of this is totally haram this is something that is not scientific and it's based on uh future telling sooth saying uh predictions um lies there's no tangible evidence scientific tangible evidence that we can base this and her therefore this is totally uh haram you"
