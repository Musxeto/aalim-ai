  "title": "What is the benefit of making Dua on the times of acceptance when Dua is responded only in 3 ways?",
  "transcript": "Sheikh, my question is when we make dua to Allah, Allah responds in three ways. He can grant us what we are wishing for or He can remove some evil from our life or He can store it for the hereafter. So when a Muslim makes a dua to Allah on any normal day, Allah can respond in three ways. But if a Muslim makes a dua on the times when prayer is answered, like before breaking the fast or on the last third of the night, Allah still responds in these three ways. So what's the benefit of making dua on these special times when the prayer is answered compared to a day when it is normal on any irregular day? So I don't understand the benefit of making dua on a special time because the response will be the same in both cases. That's what I'm confused. Jazak Allah. Wa jazak. Akhi, when you make dua to Allah Azza Wa Jal, you have no guarantees that Allah is going to accept your dua. In the sense that maybe you're not sincere. Maybe you're not present-minded because in the hadith, the Prophet said, alayhis salatu wassalam, said supplicate and make dua to Allah with present-minded because Allah does not respond to someone whose heart is negligent and absent. The Prophet said he would not respond. So whenever we make dua, we're not certain that Allah will respond to it because it may not have fulfilled the conditions. If it did fulfill the conditions, then making these duas at the times where answering the dua is most likely and highly, such as between adhan and iqama, such as when breaking your iftar, your fast, such as in the last third of the night, such as when it's raining, such as when you hear the roaster sound in the fajr, all of these are more likely for your adhan to be answered, especially the first category, which is oh Allah make it happen now. So this is the difference that the more you select these recommended times, the more highly your dua would be answered, especially here in this world when you want whatever you want it to happen, Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
