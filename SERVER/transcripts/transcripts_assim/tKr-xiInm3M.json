  "transcript": "hassan says i work at the counter of a supermarket how should i avoid touching the hand of female customers when taking money and returning change etc if i put the change or receipt or the receipt at the side some find it rude i don't know why you guys make a problem out of a no problem someone is going to put money in my hand so does it mean that they have to touch me and i have to touch them and start feeling them and what is this this is a ppg it's it's for children not uh rated r you do this and they put the money in it and once they want to put the money you just lower your hand a little bit they let go and it falls no contact same thing when you give the change you do this they do this they're not gonna grab your hand they're just gonna do this and you put it leave it and move your hand this is the easiest way if something happened accidentally it's okay but don't be too lacks in doing it but at the same time don't be so hyper and anxious about it and if there is another way of having a small tray where you put the cash with the chain and the receipt and give it to them and they collect it from it that would be nice maybe it's rude when you put it on the counter and you drop it like this but not when you put it in a sli a small tray and present it to them that would be fine so yeah don't be uh too anxious and hyped about it when it's it's not a big issue"
