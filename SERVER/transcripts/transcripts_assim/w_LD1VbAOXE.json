  "transcript": "you stay calm hola this isn't sore than is that this is different but I cannot see it it's prescribed for you with any of you approach the hollow I had a poem moto enterica hang on i will see you today to edit any wanna be so this is a different verse but it states that when a death approaches you allah advises you of writing a will to the parents and to the relatives but the prophet said are a sort of salam la vecinita lavar if there is no peak west there is no way to an air anyone who is inheriting cannot be getting anything from the will meaning i died but they are in my will that i give my wife half of the house after I die they take the will ma sha Allah it is invalid it's not acceptable why because the wife has an eighth of what i have left if i have children if I don't GH she gets the fourth first what about if I have four wives she gets for they get 48 right no they are all getting 18 that is why in Arabic we call thus co-wife bangla what is amina blah blah the one who is being hurtful to the other because when she's one she gets 18 of the inheritance if they're too they both get 18 and if therefore the old share in 18 so the more he has the less she gets anyhow it is not permissible to write a will to someone who is inheriting but if someone is nothing editing can I item i will leave a bequest one-third not more so if I have sons and one of my sons died and this son had children they are my grandchildren so can I write to them I will yes I can because they were not inherit their uncle's will deprive them from getting any thing from the will so I can get them from the inheritance so i can write them a will now this is a challenge I didn't do this but exam already brothers obligation of diverse okay obligated the worst abrogated na sukham what till our there are types of obligation one we would not find neither the writing nor the ruling it goes to we will find the rest the writing but the ruling is not valid anymore three we will find the ruling among us with practicing it we were doing it we're applying it but there is no verse of the Quran it's gone so these are the three stages and we have the examples I hope abrogation of verse and the ruling so this is the first one the obligation of the ruling and the birds nests health hokum pokum is the ruling and the talawa is there is a tation so it's not then you cannot recite it the example of this is the hadith of Aisha may allah be pleased with her she says it had no we have presen√ßa okay now get ready for a present read this for half a minute I will drink and I would ask you a question now get ready ok now I'm going to ask the question to the sisters I'll take one maybe two answers and then we will move to the brothers if they fail to find the answer the question is the abrogation of the verse and the ruling which one there are three seconds to one the brothers raise your hand please raise your hand I don't want answers that are not the question the abbreviation of the verse and the ruling where is it I want you to give me the best and the ruling that's simple again to the sisters three seconds raise your hands please I didn't see a hand no no that's not true last night okay buzz bring your hands me okay so which was which was obligated and this app which is the best oh then you did not read this you have to change your glasses this is talking about a robar suckling breastfeeding so which is the verse and what is the ruling the rest is not their brothers assisted this was obligated you cannot recite it it's not there in the Quran so how can you say it's in al baqara or is it and this app the verse itself was obligated but the ruling is building yeah what is it no no the ruling was that was obligated the 10 again let me emphasize and explain why she says may Allah be pleased with her that at the time of the prophet alayhi salatu salam the ruling in the Quran was that 10 sucklings would make a child Amara a son of the mother and this was aggregated into five so the ten were obligated the ruling is gone and changed and replaced by five and the recitation itself we don't recite it neither the first nor the second because also in the Quran we don't have in the Quran five with subtle circles would make the child a son to the mother so most buildings are aggregated one which is the 10 he's obligated in both ways verdict and recitation the second one which is five remains as a ruling but it is not there as the eyes of yours or as recitation and the shuttle should I repeat handle qui qui woman I'll give the brother give another pricey he deserves it we move on to obligation of the verse and the ruling again okay the obligation of the ruling without the bird's nest will hokum do that till our which means that we recite the verse but the ruling is not applied any more and those of your women who commit illegal sexual intercourse take the evidence of four witnesses what lat e 18 and fahisha them in viscera come pistachio alley in Alberta butter are bottoming co-organizer Minko this is a certain mr. Alonzo jelly struts us that whenever someone doubts or finds his spouse or whatever in an illegal sexual act he should take four witnesses then what jarama says that you should put them under house arrest until they until they die keep them in the house until they die so this was the ruling whenever a married woman for decades or someone fornicates a woman for decades well she's married or not this is the ruling she's to get to be kept in the house until she dies this was aggregated by the vs to return Lord will Allah prescribe the punishment women who are unmarried if they fornicate women or men what is the ruling the unmarried women and men guilty of illegal sexual intercourse flawed each of them with hundred stripes / lash them with 100 lashes this is the ruling so this obligated the first now if someone finds someone who commits adultery and keeps her home until she dies this is not legal this is not permissible of course providing she or he is unmarried what and the question to the Brotherhood next to the cameraman no the one behind him what happens if he's married this is the problem okay tell us he raised the white flag okay we forgive you okay we move on to the third type of obligation is the obligation of the verse without the ruling this is not hot alawa do not holcomb which means that the ruling is there were servers it's gone the verse is gone as in the five circles this the ruling is still if a woman circles a child five times he becomes her son and he becomes the son of her husband and he becomes a burden of all of her children prior and after he becomes immediately related to her new of this rhubarb if she does this four times only it's not enough alice is a stranger still a stranger to her and to the rest and the evidence here and the married man or woman if they commit adultery then stoned them as a retribution of Allah this verse is in short there is no solar this was abrogated this was a purse this was a present the Quran Allah the new hop-hop may allah be pleased with him said that we used to recite this before it was abrogated and he says that i am afraid that there will come a time and this time has come we read a lot of people saying that stoning is on Islamic it's not in the Quran where did you get this from it is in the bahadi it is in the Muslim the Prophet ice storm stoned the Jews the Prophet I system instructed to stone knives animalic melodies with him he started to stone the wrong idea the woman who was pregnant out of wedlock so the Prophet did it it was decided in the Quran but then it was abrogated so no one has the right to refuse it and by the way i made the research about couple years ago i was debating with some of them priests in America he was saying storing and storing so and this is one of the wonders Subhan Allah the Prophet says allosaurus on in a Maha Liang Zhou had a Dean the Roger alpha Roger a lahzar will get this religion victorious by the help of the bad man the cafard the the one who has no models and this is true the blessings and the help we get from share google well why we get so much may Allah guys into Islam Yanni I was debating with one of these priests and he was condemning stoning and I don't I have copies of the Bible but I don't have time to read it then so I went into Google and I said stoning in the Bible in less than five minutes I compiled an answer from the Bible coach chapter verses removing that day stone in the Old Testament the women that do not cover their head the Jews it says a woman if she doesn't cover her hair stall her til death look at what we have now and I compiled all of this and I sent it to the pc never came back to me us I don't know maybe invented islami I don't know but subhanAllah any we can defend our Dean pretty easily in five minutes but you consulting chef mogul and he would give us Lana sepsis tony is an hour religion it is in all the religions on very simple things those who define their parents stone them today a woman does this stone her to death if someone does this stone him to death it's really easy no in Islam only if a person was married or is married and he fornicates this is and of course the penalty is to preserve the community and you cannot inflict this punishment we accept with all the witnesses not seeing something that can be or can't be they have to see a detailed graphic evidence explaining to the very little detail that without doubt my confession so to be able to do this in the presence of four people this guy definitely is he needs to be killed because anybody would not continue or to confess and when man has confessed how many times the prophetess from turned his face four times he said o prophet of Allah purify me i have sent he turned his face he came he turned his face he came four times and then the prophet said is he not the massive know the prophecy that is awesome maybe you touched maybe you hugged maybe you did this in the says no i did the real ex thing so the Prophet sailor Sam smell his mouth maybe he had something to drink the Prophet is trying to prevent him from the punishment and he's giving him ways out and the man says I cannot tolerate this sin it is burning me it is killing me I am dying I'd rather die guaranteeing with Allah forgive my sins because whoever gets a prescribed punishment Allah it is assistant US allies too generous sao paulo Dada to have two punishments on his slave over one sin if he is beautified in this life palace but of course if he depends without being punished and feels remorse and this or what he can show that to compensate Allah will also forgive his sins after all of this the Prophet instructed him to be stoned to death and this hadith of our that I have mentioned whether he proves that this was recited as a Quran and we memorized it and we understood it and the Prophet is a Salaam punished those fornicators with it and I know that there will come a time and this time is here people are rejecting this unfortunately and they are the ignorant ones those who do not have a lot of knowledge or a lot of care about Islam now we move on to such an eighth move or break oh ok we'll take questions why a worse was abrogated but the ruling was kept where I was not the worst kept again this is not to be addressed to me it has to be addressed to allah saw said it is his book it is his rulings why does Allah keep something or even the Prophet as a lesser son does not know it's from Allah soldier it's a las wisdom there was the Quran which deals with geography astronomy biology all there any cause behind these revelation most likely not because we don't have any evidence to prove that this was revealed for this course you remember that the cause of Revelation cannot be determined by reasoning it has to be by a companion and the companion he has two choices either to say I believe that this is in this and this is portable the companion says because of this incident Allah revealed this is straightforward when we talk about biology biography geology whatever in the Quran these verses are not intended to be the Quran is not intended to be a book of biology it's always giving you only hints so these verses are to be understood after the time of the Prophet awesome after the time of the companions and that is why I we are sure we are certain that the Companions did not know the not the biology the where the verse was going to they understood it normally what a larger says what about the origin of creation and how mine is created these stages of a span of a lot of bones of soul and sunset they did not understand this except in you the meaning but they could not visualize it now can we visualize it more than them definitely we can see this in ultrasound do you can see it in x-rays we can see it in so many great details that will read the Quran who said Lila heinola the Companions at the time did not understand this but they believed it they took it for granted exactly as when the verse safe is my general where you will do that differ I'm not upset we're in makkah wits what what do you talk what are you talking about that all the armies will be defeated and they will give us their backs while they're running but I show this coming to reality in the battle of better and what a lot talks about the camels the mules the horses as forms of transportation and says wait a little dog mad at Alamo and Allah would create things you do not know at the time of the Prophet is a lobster on ok I know that Allah creates things that we don't know but now when you look at the cars"
