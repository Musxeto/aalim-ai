  "transcript": "um oh my God is we're still talking about the Battle of uhud and the outcome of the battle at the moment was the apparent defeat of the polytheist army there were they were falling in the tens under the swords of the Muslims and the amount of soldiers they had and the equipment and armor did not suffice to stand in front of the Islamic flood so they retreated they forgot their avengeance they forgot their feelings of hatred and wanting to inflict pain and defeat to the Muslims always all of this was in vain all what they were thinking of at the moment was their lives so they retreated in a very fast paced and the Muslims kept on running behind them and Gathering all the booty and the loots they used to leave behind them I want to ask you about the place of the Prophet Salah and the battle where he was fighting or was sitting the prophet Allah was at the back surrounded by his companions because they would never allow him to fight though he used to fight but they were so afraid that something might happen to him so they would always not allow him to fight and they will always be in front of him protecting him unfortunately whenever someone falls behind a plan and does against the instructions of the commander defeat is inevitable when The Archers on the mountain so the policist retreating in defeat and so their brothers the fighters the Muslims collecting the booty they said it's time for us to go down and collect our own their leader Abdullah said people the prophet's instructions were clear you are not to leave your posts don't disobey the prophet they did not pay any attention to him 40 men of The Archers went down and only nine be pleased with them all remained on the mountain he saw this opportunity and he took it he went with his writers and they killed the whole nine the who were on that mountain and then he shouted at his people and they recognized his voice and they knew that he took the rear of the battlefield so they came back again and the Muslims were in the middle yeah the men of Khalid are descending and the the polytheist army that was retreating is coming back to fight them they were stuck in the middle now who was closest to Khalid do you think from the Muslims the prophet sallallahu because he was at the back so the prophet Allah was among only nine men two from quraish and seven from the ansar and the prophet had two choices one to flee the battlefield to Medina and it was that was easy because it was relatively far from him he he still was ahead of time so he could have done this but this meant that he would abandon his men to be caught between a rock and a hard place the second choice was the most dangerous one and that was to remain fight and collect his men around him so that they become a united front once again and as you may expect the prophet saws took the second choice the prophet salallahu called the people o slaves of Allah all Servants of Allah of course they recognize the prophet's voice so they came back but the polytheists were closer so they immediately started attacking the prophet and you have to remember that it was daytime there were no places to seek shelter with and you had only nine men facing 200 plus Riders and men and everyone who was just waiting for the right moment the opportunity to inflict any form of harm on the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so they surrounded the prophet and the polytheists attacked this group of nine or ten men the Muslims meanwhile were confused because of what's going on some of them fled the battlefield and went to Medina and they were not Hypocrites they were original Companions of the Prophet but they were confused they did not what know what to do and they took the wrong turn they made the wrong decision yet Allah with his Mercy forgave them this mistake they fell in and among them was pleased with him and other prominent companions other companions were also confused because the Army was from behind and from the front so they just started killing left right and Center and they killed some of the Muslims by mistake for example are they familiar man and his father were in the battlefield yeah man was an old man and they the Muslims started hitting him and killing him and Hadith is shouting Brothers it's my father it's my father but they could not hear him they were so confused they did not understand what was going on and at the end of the battle the prophet saws gave her thefa the blood money for his father because he was killed by mistake and the and Hadith did not accept that he said it's for Allah and this Drew him closer to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam another group of the companions did not know what to do so they dropped their weapons and they just sat and felt hopeless and helpless why because some of them cried out that Muhammad sallallahu has been killed some of the polytheists cried and shouted to them that the prophet had died and was killed so they said why do I why why fight if our beloved Prophet is dead then let's die like he died and they gave up another group of the companions wanted to contact Abdullah the head of the Hypocrites they wanted to go to Medina and talk to him so that he would intercede with Abu sufyan so that they can leave them alone it they were so confused they didn't know what to do amidst this confusion they were again acts of Bravery that uplifted them back again another may Allah be pleased with him he was the uncle of anas IBN Malik and it's been another came and said o Allah I seek your Refuge and I am not connected to these people who have abandoned fighting at your cause may Allah be pleased with him and he told Saad oh sad I can smell Paradise from beyond Earth which means that I'm going to die I want to die I can I can feel it it's so close to me and he charged to the Army until he was killed and again this is not suicide Anna said another he charged to the Army and asking and encouraging his people to follow suit it was reported by another Malik Melody pleased with him that they found his uncle anas even another Dead with more than 7 87 stabs of sword and a a stroke of a sword and spear wounds who's trying to protect the prophet sallallahu no no no no no no it's nothing to do with the protecting the prophet Islam he was on his own just fighting and charging the the enemy Army more than 87 almost 90 wounds all in his face in his front body which meant that he was not giving them their back his back now imagine if someone gets stabbed once maybe if you're strong enough you're gonna stay stand and fight but to be stabbed more than 80 times until you die he was not beyond recognition they could not identify him until his sister came and recognized him through his fingers only by looking at his fingers and hands they could tell and say that this was another may Allah be pleased with him also one of the acts of bravery and Abdullah was the father of the companion Abdul Abdullah he reported a lot of the prophets uh saying sallallahu Abdullah told his son that I believe that I won't be back from the Battle of so take care of my daughters and he charged and fought at the sight of Allah until he was killed his brother-in-law and his son also fought at the side of Allah until they were killed Martyrs at the side of Allah by the way had a very strong limp and he was prevented from going in the Battle of Badr by his sons he had four grown-up sons and told they told him don't go out why do you want to go out and you're a sick man and Allah has given you the permission to go out so on the battle of this tried to prevent him but they hit but he went to the prophet salaam and he complained so the prophet told his sons let him go and maybe Allah would honor him with martyrdom and so this was the case and his wife which is the aunt of Jabra Abdullah lost her husband her brother and her son on the same Battlefield I believe we have a break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back that the translation has been indirectly influenced with the Israel we haven't face any problems in our preparations we can't call it the wise Egypt you have a huge amount of initiative going on in terms of developing qualifications in different parts of the system reading helps you um they are all uh welcome to uh participate in the discussion and the debate about the development of qualifications what types of books our children do or should read join me for further discussion Focus point foreign a light in every home and welcome back other signs of Bravery was displayed before the battle Abdullah and said both of them were Brave fighters of Islam was known in Islam that Allah would always answer his prayer so whenever he raised his hand Allah would answer his prayer immediately and before the battle of Abdullah said listen why not pray and supplicate to Allah and each one of us says Amen to the other so that Allah would answer our prayer oh Allah I pray to you that on the Battle of that you make me fight a very strong and brave man and we have this Jewel and at the end of the day grant me Victory and let me kill this man and take all his possessions from armor Shields swords and so on said I mean and now it's abdullah's turn to supplicate so he raised his hands and said oh Allah when the time of the battle battle comes I pray to you that you give me a very strong and brave Warrior where I fight with him and we exchange blows and then let him kill me at the side of Allah and chop my nose and ear off so that when I come on the day of judgment and you ask me Abdullah what happened to you I would say oh Allah it happened in your course I mean and they fought at the end of the battle sad tells us that he looked amongst the dead the dead and he found his brother Abdullah exactly as he described with his nose and ear hung in a string and he said by Allah his supplication was far better than mine because I did get my armor I did get to kill the warrior that was against me but his supplication was far better because now he is in Paradise it was confusion and chaos yet a group of the companions did not give in they did not surrender may Allah be pleased with him among a group of his companions charged because this was the weak point the weakest link they went and charged but Khaled managed to kill them all but they showed a fight to it also among the acts of Bravery one Muslim from the ansar was in his blood dying and the Muslims passed by him in confusion and he told them what are you doing so they told him Prophet Muhammad is dead so he was dying he told him so what are you waiting for go and fight until you die like he died and this boasted their morale more and more now as we know the prophet saws was among nine only of his companions seven from the ansar and two from the muhajin and they were said Allah among the ten uh uh people given the Glad Tidings from the prophet saws that they are in Paradise and they were charging they were attacking the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam with a stone and the prophet fell on his side and his head was bleeding here there was a wound in it and one of his teeth broken and one of the Rings of his helmet's shield was stuck in his cheek to one or two of them so he was also bleeding from his cheek one of the evil enemies of of uh Islam Abdullah came from behind the prophet and hit him with his sword on his shoulder but because the prophet was wearing the shield he did not penetrate that Shield but it affected our Prophet saws one whole month afterwards in pain and Agony because of that blow and again this evil man he before the Battle of Bader dug holds and covered it camouflaged it so that some of the Muslims would fall in and the prophet saws tripped and fell in one of them and it affected his leg that he could not walk properly properly and the companions fought bravely to protect the prophet Islam so you can imagine that he was surrounded by so many people wanting to kill him the seven of the ansar were there willing to sacrifice their lives so the prophet said Allah who would who would defend us the remaining and Allah will make him with me in Paradise on the day of judgment this is a reward everybody is waiting for so one by one they fought until their death until the seven died at the foot at the feet of the Prophet Allah was an extremely excellent Archer so the prophet sallam took his arrows and spread them in front of him and said throw and kill them may Allah make my father and mother for your sake and this is an Arab expression saying that I give my father and mother for you or for your sake just do that used to hit and he used to pinpoint whomever he hits and always it was a bullseye when the seven died the prophet would prevent him from fighting whenever he said who would fight them and protect us and Allah will make him with me on the day of judgment wants to go up but the prophet tells him stay until the seven died and now he told him you go and fight and the Hadith says that he fought more bravely than the ten combined he fought so hard to the extent that his hand was paralyzed and some of his fingers will almost torn because of protecting the prophet Allah he was hiding the prophet behind him and defending him he was shielding the prophet salallahu with his body and he had more than 39 wounds imagine 39 wounds in your body and you're still striving you're still striking you're still defending and fighting for the sake of the Prophet to the extent that the prophet said to his companions afterwards whoever wants to see a martyr walking on Earth let him look at Allah who's the first Khalifa and the closest to the prophet Islam said that the Battle of our heart that day was all forth was the man he stood firm with the prophet alaihissalam and after all of this Abu Bakr and managed to reach the prophet Allah and they started to fight alongside with said so now there are four of them and of course us that he is one that is equal to a thousand men and he was a great leader of Muslim Expeditions and and armies and they started fighting so the Muslims started to sit back again to regroup they're all coming back to the prophet saws to protect him they could not care they care could care less about the Battle itself they wanted to protect the prophet because they thought he was dead and now they have this hope and Allah described this in the Holy Quran by telling us that they were so depressed because of their loss of the battle that some of them dropped the swords they gave up and then Allah gave them another thing to be depressed more which made the first depression far easier the second one was that they thought that the prophet died so then they gave up if the prophet has died then there is no reason for us to continue to live and then when they knew that the prophet was alive they were so happy and joyful that the first Depression was was which was the Lost of the loss of of the battle did not seem so bad so they started to regroup around the prophet Allah among the first who came back were abujana they were all coming back to circle the prophet and to protect him with their own bodies shielded the prophet saws and whatever arrows came it fell under attacks on their on their bodies and was also known with his high voice and that was would terrorize the people when he shouts and scream in them may Allah be pleased with him himself so what did to the prophet saws and he followed him until he chopped his head off he chopped his head off who do you think was competing with how to to kill um his brother he was anxious to kill his own brother because of what he has done to the prophet but was the first to reach there and he killed him on the other hand may Allah be pleased with him was carrying the flag of the Muslims they attacked him they chopped one of his hand and he held it with the left they chopped the left and he hold it with his chest to the ground until they killed him and it went on and on and on now the killer was Abdullah who attacked the prophet before Allah and because Muslim looked so much like the prophet sallam he thought that he killed the prophet so he shouted that I killed the prophet of Allah and to know what happened next I'm afraid we have to wait until next time we meet so in until then um foreign mm-hmm"
