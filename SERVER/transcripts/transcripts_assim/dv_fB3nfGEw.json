  "title": "Husband and Wife both work and have a joint account, how to give Zakat? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says both husband and wife work and save money in a joint account their joint money exceeds nisab but not when divided into two as they share as the share is 50 50. how should they give zakat if they're putting the money in this shared account just for the sake of convenience but they know that he owns 50 and she owns 50 percent and both monies do not individually reach the threshold in this case there's no problem on them both and there is no zakat on them but if they're keeping their money in a joint account mixing and having shared ownership not caring who owns what in this case they have to give zakat and i'll give a word of advice to all brothers and sisters keep your financial savings and transactions separate from one another if you as a sister earn money don't share what you earn with your husband don't tell him how much you earn and don't tell him how much you save and don't give him access to your wealth or to your atm or to your bank account details he might feel sad angry disappointed it's okay this is the best in order to ensure the continuity of your marriage because most likely if you ask him the same if you ask him to give you access to his bank account to his atm and to know how much he earns and when where he spends his money he wouldn't give you that so shaytan is always there lurking in the dark waiting for the right moment to strike i've seen so many problems from people having such joint accounts ending up after 10 or 15 years with the man marrying someone else with her money i've seen as shared with you so many times about those people who confiscate the gold and the wealth and the maha of their wives and give it to their parents for safe keeping actually for keeping and this is theft and haram so this is my advice and allah azza knows best"
