  "transcript": "[Music] James I am interested in Islam but I believe in evolution so it it's kind a barrier yes it is it is a barrier but if you're interested in Islam you should look into what Islam has to say and you should also look what evolution has to say because even the students of Darwin himself reject the theory of evolution after they after he died and some of them wrote books condemning this Theory and proving with scientific evidences that it was wrong all religions on Earth states that Adam is the father of humans and that Allah created him so why should I believe someone who came 60 or 70 years claims to know something that nobody else ever claimed that when you say that we evolve from apes but oh unfortunately there's a missing link and we don't know where this Missing Link is and whether we are from the orangatang apes or from this or that and they show you the drawing of an ape then getting his a little bit straight and and a little bit straight in the caveman and then all of a sudden he's a straight person walking straight okay what is the missing link they don't know how did this happen they don't know it's all theoretical and has no scientific proof and even if it has scientif scientific proof I would go always with what Allah say and what his Prophet wasallam taught us rather than believing in a group of men who claim to be scientists scientists and they say this or that I would not believe them I would believe my own heart I would believe my own intellect I would read the Quran the perfect book that was revealed from Allah that was unchanged and will be unchanged it is unchanged for the past 15 centuries I believe in this book and I believe in it miraculous Revelation and the scientific facts that it includes therefore I'm willing to take it all the way rather than believing in what a group of men say and who are opposed by numerous number of scientists maybe higher in education and knowledge than them just simply because this is what people like the word of evolution Allah [Music]"
