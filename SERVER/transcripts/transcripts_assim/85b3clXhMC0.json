  "title": "Attending a Non-Muslim's wedding and working there as a Photographer | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "israel says i work as a wedding photographer and started out in the muslim community as my main client i've recently been getting inquiries from non-muslim weddings such as christians hindus etc i wanted to know the parameters around photograph photographing events where alcohol is present if i do not photograph the actual consumption could i still photograph it isra first of all what is the ruling on photographing women a lot of scholars prohibit photographing men or women alike based on the fact that they consider this to be image taking or making similar to drawing and the prophet said those those who make images who draw whose sculpture are the most severely punished people on the day of judgment so some scholars regarded photography as similar to drawing because they are simulating the creation of allah azzawajal the most authentic opinion which i am inclined to is that this is not true because photography is actually mirroring allah's creation so if i look at myself in the plasma screen which i have in front of me is this considered to be imitating the creation of allah no this is the creation of allah if i look at a mirror this is the creation of allah if i sign a check and someone xeroxes it takes a copy out of it and i see my original signature on the check and the copy would i say that this is mimicking imitating my signature or this is my signature the answer is definitely this is my signature so i'm inclined to the opinion that photography is permissible with the exception of two things one it is not permissible to take photographs of females grown-up women unless there is a legitimate reason such as identification cards passports etc but for a woman to take a selfie or to post her picture on social media or just to keep it from memory this is totally haram this is how i see it the reason and justification is that this defies the purpose of hijab if the pictures were to fall into wrong hands if your device with a mobile or laptop or pda were to be sold or stolen even if it was formatted all that was taken and saved in it can be retrieved again also the pictures of the deceased so a person who's dead my father my grandfather my grandmother my uncle my aunt they're deceased i must not keep their photographs because this may lead to something me not necessarily i'm not going to worship them surely but it may this is how the worship of idols began at the time of prophet noah peace be upon him as mentioned in the surah and as interpreted by abdullah ibn abbas may allah be pleased with a man with his father so this is per photograph so israel for you it is not permissible to work to have this as a profession photographing weddings or parties or celebrations of women of muslim women this is totally prohibited now the issue of attending such weddings of non-muslims is an issue of dispute and this is a problem nowadays because the attempts of all people muslims and non-muslims around the globe is to dilute our religion so we find that they're trying to uplift any boundaries between religions we find that there are even so-called scholars or religious leaders who invest in such attempts to uplift to remove totally the muslim identity and you have to be careful nobody's gonna care for you if you don't seek allah's guidance and support and you try to preserve your identity it will be gone with the wind not the movie but the actual thing how is that we find so-called muslim leaders religious leaders going into synagogues going into churches going into temples sharing the platform with disbelievers claiming that this is okay and this is not okay this is not at all acceptable in islam neither in the quran nor in the sunnah they know it but it is dirty politics they have not been appointed at such positions except because they serve the policy the strategy not because they are true scholars or true men of god of allah azzawajal so the issue of attending weddings of disbelievers this is not permissible in islam providing that the rituals of the wedding their religious rituals is being conducted so to me to go to a church where there are statues and idols of mary of saint john's and whoever they have of jesus so claimed to be on the cross etc being there is prohibited being there when the actual ceremony takes place for us as a muslim to attend is prohibited we should not witness such disbelief which is in our religion disbelief to them this is legitimate we have no problem with that you guys have your weddings you have your celebrations there's no problem in that for you but for us as muslims we cannot attend because we would be witnessing the priest saying in the name of the father the son and the holy ghost and we believe that there's only one god there's no god worthy of being worshipped except allah azza and that jesus christ peace be upon him is one of the greatest messengers and prophets of allah but definitely he has nothing of divinity in him he is not a god or a son of a god rather he is a human being so being there and witnessing such disbelief is totally prohibited for muslims but if after leaving the church at nighttime we they have a reception in a hotel and they invited me i would weigh the consequences if the pros outweigh the cons then i will uh answer this invitation providing that it is there is nothing haram so if it is segregated it's only men and there is no music which is haram in my religion and there is no intoxicants being consumed then i may attend but this is a bit far-fetched because non-muslims would not have this the least what they would have is maybe a bachelor party and you know what happens there but hypothetically assuming that this is possible alhamdulillah you can go other than that israel i hope this makes the answer clear to you"
