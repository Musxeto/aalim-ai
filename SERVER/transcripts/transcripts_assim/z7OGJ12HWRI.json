  "transcript": "faatima says in the non-muslim country when the criminals when the criminal is punished by the government or the victims we feel so satisfied and we think such punishment saves the criminal saves the criminal right is thinking like this permissible of course when a perpetrator is punished in Islam we must not feel sorry for them Allah Dajjal mentioned in the beginning of surah 2 nor that the adulterer and the adulteress must be flogged a hundred lashes and a group of believers must be witness to such implementation of prescribed punishment and Allah says in the ayah and you should not feel sorry for them you should not feel or have pity upon them so this is how a Muslim feels when such prescribed punishment is implemented"
