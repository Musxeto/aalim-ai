  "transcript": "I want to direct the next question to Sheikh Asim Sometimes Sheikh Asim, I personally also received this question when they were saying that yes, we agree the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam Suffered so much in his life and he is close to Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala But they said that we are very far. We are not like the Prophet. The Prophet are close to Allah Allah able to comfort him, but we are far from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala. What is your nasihah for this kind of people Sheikh? Get close to Allah Very short one mashallah There is nothing you could do either you get closer to Allah get the content and the comfort in this life or go to hell Yeah, and it is not no third option You could bitch and whine excuse my French all day long and nothing is gonna change when Allah Tests you with a calamity if your son dies You have two options you have option one is to be content and say inna lillah wa inna ilayhi raji'oon and Be patient and say alhamdulillah Is your son going to come back to life? No, no He's not but you will get a house in Jannah mansion called baytul hamd Because Allah Azza wa Jal tested you and you were patient and praised him Option two you can bang your head against the wall. You can tear your clothes. You can slap your face you can Object and complain. Why me? Why not anyone else and shout and scream for a whole month Is your son gonna come back to life? No the same result, but you will be sinful You will get a lot of sins on the Day of Judgment and you will lose all your reward. So Allah sent us the messengers Allah Azza wa Jal revealed his Ultimate and final revelation in Quran. The guidance is in our Quran If it was enough Allah would have given us each a copy But no, it's not enough. It's not enough in the sense that he has to he had to send out of his mercy and Compassion to us a role model a teacher who we would see him in front of us Doing what we think that this is impossible. It's undoable So now this role model has faced so many calamities and when was tolerant and was patient You can do the same. So you do the same you'll be with him in Jannatul Naeem You fail to do so then you have only yourself to blame Mashallah, mashallah. Very wonderful answer. I need to press it more, you know to get the pulse out it mashallah You"
