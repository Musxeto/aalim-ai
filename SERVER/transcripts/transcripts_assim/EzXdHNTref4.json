  "transcript": "Sheikh, I had asked you a question about the pronunciation of Daal as Zaal and pronunciation of Tha as Sa. So I wanted to consider. What did I say? What did I tell you? What did I tell you? To check, but I had checked with one of my brothers who is a half-faith of the nearby masjid. Okay. And what did he say? He had said that it is the correct pronunciation, but it is one of the Kirats. Khalas. Alhamdulillah. Move on."
