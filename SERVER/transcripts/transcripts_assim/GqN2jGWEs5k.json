  "title": "Imam doesnâ€™t say Ameen after Fatiha, do I say it & say Ameen again when I conclude my Fatiha assim",
  "transcript": "yeah like if if let's say that I'm praying in congregation and the Imam does not say like I mean after Surah fat and if I say a mean would I be like and after saying a mean if I recite Surah fat would I be like reciting it twice in Salah no there is no problem in reciting the fa after the Imam has recited it and even if the Imam does not say aan saying aan is a highly confirmed Sunnah but it is not mandatory nor it is a pillar of the Salat so if he drops it alt together the prayer is valid most likely he follows a school of thought that states that reciting Ain loudly is not correct which is definitely incorrect by itself the confirmed Sunnah of our Prophet Alat was that after Rec WR in the and saying he would raise his voice saying so not the following row would hear it even the row behind it the second row would hear him say aan and this is one of the dangers of blind following I wonder how could you call yourself a proper Muslim when you know that the authentic Hadith which the compan ions delivered to us stating that the prophet used to say loudly and you say no no no I'm not going to say it I'm going to shut my mouth and say it silently because my school of thought says so Subhan Allah you'd rather follow your IM rather than follow the prophet Alat wasam there is something wrong in your head so if you conclude the fa or the Imam concludes the fa and you say aan then you recite your own faat and say aan this is totally permissible and there's nothing wrong in that"
