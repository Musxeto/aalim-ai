  "transcript": "asses third question was about wearing the traditional Arab soap Arab garment the one like the one I'm wearing at the moment this white long shirt so it's like a dress or something so he says is this Islamic in the sense first of all we know that the Prophet used to wear Ali in salatu salam alikum is camis which is a shirt that has sleeves and that you get your neck through it and the length of it is not prescribed so it can be as long as mine reaching just over your ankles and it can be like the sure wall camis worn by our brothers in India and in Pakistan and Bangladesh and it can be shorter than that meaning that the dress code itself is not part of the Sunnah per se it is a cultural thing we have a coach saying that you must not expose your our it must not exceed your ankles you must not show your thighs etc should not be tied see through imitating the cough are all of these restrictions however there isn't a special form of uniform that Muslims are required to wear so if I go and travel to the Eskimos for example to Alaska would I be wearing this definitely not if I go to Europe would I be wearing this I would wear what the people we're providing it's not something specific for them so we do I do not encourage people specially minorities someone who lives in Germany to wear a soap because you will stand out in a crowd not only that this is not your usual clothes thirdly people may not accept your Dara when you look different to them they would probably be intimidated I wouldn't say that it's Haram in some cultures it's okay if you go to Birmingham for example you find everybody wearing it's okay people are cool with that no problem but it would be wrong to look down at people who are not wearing it and say look they're not following the Sunnah they are not committed to the religion etc this is not acceptable at all"
