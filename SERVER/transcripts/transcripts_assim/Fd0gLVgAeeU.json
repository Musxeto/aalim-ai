  "transcript": "sna from the US so I'm asking whether I'm telling you right now is against Sharia or not so in the past some people have wronged me deeply they made my life extremely difficult and stressful the effects of their actions Still Still linger and I continue to suffer because of it both physically and mentally so in a word they destroyed my life so I often feel over overwhelmed by the pain and humilation they caused me at times I told Allah that I forgiven them but when I'm reminded of the hardships and the hurt I feel the same pain all over again and it's it's like it brings me to tears so this experience has taken me like made my life very bad so in those moments I return back to Allah and say like Ya Allah I cannot forgive them I leave their matter to you so is saying this one's forgiven and this coming back oh no I haven't forgiven forgiven them is permissible or not rest against sh first of all if you forgive someone and you tell Allah that I have forgiven them you cannot go back in this and even if you go back in it it would be an act of transgression from your side because once you forgive them it's gone you cannot go back in it similarly in one way or the other to when we give someone a gift in Islam it is prohibited to retract your gift or to go back and say oh okay give me back my gift the prophet saidat we do not have the worst of examples a person who goes back in his gift is like a dog that vomits and eats back its own vomit it and this is a very heinous example just to illustrate how bad it is so once you did it for Allah's sake you cannot go back on it and say no I'd like them to suffer and to punish for what they had caused me because this is too late and Allah Knows Best"
