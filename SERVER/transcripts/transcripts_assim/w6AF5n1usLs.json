  "title": "Will I carry the sin of others if I taught it? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "from a sister if i enabled others to sin would i be punished every time that person does that sin would i carry that sin forever even if i have repented first of all the prophet said ali salazar an authentic hadith whoever [Music] gives way to sins to be committed meaning he initiated it he taught people how to do it he gave the wrong example he was the role model so that people would follow suit then he will be accountable and he'll be credited with all the sins others make because of him and not a single sin would be deducted from theirs so he will be accredited it till the day of judgment so this means that if you facilitated a sin you helped someone to sin you taught someone how to sin then that person whenever he commits the sin you are accredited with it you get the same amount of sins though you don't you did not commit it so if you taught someone and i know a brother who's a practicing brother subhanallah who used to play music he was a good guitarist and after he yani masha allah repented and quit playing music his cousin came to him and said to him teach me so he started to teach him how to play the guitar and he taught him how to read notes etc though the brother himself was memorizing the quran was punctual in his prayer but subhanallah there is this love to teach and there is this love to lead in a sense whether evil or good and i remember advising the brother don't don't do this this is haram for you to practice and it's even worse when you teach others he said no no no he's my cousin etc he's just learning it for himself 20 years later this cousin of his has records and it's being sold subhan allah and he has built a reputation of being a musician and all of this is pouring in that practicing cousin of his who taught him how to play music so yes it is sinful and you will be sinful for everything that you have taught unless you repent and ask allah for forgiveness and show remorse then this is in allah's hand and we hope and pray that allah would forgive and not hold you accountable for that just like allah"
