  "title": "Is telling someone about my wiswas of mocking the Prophetﷺ or Allah considered to be uttering it?",
  "transcript": "Hamad from Kuwait. Hello, can you hear me? Yes. Can I ask two questions or only one? First of all, you have to give salam. I'm sorry, salamu alaikum. Salamu alaikum, then you can ask only one question because we have very limited time and a lot of questioners are in line. Okay, so I have a friend who was complaining to someone about his wiswas and he said that he had wiswas about mocking the Prophet ﷺ and Allah. Is this considered speaking of it? If the guy is trying to seek counselling and he has a very serious issue of wiswas and he's unable to control it and he has to get it off his chest to get counselling from a psychiatrist from a shaykh or someone, this is inshallah not speaking about it. But the ideal was that he zipped his lips and did not say anything. But if he was boasting about it, like so many people say, oh I have this wiswas about this and that and he boasts about it, he's happy about it, this is speaking about it and he's sinful for that and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
