  "transcript": "and because i am a non-um arab speaker i sometimes hold my phone in my hand and there is one quran in which there is translation and the quranic arabic text as well so i can understand little bit of arabic because i'm learning arabic as of now the quranic alberta i'm trying to learn it so during the taravi i look at my phone because i can a little bit understand what the imam is reciting so i just look at the translation and follow the imam so is it something i'm not doing right or is it also to do that it is prohibited it is totally prohibited for a person in salat to engage in reading something other than the quran so by reading the translation you're actually occupying yourself with something other than the quran you say but it's the translation of the quran the answer is yes but it is not the quran so it is not permissible for you to read the translation at all during prayer and some would say that this may invalidate your prayer altogether it's like reading a hadith or reading a an article on the newspaper or reading your messages on whatsapp this is not permissible yes it's a translation of the quran but this is not the quran this is not part of the salat or the part of the form of worship and allah knows best you"
