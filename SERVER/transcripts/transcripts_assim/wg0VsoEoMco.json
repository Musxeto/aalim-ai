  "title": "Is it SINFUL to increase the price to make profit to the extent that general public cannot afford it",
  "transcript": "Ahnaf from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh We know that a merchant is allowed to sell his product at whatever price he wills. But what about those who, in order to make extra profit, cause the prices of the products to increase to the point that it becomes quite impossible for the general people to afford it? Is it still allowed? Of course it's allowed, Ahnaf. This is my pen. Usually it's sold in the market for let's say one dollar. If I display it for a hundred dollars, who in his right mind would come and buy it? I don't know. If I put a sign of Bugatti on it, I'll find many crazy people willing to buy it. If they buy scooters with a Bugatti sign, this is crazy. But if they are crazy, why not make benefit and profit out of them? So I display it for a hundred dollars, for a thousand dollars. If they're crazy enough to buy it, I'm more than happy to take their money. So this is in accordance to demand and supply. When people know that all the markets around me and the shops sell it for a dollar, nobody's going to come to me. But if they do, well, I can't help not take their money."
