  "title": "Compulsory to say Salam entering leaving Masjid",
  "transcript": "for one to say Salam when he enters the Masjid and when he is leaving the answer is no and this is the short answer is it compulsory no and usually you don't have to elaborate because the person is asking am I sinful if I don't give Salam or not and the answer is no you're not sinful okay is it recommended or not ah this is a different uh uh uh question the most authentic opinion is that it has nothing to do with entering the Masjid giving Salam saying alayum unless it's for the IM on a Friday before he goes to give his sermon it is not mandatory it is not recommended depending on you meet whom you meet so if I enter the m and I meet someone and I sayum this is okay because I want to greet him I want to speak to him but what some people do by entering the Masjid from the door or the gates of the m and those who are praying those who are reciting the Quran those who are making they're being oblig those who making Dua he interrupts them so that at least some of them would answer him back no this is wrong so is it mandatory no it is not is it Sunnah depending if you're meeting someone so if you come and enter the Masjid you have to pray two raas before you sit down afterwards if you see someone and you get give him Salam this is uh permissible and the evidence of it is the Hadith of the man who came and prayed two Ras and the prophet told and and came to the prophet and gave him him Salam and the prophet said go back and pray because you haven't prayed so it indicates that the man first started with prayer which is obligatory then he came and gave Salam to the prophet Alam we have um"
