  "title": "Deception in Western and Missionary Education - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "Instead of teaching in schools that the young girls and boys should not have sex, you should not keep girlfriend boyfriend, they teach you no problem, it's good but condomize yourself, use condom. We learn in this western education that you should build old age home. Old age home means you know when your parents get old if they start troubling you you put them into old age home so that you are free to enjoy in Islam there's nothing like old age home Allah says in the Quran in surahman chapter number 31 verse number 14 and 15 we have enjoined on the human beings to be kind to the parents in travel upon travel that did the mother b them and in years twin was the meaning and the verse continues verse number 15 that if they do jihad they strive and struggle to make you worship somebody else besides Allah they don't obey them Allah repeats the message in surah ak chapter number 46 verse number 15 we have enjoined the human beings to be good to their parents Allah repeats the same message in surah in kabut chapter 29 verse number 8 we have enjoined the human beings to be kind to their parents And Allah says in surah Isra chapter number 17 verse number 23 and 24 that you have to worship only one Allah subhana wa ta'ala and if your parents reach old age if one or both of them reach old age don't say of to them but rather lower to them your wing of humility and address them in honor and pray to the Lord as they cherish you in childhood. Pray to the Lord that blessed them as they cherish me in childhood. So after worshiping Allah subhanana wa tala, Allah says you have to be good to your parents. But in the western society they teach you how to make old age home so that you can get rid of your parents and you can enjoy life without them. So there's a difference between societies and the education. Many a times when we go to Christian missionary schools and we know even the country where I come from India many of the schools and colleges and universities they have been established by Christian missionaries and there the majority studying in their school and colleges are not Christians but the non-Christians including the Muslims they made to pray every day to Jesus Christ peace be upon him. And indirectly many of our Muslim children they are being brainwashed and this is happening in different parts of the world. For example, when the young children of ours go to these missionary schools, they are given chocolates. On the chocolate wrapper is mentioned, hey Ram. When they eat it, the chocolate is bitter. They open another chocolate on the wrapper is mentioned, oh Muhammad. They eat the chocolate and it is bitter sallallahu alaihi wasallam. Then on the third chocolate is mentioned, oh Jesus peace be upon him, the child eats the chocolate, the chocolate is sweet. So without saying a word what will happen to the mind of that child? Ah Ram is bitter. Ah Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam is bitter. Ah Jesus is sweet. So without saying a word they are leaving a message on the young children when they go for picnics and this is happening common when they go for picnics suddenly the bus stops then the teacher says now let's take the name of Muhammad oh Muhammad let the bus start and the driver put the ignition bus does not start then they say let the take off take the name of Ram and let the bus start the driver puts the ignition bus does not start then the teacher says oh everyone take the name of Jesus they take the name of Jesus and the bus starts this is happening common they're leaving a mark on the child that if you ask from Jesus you get what you want if you ask from N Mo Muhammad you don't get so we have to be careful which education we give our"
