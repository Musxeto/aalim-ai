  "title": "Do we HAVE to face the Qiblah when making Dua for the people in the grave? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The next question is When I visit my father's grave, his grave is in the middle of the cemetery So, while walking towards it, I pass by other graves And I make du'a by facing him Should I go to the grave to make du'a or can I do it outside? No, you can do du'a for anyone who's engraved Who is buried, whether he's your father or anyone else Without the need to face the Qibla There is no need to face the Qibla But if you do face the Qibla, make the grave between you and the Qibla And you can raise your hands and make du'a So, why do you want to make it outside? You're not praying Salat Salat is not permissible to be prayed in a cemetery, in a graveyard Salat that includes bowing and prostration This is totally prohibited But to pray in the du'a and to invoke Allah O Allah, forgive them, O Allah, have mercy on them O Allah, expand their graves This is permissible to be done as you're walking And this is the du'a we say As-salamu alaykum And so forth, no problem"
