  "transcript": "the next question assum sirum I am Muhammad anuli medical student of aiims as from West Bengal India I stay in a hostel and my roommate is a Hindu he has some small statues of their gods so is it mandat to cover these every time when I attend to Salah please explain I cannot attend every Juma because of the class schedule so I do Zar at Tiff time is it right or wrong please explain Muhammad has asked two question number one he stays in Hostel and his roommate is Hindu and his Hindu friend has got many Idols of the Gods so he's asking when I pray in the room should he cover these idols brother when you pray you have to pray towards the kah you have to find out from the compass from your mobile that where is the kah after you identified the K you have to fa in the direction of the ca for praying now when you face in the direction of Caba in front of you there should be no Idol if the idle is behind you no problem so if the idle is in front of you or you can see the idle while praying see you to shift it behind you or out of your field of vision if you cannot shift it then you cover it you explain to your non-muslim friend your Hindu roommate that I'm a Muslim I'm not supposed to pray in front of Idol but if the idol is out of your vision somewhere behind there's no problem if in front of you you shift it behind keep it at the side or behind you so that you cannot see it and your prayer is valid if you cannot shift it you can cover it with the cloth so that it is not seen coming to your second question that you miss your jum Salah because it clashes with your classes so what do you do you pray a z during a tiffen time or lunch break is it correct it's totally wrong a Muslim is not supposed to miss his jum Salah normally a Muslim should offer his prayer in congregation in musk some Scholars say some Scholars say that it is some say it is according to IM he puts it as if you regularly miss your normal Salah if you do not pray in congregation mosque it's a Maj you puts it as 65th or 56th number of major sin so some schol say some say it is far some say it is if you miss it jum there is no difference opinion jum is a f on every Muslim and if you miss for three jum there's a Hadith that know it can the black spot is there can without any valid reason can can go to KU without any valid reason so normally you cannot miss unless if you're traveling okay you need not pray it's not F toay traveling or if you're sick or if there's a valid reason but because it clashes with your education classes this is no valid reason at all and you in West Bengal mashallah West Bengal is one of the states of India which has mashallah substantial percentage of Muslims and one of the safe places when I say in my talk if you have to migrate you know one Kashmir has a large population then Kerala is there even with Bengal has a large population and West Bengal has millions of Muslim I'm sure if you tell to your teacher that you know you want to go to prayer during Juma I doubt they'll object and mentioned in the Constitution the Muslim personal law is there worst comes to wor you miss it no problem if you can see through that you can change the timing of the class if not you miss it there is no comparison between attending an educational class or Juma Salah and jum Salah can't be prayed in your hostel or your college it has to go into a mosque or a place where Juma is offered if your college is a Muslim College where jum is offered alhamdulillah so it should be read in a congregation and you cannot miss it for pettities unless there's a VAR in like traveling and if phic Etc so my my advice to you asking is it right or is it wrong it's totally wrong it's Haram so you cannot miss your Juma Salah and see to it my advice to you would be that pray even your five time Salah in congregation in a mosque since you're living in West Bengal West Bengal masah has got many MOS most of the you will find mos in most of the places it will not be far away so my advice to you would be see that you pray five times Salah in a mosque in congregation and jum Salah in no way should you miss single jum Salah unless there's a valid reason hope that answer the question"
