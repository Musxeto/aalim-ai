  "transcript": "Sulaiman over him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu sallim wa barik alaa muhammad ali l-'alameen nabina muhammad in 1 AD he was like eh me i'm a bad couple of days ago i was asked about the ruling on protests and I said it's not permissible and this led to so many negative remarks a negative is the least I could say about it so abusive so insulting and Twitter was filled with those people who come to the first time checking my tweet and commenting on it with the grace of Allah I don't get affected by such negative remarks or comments mainly because they usually come from ignorant people and people that have no influence so whenever you check their followers you'll find 3060 followers which tells you that they are either nobodies or they are paid to have an impact on Twitter and the social media we call them electronic flies we have a lot of them here what concerned me was that those who tried to comment had no knowledge of the quran or of the sunnah and this is problematic this is an issue of halal and haram if you would like to comment on it the list is to be qualified so without going into a lot of details protesting is not an Islamic concept some ignorant were trying to even lie and say that the Prophet is Aslam protested for thirteen years in Mecca Subhan Allah how blatant lies can easily be passed through people the Prophet SM ordered his companions not to protest not to fight back not to do anything that would cause annihilation to the Islam and the Muslims at the time this is why it's what was called a peaceful period of 13 years and whenever they came to him and requested that they defend themselves he would not allow it others would say that Musa and Ibrahim and so on where protesters subhanAllah these were messengers of Allah what Allah ordered them was specific for them not for everyone else and they had their own religion and their Sharia their own Sharia law and Islam we don't follow their teachings if it goes against our teacher for example use of peace be upon him it was permissible for the people to prostrate to their kings and this is what his siblings did when they came to Egypt so would anyone say that okay I can prostrate to my parents or to my king or to my president this is absurd now the concept of protest is confusing some people say you ignorant imbecile Disick Allah here I'll take from your good deeds on the day of judgement I have no problem didn't you hear that hadith of the Prophet Isis am the best jihad is it truthful advice given to a tyrant ruler said yes I've heard that but anywhere did the Prophet say that say this publicly no protesting is something that is public and it only leads to something that is Haram the Prophet said that is salat wa salam whatever you see something evil you have to prevent it with your hand if not with your tongue rhetoric if not then by your heart and this is the list of Eman authentic hadith but again this is different than protesting protests and demonstrations are against Islam simply and straightforward because our righteous predecessors from the Companions and from the terrain and from tabut a beam did not do it they did not march in streets let alone loot shops burn property and attack innocent people they haven't done anything of this so this is those whom we take religion from we do not take our religion from the west or the east we could care less if they do demonstrations and protests as we see at the moment happening in the u.s. their cause of being upset and angry can be justifiable but their actions are not yes George Floyd was an innocent man killed unjustly by a number of cowards who should be prosecuted and convicted and jailed this is manslaughter but this does not justify the protests and demonstrations and the killings of innocent people looting a relics shop breaking windows of showrooms attacking properties attacking shop owners for defending their shops just because they're white where is the justification or share could be it went out of hand this is what Islam says no protest because inevitably it would go out of hand Islam is based on fundamentals Quran Sunnah the understanding of the righteous predecessors this is something given however there is another concept of priorities so pros and cons would help me judge an issue and this is confusing to those who do not have knowledge even our best may Allah be pleased with him a man comes to him and says is a murderer capable of repenting will Allah forgive him he said yes another man comes after awhile is a murderer capable of repenting will love forgive him even a message no the Companions of regna baths were shocked they said two different people same question two different answers he said yes the first one had remorse in his face I knew that he killed someone so he's asking about the possibility of repenting and I told him yes nothing prevents you from repenting the other one had sparks flying from his eyes intending to kill someone but he wanted a carte blanche so I told him no there's no repentance for you to prevent him Islam is based on pros and cons advantages and disadvantages a logic tells us in the Quran mohamad they ask you about intoxicants and gambling sake there's a lot of sin in them and there is some benefit being a good gambler being someone who sells wine I'm making a lot of money so there is sins in it for those who are affected by it but there is benefits for others Allah says there's sin far far over ways their benefits which means is prohibited likewise Allah says that do not curse the idols that they worship for they would in retaliation curse Allah so to prevent cursing Allah we refrain from from cursing their idols that they worship falsely look at protests what good can it bring oh it pretty how does a lot of good in it you imbeciles don't know okay show me because we can ask for justice we can ask for a fairness we can ask for things to be straightened up and if they don't we will continue to protest and demonstrate and loot and burn and do heinous things okay ten years ago we had something that was called the Arabian Spring demonstrations and protests peaceful took place in Tunisia in Syria in Egypt in Yemen in [Music] Libya and thirty years earlier the same happened in the late 80s I think it was 1989 in Algiers when the Islamic Front Salvation and thought won the elections and the army came to overturn this with the blessing of Francois Mitterrand the French president at the time who said that we will come and invade Algiers if the Islamists were to gain power and for a decade killings and bombings and lootings and terrorist attacks from both parties from the Army and from the so called one of the Islamists it devastated the whole country divided the whole nation resulted from what protests look at Syria look at Libya look at Yemen look at Egypt look at these countries who had a life before such protests people used to go to work people used to go to schools people had businesses they had a passport that they could travel anywhere in the world with they had hospitals they had a life protests demonstrations in addition took the collaboration of tyrants caused this situation so what does protest and demonstration achieve when you answer a question like no protest is Haram and you get this bombarding attack from so many different people and they criticize what you say okay so what who's backing you up chef try to have been bass been are they mean that Alberni jihad had frozen and the doing of the Salif no no no not enough you want more none of my business I'm telling you what I think what I believe what the scholars of the self belief you don't you have beef with it that's your problem this is not mine a mathematical Nana's was beaten up by the ruler never protesting never going out and calling people to demonstrate imam ahmed was jailed and beaten up for a couple of years never ever even making duaa against the muslim ruler even taymiyah was locked up for so many years and died in prison did he ever call for a demonstration or to overthrow the government never so what people are doing at the moment is totally wrong who's doing it scholars of Islam no series of knowledge most likely no laymen people who have zero knowledge about Islam some would argue and say ok chef the protests we were talking about is in the West where the Muslim ruler does not exist so what you're saying is correct with Muslim rulers but what about a kafir country and what about if the kafir ruler himself allowed us to protest and say that this is part of your Constitution and your civil rights this is an issue of dispute if the kafir ruler allows it the laws of the country allow it and it is most likely nothing negative would happen it's an issue of dispute I personally am inclined to say no because this includes free mixing between men and women it may include the possibility of evil people infiltrating the crowds and making heinous things killing civilians or blowing up something so that the army and the police would attack these protesters though they have nothing to do with it and this have been reoccurring in so many different scenarios and countries that we know of now one always hears and reads what's your deal from the Quran and the Sunnah subhanAllah yanny Twitter is not a place to put your Delisle there are publications written on this and I'll quote you a number of hadith the Prophet says and whoever has a ruler who's having power over him and he sees the Lord ruler doing a sin he should abhor the sin but not take his hand out from obedience and the pledge of allegiance to that ruler his sinful yes we know his sinful hated abhor it with your heart but remain obedient so that we would have the coherent and we have the unity of the community the Prophet said as a son whoever abandons the congregation the Gemara and leaves obedience of the ruler he would die the death of jahiliyya the Prophet said RA salatu salam when his companion said o prophet of allah there will be rulers among us who we acknowledge some of the things they do and we refuse and reject some of it the Prophet said Isis Salam due to them their rights and ask Allah for your own rights now people who are by nature rebellious and unfortunately ignorant they would say are you are defending the tyrants and most people who say this and I don't want to name countries but their country is literally a piece of junk not because the country doesn't have the tensions but because of the population they are rebellious no matter how many presidents come and take care of their country they try to do their best some religious Imams or leaders hear their call for a rebellion call for demonstration protests and you will see the people in the masses on the streets crippling the economy crippling everything else nothing happens the army comes in disperses every everyone killing few here and there things go back to normal but the people are still rebellious they don't have any knowledge in the Quran and in the Sunnah in Arabic language is nothing they don't care about what is happening look at Syria look at Yemen look at Libya look at other countries were that were affected negatively by these peaceful protests they're unable to find a shelter to take them in no food starvation Wars killings burnings of property and this is not the doing of the population by the way this is a doing of a handful of irresponsible people usually youth thinking that we can change the world what did you change nothing some occupied territories where Muslims are being occupied being lynched being attacked by the kaffir army people are calling for resistance okay how many are there of you we have 5000 how big is the enemy army about maybe 50 million what arms do you have nothing only daggers and maybe pistols what arms do they have you name it they have it when you attack them as a form of resistance will the army only select those who attack them to attack back or they will try to annihilate the whole Muslim population why don't you think in a holistic way or share you want us to die as cowards you want just to retreat at the entrance I don't want you to die as a coward but I don't want you to die and take with you 50 or 100 thousand innocent Muslims who just want to eat pray fast and live a normal life they are not rebellious as you you want to destroy the whole region and burn the whole land and after a few years you say well I didn't know it was that bad now you know so what we are telling you it's not being coward Allah mentioned in surah Anfal at the very end in the beginning in islam one person should not flee if he's fighting ten so an army cannot flee if they are facing ten times more than them allah awj l knew that this was difficult so abrogated it and said one man must face two and not run away if they're free he's entitled to run away an army can face double his size and must not run away even if this would end all of their lives but if they are more than double their size they have the permission to run away and regroup and get reinforcements so what is happening worldwide people don't know their little religion and this is why I had to record this lengthy video I don't know even if I'm gonna publish it or not but I'm gonna give it a try think it over and I hope that the people would a bit expand their mind and restricted tongues not to speak without a lab not a knowledge if you have knowledge we can communicate we can ask but sweating using abusive words and profanity any person could do that only us Muslims would refrain from using it because though I love to swear back at you and show you some of my arsenal but my religion prevents me my upbringing stops me so I hope that you have something of that in the future and Elijah knows best sallahu Salaam Baalak are lenabena Muhammad"
