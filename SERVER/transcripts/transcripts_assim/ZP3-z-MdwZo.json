  "transcript": "so the brother is asking what are the most important things someone who gives dawa that must be known so his dawah can reach old men and old women right I don't know why old men are old women why not young men and young women that way is that one it doesn't matter about how old you are so when you give dawa you're actually teaching the Islam so the first and most important thing to understand in giving dawa is what you are calling people to what do you mean some people focus on Haram you have to pray like this you have to do like this some people focus on teskia you have to have Iman [Music] some people focus on issues of apida and by Akida we are referring to different sects and Cults oh this cult is this is this is uh this this is this this is this but this is not happy either this is studying Cults and sects so what should we be focusing upon number one when the prophet Allah he stayed in Mecca for 13 years correct there was no fasting of Ramadan there was no zakat there was no Hajj or umrah Salat was introduced only in the last one or two years for 11 years almost no Salah so what was the prophet doing 10 11 years what was he doing he was teaching people Iman what is Iman every time I ask people what are the five pillars of Islam foreign but when I asked him about the six pillars of Iman six pillars I thought there was 500. I said no no there is another six pillars of Iman they don't know and this is the most important thing you should teach yourself and your children and your brothers and took Meena to believe in Allah the day of judgment the Angels The Messengers The Scriptures the books whether good or bad now the vast majority of Muslims don't know these pillars and those who know them when you say to them to believe in Allah what does that entail that Allah is existing no that's easy everybody knows Allah is existing to believe in Allah means that you believe in his beautiful names and attributes look at beautiful names of Allah if I ask you what is the meaning of foreign so I don't know I don't know I don't know okay what do you know Allah this is a problem 99 Names of Allah azzawajal and you don't know him so when you pray Allah who are you praying to Allah what do you know about him nothing nothing which means that there is a deficiency when you raise your hands to make Dua you don't find full hundred percent dependence and Reliance and Trust on Allah and this is one aspect and this is why we have problems with our sins we can't get rid of our sins because we don't know Allah Allah is watching us Allah is listening to us but we don't acknowledge that to believe in the day of judgment of course to to believe in Allah entails I will take six hours to explain this they don't have time so and to believe in the day of judgment what does this entail what will happen before death the signs of the day of judgment major and minor also what will happen after death how the angels will take your soul what will happen in Your Grave how long you will stay there what will happen on the day of judgment when you are resurrected from the grave then how you will be held accountable in a day that is 50 000 years long and how you have to pass over which is a bridge on top of Hellfire and who will survive and what will happen when you come to al-haud book what will happen when you come to the al-antara and how is the scale going to weigh your with your records your Deeds everything is in the day of judgment Angels how many are there what are their names what are their duties then you come to the prophets and Messengers then the scriptures then this was what the prophet was teaching the people in Mecca and this is why they had the strongest Iman the strongest belief when Wars took place they did not run away they remained standing and defending because they had the conviction we don't have this amen if we're praying now in Fajr in this Masjid and we are very crucial and the imams boy is very nice and one cat one pussycat comes in between the legs what will happen to the worshipers jumping in afraid why no trust in Allah and even worse if you see a cockroach the Imam himself I said we have a problem we don't know Allah that is why we can't find the sweetness of Salah of so this is what you should be teaching and you should be teaching the children and everybody once you do this inshallah your dawah will be very uh effective"
