  "transcript": "Sahara or Sahara Ali says if the gold is not 24k is it stills accountable and if I have money and gold but the gold does not reach the nisab do I have to pay for it first question if the gold is not 24k this means that it has some impurities in it so 22 karat of gold means that there are two out of the twenty-four which is copper or other types of minerals eighteen karat of gold means that there are six impurities in it this is also the catabolic at is the cata book but how to calculate the nests up it's easy if you have 90 grams of 18 karat gold you multiply the 90 grams by 18 and divide the result by 24 and you will get what's 24 karat of gold in it so I'm not good with calculations this is the calculator if we have 90 grams of 18 x 18 carat and divided by 24 this means it's 67 grams and a half so it did not reach the threshold which is 85 and the more you go up and do the same procedure multiplied by the carat of the specific goals you have and divide by 24 to know whether it had reached the nisab or not if it reaches the nisab then you ask the jeweler shop to estimate the value of this gold and give 2.5% over it okay let us assume chef that I have sixty seven point five of 24 karat gold as in the example you just just calculated but I have 20,000 reals in my bank account in this case you have to combine both and gives a cut over both the twenty thousand reals would definitely buy enough gold to make the gold you have reach the threshold and exceed so you have to combine both and give 2.5% of it as zakat"
