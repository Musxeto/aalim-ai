  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m [Music] [Music] [Music] alhamd we are still discussing the events that took place on the sixth year of Hijra and on that year the prophet Al wasallam sent a military Detachment led by Abu may Allah be pleased with him and he led uh and he sent him to monitor and observe a route used by the people of qur for the trading so he just sent him there to see if they're using it or not and then that they the Muslims would be able to uh acquire such Caravans commercial Caravans when they went there the prophet Alam gave him only a small bag of dates and there were 300 men imagine 300 men with only a small bag of dates and they went they had no uh uh uh alternative they had to obey the prophet Alat wasam and they had their trust 100% in Allah the almighty they knew that Allah would not let them uh astray they went and every single day abua would give each Soldier one piece of date and the companions asked those who were on that expedition how did it suffice you they said well it didn't but we used to suck it like a child and drink water alongside with it and this would suffice us from day till night so one single date and then the dates ran out so they had to eat tree leaves whatever they found green on the on the on the ground they would used to eat and that is why this Detachment is called which is the leaves and another name of it is and they were so hungry to the extent that they had to slaughter three camels and they were 300 so a camel for every hundred and then abua told them not to do this anymore because then this means that you would not have anything to travel on and with the grace of Allah they found when they were close to the coast a big whale on the shores of this Coast the story says that they stayed there the 300 men eating from that whale for a whole month and it was so big that when they put the ribs of the whale a man on top of a camel could easily go inside this uh uh uh place so it was a very big whale they had a lot of food from it lots of meat and they dried some of the meat and they took it back to the prophet Alam who himself ate from it and we learn from this that when whenever you have your full trust in Allah Allah will not abandon you never but you have to have the full trust in him and also we learn from this that it is lawful for us to eat the food of the sea no there's no need to slaughter it and even if it dies at Sea before you you you you fish it it is still permissible for us uh to eat now after all of this we move on to one great battle in Islam not because of the number of soldiers and not because of the destination but because of the events that took place alongside this Great Expedition and this is known as the tribe of b or and this is the name of a water and Oasis by the name of this uh uh battle took place on the sixth year of Hijra some say it took place in the fifth and others say it took place on the fourth year of Hijra whoever uh um each one gives his own uh uh interpretation and dates and some Scholars say this took place before the Battle of because mu was attending it and as we know s mu died soon after bani when he gave his verdict that they are to be killed the Warriors and he died afterwards because he kept on bleeding until he died uh uh of the effect of that arrow that he was hit by on the Battle of kandak so whatever time it took place in whether it's a fourth year fifth year or sixth year the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam went out in 700 Fighters he went out to uh uh this area accompanied by Hypocrites on that particular Expedition they decided to come along with the prophet he drew Lots among his wives because he had he wanted to take only one sallallahu alaih wasallam anda's uh turn it was so she went with the prophet he went to B and are part of the tribe of and if you recall were on peace treaties with the prophet Alat wasam and they always they were always allies of Islam if you recall and his role in uh uh uh Islam because he's the one who went to poist Army after the battle of UD and told them that go away don't go back to Medina because the prophet Sall is coming with lots of people the Battle of b as you can see on uh uh the plan it's a little bit too small but I hope inshallah it suffices uh the prophet alhat went to them while they were unaware of his coming so they were watering their animals they were preparing for a new day and the prophet came in the very early morning the Sunnah or the custom of the Prophet Sall wasallam not to attack a tribe without notifying them and calling them to Islam with it was a completely different story first of all because they were introduced to Islam before he sent people to call them to Islam and they rejected it and thirdly because they were enemies of Islam they themselves from the tribe of K alone they went and fought with the aabish the army of aabish who came to attack attack the Muslims in the Battle of UD so they were enemies of Islam and that is why the prophet did not give them a warning as he usually uh uh uh did and they were attacked stories say that a number of their soldiers were killed some say 10 some say more some say less and uh they managed to gather from them 2,000 camels and this is the beauty of this battle and 5,000 sheep you're talking about a lot of cattle and they ins slaved 200 families from them as they were the enemies of Islam and the prophet wasam uh uh he spent one full month on that expedition on the water or near the water of the one incident took place and this incident was utilized by the Hypocrites as they were resting near this water and and filling their water tanks and and watering their animals and drinking themselves washing one boy a worker a laborer belonging to alaj the the migrants had a small quarrel with another boy who worked for Al Anar and they quarreled a little bit so each one went back to his people and called them to fight the boy from the muhajirin said oh muhajirin come to my Aid and assistance and the boy from ansar said oh ansar come to my Aid and assistant and both parties came and this is where Satan is the Hypocrites started provoking this side and that side and trying to put fuel to the fire abdah the the Hypocrites who is present here were they apparently known as Hypocrites or were they just well they people did not know that they Hypocrites in the sense that they were labeled as Hypocrites they had feelings that these people are not sincere the prophet knew them but he would never call them or label them as uh Hypocrites so they still had Islamic faces yes and they used to pray as we're told in the Holy Quran that they themselves pray in Masid in the mosqu with the prophet but when they stand up to pray they do that in laziness they're not uh uh so quick to attend prayer they spend money as Charity but they do not spend it for the sake of Allah they they even say by their mouses that they testify that the prophet is a prophet of course as in reported in where Allah says that they come and testify that you are the prophet of Allah but they say with their mouths what is not in their hearts so they are hypocrites so so they put the fuel to the fire put put to the fire among the muhajirin and the ansar and they almost most engaged in fighting when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam went to them and said what is this do you call with the Call of Jah of ignorance you want to come go back to uh uh pre-islamic times and they calm down now look at the label though they called themselves ANS and M yet the prophet because it was used in a context that was not suitable called this ignorance so what about if someone says I'm a from this country or from that country and what about if a person says I'm white and you're black and what about if a person says so and so labeling people and trying to divide them into parties and each party is happy with what it has this is completely un Islamic in Islam we have only one thing to hold on to and that is our religion our belief in Allah this diversity we have is all melded and blended into Islam alongside this event the Hypocrites showed their ugly face I believe that we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we will be right back [Music] I say that the translation has been indirectly influenced with the Israelite n we haven't faced any problems in our preparations we can't call it uh the uh wise uh H Egypt you have a huge amount of initiative going on in terms of devel in qualifications in different parts of the system reading helps you um gain knowledge but serving the N it doesn't help you at all they are all uh welcome to uh participate in the discussion and the debate about the development of qualifications what types of books our children do or should read join me for further discussion to focus point Huda a light in every [Music] home asalam alayum and welcome back the Hypocrites always have a role in provoking problems and causing FNA among the Muslims they have their role in spreading sin as mentioned in the Holy Quran here on this battle of they showed their ugly face and that was when abdah Sal the head of the Hypocrites when he heard about the scuffle that took place between this uh muhajir and this Ansari he said they've done that they've encouraged to attack us and to say bad things about us by Allah when we go back to Medina the dignitaries and the Men of Honor would get those humiliated people out of it so now he's saying that they have the honor and the Muslims are the humiliated and insulted one to be kicked and he also said this is our mistake as the Arabs say feed your dog and eventually your dog will eat you and this is was a great insult because now he's who who who do you think he's intending with this Prophet The Prophet s wasallam and the Companions and he also said to his companions do not support the Muslims Muhammad and those who are with him do not give them money do give them facilities to his unfortunate luck Zade Aram was there who was a young boy and he when he heard this he went to his uncle some say it was some say someone else and he told him what took place and he reported that so they went to the prophet Alat wasam and told him this what took place so the prophet brought Abdullah and he told him did you say this said by Allah I did not say anything this is complete fabrication I'm innocent and I did not say any of the reported so the prophet Sall wasallam accepted his speech and allegation and rejected Z's testimony simply because this is the Islamic practice now when someone comes to you and testifies that he had seen someone do something you cannot take his word against the words of the accused those who claim to have seen something they must provide us with the evidence without the evidence the only thing they had the the only thing they have is for the accused to swear by Allah that he did not do and I'll give you an example if for example I come and claim that I lent Abdallah 100 real and I go to the judge and I say I want my money back the first thing the judge would say would be do you have proof do you have documentation do you have witnesses if I don't have any of the above mentioned then I do not have any evidence with me the judge turns to Abdullah and says do you agree to his claim do you confess if Abdullah does not confess he would say no I didn't and I swear by Allah I did not borrow anything from him so this is enough the same thing with z and abdah Z claimed that Abdullah said but Abdullah swore by Allah he didn't so the prophet wasallam treated him as he said but when Zade went home every everybody was blaming him how do you lie why do you say such bad things about Abdullah now the prophet wasam does not like you and he doesn't like want to look into your face and he said I was depressed so depressed that I couldn't sleep until Allah the almighty revealed a whole chapter of the Quran by the name of the chapter of the Hypocrites and the prophet Sall wasallam smiled when he saw Zade and and he told him that Allah authenticated your story and now everyone knew Abdullah on his real identity one of the companions came to the prophet Alat and told him that you have to understand prophet of Allah just days before you came to Medina migrating to us from Mecca we were about to Crown Abdullah as the leader of Medina as the ruler and king of Medina your coming to Medina destroyed all of his dreams and that is why he has so much hatred against you and against Islam this took place but it was not taken easily by one very close person to abdah Sal and that was his son Abdullah Abdullah the father and the son have the same name Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him went to the prophet wasam and he told him oh prophet of Allah no everybody knows in Medina that I am the most obedient son to his father no one takes my place I'm the only person in Medina that is known to go out of his way to please his father and the prophet acknowledged that he said therefore prophet of Allah if you want someone to kill my father because of what he had said then please give me this order and I'll kill him with my own bare hands because I'm I cannot guarantee myself if someone else kills him and I see the killer of my father walking on the streets that Satan does not come to me and orders me to kill the killer of my father therefore let me do the job look at this love and respect and obedience to Islam the man doesn't hate his father he loves his father so much that it is a well-known fact in Medina but his obedience to Islam his respect to the prophet Alat made him go and asked for the permission to kill his own father that he loves because of what he had done and his allegation and justification he does not want to kill a Muslim who did the instruction and who performed what the prophet instructed him to do the prophet Alat wasam prayed for Abdullah Abdullah and asked Allah for him for forgiveness and told him have no no worries we will be on good terms with your father and we will be on good company as long as he lives nobody is going to kill him can we take a lesson from that that the words of the polies of the Hypocrites don't uh you know Force the prophet or don't force us islamically to get into actions towards them or retaliate against them unless they do an action no no we cannot do that simply because stood up once this was clarified and sought the permission of the Prophet to kill abdah he's he he had said something that would damn him forever and he had committed an act of blasphemy by just insulting the prophet Sall wasallam this is blasphemy there's no second choices yet the prophet sallallah wasallam told him no Omar I do not want the Arabs to talk that Muhammad kills his companions that would be bad for the image of Islam because previously he was acting as a companion so if he done something wrong it would be seen as he killed his own people yes and again the prophet Alam thought of the Lesser evil now the choice was there you kill Abdullah nobody t but the whole of Arabia would object and say don't accept Islam because Muhammad kills his companions so what do you think he would go he's going to do with others and also if he kills Abdullah Sal the Hypocrites and those allies among them and maybe some Muslims with weak faith and Iman would try to retaliate or to stand by their deceased leader but look at the wisdom of the Prophet Alat once this took place before that incident whenever he talked people listened especially his people because they respected him as a leader and immediately after this incident whenever he talked they all hushed him and told him don't speak it's not of your business so he Lo he lost faith he lost faith with his people trustworthy and and this shows you that the prophet's wisdom Alam was on its right and and his decision was completely correct and in its place the prophet Alat wasam when he went back to Medina stood Abdullah Abdullah the son of Abdullah stood at the gates of Medina and when he his father wanted to enter Medina his son prevented him with a sword and he said son what's wrong with you are you crazy he said father you said that the honorable and the the one with dignity will kick out of Medina those who are humiliated and insulted you meant the prophet s wasallam well the honored and dignified is the prophet Alam and you are the insulted and humilated one and I I will not allow you to enter Medina until the prophet wasallam himself gives you the permission to do so and the prophet Sall wasallam allowed him to enter Medina look at the way the prophet used to treat his enemies look at the prophet Alam how he used to treat his enemies with kindness and with Mercy now we have to recall and remember that Abdullah was a hypocrite and though he was a hypocrite the prophet s wasallam used to go out of his way so that he might like and accept Islam as a real Muslim to the extent that even when he died the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam took his shirt and he gave them so that he would wear the shirt before he was buried the prophet himself s wasallam wanted to pray the funeral prayer but he was denied by Allah and Allah told him as in surba if you pray seven 70 times over them I will not forgive them and the prophet said Alam if I knew that Allah would forgive them more than 70 times I would have prayed more than 70 times and he is indeed the mercy to the worlds I believe that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time all [Music] [Music] oh h [Music]"
