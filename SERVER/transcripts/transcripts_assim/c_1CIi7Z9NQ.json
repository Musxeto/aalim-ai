  "transcript": "Sheila rahmanir rahim and hamdulillah or salat wa salam ala rasoolillah well ali wasabi woman is dead i Behati a westerner vicinity Helio Medina I'm a bird assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we began discussing hadeeth number 20 of from the two Academy which was compiled by one of his name's is Nikodim and Makdissi he's better known as Abdel Hani al German le and Makdissi so this is why they differentiate between even Kadam and mock the CL morph up who compiled alimony and they differentiate between this great scholar though Archie similar narrated Aisha may Allah be pleased with her Abdul Rahman bin abu bakr and turned upon the Prophet while I was supporting the Prophet on my chest Abdul Rahman was holding a fresh sea rock with which he was cleaning his teeth a last messenger made the blessings of Allah and peace be upon him looked at it so I took the sea walk I chewed it with my teeth and made it soft and then gave it to the Prophet may the blessings of Allah and peace be upon him then he made the blessings of Allah and peace be upon him cleaned his teeth with it I have never seen a Las apostle cleaning his teeth in a better way after finishing the brushing of his teeth he lifted his hand or his finger and said three times oh Allah let me be with the highest companions and then he died I shall used to say he died while his head was resting between my chest and chin albahari this hadith is quite emotional because it is describing the final moments of our prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam and as we know that the biggest and hardest calamity a Muslim faces is in the death of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and the Prophet told us in the authentic hadith whoever is struck by a catastrophe or a calamity he should remember his loss in me the prophet of Allah because then every other loss would be negligible the greatest loss one of us may have encountered is the loss of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam and as we know that he fell sick for some time before he died and the scholars say that this is because of the effects of the poison he ate sallallaahu Selim when he was invited to eat from a meal that was prepared by a Jew woman and the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam when he was on his dying bed mother aisha is telling us how he was lying and resting his head between her chin and chest so she was like embracing him sallallahu Hari who he was seldom when Abdul Rahman even Abubakr her brother enters the room with fresh c-walk and she noticed she could tell by the way the Prophet was looking that he was interested in it but he was unable to speak it was hard for him to talk so she took it she softened it by biting it until it was soft and then she gave it to the Prophet who cleaned his teeth in a way second to none and then after he had finished cleaning his teeth salah salem he raised his finger he raised his hand and said o allah make me among or with the high companions marloth et al Allah and he died sallallaahu are you listening and the Rafi kilala are those mentioned in Surat Annisa that those who were favored and blessed by Allah to be with the prophets with the subdue pain with the martyrs and with the righteous waha Sunnah Allah Iike a la Fitte and he's saying here are graphic and Allah so he is pointing to his wish of being with them and why did he say this the Prophet said that is allowed to say no prophet would die unless he is requested for approval or for permission that is meaning that all messengers of Allah before they die the Angel of Death Comes to them and seeks their permission that Allah so Allah says that you are to die now so am i permitted to do this and we know a lot of hadith regarding this issue for example hadith of Moosa when the Angel of Death came to him disguised as a human being and Moosa was startled so he punched him in the eye and he made his eye go as in the human form so he went to Allah and he said o Allah you sent me to someone who does not want to die so he told him to go back to Moosa and tell him Allah says that you are to die but if you want to prolong your life put your hand on the skin of a bull and every single head under your hand would mean a year extra for you how much would that be a thousand more so the angel of death went to Moosa but he introduced himself now and then Moosa asked him and the angel of death said that Allah says put your hand on the skin of a bull or of a bison and with every hair you get one year and then moosa says and then what after 100 years 500 thousand years then what angel of death said the inevitable which is death so moosa said no if this is the case let it be now and there are so many cases and different stories but the hadith is obvious that the last thing the Prophet did is a lobster and before he died was using the sea walk which indicates how important it is for us the following hadith had is number 21 yes yeah before that can I make addition to the miss Walker distinct like a medically it is proven that the mouth is the harborough's of all bacteria and the many heart it means had ready to do mouths because of bacteria so don't you love this prophetic advice he's a good father MA because you know come back until using you are having a good mouth which you know is helping your I agree I agree with the fact that it is medically proven but again I would not wish that we go under this road meaning hypothetically hypothetically if Islam tells us to do something and medicine proves that it is not good what would I do can I give you a very odd and strange example the Prophet said early salat wa salam and the hadith is and Buhari when a fly falls into the cup of one of you dip it Gani take the fly and dip it again in the liquid because in one wing it has the illness and the other wing it has the remedy and the cure for that illness now two hundred years ago those who were not believers said what kind of a disgusting hadith is this stuff for Allah first of all we have to know that if the fly falls into my glass I'm not forced to eat to drink it huh I may cause it away but if I were in Somalia and they had this glass with a fly in it do you think they will toss it away it's something for all times and for all places Islam is for a limited or a specific place however 200 years ago the people did not approve of this even vision Buhari it is unacceptable it's not logical only 20 or 25 years ago medical reports and research not from the Muslims from the disbelievers proved this prophetic hadith and it was examined in the laboratories that the more you dip it the more better it is for curing and killing all these bacteria in it so 200 years ago what would you say about the hadith those who were practicing and believing they would say I could care less about what your medical reports are and until today I could care less as long as the hadith is authentic my prophet said a terrorism I believed it blindly therefore I would not always like to connect the Quran and to the Sunnah to nowadays sciences why because today they come with a theory saying that this verse of the Quran is mashallah is very great it's excellent it's gold coincides with science two months three months down the line another theory comes and says no the theory that proved that this ayah is correct or that hadith is correct is a wrong theory so what will happen I would have been playing with the Quran Sunnah and degrading them and allowing them to tarnish its reputation no I believe in the Quran and Sunnah regardless of what science says I hope this clarifies it we have a break so stay tuned and sharla we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back hadith number 22 yes brother narrated moguri mahira even surah said once i was in the company of the Prophet may the blessings of Allah and peace be upon him on a journey and I leaned over to take off his coof leather saw he ordered me to leave them as he had put them on after performing ablution so he passed wet hands over them the hadith is narrated by Marilla it been sureba may Allah be pleased with him and he's saying to us that once he was with the Prophet on a journey Ali salatu salam and it was time for prayers for the Prophet wanted to perform ooodle so admirably Schreiber was pouring water for the prophet and the Prophet was doing Woodill until it came to the part of washing the feet so Al Mualla leaned down to take off the shoes of the Prophet of Islam and the Prophet told him leave them for I have entered my feet in my leather socks which is known as hoof while they were in the state of purity meaning I was in the state of Buddha when I put them on and then the Prophet simply passed his wet hands over them and this concluded his evolution so what is this hadith talking about the hadith is talking about Messi Al Hussein wiping the two hoof hoof is a leather - and nowadays anything that you wear on your feet is considered to be hoof whether it is your shoes or your Sox's or a special kind of leather socks that people use in some parts of the countries especially in house they call it Jerome OOP or MOOC or woof all of these are different names now having said that when we read the of the Quran that tells us about Woodill it says to wash your feet but there is another Tara which is to wipe your feet and the scholars of a hallucinogen ah they all agree without any differences among them and that is washing the feet when they're bare is mandatory but wiping on the socks is permitted and it is part of the Sunnah wiping over the shoes wiping over the socks wiping over the leather thing that is covering your feet providing the conditions are there now this wiping over the shoes or the socks is not only found in books of it is also found in books of Aikido why because it became a sign of al-sunnah the Shia reject wiping over the socks completely and consider it not to be valid and that is why I'm a Muhammad Amin humble and so many great Imams of Sunna said I know that more than 40 companions have reported that the Prophet asam used to wipe over his shoes and socks so there is no way of error and that is why it became a sign of eres una whoever wipes on his socks or shoes he is part of the center and whoever Alexis or the objects this is not part of them however there are conditions condition number one you cannot wipe over your socks or over your shoes unless you put on your socks and shoes while in the state of wouldl otherwise it's no good and this is something that a lot of the Muslims don't realize they there is wiping on the socks or the shoes but they don't understand these conditions which is essential for example I went to Masjid for prayer of hijiri I pray treasure I went home I slept for an hour or an hour and a half I woke up I put on my socks my clothes and I went to work the her time is there I want to perform ablution can I wipe why because when I put on my socks I woke up from bed without doing any wudu so I put them on while not in the state of Woodill second scenario I went to prayer for time I put on my socks I prayed for I went to my bed and slept woke up and went to work while having my socks on since Roger know her time is in can I wipe on my socks yes because when I prayed father I was in the state of purity so I would I put my socks on do I have to put the socks immediately after all huh no I don't maybe I may go do at four o'clock in the morning five six seven at eight I put my socks on but I did not know if I'm oh you do so I put them while in a state of purity so this is the first condition the second condition is that you cover the whole foot up till the ankles the ankles included so your shoes nowadays are not in compliance because they're below the ankle if you're wearing a boot or wearing a shoe that has a high neck then this is permissible but if you're wearing your socks is more than enough and we have problems people say the socks must be very thick it should not have any holes it cannot be transparent and all of these are not acceptable these are not conditions who put these conditions you and me the Prophet told us has some to wipe on anything that we wear on our feet even if it was transparent even if I can see the skin thus it is considered to be hoof even if it had a hole in it even if it had a hole in it because the hoof of the Companions do you think that were made in prada no there it was made of any leather they could wear it it has so many holes in it yet they still wiped on it so these are the two conditions there is a third condition regarding time and can I wipe on my shoes until the day of judgement no because you will not live until that day secondly because there is a time bound the Prophet said for those residing how many one day and one night and for those traveling three days and three nights and when does the time of the day and night start from the time I put them on or from the time of wiping from the time of wiping meaning I could pray while wearing my socks more than one day and night and I'll give you an example someone makes woudl and prays Hajer know her as her mother Abe and Asia with the same Udo he's got you know a septic tank that is very big huh and after Asia he puts on his leather socks and answers the call of nature and goes to bed so he prayed five prayers with his socks let him wear it in the morning so all these five prayers were prayed with the original woudl with his socks on he went to bed he woke up in the second day but one doodle and made his wiping so prayed for our celebration and went to bed before Fajr prayer before Fajr by completing the 24 hours he woke up and made what do I made Russell and then he prayed with the same model door our Maghreb and Asia so these are three days wearing the socks but actually the time of wiping is that you have to do the 24 hours understood inshallah okay we move on to hadeeth number 23 I think yes who will read this so Dave have nellie a man may allah be pleased with him and his father reported I was with Messenger of Allah melt the blessings of Allah and peace be upon during a journey he the Prophet urinated performed evolution and wiped over his soul okay this is the same context different sahabi Haditha if Nelly a man may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he says that he was on a journey the Prophet urinated perform doodle and then wiped over his leather shoes as mentioned before okay do we have any questions yes yeah shaking the earlier this you mentioned that at the final hour of the prophets alehsalaam he did mention oh Allah raised me amongst the highest one yes companion company now there is a special macomb for a place for rasool allah salla standard Mikami mahmoud yes there is exclusive for him so can you note that is an exclusive DVD for him now about the company is asking up to raise among the company that was a big yeah not coming the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam told us that whenever you hear them as then giving the iran repeat behind him and then offer salat ation to me and ask allah azza wajal for al wasilla well favilla was mohamed mahmoud this special high status because by allah this cannot be except for one individual and i hope he did not say I am he says I hope the time this individual and we know that he is this individual and that is why the Prophet was so humble especially when it came with allah azza wajal when it's with allah he would not say i'd like he would say o allah I'd like to be with the highest of companions whom we know to be the Prophet SAS adoring the martyrs and the righteous of his own very quickly a Brahmin shed what advice do we have for the people who take too much of logic into religion regarding the hadith of wiping over rather than under the feet in this hadith the hadith is attributed to Ali may Allah be pleased with him he said if Islam was logic then it would have been wiping the bottom of the shoe rather than on top of the shoe and the hadith is fabricated because logic says that you have to wipe over the top if you wipe under it's going to be even worse because it wouldn't make it moist and it's going to catch more dirt to it so attributing this hadith to Ali saying that Dean is illogical this is not true Islam is logical but whose logic is it is it the logic of the man in a white house or in the Kremlin or in the black castle or in the island of Tora Bora or whatever it's the logic that coincides with the Quran and Sunna and this is difficult to find unless it is in compliance with the Quran Sunnah Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila what Salam o aleikum allahu alahi wa barakato"
