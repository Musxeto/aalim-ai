  "transcript": "dear brothers and sisters in islam and welcome to this new episode of women around the prophet salallahu among our mothers among the wives of the prophet salem whom we all acknowledge are the best of women there was a wife and her name was zainab bintu khuzeima and her father's name was jose mahevnil hadith her mother was a famous woman by the name of hind bin tauf bin zuhair hand had many daughters and she got her daughters married to some of the dignitaries of quraish so just to be married to one of her daughters meant that you will be connected to so many in-laws and people who are related to you through her so she was the mother of zainab may allah be pleased with her the mother of the believers and she also was the mother of maimuna bintil who later on became the wife of the prophet alaihis salazar also she was the mother of um the wife of al-abbas the uncle of the prophet alaihis salatu and she was also the mother of salma bint romas the wife of the uncle of the prophet islam hamza ibn abdulmut she is also the mother of asma been to umass who was married to jaffa ibn abi talib the cousin of the prophet salam when he was martyred she married abu bakr as-siddiq the first caliph and when he died she married ali the brother of her first husband and the cousin of the prophet of salah to assalam so her in-laws her family those who were connected to her and to her siblings were honorable people and no wonder because someone that the dignitaries of quraish seek after getting marriage from their daughters must be of a certain caliber zainab was known before islam to be caring loving and merciful to the poor and to the needy and that is why she was known as the mother of the needy um when she died she was only 30 years of age and before the prophet alaihis salatu salam married her she was married to ubaidah ibn harith and ubaidah is one of the first to accept islam and he was among the three heroes of islam who came to a duel in the beginning of the battle of badr the first major battle between truth and falsehood between islam and disbelief 300 plus men only going out to attack a convoy coming from syria to makkah looking for the money for the wealth in compensation for what was taken from them only to find that they've missed that caravan and instead an army of a thousand men or more with knights camels with full ulterior artillery and weapons fully armed is there to fight them they only took something that was to be used with a caravan unarmed so they didn't have any heavy weaponry so in the beginning the disbelievers the idol worshipers and shaiba the sons of rabia came out asking for a jewel so three from the people of medina from the ansar came out and identified themselves but the idol worshiper said you are honorable people but we want our next of kin we want our own people the muhajireen the migrants to fight them so the prophet al-sassam ordered all from his closest kin and they fought and they managed to win hamza killed the one he was fighting ali killed the one who was fighting rubaidah ibn harith and if i'm not mistaken it was rudba who was fighting him they exchanged blows and they were injured so then they finished him off ubaidah was injured in this battle and soon afterwards he died now being the cousin of the prophet alaihis salat and his wife being alone in medina the prophet alaihissalatu assalam proposed to her and after marrying hafsah the prophet proposed to zainab bint huzaima in the third year of hijrah and the prophet allah salaam married her only to live with her for only three months in some narrations say eight months she soon afterwards passed away and died so she was the second wife of the prophet ali salazar to die in his lifetime there were only two who died in his lifetime khadijah the mother of the believers may allah be pleased with her and zainab bin may allah be pleased with her but in these three months she gained the honor of this life and in the hereafter for being our prophet's wife in paradise sallallahu alaihi the second wife we are to talk about today insha allah is a well-known name so whenever you hear her name you don't have to look for the daughter of someone so-and-so so whenever you hear the name of khadijah this is an icon you know it when you hear the name aisha this is an icon by itself you know it when you hear the name um this is an icon of its own her real name is hind bintu abi um nil muhira and he was among the generous men of quraish and this is an attribute to be praised when you're known to be generous and to give this is something to be proud of in arabia her mother was and she was named by selema because she married her cousin abu salem and abu salama may allah be pleased with him is the cousin of the prophet his mother is so he was one of the prophet's cousins alaihis salat was salaam and his name was he was among the first to accept islam alongside with um and they suffered greatly in the beginning of the introduction of islam to quraish so they had to migrate to abyssinia then they traveled back to mecca and then abu salama traveled and migrated to medina he had seen so many things in his life when he wanted to migrate and he was among the first and some say he was the first to migrate to medina his in-laws came to the outskirts of mecca and they said to him if you want to go this is your problem and if you want to take your wife with you then this is your problem so when she was prevented from going and accompanying her husband her in-laws the family of abu salema took her son from her hands and said we will not leave our son with her if you are migrating to medina and she stayed for a whole year weeping and crying unable to go and catch up with her husband and unable to leave her son behind who was sort of abducted by his kin until they felt sorry for her and returned her son to her so now they have been reunited but the problem is that there's no one to take her to medina and to travel there it may take like three to five good days on camel's back so she went to the outskirts of mecca every single day trying to go and to leave until she decided to leave on her own which was totally unheard of extremely dangerous for a woman to travel in the wilderness without any man protecting her and allah azzawajal sent to her who saw her identified her and asked her where about is she going and when she told him he felt obligated to accompany her and to protect her so he accompanied her to medina and she praised his moral ethics and conduct that he had never looked at her and whenever she dismounted from her camel he would move few steps and give his back so that he would not see anything that was inappropriate he never spoke to her until he got her to medina and left her and went back to makkah this was the chivalry of the arabs long back even those who were not muslims this was instilled in them being the feelings of of being a man and being generous being courageous being courteous and respecting others when abu salama was with the prophet salallahu he was a very close companion to him he is his cousin not only that he is his brother through suckling because we know that the prophet saw when he was born he was given to tuwabia which was the slave concubine of his uncle abu lahab so she suckled him and she suckled abu salam and she also suckled hamza abdul muttalib so all three are siblings through suckling so abu salam was close to the prophet islam and he fought better with him and he also fought alongside the prophet hassan in the battle of uhud which was on the third year of hijra only to be wounded and this wound did not recover completely and few months later on it erupted again and caused him to die now there are milestones in people's lives and if we were to ask mother um what is your milestone she would definitely without any doubt say that it was that incident which accompanied the death of her husband abu salam she tells us that abu salam once came and he told her that i heard the prophet wasallam say and by the way this was the habit of the muslims of the companions whenever they hear a piece of information that is beneficial for the muslim they would convey it to them and the first that they would convey it to is their family their wives their children so he came in immediately started preaching i heard the prophet alaihis allah say whoever is afflicted by a calamity and recites we are for to allah we are we belong to allah and we shall return to him and then supplicate by saying allah oh allah reward me in my calamity and substitute me with something better than that so i memorized this hadith till the date that abu salem and my husband passed away so when he died i immediately said this duha but then i contemplated afterwards who can be better than abu salama substitute me with something better than it who can be better than abu saleh and after my head was over and we know that the da of a widow is four months and ten days i heard the prophet alaihissalatu salaam seek permission to meet me and he came in so he asked me and asked for my hand in marriage so i explained to him o prophet of allah no one can reject you no one can turn you down you are the dream of every woman on earth but the problem is i am a jealous woman and i am an old woman compared to your wives and i have children so i may be considered to some as access luggage so the prophet acknowledging that she was alone and that her husband was a close companion of his his cousin and his brother said to her as for your age i'm older than you so this is not a legitimate reason as for your jealousy i will ask allah azza to take care of it and as for your children i will provide for them and they are under my sponsorship so she agreed and the prophet alaihis salat was salaam married her and only then she thought to herself now i know what can be better than abu salama the wisdom of the prophet allah marrying someone with four children or three with someone who is not that young with someone who's alone and her tribe are not is not with her is that to show the community that allah does not leave people stranded and in need without any help so many times we have calamities catastrophes crisis surrounding us and overwhelming us and we think that this is the end not believing in allah not trusting allah not fully relying upon him we soon would find the way out and these are frequent lessons from allah to us if we were to only comprehend and understand the prophet salallahu salaam her guardian was her son and few of the companions were there alongside to witness such a marriage contract now she lived with the prophet isaiah unlike other wives because she did not feel jealous so she did not cause any problems to the prophet the prophet had the habit of visiting all of his nine wives when it was assert time or the likes so he would start with um because she was the oldest of his wives and then end up with aisha being the youngest and he would sit for maybe 10-15 minutes chit-chatting checking on them and he would do this every single day was a chaste woman a kind woman and the prophet appreciated her ali sam he appreciated her wisdom and kindness he trusted her and he took in her children as his own living in his house and allah azzawajal would put in the prophet's heart sallallahu caring for her so he would probably give her gifts to indicate to her that she has a special place in his heart one of the situations that she's well known of was that in the treaty of al-hudabiyah when the prophet elizabeth went to mecca to perform umrah on the fifth of the sixth year of hijrah and he was blocked by the idol worshipers so they wrote a treaty stating that this year he cannot come in he has to go out but they are wearing so the prophet went and addressed the people who are wearing waiting eagerly to go and perform their umrah he said to them we sign the treaty we have to go back to medina and hence whoever is blocked from completing his ritual you know the ruling which is that you have to slaughter your hadi your sacrifice and shave your heads so shave your heads and sacrifice your head this was a directive from the prophet sallallahu to his astonishment no one complied so he went into his tent being angry and mentioned to um what had happened from his people they're not obeying me so um salam allah be pleased with her said to him o prophet of allah would you like them to obey you go out do not speak to a soul until you slaughter your own sacrifice and call the barber to shave off your head so the prophet isalam went out of his tent did not speak to anyone slaughtered his own sacrifice and asked the barber to shave his head the moment he did this all the companions came back to the senses and they hastened to slaughter their sacrifice and to shave their own heads as if they were about to kill one another because of wanting to do it in a so quick fashion and manner this is why the prophet hassam loved um salemma for being wise for being intellectual due to her age and due to her upbringing as well being with the prophet alaihis salat was salaam she narrated as the habit imam says in his muslim 380 hadiths and we know that the prophet alaihis was had many things with his wives that the companions did not know so she told us that the prophet used to kiss her and go to pray without performing wudu and the same hadith was narrated by ishmael be pleased with her and also that she used to perform russell with the prophet taking from the same bucket and so many other hadiths about nocturnal emission for women when she was there about men says about so many topics that were among the things that she had witnessed herself and she kept on after the death of the prophet teaching and sharing this knowledge that she gained in the house of the prophet sam with the muslims when she died some say she died at the age of 84 and some say that she died at the age of 90 and she died as the mother of the believers and one of the wives of the prophet [Music] [Music] foreign today i'm going to talk about the book interactions of the greatest leader abu hurairah may allah be pleased with him said the messenger of allah said no one's wealth helped me as much as the wealth of abu bakr helped me after which abu bakr began to weep and say and is my life and wealth for anything besides you o messenger of allah this narration shows the level of etiquette and humbleness that abu bakr may allah be pleased with him had in the presence of the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam for he likened himself to a slave of the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam by saying that his wealth was only for the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam as well as his soul and self this comes as no surprise for the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam has more rights on the believers than themselves he may allah be pleased with him spent his wealth in the cause of allah and he consoled the prophet of allah through his own self so the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam recognized that for him and said in order to build his teacher and to remind the ummah of his virtues no one's wealth helped me as much as the wealth of abu bakr helped me among the benefits of this narration it is important to keep good manners and humbleness in the presence of the prophet of allah sallallahu alaihi wasallam thanking someone who has bestowed some favor on you as well as supplicating for them is part of having good manners reported by al-bukhari reported by al-tirmidhi and ibn maja al-bani ruled it authentic in his book sahih al-jameer the explanation of a cindy on the book of ibn maja and ate bishar al-jameer and welcome back our first question from the emails and feel free to call if you're still awake and watching this program if you have any questions on your mind ali says can we pray ishra at home because the masjids are not open as for the reward that the prophet salallahu placed upon a certain task which is one hajj one umrah this is only limited to the conditions set by the prophet allah which is a person who prays fajr in congregation remains in the masjid until the sun rises and then prays to raka so scholars say that this reward of one hajj one umrah perfect perfect perfect is conditional and the conditions are to be prayed in congregation in the masjid nevertheless reward of praying fajr remaining in your position in your home making thicker until the sun rises and you pray to raka's is also highly rewardable i don't know of any of the companions may allah be pleased with them that would not follow this in the hadith the prophet isaiah once left home to prefajr while his wife was in a position of prayer and came back after sunrise and she was still in the same position making dhikr so the prophet said allah i said four words meaning four statements that would equal all the time that you had spent from fajr till now that's it so it indicated that the mother the mothers of the believers used to pray fajr and stay where they are making vikar until the sun rises so this is highly recommended but it does not have the same reward as doing it in the masjid and offering the two rakahs after sunrise so would ishraq be prayed at home similarly to the to the masjid and get the same reward answers no afrin says i have an exaggerated fear of death how do i cope with it as it hinders my day today activities we said this so many times that the fear of death can be positive and can be negative the negative part of it is usually due to shaytan's whispers weakness of iman and it might be related to other factors as well why do we say that this is related to shaytan negative fear makes people stagnant refusing to progress it handles them from doing a lot of things so whenever they want to do something they're afraid of death so they don't do it whenever they want to earn and work they're afraid of death whenever they want to plan something positive for the future they're afraid of death such fear is from shaytaan and a believer a true believer does not fear the shaytan nor the soldiers of shaytan rather he fears allah alone now you ask yourself is my fear of death going to stop me from dying maybe maybe no it's not going to stop you from dying because your death was predestined for 50 000 years before allah had created the universe and this is why it's something which is done and over with whether you fear it or not it's going to come at a designated time not a minute early nor a minute late so you come to think of it logically why then am i afraid it's going to happen so is my fear going to prevent it no is my fear going to make me enjoy life no so who's benefiting from my fear shaytaan satan so you have to put this in your mind in order to overcome such a negative fear on the other hand there is a positive fear and this fear is the one that drives us to excel so i'm afraid of death why because i have many shortcomings and sins what are you going to do about it well my fear of death is driving me to repent that's positive it's driving me to do good deeds to compensate for the bad deeds that's even positive it is making me not so attached to this dunya to the money to the wealth to the family to the children because i know i am about to depart them soon so i have to invest in them to the best of my ability giving charity to ongoing sadhaka sadaqah to feed the poor to take care of my children and upbring them in an islamic way so that after my death they make dua for me or maybe perform umrah or any of the likes so this fear of death is a positive thing it is driving me to excel and to progress and this is how you should look at it afrin umar says can we praise allah with our night clothes some people say this is not permissible and we must wear good clothes while praying is this true no it is not true when it comes to permissibility anyone claiming that it is not permissible must provide an evidence as long as your aura is covered then your prayer is valid but the more you show interest and respect the higher your reward would be praying in your pajamas is acceptable your clothes are pure there's no najasa or impurity on them and your aura is covered but would you ever meet a guest wearing a pajamas would you go and meet a ceo of a company a minister a ruler that says no so scholars say it then it is best to wear your best attire when you are standing in front of allah praying to him so that this would show how serious you are in what you're doing other than those who wear anything or their night clothes and pray with it not paying an attention so this is something recommended and better not that it is not permissible it is permissible as mentioned earlier suha says my father loses his temper too soon and this is very often i get mad at him for yelling for no reason how can i help him stay calm and also how can i control myself when he loses his temper this is problematic but i'll get to suha's question after taking ahmed from bangladesh yes my question my question is about tawaruk in salah especially in salah that is uh okay so the ones with one the shahood so can from bangladesh is asking about rook and tawar rook is to sit in prayers on your left buttocks on your work while if tirash to sit on your left foot in normally sitting positions tawar rook is one of the sunnies of the prophet islam and in the shafi methab they sit tawaruk in any final to shahood so whether it is two raka's of fajr or of sunnah or three rakaats of maghrib or four raka's of risha the last before you give salam use it in tawarik position but the most authentic opinion is that tawar rook can be performed when the prayer itself has two tashahud so if i were to come from behind a worshiper and i see him sitting in the iftarash position i know that this is not if it's an isha prayer for example then i know that this is the first the shahood and the imam will stand up to pray the third and the fourth but if i see him in the tawarrok position i know that this is the final raka so this is not an indication but this is what the hadiths narrated that the tawarrok would be usually performed only when the prayer has two teshahood first the shahud and the last of shahood therefore you should not offer it when you're praying one rakah of witter nor when you pray three raka connected of witter without sitting in the second which is according to the sunnah and you should not perform tawar rook when you're praying the turaka of sunnah or the turaka of fajr and allah azzawajal knows best so going back to suha's question that my father loses his temper too soon and this is very often now rage and losing your temper and getting angry quickly these are all defects shortcomings things that must be fixed and unfortunately as human beings we are filled with shortcomings that need to be fixed and we acknowledge of them yet i've noticed that many of us don't put the effort to fix themselves so now we have a problem we have a father and a daughter the daughter is justifying her own rage against her father by her father's mistakes and this is a vicious loop a vicious circle so why are you bad because he was bad why is he bad because she made me bad and we will never ever end who came first the chicken or the egg we have to know obligations duties and rights your father is a father he's not your sibling he's not your son he's not your colleague he is a father which means that he has so many rights that you cannot overlook so if he becomes angry if he becomes upset if he loses his temper if he says abusive words as a daughter you must be dutiful kind obedient and respectful but he's abusing me he's doing this he's doing that do you have no excuse first of all avoid the things that make him lose his temper avoid the things that make him angry and even if he is unjustly angry and loses his temper keep and maintain your cool because at the side of allah you are sinful big time if you retaliate or express your disapproval of what he's doing or your anger or your resentment you're doomed so first of all work on yourself our problem inflates if we start looking at other people's faults and turning a blind eye's eye to our own faults so yes he has this and that she has this and that okay what do you have no no no i don't have anything i may have shortcomings but this is not of great importance let us fix other people this is wrong and this shows how weak man is how vulnerable to shaytaan messing up with his mind misinterpretation where the oppressor feels oppressed why are you invading this country and killing its people ah because i feel that i have to do something i have to act so now he's justifying his oppression due to any other reason that would make him go to bed and sleep but this does not change the facts so you need to get your act together he's your father try to advise him when he's in a good mood definitely avoid anything that would make him lose his temper definitely do not even express any type of resentment or disapproval of what he is doing may allah guide us through the straight path ruhi says is it permissible to pull out our gray hair there are a number of hadiths where the prophet tells us aslam that the gray hair will come as light on the day of judgment and the prophet said that some that the gray hair is the light of the believer and he also said that whoever plucks a gray hair then he is removing the light of his face or as if the prophet said something around these words so if it is a light and it is something that allah loves plucking it would be something not recommended at all if not prohibited yes you have the option of dying it if you don't want to keep it and dying it is permissible because the prophet saw instructed abu bakr to dye the beard of his father abu kohafa and his hair because it was too white but this is a recommendation it's not mandatory so if you don't like the whiteness you can dye it but plucking it and removing it is highly not recommended if not prohibited and allah knows best muna says is it permissible to interact with jinn not to harm others but just like that the issue of interaction with jinn is governed by the quran the sunnah we know that prophet sulaiman peace be upon him asked allah azza the ability to control the jinn and he asked allah not to give this ability to anyone after him and allah granted him his wish to the extent that once the prophet was attacked by one of the jinn so while well while in the prayer he was praying leading the prayer so he strangled the jinn until he felt the saliva of the jinn on his hand and when he concluded the prayer the companions asked him that you moved in your prayer what happened and he said that aegin attacked me with a torch of fire so i strangled him and i wanted to tie him to one of the pillars of the masjid so that the children would play with him but then i remembered the wish of my brother sulaiman and how allah granted it to him so i let him go so no one no one has power over the jinn now can jinn be seen in public the answer is no we cannot see them in their true form they can adopt a character such as a dog maybe a human being and and transform into that and we can see that but this is very rare can they communicate to us this is possible there were people who were addressed by the jinn but such communication is not normal can they work for us the answers no they may help us without us knowing the righteous of the jinn can do things to us and help us without knowing they can be among those who attend lectures in the masjid and listen to the quran who knows maybe they're watching us now this is all possible part of the religion this is how they learn their religion but to claim that we can communicate with them and chit-chat and maybe what's up them and that they would serve us to do things we want them to do this is not permissible because they would not obey you unless you worship them they cannot work for you just because you're a righteous person otherwise they would have worked for abu bakr um the great companions which we have no no recollection of so having them work for you as some people claim in indonesia in nigeria here and there a man says that he has control over six or ten gin and they help him diagnose the illness of a patient and maybe offer or perform surgery with his nail and extract things and then put it back again all of this is black magic all of this is shirk because this person must have worshipped them offered them sacrifice some of them even step on the quran so that they would be able to communicate with them or write the quran in the blood of menses all of this kind of black magic and shirk is there so it is not permissible to go down there or to believe in what they speak or say because they're usually blatant liars and going to soothsayers who are assisted by jinn just for the fun of it renders your prayer of 40 days unaccepted and if you believe in a single thing of what they had predicted then you have exited the poll of the fold of islam our man says people in the subcontinent say that it is prohibited to cut hair and nails on tuesdays and after maghrib is this true of course it is not true any person claiming that such a thing is prohibited he's obliged to provide us with the evidence from the quran or from the sunnah of the prophet sam that is authentic and this is the beauty of islam i cannot come to you and say by the way it is prohibited to wear glasses on a saturday because a saturday is the day of the jews and this holiday of the jews must not be taken seriously so you have to take off your glasses sounds logical sounds legit i can't say anything like this because any tom dick or harry can challenge me and said listen with all due respect we're muslims if you don't provide us with the quran and the sunnah or from the favor the three favorite generations interpreting it and stating it i will not accept it which is totally legit therefore we don't have monks or priests we don't have popes in islam that say you have to do this why don't ask you have to do it and that's it everything is cleared and facilitated for the muslims from eastern to the west rich or poor educated or literate to understand this religion that is for all saddem says it's been a year since i'm making specific dua to allah at times i feel a bit disheartened that maybe allah is angry with me so he's not answering help me fight these thoughts well first of all remember that you are a servant and not a master remember that you're calling your master and not your peer remember that allah is not obliged to do anything for you while you are obliged and commanded to show and express your poverty your humility and your need for allah azza when supplicating and finally remember that what is ever written for you will come your way nothing will prevent it and whatever is not written for you no one can get it for you when you have these things at the back of your mind you feel the content in your heart the prophet of allah ayoob he was tested by allah for 18 years with an illness that people repelled him and boycotted him 18 years and he's a prophet for you to call allah for one single year allah is giving you everything food shelter health you name it you can't count it but for that specific thing that allah knows that there is no good for in it for you and you still feel sad that allah is angry with you you should feel sad that you're not treating allah azza as he's supposed to be and not worshiping allah and not doing dua for allah azzawajal or to allah expressing your poverty humility and need for him this is all the time we have until we meet tomorrow same time i leave allah so"
