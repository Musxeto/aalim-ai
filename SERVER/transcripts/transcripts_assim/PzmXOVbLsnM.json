  "transcript": "my question is about those people who keep dogs outside their house i know that it is only permissible if it's for security reasons or for hunting but what about those people who keep dogs outside their house but the dog is chained meaning the dog has a chain around the neck so or maybe the dog is in his box or cage can such people claim it is for security reasons okay we know but we know if there was somebody to rob their house the dog wouldn't be able to repel the house i will answer inshallah from bosnia he says that people keep dogs outside their homes chained and they claim that these dogs are for guarding and protecting the houses but they're chained so is this permissible this is between them and allah if these chained dogs would actually bark if an intruder comes in that would make the people of the house aware of such an intruder and that would protect them but if they're just keeping that dog as a form of being cool or being sophisticated like so many muslims unfortunately are doing this is haram you"
