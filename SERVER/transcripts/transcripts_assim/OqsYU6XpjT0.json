  "title": "Collect Haram money for CHARITY? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Money, or haram money, is either haram for itself or haram for the way it is earned. Money that is haram for itself is either stolen or taken by force. This money, you cannot utilize it if given to you as a gift. You must not accept it. And it's haram for you if you take it. Even as charity, we cannot take it. So someone comes to me and says, Sheikh, this is Nasir's car. I'd like to give it for da'wah. And he says, OK, where is Nasir? Well, Nasir is in Nigeria. He's in Ghanoum. And I stole it from him. I cannot accept that. There is another way of haram money, which is haram for the way being earned. So a prostitute makes money. The money itself is haram not because of itself, rather because of the way it was earned. Someone who sells drugs or has a bar and sells alcohol, the money he earns is haram according to the way it was earned. Someone who deals with riba and he lends people money and he gets riba, the haram money is haram because of the way it was earned. It is haram upon the person who earns it. Once he gives it to anyone else, it becomes halal to everyone else. So if he gives me a gift, I accept it. If he gives a donation to the masjid, we will accept it. Because the haram money is haram to its way of earning, not due to its nature."
