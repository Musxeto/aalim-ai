  "title": "Minimal period between two menstruations? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay ramla from saudi arabia she says what's the minimal period between the two menstruations there was nothing mentioned to us in this regard from the quran or the sunnah so all what you may read is ishta had from the scholars who came and thought that this might be the right period so some would say 14 days some would say a day and a night some would say this or that so there isn't any specific mentioned period between the two menstruations and this is why in one of his rulings if i'm not mistaken stated and this was also reported uh by the shafiri may allah have mercy on him that a woman can conceive can have monthly uh period then then purity then monthly period then purity the monthly period in less than a month and this is rare but it can happen so what the scholars the majority of the scholars let us say said was that the maximum amount of the number of days of monthly cycle should not exceed 15 days so if a woman gets seven days monthly cycle and then she gets purity for a couple of days or ten days or seven days and then gets another seven days of monthly cycles this in a less of a month reach 14 it cannot exceed that because if it were to be 15 this means that the purity would be less than 14 days per month and the menses cannot exceed the purity so it has to be half or less but in regards of the minimal period between the two monthly cycles there isn't anything mentioned in that and allah knows best"
