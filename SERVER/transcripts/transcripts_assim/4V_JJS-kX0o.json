  "title": "If he did not know laughing at a KUFR joke took you out of the folds of Islam, is he a kafir now?",
  "transcript": "Saad from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh So Sheikh my question is if someone is so if someone made a joke about Islam that was Kufr and someone else like laughed at it not knowing that laughing at it is not permissible and thought it was just you know it didn't really cross his mind or he didn't really understand didn't know that it was unpermissible to laugh at such jokes so is he a kafir? Again if he did not say the joke he did not know that it was Kufr his knowledge was not sufficient he had no intention to ridicule or to make fun of Islam like that like the person who initiated it no sin on him inshallah once he remembers or once he realized what he had done he has to ask Allah for forgiveness and move on"
