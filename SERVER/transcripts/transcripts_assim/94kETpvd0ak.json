  "title": "Imam Shafi said we can pray missed prayer (due to sleep) whenever we want is it true Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says that he heard the shepherd say may allah have mercy on his soul a great imam of the muslims that it is permissible to pray a missed prayer due to sleeping whatever you want so if you missed fajr prayer you can pray it after after asur and he says that the reason was that there is a hadith of a valley what is the hadith of ali there is a hadith where the prophet was on an expedition and he set his camp at night and he said to the companions who will guard us and wake up wake us for fajr so bilal said i will do. and bilal stayed all night long and at the end of the night he felt a little bit drowsy so he put his back to the camel you know just resting his back and all of a sudden he fell asleep and the prophet woke up when the sun was almost in the middle of the day and he woke up and he said what is this he said o prophet of allah the one who made you sleep made me sleep i had nothing to do with it so the prophet told them to pick up their camp and they moved away and then they prayed fajr so the confusion with brother sarud is that shafri claims i don't know imam shah he said this or not that this hadith is an evidence that you can delay making up for the fajr and there is no evidence in that because the prophet justified this in the end of the hadith so i i beg to differ that imam shafi used this hadith because in the hadith the prophet stated that in this camp shaytan overwhelmed you all so in order to make up your prayer we have to shift to another place where shaytan has no power or authority in that's the only reason secondly how can we follow shafi's instruction if he were to say such a thing may allah mercy and soul and this is his ishtihad when we have a clear hadith this is authentic the prophet said allah whoever oversleeps a prayer or forgets it must pray it as soon as he remembers it must pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no expiation to it other than that what do you understand from this the prophet is telling you pray it asap or as they say asap and you say oh yeah but shafi imam shafer he says the prophet says come on give me a break and some smart act alec would say uh um didn't the shepherd i know about hadith subhanallah is allah going to ask you in the day of judgment about what the shafiri said or what about the prophet saw sallam said come on be a real muslim so i respect shafi's chavez on my head definitely but i respect the hadith of the prophet sawsan more and if you fail to bring me a hadith or to indicate to me that the hadith is not authentic then i'll always stick with the quran and to the sun until the day i die and"
