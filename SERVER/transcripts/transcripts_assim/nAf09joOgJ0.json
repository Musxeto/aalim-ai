  "title": "Why do muslims break fast at maghrib when it's still bright when Quran tells to break till nightfall",
  "transcript": "uh question is some people break their fast when the sky becomes fully dark not just after marivada they say that in surah al-baqarah ayat number 187 it is written uh to complete our fast till the nightfall what is your what is the ruling on that alhamdulillah foreign the quran cannot be interpreted and understood without referring to the sunnah it's a grave and serious mistake that so many people jump the wagon and think that they are qualified to understand the quran and this is exactly why all of deviant cults and sects have diverted from the straight path based on a single ayah they misunderstood without referring back to the quran and to the sunnah the khawarij the murjiya the murtazila all of them they depended or understood a particular ayah and neglected to look at the other evidences and this is the methodology of those who follow innovation and deviant sects the muslims from alhasunda al-jamaa they follow safer moderate and authentic approach by going to the quran collecting all evidences that speak about this going to the sunnah reaching out to the clarification of the prophet and how he acted in similar situations and we will find that the prophet alaihis salam used to break his fast as soon as the sun has disappeared even if there is light in the sky he used to break his fast and eat because this is what the actual nightfall is and the prophet said alaihis an authentic hadith when the daytime comes from here and the night goes from here then this is when a person stops eating and drinking and when the nightfall comes from here and the daytime leaves from here this is when the time where a person fasts so this is a break is fast that is night time so this is the criteria because if the sister reversed it she will find that she was wrong or these people were wrong so now those who do not eat until it's totally dark by default once the break of dawn happens and the call of evan elfazir happens they will continue to uh eat and drink until the sun is about to rise and definitely this is wrong this is not part of the sunnah and their fasting is invalid tab why is it invalid because they ate and drank after the break of dawn so the sky being dark or not is not a criteria is not a determining factor the determining factor is when the sun sets this is when a person who's fasting breaks his fast and when the break of dawn appears which is the horizontal light in the horizon then this is when a person begins his fasting and allah azza knows best"
