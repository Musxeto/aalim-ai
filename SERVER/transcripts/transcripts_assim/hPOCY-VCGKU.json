  "transcript": "a sister says is a person who is affected by black magic free of accountability for the sins they commit in the process such as behaving badly or breaking a marriage this is something that we can't be the judges of how do we know that this individual is affected by black magic people come to me and say i divorced my wife i said how many times he said well i divorced her ten years ago once and then five years ago the second and last week i was afflicted by black magic and without knowing it i gave her divorce now how would i know that he was afflicted by black magic i can't this is him saying without any proof it's his word against someone's else's words so how can i judge for him i say if you divorce your wife and there are witnesses and you're confessing and your wife said yes he divorced me that was the third divorce he could come to me and say i killed a man but i was under the influence of black magic how to prove it i stole money i committed a crime i said blasphemous things how do we confirm this how do we prove it we can't so this is something that only allah can judge which means that on the day of judgment your you will be held accountable for what you've done and only allah could judge whether you're exempted from punishment because you were insane out of control you could not manage your emotions actions or feelings because of the black magic or you were just bluffing this is all in allah's hands so someone who's under the influence of that magic is like someone who's insane due to insanity he will not be held accountable on the day of judgment in this life there has to be proof that he's insane so someone who's insane and he kills someone or he does something we'll put him that in the loony house but not execute him but someone who claims that he was afflicted by black magic how can i prove this i can't so he has to be dealt with unless proven otherwise and allah azzawajal knows best you"
