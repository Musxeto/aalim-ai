  "transcript": "hope all is well um what it is I came across through a student of knowledge yesterday who said that uh if a person knows how to pray knows how to pray knows how knows how to knows how to fast these are the bare minimum things they need and anything more than that is recommended so my question to you is alhamdulillah I've been accepted by zard Academy and I've been learning through your uh playlists on YouTube and I've been starting to learn Arabic my question is if I got debts to pay to other would I be sinful if I seek knowledge that's recommended according to him and then you know every so often you have to buy notepads and pens um as opposed to then putting that extra money towards paying off a debt do that make sense the debt will take quite a long time anyway to pay off thank you the biggest problem is when people listen to something and they misunderstand it not only that they Cascade their own thoughts according to their whims and desires and start to build castles of sand which has no Foundation which has no strength to shelter anyone this is the biggest problem now th that person who said that statement never said that refrain from learning anything else and just pray and fast and that's it he was talking about the bare minimum according to the Hadith of that noad who came to the prophet wasam and asked about the rituals of Islam and the prophet said to him to pray five times a day to fast Ramadan and to give the zakat to the pooru and the man said anything else and the prophet would always reply by saying no unless you would like to offer some voluntary acts whether prayer or fasting or charity so the man said by the one who sent you with the truth I will not add anything else nor deduct anything from what you've instructed me to do and he left and the prophet saidat wasam he has prospered if he's telling the truth and another narration he is from the people of Jenna now this is the bare minimum that would take you into Paradise we don't have to emphasize the fact that if your five daily prayers are not topnotch in the sense that you may wander a bit while praying you may be a bit oblivious neglectful not concentrating which reduces is the reward of the prayer then you are in deep trouble because you have to compensate these flaws and shortcomings with other good deeds such as nephl prayer night prayers DHA and the likes to compensate for what was missed so this is what probably the Sheikh was telling you about now stating that I have have to pay off my debt your debt is a priority but it does not mean that you have to take it literally in the sense that okay I can only drink a bottle of water a day this would sustain my life though I'm thirsty and I need probably five to seven bottles a day to be healthy but no no I'll just take one so that I can dedicate the of the money for my debt this is ridiculous nobody thinks like this I'll have one meal a day instead of having three I'll turn off the heating and put a lot of blankets so that I can red nobody acts like this except someone who's controlled by Satan messing up with his head trying to drive him over the cliff so that he would reject Islam and say Islam is a Rel religion of hardship and difficulty I'm not buying it anymore this is what's happening so be careful a and don't fall into his traps"
