  "title": "Is it permissible to work in tax department ( revenue officer IRF ) - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um is it Halal for a Muslim to work for IRS as a revenue officer the irf is dealing with taxes and collecting taxes is not permissible in Islam according to the most authentic opinion because the many hadiths where the Prophet indicated the gravity of the sin of the ashar who takes 10 percent of whomever comes for the Authority for the government and taxations are not permissible to be forcefully taken this is my hard earned money who gives you the right to take a percentage of it whether it's Customs or taxes or uh revenue or whatever all of this is not permissible so even if there are Scholars who allow this yet it is not permissible for you as a Muslim to work in such a department and Allah Knows Best"
