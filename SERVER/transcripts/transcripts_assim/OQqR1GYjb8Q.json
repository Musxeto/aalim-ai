  "title": "How can the Sun rise from the West, it just doesn’t make sense scientifically ! Assimalhakeem JAL ￼",
  "transcript": "Aska from Indonesia Assalamu Alaikum Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi As we know, one of the signs of the end of times is that the sun rises from the west. Now from a scientific perspective, the earth's rotation makes it seem that the sun rises from the east and sets in the west. Now can you kindly explain how we as Ahlus Sunnah should believe this future event? Or is this question of mine just another west-west that I should ignore? Jazakumullahu Khairan Wa Jazakum. Akhi, belief and conviction is something in the heart. Whether you are a rocket scientist, a nuclear physicist, or a layman, a shepherd, a nomad, a farmer, who's illiterate, Qur'an said, or what the authentic sunnah has due to my own weakness, but I believe in the Qur'an. This conviction is what Muslims all over the world believe in. If you go to a farmer in Kashmir, or a shepherd, or a nomad in the deserts, they have never read the Qur'an in their lives, and they have never studied the sunnah. But if you tell them that in the Qur'an, Allah tells us that one of the signs of the day of judgment, that so and so will happen. The Prophet told us the interpretation of this ayah, the signs of Allah, that the sun will rise from the west. The nomad, the shepherd, the farmer, they would say, I believe. You say, Akhi, how is it possible that the sun rises from the west? Come on, this is nonsense, this is illogical. If you want me to kill you, keep on talking like this, because my conviction is undoubtful, unconditional. I believe in whatever the Qur'an or the authentic sunnah says, whether I understand it or not. So be careful on what you say to me. This is the belief. So whatever you're suffering from, it's wiswas, it's shaitan. Now, you believe what NASA says, what science says, and you are hesitating and believing in what the Qur'an or the authentic sunnah is telling you? This is crazy. There's something wrong in your iman. What you should do is, amantu billahi wa rasooli, I believe. How? It's none of my business. Allah said it would happen, it would happen. And this is the logical answer. If Allah wants the sun to rise from the south or from the north, or it does not rise at all. This is Allah's creation. Allah does whatever he wills. So I hope this answers your question."
