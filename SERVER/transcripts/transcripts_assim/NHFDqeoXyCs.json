  "title": "Can I use my LEFT hand to brush my teeth? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Suad from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam. Sheikh I am a lefty. I write with my left. However, I eat with my right hand and drink with my right hand. But when it comes to brushing my teeth, I struggle using my right hand and sometimes end up using my left hand to brush my teeth. Is that okay? Jazak Allah Khair. And he justified this by saying because Shaytan eats and drinks and gives and hands out and receives with his left hand and Allah knows best."
