  "transcript": "in [Music] ald [Music] [Applause] sh [Applause] for [Applause] [Music] for fored in his and in they reported that may Allah be pleased with him said a man came to the prophet s and said oh prophet of Allah advise me yet be brief so the prophet said when you stand to pray pray like a man bidding farewell and do not say anything for which you will have to apologize for and give up hope for what other people have Servants of Allah our Prophet Sall wasam was given the concise of speech few words that have profound meaning which may require Scholars to interpret in volumes and in this beautiful Hadith we see how Keen the companions of Allah may Allah be pleased with them on seeking seeking advice and this is what we should do because advice is heavy on the soul and if you advise and if you advise someone most likely they would reject your advice but when someone seeks advice from you this means that he is willing to accept it and therefore we should try to improve ourselves to give and to accept advice the companion of Allah may Allah be pleased with him requested an advice but he requested it to be brief because so many lectures we attend so many speeches we hear and very little remains to be implemented and this is why the prophet gave him what is suitable for him but in a very short statement so what was the first advice the prophet addressed the topic of Salat which we usually take for granted usually we call people to pray come to the Masid I didn't see you in today what's wrong why didn't you come for for this is the bare minimum that we call people for this was not the case at the time of the Prophet the bar was set up high the prophet did not tell him pray or observe your five daily prayers the prophet s Alam focused on something that was more valuable and that is quality versus quantity what counts at the S of Allah is quality and this [Music] is understood clearly if you measure between two hadiths the first one is the Hadith that speaks about our Prophet told us that you will look down upon your prayers compared to their prayers they pray day and night without end yet they are the people of Hellfire they are the hounds of Hellfire as the prophet has described them sallallahu alaihi wasallam and if you compare this to the Hadith of the Prophet where he said that whoever prays two without Whispering without talking to himself about worthy matters Allah would forgive all of his previous sins so put this in the scale two compared to praying all of your life without any quality then Islam focuses most on quality rather than on quantity and prayer has great importance importance in Islam the prophet told us that those who do not pray at all not a single prayer are not Muslims and this is mentioned in the Quran in so many ayats and this is clearly mentioned in theth of the Prophet when he said that the pledge between us and Them is prayer whoever abandons it is not a Muslim the prophet says this in clear state stat ments so whoever does not pray at all is a cafir who prays Salat but he is lazy in performing it he is a hypocrite Allah says and when they go to pray they go in laziness and this is the description of a hypocrite prayer is so important that by its validity all of your rest the rest of your Deeds are valid whether it's charity fasting Haj but if your prayer is not valid to begin with then all of your good deeds would be rejected accordingly and this is the first thing that a Muslim would be held accountable for on the day of judgment as the prophet had said so coming back to the Hadith pray the prayer of a man bidding farewell a person who bids farewell is a person thinking that this is his last prayer so he does his level best to perfect his prayer to attain the necessary to complete its pillars mandatory acts and even the Sunnah acts that the prophet used to perform Sall Alam when doing the Sal a person Bing farewell is a person who holds himself accountable now before the day of judgment so he asks himself after every prayer was it good was it accepted or was I distracted while doing it he is a person when standing in prayer imagines and has a conviction that he is standing before Allah and this is why he shows his submissiveness in his standing up in his rur in his he thinks of nothing but pleasing Allah so if you imagine someone coming out of his grave given the chance to pray one single prayer then going back to his grave whether being rewarded or or punish how do you think this person's prayer would be now the prophet said in a another authentic remember Allah well actually he said remember death when you stand for prayer because a man when he remembers death while praying he should perfect his prayer and pray the prayer of a man thinking that he will not get another chance to pray another prayer this is the advice of the prophet and this shows you how short the span of a Believer is everyone of us think that he will live for eternity even those who are past the age of 80 or 90 they still have hope in living for another 10 20 or even 50 years more and this is why when we act we do not perfect what we do because we always think that we will have another chance now pray pray the prayer of a man bidding farewell remember death in your prayer does Islam promote death dying and the concept of having this thought with you all the time death can be negative and can be positive in the sense that if you remember death to the extent that it would make you despair give up hope in Allah's Mercy not think of jenah but rather give up hope from everything good then this is negative while Islam promotes positive thinking of death and this way of thinking posit positively of death encourages you to do well and to stay away from sin so when you're ever tempted to do Haram your positive thinking of death makes you refrain and whenever you are lazy from doing what is mandatory your positive thinking of death gives you the power and the courage to do such a things and such concept of positive death if we have it in us we will transform Our Lives not only that but also the lives of our children whom we always monitor don't do this what are you doing we sometimes spy on them if we install the positive concept of thinking of death we can be sure that they are not sinning because there is an inner voice that prevents them from doing Haram and calls them to do what is obligatory if we manage to think positively of death we will not accept bribes we will not give bribes we will not cheat at our work we would not steal or embezzle or do anything that angers Allah we would not deal in RBA we would not think of cheating the wife from her rights or taking her possession or keeping her gold we would not do so many things because we are aware of the fact that death is coming inevitably and this positive way of thinking about death would definitely makes us improve praying has benefits in the here after without any doubt it has benefits in our Graves without doubt but does it have benefits in this life definitely part of the benefits of Prayer in this life that it releas leaves you from stress from worries from thinking of worldly things that would cause you to be diabetic with high blood pressure with a lot of confusion why because when you say allahar you are actually communicating with Allah so you don't think about your job or your debts or your wife or your children you only think of what pleases Allah knowing that if you please Allah Allah would make all of your Affairs to what pleases you but if we fail to be in such communication and we say Allah while thinking of worldly matters then we have a problem the prophet tells us about night prayer he says the honor of a believer is when he stands for night prayer what honor is there it's the honor of communicating with whom everything in this universe is in his possession and in his hand the prophet used to tell B oh B relieve us with Sal so whenever the prophet was Disturbed he used to ask B to make because relief was in Sal nowadays we say oh B relieve us from Sal it's a burden on our shoulders we just want to pray and leave but it was the relief of the prophet in the Salat itself if we look at our prayers nowadays those who are lucky Among Us are those who pray in the Masid because the majority of people do not know the Masid some of them know the Masid in J and some of them do not know the Masid even in J the majority of Muslims do not pray the five daily prayers as Allah commanded them in the Masid and even those who pray the M they are unfortunate because they do not have the they do not have the perfect Salat each one of us has his heart in a different Valley than in the Masjid we think of our businesses of our families we think of our work we think of our fun and entertainment some of us spent all of his Salat playing with his clothes fixing his clothes scratching his body fixing or checking what's in his pockets what kind of a Salah is this a person looks right left looks up up down where is your heart you have certain certainty that these people are not praying the prayer of a person betting farewell it is impossible with the actions they are doing the companions may Allah be pleased with them used to seek refuge in Allah from the of the Hypocrites do Hypocrites have for sure do they have submissiveness in Salah yes the submissiveness of organs so they pray and they don't move but their hearts are not submissive they don't have the in their heart and like may Allah be pleased with him said by Allah if your hearts were pure you would never have enough from the Quran likewise if our hearts were pure we would never have enough from the Sal alhamdulillah the prophet's second advice do not say anything for which you will have to apologize for is the prophet telling us not to apologize on the contrary apologizing for your wrongdoing is part of good ethics that Islam Pro most yet the prophet sallallahu alai wasallam is prohibiting us from doing something or saying something that requires we apologize for afterwards so this is preemptive do not say or do something you will regret and have to apologize for later on and if you look we find that the Muslims have neglected this advice our tongues are engaged in so many hideous and evil acts that are Beyond count when you sit with the Muslims without any hesitation you can say that all of our Gatherings are filled with backbiting with gossiping with slandering people with making fun of people even if someone is in front of us he doesn't know how to drive he doesn't like like people to overtake him this is and we don't pay any attention to it how many marriages were destroyed by the evil of our tongues a word that we say angers the husband he divorces the wife a slander that we say things that we do not pay attention how many disputes among the Muslims were ignited by a statement we did not pay any attention to the prophet tells us that there is a word or a statement that a person says does not pay any attention to throws him in hell for 70 years and he has not reached the bottom of it yet because of a statement you said so the prophet who was given the concise of speech who if he were to talk no one would want him to stop yet his words used to be counted and he did not talk a lot why he himself said whoever keeps silence whoever keeps silent he will be saved and secured on the day of judgment so silence is highly recommended so that you would not apologize for yet if you will speak in what pleases Allah then speaking in what pleases Allah is far better than remaining and finally the prophet said said and give up hope from what other people have it is human nature when you see someone who's rich that you wish that he gives you something that you become envious when you see someone influential you wish that he gives you a job when you see someone who has something you do not have you are hopeful that he may share it with you you so you always constantly looking at what other people have and this shows how little is in your heart how little dependence Reliance and Trust in what Allah has because you're not looking at what Allah has you're looking at what individuals have and whoever is self-content with what Allah has Allah would make him the richest man even if he does not have a penny whoever is sufficient with and content with what Allah has Allah will make him the wealthiest person because he is not enslaved to other slaves he is enslaved to his master and to his Lord and the more you look at what people have the more enslaved and humiliated and belittled you be to them the prophet said Al wasam whoever guarantees and I pray to Allah that he makes me and you among those who guarantee this whoever guarantees to me to the prophet that he will not ask anyone among the people for anything I will guarantee Jenna for him how many calls do we get from people she can you do this for me can you talk to someone can you lend me something can you make me borrow something this is not part of the teachings of the Prophet who taught us to be content with whatever we have and not to look at what others have so the prophet says whoever guarantees to me that he would not ask people for anything I will guarantee for him J therefore Servants of Allah I advise myself and you to feel of Allah our life in this world is limited it is short so many loved ones have passed away and now we tend to forget how much we love them and how much we were sorry for them soon our loved ones will miss us and we will die and nothing would help us in our Graves except the prayer that we used to observe the prayers that we used to perfect the prayers that we used to pray as a person bding farewell nothing would help us except protecting and observing what comes out of our mouths and whether it pleases Allah or angers him nothing would help us except being content with what Allah has given [Music] us for [Applause] allahar"
