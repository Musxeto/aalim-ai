  "title": "Difference in strength between man & woman - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um you've also talked check about the difference between men and women or sorry that they can both have courage and strength this can be something that women can also possess uh what's the the difference though because now we have subhanallah this phenomenon of sisters who say well i'm brave and i'm courageous and i go and fight in the ufc or i go and start you know being you know this this very brave woman taking on the world with my hijab or whatever but i can you know so what do you what do you uh is there a difference in the quake men of course strength and women of course of course is a big difference and the biggest difference is to those type of people is what i always open people's eyes when people come to consultation i tell them from the beginning or my sister i'm not a psychiatrist i studied zero psychology unfortunately i'm not proud of it but i don't have knowledge in it i'm an eye opener i'm a chef so your confusion comes because of your lack of knowledge i help you but i will not cure you because i'm not a doctor and the first thing i always talk to people and alhamdulillah 95 benefit from that is i ask them two questions the first question unanimously is answered in a second and in the same answer by all muslims do you want to follow sharia or do you want to follow your whims and desires immediately everybody says [Music] this is not the question the one million kuwaiti dinar question is and i love kweity dinars you know i i just adore the people of kuwait um i asked them okay in your attempt to be a strong woman whether it's ufc whether it is going to the gym with your niqab i saw a clip somebody sent me of a sister doing workout and cross fitness with her nikob what is this fully nakabhi but you can see her curves you can see her bending over okay what is this so i asked them are you in this situation following sharia or following your wills and desires this is where they trip and they start to stumble uh uh okay you've answered yourself if it was sharia you would have stated it immediately but you know it's not in the quran so it's for your whims and desires for sure so being a woman and a strong woman there's no problem in that being the one wearing the pants in the house whoa whoa whoa hold on i get counseling sessions with couples sure my wife always doesn't want me to work in this job she says no don't work i have been unemployed for two years and she insists that i work in other jobs i cannot travel to work i cannot do this to work and she is the one who's providing and she's saying that i must not go and see my mom i said excuse me i don't see the picture correctly can you turn on the the camera who's wearing the pants who's the man this is a problem in masculinity definitely and it is not haram to be strong um uh she was the one who stood by the prophet salaam in the battle of defending him when everybody fled she had a sword she was so stabbed and bleeding but she defended the prophet salam now do you think that this woman sits home and her husband is the one who does the cooking and she's the one who tells him do this clean and and she bosses him around the house no she's the best of wives the best of mothers the best of women and i would not elaborate because this is a family show but she is the best of women daytime and night time but but the the concept of masculinity is different nowadays we think that if i'm in the house part of masculinity is i don't cook why the prophet is he used to stitch his his garments he used to fix his sandals he used to milk his sheep he used to work in the household with his wives did this impact his masculinity alisa never it added value to it no so we have to fix and uh scrutinize and uh try to get an understanding of the meaning of masculinity sometimes masculinity means that you remain steadfast and strongly holding your opinion so my wife wants to go and work in a mixed environment and they don't allow her to wear the and she goes at seven o'clock am comes back at 7 00 pm wearing perfume and whenever i talk to her she says this is my life this is my work i have my career and he says what can i do the only thing you can do is become a man that's it become a real man and a real man does not approve of that sometimes giving in allowing things to happen is part of your masculinity so i came home and my wife did not cook lunch i was so aggravated and angry i divorced her you're not a man why she this is my given right and she did not cook you are not a man wallahi whenever i come to the hadith of safiyah and ishmael visit him imagine this imagine the greatest man ever to walk the earth sitting with his companions in the living room and it was the night of so it's his house and in comes a servant with food from the house of safiyyah and some say from the house of zainab the co-wife aisha saw this got really mad stood up and spanked the servant's hand making the food spill on the earth on the ground and the plate breaking everybody from the companions were shocked and whoa what's gonna happen the prophet stood up collected the food with his own honorable hands saying to the companions calling them down don't worry don't worry your mother is jealous talking about your mother is jealous i know 99.9 of the muslim men quote unquote if this happened in front of their relatives or parents they would divorce her on the spot she doesn't respect me she is not treating me as a man she is making me look in front of my friends as a wimp not the prophet he is giving us a role model you want to be the uh male alpha this is what you should do control your anger let it go that's it so we need to uh synchronize our own beliefs with the islamic beliefs so that we could have this right understanding"
