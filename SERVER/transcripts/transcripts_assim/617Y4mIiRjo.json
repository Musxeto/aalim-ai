  "transcript": "Metin al-amin nabina muhammad nur Ali he wasabi woman said behead ye Weston be so naughty he al-madinah and Mubarak assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh I have to admit that I am delighted with the grace of allah azza wajal that the organisers arranged it so that we would have dinner before my speech because then I would have had second thoughts would it be worth having dinner or not now I had my dinner Hollis I don't care about the speech it's something extra it's a bonus for me and after seeing the presentation to tell you the truth I have a very hard heart but it brought tears to my eyes I could not watch half of it maybe I'm homesick and maybe the presentation was good but seriously when it comes to giving and when you see that this small thing that you gave is so huge the impact in this world you don't know what the impact would be on the hereafter when we talk about sadaqa arabs relate to it and this is not racist I mean they relate to the word in their language because it is derived from a SUDEP which is truthfulness so sadaqa is anything you do for the sake of allah azza wajal whether it is financial or non-financial whether you feed people whether you offered drink whether you close them whether you show to them even what you feed your wife and children this is called sadaqa to the extent that the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said smiling in the face of a muslim brother is a siddhappa and this is addressed to the brothers not to the sisters now it is without doubt that money is our soulmate we often lie to our spouses when we say to them you are my soulmate money is my soulmate and this is why if I'm put in a situation of a calamity or life threatening I would easily give my money to buy my soul this money that I possess that I have I can put it in the hand of a widow who I will never ever meet until the day of judgement I can put it in the hand of a blind man who's needy who will never ever see me in this life I can put it to help a person who's flat broke and has nothing in this world and would never ever benefit me in this life I could put it in the hand of a Wayfarer a traveler who is disconnected from his country from his family look at their Oh hinges may allah azzawajal ease their pain and suffering I'll never need them but Allah Azza WA JAL would keep and preserve this for me this process of giving as long as you intend by it face of allah azzawajal it is a manifestation of your truth and that's why we call it sadaqa means that it proves that you are sincere and truthful and you're anticipating the reward from Allah on the day of judgement if people did not have this in them that is the belief the man would not have left his farm and garden for the sake of Allah Abu Talha I'm sorry may Allah be pleased with him came to the prophet alayhi salat wa salam when this ayah was revealed Allah says never will you attain the good that is the reward until you spend in the way of Allah from that which you love and whatever you spend indeed Allah is knowing of it ayah revealed immediate reaction about all her comes to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he was among the richest of the companions he had so many forms so many places property but this particular property was adjacent to the message of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam it has it had nice shades and it had pure sweet water water well so the Prophet used to come out early his salat wa salam and drink from its water about all he came to the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam and said o prophet of allah this i was revealed and the most precious wealth I have is this garden of Baral ha so take it and do with it whatever you want immediately action the Companions reacted positively because they believed Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him a very strange man the Prophet said alayhi salaatu wa salaam none of my companions had benefitted me with his wealth more than abu-bakr may Allah be pleased with him therefore block all doors in the Masjid except the door of Abu Bakr Abu Bakr started crying he said me and whatever I own belongs to you Oh prophet of Allah true and sincere reaction from Abu Bakr three times in his life he got out of his wealth imagine if you have three cars two buildings a bank account and you say all of this is for the sake of Allah you may able to do it once though it's difficult he did it three times rahmatullahi table1 said today I'm going to beat Abu Bakr in competing to Allah so he took half of his wealth came to the Prophet al-assad and said o prophet of Allah this is for Allah sake so the Prophet said what did you leave for your family I said half of it the same similar amount so 50% I kept 50% so he said may Allah bless you Abu Bakr came and he put something heavy in front of the Prophet a lustrum I said o prophet of Allah this is for Allah sake so he said what did you leave for your family he said nothing except Allah and the Prophet allosaurus Allah everything he had and possessed he gave it for the sake of Allah Rama said by Allah I will never race you a book I can't compete this is how the Companions used to react may Allah be pleased with them and when you look at their actions you understand the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when he says what sadaqa to Burhan so doctor the thing that you do for the sake of Allah is an evidence is a proof of what in a court of law no this is a proof of your belief this is an evidence that you believe it is allah azza wajal who gives and that Allah alone who rewards charity sadaqah is not something new it begins with us from the time we are born and it goes with us till the time we die when you're blessed with a child what do you do on the seventh day you shave the hair you weigh it and you give the weight in silver in charity Sunnah you slaughter two Rams for a baby boy or one ram for a baby girl and you give part of it in charity so from the very beginning of your life in this world you give not you maybe your parents and this process of giving remains with you until the moment you die allah azza wajal says and spend in the way of allah from what we have provided you before death approaches one of you and he says my lord this is on the death bed he's dying what does he say he says my lord if only you would delay me for a brief term so I would give charity and be among the righteous the first thing he said not to pray not to fast I just want to be delayed so that I can give and this explains to us why charity is important to the extent that Romar may Allah be pleased with him said it was mentioned to me and force who would mention it to him the Prophet is awesome he said it was mentioned mean that good deeds boast and compete and sadaqa says I'm the best among you all sadaqa is difficult no person would say that it is easy to give you feel when you give away that it is taking part of your heart there are many virtues of sadaqa and if we would like to speak about Sebata in detail this would take us to breakfast I don't know if it's in the menu so we have to conclude and as early as possible in sha Allah but in general charity sadaqah is divided in two types sadaqa that is mandated is known as the cat and sadaqa that is voluntary so we will not speak about such classifications of the cat whether it's on gold silver and currency whether it is on things that are prepared to be sold merchandise or the things the crops that coming from the ground or the livestock this is too detailed and it's not what we want we would like to just be reminded of the virtues of sadaqa because in this world we tend to be distracted so anyone any organization has a mission and vision statement we as muslims we have this well in the salah tijuana tsuki omaha marathi lillahi rabbil aalameen allah said akela everyone knows that we are in this world for a period of time and then its death eternity paradise insha'Allah so we would like to build our house we will like to furnish it we would like to have everything in it and this happens with the grace of Allah and after that with what you give so what are the virtue of sadaqa there's a promise from allah azza wajal the Prophet said alayhi salat wa salam allah says spend oh son of adam and i shall spend on you you believe that well why it's difficult I believe don't get me wrong but if I give 20% of what I possess he who gave you the other 80% Maharaja come in Vittorio mahadji whom later Laguna Shia what you had a local Muslim Arabs are olefin well it is Allah who got you out of your mother wounds knowing nothing no PhD no masters no be a no diploma no languages possessing zero who made you who you are my biceps no who made you what you are is allah azza wajal attributing anything to other than him is shirk imagine if I say I managed to secure contracts from my company for the last physical year I managed to reduce cost I managed to gather money this is shirk has it been a best may Allah be pleased with him says you have to attribute it to whom to Allah so whatever we're enjoying at the moment it's not from me it's from Allah Azza WA JAL so if you spend Allah would spend more and will bless more and not only that Allah would appoint an angel to make drum people come make dua for me why you are masha'Allah scholar you're right CeCe some come to me and say make rupiah why he said well I have this jinn I have this I told him if I do rope here my gene will go into you you'll be double possessed depend on allah azzawajal but when there is an angel making dua for you you're in good hands the Prophet says Ali Saleh there is no day on which the people get up wake up but two angels come down they descend and one of them says or Allah give in compensation to the one who spends in charity and to all those who spent the two hundred and fifty thousand ringgit may allah azzawajal give them compensation for what they had spent and may allah azzawajal give those who will spend more more than those who had spent it the other angel says o allah destroy the one who withholds so if you withhold the angel is making dua against you and this also was emphasized by the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam we think that our money saves us we have insurance policy we have stocks hamdulillah we have offshore accounts just in case we have to leave we have so many investments here and there so we should be safe abu talha ferry may allah be pleased with him he said i came to the prophet sala allah and he was in the shade of the Kaaba and I heard him say they are the losers by Allah the Lord of the Scarpa they are the losers so I came to himself Allah who are the losers may Allah not make me and you among them who are the losers the prophet said are in salat wa salam they are those who gather they are those who collect wealth except those who say like this and like this who give away in charity in Xalapa they're not the losers but those who continue to check their record books how much they have and they do not spend in the cause of allah the prophet swears by allah the lord of the Kaabah that they are the losers air conditioning is a blessing from a large division especially in Malaysia well actually not especially Saudi Arabia without air conditioning we will die but on the day of judgment it is fifty thousand years long and the Prophet tells us as some that the Sun draws closer from the servants of allah azza wajal and they sweat according to their good deeds and bad deeds those who have good deeds their sweat reaches their ankles those who are lesser in deeds their sweat reaches their knees their sweat reaches their waists and some their sweat reaches their noses their drown their their own sweat so what to do we need a cease we need a form of protection don't worry the Prophet Hassan is giving you this protection and he says every one of you will be under the shade of his sabaha on the day of judgment so I could care less about the Sun I give I have my umbrella I have the sadaqa and especially those who spend with the right hand and conceal it so that their left does not know how much he is spending they will be in the shade of Allah the Almighty the shade of his throne Subhanahu WA Ta'ala and one of the narrator's of this hadith his name is Abu method he said they said about him that every single day he would always give a charity even if it's a piece of onion or a piece of bread he has to give charity every single day so that he would be under his shade on the day of judgement now the past I would not say month maybe in the past year how much did we give in the cause of allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala one says that yeah I gave last year something which is good but this has to be sustainable this has to be a continuous process imagine we have dr. Zucker with us he prescribes medication for me and he says take two pills of this every day and I take the whole bottle I just want quick relief what will happen I'll die but if I take the dosages as prescribed continuous sustainable I will live with the grace of allah azza wajal likewise when you keep on giving sustainable continuous as the management of an organization institution I can plan I know how much is coming and this is good for everyone when I see orphans my heart breaks because our heart is hardened is darkened is filled with fitna backbiting hatred envy grudges we need medication for our heart unfortunately that desire cannot provide me with this so I have to go to the prophetic Sunna what is the cure for my heart the Prophet said alehissalaam if you want your heart to be softened feed the needy and rub on the head of an orphan the more you help and show your compassion when you feed the orphan for the sake of Allah not because there's a photo shoot you're doing it for the sake of Allah you love the orphan because he's in need he is broken and he has no one except those who give a helping hand allah azza wajal would make your heart soft now when we come to accountancy okay sure I have a hundred thousand it if I gave twenty percent twenty thousand eighty thousand remains this is not very profitable wallah it is profitable am i I'm sweating on that yellow I'm not going to expiate my oath well llahi it is profitable the Prophet said alayhi salaatu wa salaam charity does not decrease wealth this is a profit you believe erase a lot of Salaam so one would say ok I believe what I can see yesterday it was five digits a hundred thousand in my bank account now after I gave twenty thousand it is four digits was it still five was it 60 I didn't I wasn't good in calculus or mathematics so a hundred thousand is six digits but nobody seems to pay attention because when the stomachs are full all the blood goes from the brain to the stomach for digestion so probably this is why people are not following so I had a hundred thousand this is how many digits eight six I gave twenty thousand how many remains eighty thousand which is five digits so how do you want me to believe that charity does not decrease well it decreased it you don't have Iman you think that money is everything your health is more expensive imagine if Allah Azza WA JAL would test you with an illness that would consume the whole hundred thousand would you pay it said yes so now you have eighty thousand bonus gift what about your children their health their well-being their Eman would you like them to be tested with their Eman one of them becomes an atheist sorry daddy I'm a free thinker I became an atheist there are many out like this when we fail to protect ourselves with charity what about your house what about your business what about your vehicles and cars all of this is money that you are saving and protecting when you give in charity and not lust let us not look at this life let us look at the bigger picture the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam protect yourselves from Hellfire even if by half a date not a full one so is there a lot of reward when I give sadaqa listen to this hadith the Prophet said alehissalaam whoever gives sadaqa the equivalent of a date that was acquired by halal means for allah does not accept anything but that which is Halla your sadaqa has to be earned from what from halal money if you work in Haram and you give Allah will not accept this you will not be rewarded for it yes you can give it in form of cleansing your wealth if you deal in RIBA if you do in insurance Haram insurance if you deal in entertainment how I'm entertainment in the vast majority of entertainment is Haram if you deal in selling Haram the earning is Haram you give it in means of charity to cleanse but you will not be rewarded if you don't give it you will be punished it will be double punishment for you so the Prophet says whoever gives gives this date Allah accepts it in his right hand then he tends it for the one who gave it as one of you tends his small horse until it becomes like a mountain you come on the day of judgement fearful scared and you showed your good deeds and wrong address no no no sure I know myself I don't I did not do this and Allah will tell you yes you gave something that was little and allah azza wajal made it to be this huge for you charity Oh sadaqa purifies your records of bad deeds the Prophet said Atticus a lot was Salaam all people have trade the merchants who sell and buy long ago you don't go to the malls to buy and sell you go to the souk and the souk is an open local market you find tables you go how much is this a hundred said no I'll buy it for 1000 K eighty no I'll buy it for fifteen and you start to negotiate and bargain and most of the time you would lie so by Allah I bought it for seventy-five and you bought it only for five you swore I believe you so all of this means that there is a lot of sins involved in selling and buying and trying to win a contract the Prophet said Isis of all people who deal in trade all merchants this transactions of yours that is selling involves idle talk and oaths so mix it with sadaqa so that sadaqa would purify your records from bad deeds and if you look at evening time when he described the prophet alayhi salat wa salam was the prophet rich Salalah ye shall know he wasn't rich financially but he was rich in his heart he used to get a lot of wealth and money and would never keep anything and this is why the Prophet was the happiest alehissalaam was salam was the most content of whatever happened to him he once in a battle got something that fills two valleys between two mountains forty thousand sheep after the battle of hunayn and it was on the eighth year of hijra and there was a nomad a bedouin standing next to him and the Bedouin jaw almost reached the floor is something beyond people's imagination so much wealth so the Prophet looked at him a little of the sermon said you like this I said yes come on give him a sheep give him seven give him twenty give him thousand giving him the whole thing this means that the Prophet had nothing in his heart and his soul autism he had all the wealth in his hand and this is why he was strong if we have the wealth in our hearts this would cause cardiac arrest or they as they said it will kill you but when you have it in your hands the man the Bedouin immediately went to his tribe they said o people come and accept Islam because I have come from someone who does not feel poverty the whole tribe embrace Islam so the Prophet gives alayhi salatu wassalam the companions give the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam if I had gold as much as the Mount of Hood imagined mountain in gold the Prophet says I would not like three days to pass over me without me spending it all in the course of Allah except something I keep for that because maybe I have borrowed something from here and there I gave it away the rest I would all spend it in the cause of Allah what is the best type of xalapa is it when I'm a rich man and a millionaire no the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam if you give in charity when you are healthy and miserly meaning that giving away is a little bit difficult on you fearing poverty and hoping for richness the Prophet Alice's have said do not delay this is the best Sbrocco when you are healthy miserly you are afraid of poverty and hoping for being rich then the Prophet says I some do not delay until you are at the point of death and you say give this to so-and-so give this to so and so we always delay no now you have you give and if you look at the people and the categories of the people on the day of judgment you will find that a person who's a scholar teaches a person who is a Mujahid fights in the cause of Allah is martyred in the cause of Allah a person who prays in the Masjid is a worshiper a person who fasts is someone who's doing it for the sake of Allah the person who gives in sadaqa in charity comes on the day of judgment with all of their good deeds because he gave money to print books to support TV channels Islamic and to give lectures so he would be like the scholar he built a message it so that worshipers would pray in it so he will come with their reward he gave a power to break the fast and feed the people who were fasting so he will get exactly like they are having and he gives his money for the cause of Allah to elevate the word of Allah in jihad and he will have the same thing sadaqa is something that goes beyond our imagination the amount of reward that awaits us only if you what if you believe was sadaqa to Burhan it's a proof it's an evidence was sadaqa to is something that indicates that you're sincere and truthful what type of sadaqa is best there are different opinions of scholars some of them say there is a hadith and it's authentic by Albani he said that the prophet sallallaahu ra sallam said the best of siddhappa is to provide water so if you dig a well like we have seen in Yemen and elsewhere this is part of the best of silica others say scholars whatever is needed so sometimes in famine struck areas feeding them and providing them with water to drink is the best in other places maybe building a Masjid in other places building an orphanage but it goes without doubt that all of these work need to be associated with knowledge I can feed a mouse I can provide a shelter but I need to give the children proper knowledge of the religion that would stay with them until the day they die feeding them nourishing them clothing them sheltering them are all good deeds but without knowledge of the Quran and you've seen in the presentation the circles of knowledge among women masha'Allah they are all in here job they're memorizing the Quran the learning about rápida and toe heat this is more important than anything else but it's a collective work we need to feed and we need to teach so all of this is combined in the hadith of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam when the son of Adam dies all his good deeds come to an end except three ongoing charity sadaqah to Algeria building a Masjid building an Institute building or printing books of proper Elam teaching people ongoing charity beneficial knowledge this is what we claim to be looking for in sha allah in our teachers in our professors in our scholars who teach beneficial knowledge and the prophecies Ali salat WA Salam or righteous offspring who will pray for him whether a boy or a girl this is part of what continues after your death so now after the dinner and the desserts after you have given you have a choice you're alive you can give I urge myself and you to give generously because this is how you invest your wealth in the proper Channel allah azza wajal will substitute you will compensate you and we'll throw barakah in whatever you have left hada Allahu Alem when it's battle realm alayhi assalam wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik alaa abdul rasul allah nabim muhammad while he was happy he marine [Applause] disarmed allahu khairan to share a similar kim for the very enlightening speech"
