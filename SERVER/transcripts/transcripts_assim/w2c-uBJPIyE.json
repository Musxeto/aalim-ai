  "transcript": "foreign I am not allowed to fast for whatever reason whether it is for the purpose of paying back my misspass or on a foreign countries are already celebrating the first day of it which is first of showers and I'm intending to to travel to a broader town of the neighboring country which has they have really celebrated the first of shower and I'm still fasting and by the time if I were to reach to that intended destination am I easy perfectly fine for me to still keep on fasting first of all the issue of fasting and breaking your fast for eat is dependent on sighting of the Moon the prophet said I'm in an authentic Hadith fast when seeing it there is the Crescent and break your fast that is for it when you see it there is a crescent as well and he also said the day of fasting is the day when you all fast and the day of Eid is the day when you all celebrate it so you're part of the community and you cannot go against them if you are in a country you you fasted the 28th the 29th and then they said oh tomorrow is it then you have to celebrate eat with them because you're in the country and if there is an adjacent country that fasted 29th and the 20th and the 30th they still fasted it unlike your country did not celebrate it this is their right they have to fast because they are in that country and everybody else is passing on the 30th now the question is if I fasted the 28th and the 29th in my country and just before sunset I traveled to this country and I reached there and they are fasting the 29th like my country the following day they said today is 30th we're fasting while my country said today is eight we're not fasting who should I follow you should follow the country you are in at the moment with the Muslims who are fasting and you must fast with them the only time that you may skip fasting is if you were in your country on the 29th and the sun had set and then they said oh we see the Crescent alhamdulillah Ramadan is over tomorrow's Aid so now for you in your country Reed has been established and five minutes later you take a plane and you move to the other country and they say tomorrow's 30th we're fasting in this case you don't fast why because it is read for you Halas Ramadan is over and you saw the Crescent with the people who are celebrating Eid when you go to a country that are fasting you cannot fast with them but don't show them that you're celebrating Aid because you'll go against all of them rather pretend that you are fasting and actually it's your first day of Eid and Allah Knows Best"
