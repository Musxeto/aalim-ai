  "transcript": "Russell says me and my wife would like to make our hedge however my savings are from my income that I earn by working in a bank in the UK I have learned before I joined the bank that it is prohibited I've tried looking for another job and it is very difficult to change career paths but I'm still trying so would it be permissible to make hedge with this money this is an issue of dispute among scholars some say that the hadith where the Prophet says Allah saw some inna llaha pay even well ah Jakub Allah Allah ie well allahu allah pay even that Allah as Odin is good and he does not accept financially that is anything except which is good meaning that if you earn her own money and you go to spend it in charity Allah will not accept that from you as a charity if you want to give the cut out of it it's how long money it's not going to be accepted so as a consequence these scholar said if you perform Hajj your Hajj would be invalid as well other scholars took a softer approach and they said that hatch is a ritual that is combined between physical and financial salat for example it's all physical while zakat it's all financial so Hajj is a combination and though the person's earnings which he had performed Hajj with were Haram yet the physical effort that he had done and he travelled and he prayed and did all the rituals these are accepted and Halla and this is why the permanent committee of IFTA gave the fatwa of saying that your hatch is valid as a pillar of Islam it's gone but your sinful still for your earning your reward definitely is not the same as someone who performed his hatch with his halal earned money and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
