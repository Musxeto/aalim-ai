  "transcript": "a person who is in the state of a major ritual impurity so if a person is in the state of major ritual impurity Geneva and he would like to go for a second round after reloading or he wants to drink or eat or even go to a shop and buy something and come back but he's in the state of major ritual impurity it is recommended to break it up a little bit by performing woudl and this was instructed by the Prophet Alistair Sam especially when it comes to having intercourse again without having a bath this is recommended because it makes you fresher as the Prophet said that is a lot sooner"
