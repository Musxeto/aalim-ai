  "transcript": "ibraim from Guinea Allah bless you and your team um my question today is related to uh basically the 10 days are coming and I wanted to do the whole 10 days or 10 nights inside the masket but the problem is currently I'm helping my father with a huge legal problem that I'm helping me solve so I cannot do the whole in the Masid every time he needs I have to get out but like since it is let's say a necessity like should I every time renew my intention of every time I come back to the Masid or is it fine to just do it in one alhamdulillah is not mandatory while helping your father in what he needs you in is so when you help your father you're being rewarded more than the but if there is a space or a period of time where you're not needed and you go back to the Masjid you renew your and do even if it's for four or five hours without any problem inshallah"
