  "transcript": "sh we know that Allah has given us a will which is under his will and so we are responsible for our own shortcomings and faults my question is if we are not being able to excel in our worldly activities or achieve our goals for example uh I want to get rich or I want to trck an entrance exam is it possible that Allah is stopping me from doing so in the sense like how should I differentiate between my own shortcoming such that uh uh no this is my fault and I need to improve myself work on myself or maybe this is uh something that Allah doesn't want me to achieve could you please uh explain this issue a bit this is something that no one knows and hence Allah has given us the free will to choose and our choices are governed by Allah's choice but we don't know what Allah would choose for us so we have to Excel and do our level best and if we succeed then alhamdulillah Allah has made it possible for us to succeed and if we fail though we had done everything in our possession our hearts are content because we know that we've done our best and Allah chose it not to happen so this is the best for us and Allah Knows Best"
