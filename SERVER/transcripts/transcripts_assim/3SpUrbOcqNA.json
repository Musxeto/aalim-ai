  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam. My question is sometimes when I make wudu I try to ignore every doubt that I get but I wanted to know the ruling on this thing. So whenever I'm washing my face and I'm wiping my whole face sometimes my lips are clenched and they sometimes turn inwards so and I wipe like I try my whole fingers do not cover my whole lips so is that some detail that I should be paying attention to? What you're asking about is part of what Shaytan does best and that is messing up with your head. In Islam Allah says in Chapter 5 Surah Al-Ma'idah O you who believe whenever you want to pray wash your faces. So what is washing the face? Putting water in your the palms of your hands usually it's two spoon tablespoons two or three and then you just wash your face that's it I've washed my face. Oh Sheikh what about the corner of the eyes what about what's underneath your eyebrows what about here this area and this area and actually this is not washing your face take your face to a car wash that will do a good job but washing the face usually it's just this and move on. So my lips Sheikh were turned inwards what is this what your lips is from the tribal Africans where they put dishes when they're young and this is this big normal lips this does the job when you make madmada when you turn the water in your mouth it covers the what's inside and what's outside all of this is part of Shaytan messing up with your head a lot of overthinking a lot of exaggeration what if this what if I didn't do it properly my salat would not be valid which means that I'm not a Muslim which means I'm a kafir which means that my marriage contract is invalid which means that my children are born out of wet luck which means I have to hang myself and commit suicide which means that you'll end up in jail and in hell for eternity duh this is not Islam what you're practicing you what you're practicing is not Islam how come Sheikh I'm making good when I'm praying is Islam a religion of ease and simplicity or a religion of hardship or difficulty you say no it's number one religion of ease and simplicity good question two what you're practicing in your wudu is it number one or number two you'd say no Sheikh well that's number two it's very hard and and difficult in this case you're not practicing Islam your wudu is not from Islam your prayer is not from Islam you're practicing another different religion don't kid yourself or fool yourself so go back to the basics take it easy and inshallah things will be mighty fine"
