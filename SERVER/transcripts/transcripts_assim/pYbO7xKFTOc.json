  "transcript": "um we know that when we are praying in the congregation behind the Imam we aren't supposed to say uh but we are still supposed to say um uh Robert hunt so my question was are we supposed to say this in the same position as if we were praying alone that is after we've risen and we're already standing or should we bring It Forward into the moving position that while we arise and we say it up an hour the vast majority of Scholars say that the follower does not say semi Allah only the Imam and a person praying alone says both the Imam the person praying alone and the follower of the Imam says now for the Imam there isn't enough time to say it except when he's standing erect Because by the time he says send me Allah who he would have been standing straight the distance is very short so he would say in a standing position for the follower the moon when the Imam says while he's raising he says and not when he is fully erected and Allah azzawajal Knows Best"
