  "transcript": "foreign [Music] my phone is in the carpet or floor that I pray in and then I forgot to turn off my phone or put it on silent mode and then someone's call someone someone calls me so can I do movements while praying like pick it up so that the German won't be the served of the ringtone check it's on the floor no this is problematic because if it's in the floor and you have to bow down this is adding gurukur to the Salat and this is not permissible so it seems that you need to either turn it off with your foot and only a orangutan can do that in a good way or maybe if you try to squat without doing the record so and and this depends on the strength of your squad your quads and your knees and try to pick it up but eventually try your level best not to go into the Masjid without turning off your phone or putting it on silent mode and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
