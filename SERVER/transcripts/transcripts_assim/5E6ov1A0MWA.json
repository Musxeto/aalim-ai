Amala death is the final fate of everything that allah azzawajal has created as this is what separates a lot from others for Allah is the first without the beginning and the last without an endings of Hanna who assuages and every living creature must taste death as allah stated in the quran qaloo nafs in the impotent mode every soul shall have a taste of death and when we lose a loved one when we lose a friend one cannot escape feelings of sorrow and sadness as this is human nature our prophet alayhi salat wa salam when he lost his last son ibrahim some say he was a year old and some say he was a year and a half definitely less than two years of age when he died the Prophet himself alayhi salatu wassalam was saddened by it so this is something that no one can escape however it would be a great relief if we are able to at least be inclined that our loved ones had died a good death but how do we interpret a good death a good death is dying on something that pleases allah azza wajal and allah all my he has given us signs so that we can judge if this was a good death or not bearing in mind that these signs are not 100% proof to say that he's in Jenna or not because the methodology there appeared in the Creed of a Sunnah wal Jamaa that we do not assign a person to heaven or to hell unless there is proof from the Quran and to the Sunnah even if a kafir dies in front of us we cannot say that this particular individual John Jin or Donald is in Hanna we cannot say this because this is only in Allah's knowledge we say generally speaking whoever dies a kafir will go to him and whoever dies a Muslim will go to paradise whoever has these signs in him we pray and wish and we're hopeful that he will be among the people of Jannah because this was a good sign so let us go through some of these glad tidings given to us the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam whoever concludes his life with the testimony la ilaha illa allah he will antigen and this is straightforward concluding your life with Leila allah ma means that insha allah you are among the people of Jannah whether you pass by hell to cleanse some of your sins this is a different topic in eventually you will go to gender and this is one of the benefits of remembering Allah if you analyze what into our minds movies music slang words curse words then you realize that when death comes the last thing that you would say is the last thing you lived by those who live by remembering Allah by saying la ilaha illa llah hundreds of times throughout the day we'll die on that those who curse those who swear a lot whenever they see something they use the four-letter word all the time then they will die on this may Allah protect us all is something very easy to say la ilaha illallah but not everyone Allah Azza WA JAL gives him this honor so many people so many patients will say to them say la ilaha illallah they can't they were held from saying this beautiful word or statement and this encourages us to remember allah azza wajal a lot so many people conclude their life over sin over negligence of mandatory acts like salah they don't they die on sin some may die in their sleep and this is known as sudden death sudden death generally speaking is not a good thing most of the Muslims pray for sudden death because they would like to avoid the agony of dying however the Prophet said RA salat wa salam he said that sudden death is the taking of someone who's angry meaning that Allah when angered by a person he takes him through sudden death because then he cannot say la ilaha illallah because he could not return the rights to the people he could not repent from sins however this is generally speaking scholars say those who live by the Sunnah and die by the Sunnah even if they had sudden death they are inshallah in good hands but the fear is upon those who are like me and you who are sinful who are postponing repentance and they do not do it on time among the good signs of a good death and I've seen this myself personally most of you have is the sweat that comes to someone who's dying just before they die the Prophet said alehissalaam salaam the believer dies with sweat on his forehead and this is a well-known fact a lot of the Muslims when they are on their dying bed even if the temperature is very low they sweat a lot especially in the forehead area when the body or when their soul departs their body among the good signs is to die on a Friday we know that the best days of the week the misery of the week is Friday and the benefits of Friday are a lot bur manga noticeable blessings of Friday that whoever dies on a Friday Allah Azza WA JAL would protect him from the trial and the torment of the grave the Prophet said RA his salat WA Salam there is no Muslim who dies on the day of Friday or the night of Friday the night of Friday is not after sunset sunset today it is last night after yesterday's sunset this is called the night of fright whoever dies in the day of Friday or the night of Friday but Allah will protect him from the trial from the fitna of the grave also allah azza wajal created us to test us and part of the testings that we have is the way we die because this is the last thing we will experience in this world and hence allah azza wajal has placed great reward over different types of calamities when people die in an authentic hadith the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam said the martyrs other than those who died on the battlefield for the cause of Allah are seven so we know that one of the good signs of dying a good death is to be martyred in the cause of Allah and I will not go into the details of who classified who is classified to be called a martyr in the cause of Allah because nowadays anyone that dies here there they call him he died as a martyr and this is not true there are conditions for being classified as someone who died in the cause of Allah so the Prophet says are a solid wassalam listening to us b7 he says a man who dies in the plague the window epidemic a man who dies drowning a person who dies from pleurisy and this is something an illness that comes in a person's body person who dies through stomach aches or stomach diseases a person who dies in a fire a person who dies under a collapsing building a person or a woman who dies while being pregnant or while in neighbor she is considered to be a martyr and also a person who dies because of tuberculosis the Prophet al-assad was select lists for us these illnesses the plague - Ruckle osis dying under a collapsing building a falling building being burnt to death in a fire drowning those who died with cancer whether its intestines cancer or anything in the stomach area or any similar disease that causes diarrhea or vomiting continuously until he dies a woman dying in her labor or due to her pregnancy all of those providing that their patient providing that they do not complain or say anything that dooms their life their world and the hereafter they will die as martyrs so when someone loses a loved one to such a trial he's saddened but at the same time he's happy because he seen them being patient and he is hopeful and wishful that they will he sha Allah be rewarded for that likewise part of martyrdom is to die defending yourself the Prophet said alehissalaam whoever is killed defending his wealth is a marchin someone wants to steal your money and you fight him off and you kill him he goes to hell and if he kills you you go to paradise whoever is killed defending his family is a martyr even if you are overwhelmed by people attacking your family you defend them even if they defeat you and kill you even if you are certain of being killed you must stand up and defend your honor defend your wife defend your daughter defend your sister even if it needs to you dying the Prophet says Alice or whoever is killed defending his religion is a margin and whoever is killed in self-defense is a margin having said that we're not allowed to directly go and kill others who are transgressing against us the scholars all agree that you have to begin from the lower type of defense to the upper so if you can repel such an aggressor by advising him this is good if not then try to get the help of others try to call the authorities try to make him stop through either shooting him in the hands or in the legs but not to go directly and killing him if his translation cannot be stopped except by killing him then the prophet alayhi salat wa salam says that this is permissible and a large division knows best of Shalala holywell a confessor in and hamdulillahi rabbil aalameen washes Valdiserri color wash has one soul Allahu alayhi wa he was happy he Marini the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam told us in a number of different Hadees that when Allah Azza WA JAL intense for an individual good allah azza wajal would take his soul while doing something good and this can only happen through a las will subhanahu wa jal the Prophet said sallallahu alayhi wasallam when Allah wills good for his slave he uses him the Companions said how does he use him the Prophet said our asado Salam he guides him to do good deeds before he dies and no one among us knows when his death will come yet we live in the hope that we reached the age of Noah peace be upon him 950 years because this is what our lifestyle says the Prophet said alayhi salaatu wa salaam about a laws will for us to do good before dying and he said in another hadith specifically highlighting the importance of Sabah of charity of giving in the way of Allah Azza WA Jalla the Prophet said are in salat wa salam whoever says Leila in the law seeking the the countenance of Allah thereby and that is the last of his deeds will enter paradise okay we know this we've heard this but then he goes on to say and whoever gives charity and that is the last of his deeds will enter paradise subhanAllah this shows you that those among us and I know a lot when they see someone's begging they do not interrogate him if he is sincerely poor or not if he is a professional or not there are so many who we look down upon who are not financially well established as we are whenever they see someone begging they immediately put their hands in the pocket and they give him whatever is possible and this is their way of life such people when death comes they will enter paradise with the grace of Allah because their chest is cleansed with this charity they give no matter how little it is and those who give large amounts of charity but they are selective and you have to beg them a lot to get something off of them they are not of this type servants of Allah death is a serious thing everyone is scared of death and this is human nature but when you know it is inevitable and it's coming without any hesitation and when you know that your death was predestined fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation you learn how to embrace this fact once you embrace it once you learn how to live within it your life changes because every day you wake up you consider it as a new day and you try and you strive to do your level best in this day and when you go to bed you say all that calm that reminds you that you may not wake up in the morning I know people close relatives of mine who went to bed and did not wake up without any illness this happens if you embrace this fact then your life would definitely change if there were anyone to escape death our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam would have escaped it our prophet alyce Aslam died and he is dead salallahu alaihe wasalam according to what we considered life and death is in this world but he is alive in the face of Alberta which is between the hereafter and our worldly life he is alive but not like our lives the Prophet array salat WA Salam when he was on his dying bed mother Aisha tells us may Allah be pleased with her that he used to put his hand in and wipe his face and says la la la in a lil mo dis Ichabod he used to say la ilaha illa-llah death has Agony's and she says after what I had seen happening to the prophet alayhi salatu salam on his deathbed i would not hate any of my loved ones to suffer on their deathbed because the prophet Ali saw it was salam suffered a lot but then one remembers the hadith of al bara Abner azim may Allah be pleased with him and with his father when the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wa salem sat once while a grave was being prepared in the graveyard and he gave a reminder to his companions and he told them and expressed to them how the angels of death extract the soul of a believer and how they extract the soul of a sinner and when he came to the part of extracting the soul the Prophet said RA salat wa salam said about the soul coming out of a believer then it comes out easily like a drop of water from the mouth of a water skin and when he came to describing the extraction of the soul of a disbeliever or of a sinner the Prophet said Ali Saleh so and then his soul disperses inside his body then comes out cutting the veins and the nerves like a skewer passing through the wet wool people look at these two descriptions and compare it to how the Prophet Allah saw some suffered and they have whispers and doubts and they should not because anyone with knowledge would know that the hadith is strictly referring to the exiting of the soul not what comes before it therefore you can see a kafir a disbeliever on his dying bed dying in peace so we can see no problems no Agony's he says the final words he kisses his children and then he dies and we think that he's dying peaceful and he's not his death is one of the most horrible death and the soul is coming out like the skewer coming from or out of wet wool while the believer might suffer just before his soul exits his body but this is to uplift and to raise his level at the sight of allah azza wajal his sins are being purified his good deeds are he being increased and his level in jannah is also being raised but when the soul comes out it comes peacefully like a drop of water falling down from the tip of a water skin therefore brothers and sisters try your level best to get ready for that day and Allah knows when it will come try your level best to conclude your life on earth with good deeds because the Prophet said Allah is solution in a malleable how 18 verily deeds are judged by their conclusion and he said that whoever dies on something he will be resurrected on it if you die watching horror movies listening to her our music if you die dealing with Reba stealing people if you die arrogantly thinking that you're better than others if you abuse your wife and children and die on that this is how you will be resurrected on the day of judgment but if you die in the state of Alabama you will be resurrected saying labbayk allahumma labbayk if you die praying you will be raised praying if you die fasting allah azza wajal would show the whole world that this man died fasting so do your level best to conclude your life on earth by doing good deeds because death when it comes it does not seek permission and Allah knows how many days how many hours how many minutes we have left on earth and after that we have to respond to the color of allah azza wajal so I pray that Allah has mercy upon us when our graves have disappeared from the surface of the earth I pray to Allah to have mercy upon us when people do not mention our names when people do not visit us when people do not even remember us o Allah conclude our days on this earth with goodness and good deeds oh Allah make our last words that we say before departing this world la ilaha illa-llah and don't return us to senility so that we wouldn't become a burden to those around us la mulana a homonym - ah wah wah wah - Alden Iberia Attica valerevna Roger dunya Akbar homina voila lava alumina voila Ellen aramis your honor Allah who mocked him Nana bhai people Oh
