  "transcript": "so sh actually my question was a of the subcontinent said that if a person performs a voluntary act in the month of Ramadan it's equal to one obligatory act in other months and if a person performs one obligatory act in the month of Ramadan it's equivalent to 70 obligatory acts in other months so my question is is it authentic she and is there any had regarding about it this is based on a weak Hadith that is not authentic however a lot of the DI and the scholars use it whether they don't know of its weakness and that is it's not authentic or whether they know but they think it is in the field of and it is not related to and not related to Halal andam so it's okay to utilize that but the Hadith is not authentic"
