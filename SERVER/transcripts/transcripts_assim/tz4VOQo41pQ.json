  "transcript": "Chad from the UAE uh says uh these days many people engage in idle talk so it's idle talk a thing and if you could tell us how Idol talks are like and how to avoid it it'll be beneficial Insurance see idle talk is grades and levels if there is no sin in it then there's no problem but it's a waste of time so you and I could sit and talk for hours about nothing we could talk about cars could talk about sports we could talk about tourism sightseeing we could talk about skiing we could talk about a scuba diving and these are not related to Dunya such as real estate or making money or Investments nor to worldly matters physics chemistry beneficial knowledge nor to Islamic knowledge so this is a form of idol talk but it doesn't contain any Haram laru in the sense that there's no backbiting there's no slandering there's no music there is no uh celebrations of the kaffar of the disbelievers it doesn't contain anything Haram so moderately speaking we do need this sort of idle talk to water down or to at least to break the ice when we go to a wedding or to a gathering we have to use this form of idle talk instead of going straight into preaching and reminding people of Jannah and intimidating them of Hellfire you can just go barge in like this so we need to speak a little bit about worldly things here and there uh drop a joke or two and then seriously address an issue but to spend your time in idle talk that doesn't benefit you neither in this Dunya nor in the it's like someone playing Solitaire for six hours I know people who are addicted to this or mind sweeping I I know I'm a little bit uh backdated but people spent six seven hours playing Solitaire what are you doing this is an addiction he said I'm not doing anything Haram I'm just playing this is Haram because this is time that you will be asked about in your grave and on the day of judgment so you have to strike the right balance and Allah Knows Best"
