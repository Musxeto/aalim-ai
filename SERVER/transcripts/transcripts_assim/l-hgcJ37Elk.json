  "title": "Fortress Of Muslim 64 Excellence of sending salutations on Prophet, Spreading Salam Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord the beauty of offering salutation upon the prophet Allah so many people you hear them mention the name of the prophet and they don't offer salutation is this bad well Hadith 221 the prophet said The Miser is one whom when I mentioned to him fails to send prayers upon me Allah so whenever you write his name people write p b u H I think which is an acronym for peace be upon him this is not valid this is an innovation it's not good in Arabic they just write Salah or Saad and this is not correct say the whole thing Allah would pray upon you ten times you will be rewarded and you will not be a miser so what happens when we offer salutation upon the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam Hadith 222 the prophet says um Allah has Angels who roam the Earth and convey Salam to me from my ummah what does that mean it means that number one the prophet Allah does not hear you does not know what is happening on Earth at the moment because he's dead as Allah mentioned in the Quran you are to die and they will die so the prophet is that Allah otherwise why did we have caliphs after him why don't we go and seek his help because he's dead it's over he doesn't hear he doesn't know unlike what some of the ignorance think that he controls the universe like he controls the palm of his hand and his hazar Nazar and he knows everything this is all blatant shirk they are attributing Allah's attributes to the prophet Islam who's dead so he doesn't see he doesn't know what's happening because he's in the life of the barsa which is a transition period between this Dunya and the hereafter however there are angels roaming the whole earth anyone who offers salutation they will deliver that to the prophet Allah and convey your Saddam to him and Hadith 223 elaborates a bit um so the prophet says whenever someone sends salaam upon me Allah returns my soul to me so that I may return Salam to that person so when the Angels come Allah returns his soul okay what is this we know that if the soul is extracted from the body a person is dead then when he's in his grave it's returned back to him in a way that has connection with the physical body until the day of judgment but is it possible that it's extracted and gotten back on and off on and off because millions and hundreds of millions of people offer salutation upon the prophet is every second of the day Scholars had many interpretation among them is that the extraction of the soul and it's coming back is something of the Unseen but it is definitely not like dying so it does not have the same Agony and pains of dying when the soul is extracted and returned and so forth so this is from The Unseen we believe what we learn from the prophet assalam without going into how or or why or when because this is from the world of the Unseen Hadith or chapter 108 and that is the benefits of spreading the Islamic greetings the prophet Allah said in an authentic Hadith foreign foreign you shall not enter Paradise until you believe and this means that it's a precondition to be a believer in order to enter Paradise Idol worshipers those who associate others with Allah disbelievers atheists will never ever be admitted to Paradise why the prophet said you will not enter Paradise until you believe and you shall not believe until you love one another the prophet says shall I not inform you of something if you were to act upon it you will indeed achieve mutual love for one another this is a rhetorical question which makes people want to hear the answer and the prophet said spread salaam amongst yourselves this is part of a religion to spread Salam assalamu alaikum the shortest form assalamu alaikum warahmatullah the middle form assalamu alaikum warahmatullah the longest form this is the Islamic greetings which Muslims meet one another and say Hadith 225 may Allah be pleased with them said highlighting the beauty of Salam Ence foreign three characteristics whoever combines them has completed his faith to be sincerely just to spread the greetings to all people and to spread charitably out of the little you have and these three by far make a person a complete believer when he is fair whether he is pleased or angry when he is just in his judgments and this is a very very rare character to be fine to be found in people very rare secondly to spread the greetings to all people and this is also rare I meet someone of wealth and high position definitely I will go salam alaikum how are you but if I meet someone who's a beggar or a janitor or someone way below my status I would pretend as if I did not see him this means that I'm an evil person if I am selective in giving Salam and thirdly to be charitable especially when you have little when I'm rich when I'm a billionaire what's the difficulty in me giving Millions away nothing I have so much money but when I have very limited amount of money yet I'm still charitable I'm still giving in the cause of Allah this means that I am a full moon and a believer Muhammad um [Music]"
