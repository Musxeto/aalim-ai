  "title": "Determining Isha & Maghrib time (redness in the sky / glow / Scandinavian countries) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "like um lookup is actually empty the resin on the sky disappears but if there's still like a white thread like a light on the west where the sun has set it okay first of all we have to understand that the issue of rishi timing is different in some regions in some areas however the ruling is the same scholars identify the time of asia by the disappearance of the redness in the direction of the west after the sun disappears so when the sun actually disappears from the horizon we cannot see it it has already set in the west where it disappeared there is a glow of redness this is the time of maghrib until the redness disappears up north in germany in scotland in the scandinavian countries which i was not fortunate to visit yet they say that though the sun had set the redness had disappeared yet there is the glow remaining and sometimes this glow confuses the people thinking that this is still time for maghrib and it reaches way after the islamic midnight which is awkward because we know that isha time is from the time of the disappearance of the redness till the middle between sunset and the brick of dawn so if sunset is at 9 30 and the break of dawn is at 3 30. let's assume so it is six or six hours this means that midnight which the time of asia expires is at 12 30. now these people say the whiteness at the west disappears at maybe approximately 12 12 15. so this means that we have only 15 minutes to offer rishi and then the time expires doesn't make any sense and it's causing a lot of hardship in my own opinion and you guys have to ask your scholars in your country who see and observe it by themselves in my own opinion i have the quran the sunnah to follow once the redness disappears regardless of the whiteness or the shining or the brightness of the sky once the redness disappears this is a time for ratio and i would presume that the redness disappears after maybe 50 minutes from sunset and the glow and the whiteness and the brightness may remain for two three hours maybe it remains still fajr who knows in these areas it is a little bit strange stranger than anywhere else but this is what seems to me now some may argue and say sheikh we don't have redness to begin with and i doubt this as long as there is a sunset there has to be redness but assuming that there is no redness and we cannot identify or assuming that the redness remains until faster time and this is very far-fetched but as i said i've never been to these countries so i cannot say for myself but hypothetically assuming that in this case they should calculate and estimate their issue similarly to the most or closest adjacent country that has redness after sunset and its appearance the disappearance of this redness for like in the hadith of the dajjal like in the hadith or in the states or in the countries that the sun does not disappear at all throughout the whole season or it's all night time throughout the whole uh season in this case we estimate according to the nearest country that has a distinction between night and day and allah azza knows best"
