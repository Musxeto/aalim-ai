  "transcript": "you know that in India we get interest money over the deposits in banks and no one can escape this it's mandatory to they give you these interest money so what can we do it with it we have one of my wife's aunt's is sick so can we give it to her this interest money has to be given to the poor and needy Muslims not with the intention of getting closer to Allah but rather with the intention to cleanse your wealth from this filth and from this Haram money therefore if your wife's aunt is needy or poor definitely you can give her the money for her needs whether its medical treatment or food or rent or whatever but if she is well-off yet because of the high medical bill she doesn't want to spend the money she has then in this case no you may not give her from that interest money and Allah knows best"
