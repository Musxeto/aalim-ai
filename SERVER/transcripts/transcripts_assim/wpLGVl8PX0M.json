  "transcript": "my question is uh do we have to uh stand up if we are passing by a funeral like even if it's a coffee's funeral where we have to respect it that we stand up while we are seated while driving or something and just quickly sit down is there any hadiths relating to this there is a Hadith and the prophet saws stood up for a funeral of a Jew and when the companion said this is a funeral of a Jew he said isn't it a soul some say that this is not an authentic Hadith and the most authentic opinion is that the instruction and the recommendation of standing up when a funeral passes by was abrogated so now we don't have to stand up whenever we see a funeral being brought into the Masjid or we are in our car and we see them pass in front of us we don't have to do that because it was abrogated Knows Best"
