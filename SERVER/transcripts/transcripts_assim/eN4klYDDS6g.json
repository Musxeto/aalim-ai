  "title": "What number should I set my trimmer to when trimming my mustache? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "from Canada says what's the length I should set or the degree I should set my trimmer to on my shaving machine when I do my moustache this is up to you you can set it up to seven to ten or to one you must not shave it this is what's not permissible according to a most authentic opinion in my Malak says that this is mutilation but you have to and I help the director gets a closer shot you have to avoid having the hair of your mustache going down on your lips and some of the narrations that they used to get one miswak and put it on the upper lip and cut the hair so that it would not go down on the lip but if you trim it like I do maybe because of the video it's it shows that I don't have any but this is like one setting and this is clearer cleaner for me and it depends on your preference so there isn't a specific length yet it is highly recommended to shorten it as much as possible without shaving it"
