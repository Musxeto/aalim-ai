  "title": "Which prayer calculations should muslims in Canada follow? Umm al qura or ISNA? | ShAssim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so going back to Abdullah's second question he says which calculation for us in Canada are we supposed to follow are we supposed to follow Oh Mel Cora or are we supposed to follow isne or the University of Karachi or the muslim world league etc to the best of my knowledge following the calculations of um mal Cora is the best when it comes to fajar Lahore answer and MRIB you must not follow it when it comes to Asia because they have an error which fixes raesha timing to be an hour and a half eleven months of the year after sunset and two hours in Ramadan after sunset which is totally bogus and not correct usually Asia is about an hour to 70 minutes after sunset so if isnan is within this range after sunset or the muslim world league then you should follow that in asia but the rest you should follow on McCulloh"
