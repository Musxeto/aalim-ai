  "transcript": "alikum Salam is the name correct yes it's correct yes what can I do for you I have an an issue a few months ago I used to be very keen regarding my Dean I have started learning deeply about Islamic science memorizing the Quran learning Arabic I used to practice everything I listened from the prophet Sall wasallam and from Allah as well and at school I'm an a student now I've lost interest in school and in my d i practice but not like before I easily see knowing that it is aing my heart has hardened I feel like I'm physically in this world but spiritually I'm not I'm always stressed I have started also having anger issues I feel like I'm in a bul but I cannot get out from it I try my level best to get out from that issue but I cannot I've sleep enough but I I having headache if I start uh reading uh something regarding Islamic science and I live it it's very hard for me now so I don't know what's my problem or what's wrong with me sh okay first of all joia I cannot answer you um before getting more and more information about your lifestyle what has changed what came to you maybe you've picked up bad company and friends maybe you've changed your environment maybe you've shifted your home maybe you went to a new school this requires give and take which we usually do in a counseling session but this is not the time nevertheless a lot of the symptoms that you've mentioned fits like a glove with an evil eye so many a students so many people who are enthus enthusiastic towards dawa and learning the dean and practicing all of a sudden come to a halt and this is due to an evil eye they come to me and I tell them simply do R and in five days hopefully maybe less maybe a little bit more if you notice that there is tremendous significant Improvement then alhamdulillah the diagnosis was right so how to do R bring a like 10 or 20 bottles of water take the cap off put them in front of you recite the fat three times two three same thing three times blowing after each time two verses the last two verses of of blow another set blow another set blow and then the last three blow repeat the set blow repeat the set and blow for the third time put the cap back again and for the rest of the time of your day or week or month or whatever only drink water from these bottles until they're finished then repeat the process again on another 10 or 20 bottles meaning drink in the morning in the noon afternoon in the evening at night when you go to school put two in your backpack when you go to office put three two or three on your desk next to your bed only drink water from that yes you can drink soft drinks or or or or tea or coffee whatever no problem in that but when you drink water drink only from this Ria water I guarantee you with the grace of Allah that in 3 to 5 days you'll feel tremendous shift in your behavior and character this emphasizes and authenticates the fact that you have an evil light inshallah in two three weeks it will be all gone down the drain don't stop R water until you're totally recovered even if it takes a month or two but you will feel a huge relief and difference with the grace of Allah zakar"
