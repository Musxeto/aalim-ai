  "transcript": "Sam from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu How is everything Sheikh? Alhamdulillah My question Sheikh is if I am behind an imam and he's in sujood and his awrah is exposed and I'm behind him, I'm the follower, should I depart from that salat or should I still continue and would the salat be valid in this case even though the imam is in the end his thing is exposed his back when he prostrates? No this exposure of the awrah is temporary and negligible so you continue to pray and after the prayer you come up to him and tell him about it so that he takes a better precaution next time"
