  "transcript": "his third question is are there bad Deeds that wipe out good deeds he says we know that acts of apostasy acts of shik associating others with Allah these ruin all of our good deeds and erase them as if they never existed are there anything else well to my knowledge anything that nullifies Islam erases all of your good deeds so any Act of Blas to me so if someone makes fun of the Quran if someone makes fun of Allah the almighty if someone makes fun of the Prophet Alat wasam these are acts of blasphemy he becomes a cfir immediately and all of his Good Deeds are wiped off if he makes fun of prayer if he uh for example thinks that the law that people make is better than the law of the Quran and you find this in some Muslim countries they say we don't want Shar we don't want the or the Sunnah because the law of uh uh this or that Institute is far superior and better this is blasphemy once you think or or believe that something is better than the Quran and the Sunnah it's gone generally speaking now on specific acts and on specific Good Deeds there are things that may erase such good deeds for example if someone um let's say uh gives charity this is a good deed but if he boasts about it I gave this much and I did so much for people and he talks to the poor man didn't I give you didn't I do this for you this erases this particular part of the Good Deeds likewise if he shows off then whatever Deeds he's doing by showing off it erases that particular deed and not the whole thing and Allah knows best I think"
