  "transcript": "some people take a pause by keeping their head in the middle for a few seconds in between their salams is this right he's referring to say assalamualaikum warahmatullah a Salam o aleikum wa rahmatullah this is not from the sooner you should you should say this simultaneously by saying as-salamu alaikum WA Rahmatullah as Salam o aleikum wa rahmatullah you do not post some people do more than that they like zigzag so they say assalamu aleikum wa rahmatullah I said Mr a Kimora I don't know where this came from but a lot of the Arabs do this this is totally bogus it has nothing to do with the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam"
