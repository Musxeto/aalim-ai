  "title": "Mother can't FAST OR afford to pay Fidya, is it sonâ€™s responsibility? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Hamza from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh If my mother has a chronic disease and cannot pass Ramadan, I know that she has to expiate by feeding a poor person for each misday. If my mother does not work and has no income, does the obligation of her expiation fall on me, in case that my father is not willing to do it? As fasting is part of her obligation, feeding is also part of her obligation. Now if there is someone who is volunteering, such as her husband or her son, alhamdulillah. But if they don't want to pay, she has no sin on her and Allah knows best."
