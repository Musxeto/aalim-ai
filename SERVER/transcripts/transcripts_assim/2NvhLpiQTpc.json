  "transcript": "mmm Saudi Arabia says do we have to have an intention for every prayer we pray the answer is yes ha ha ha may Allah be pleased with him said that the Prophet alehsalaam said that indeed all deeds are connected or dependent on the intention in the man Ahmad bin yet that verily deeds are judged by the intentions so when you go to prayer you have to have the intention for that prayer now he said something that caught my attention that is do we have to say the Nia the NIA he is something that you do in your heart it is something that is not uttered it is something that you intend to do so now when I do this I got hold of my pen I did not say okay I am going to take hold of my pen voil√° know all what I do of all what I did is thought about it and did it like if I have some Brioni in front of me preferably mutton biryani I don't like chicken biryani and I say bismillah and I start eating my friend asked me what are you doing I said I'm eating so did you intend it so do you think I'm crazy definitely I intended it I'm holding a spoon and I'm eating it and I said it's me laughs so your intention is marked by making Woodill walking or driving to the message entering the message and you know that this is the whole time other time you're not insane he don't let Shaitaan play with you this is the intention ok sure do I say in my heart with my lips sealed that I intend to pray the whole prayer today at on Saturday behind the imam so and so for raka the however are not not Kedah it's this is nonsense all of this is bida and you should not say that at all"
