  "transcript": "that we are closer we this is the majestic pronoun referring to allah we are closer to him than his jugular veins so his father says that allah is everywhere according to this ayah first of all issues of akita are not to be discussed by laymen especially those who did not read the whole quran especially of those who have no knowledge of the sunnah i cannot come to one single ayah and say listen i have evidence of this and that while neglecting tens and hundreds of different verses that go against my understanding why um may allah be pleased with him the second caliph said do not debate with the people of innovation with the verses of the quran what yes umar said do not debate the people of innovation with the quran because the quran can be looked and understood from different angles but debate them with the sunna with the authentic hadiths this is crystal clear and it cuts all arguments so your father who came to this particular verse and he said that allah is closer to us than our jugular veins we would ask your father with all due respect what do you want us to do with the numerous verses and the hadiths that confirm allah azza rising above his throne which is above the seventh heaven what to do when all the verses of the quran and all of the hadith confirms that allah is in the height and his revelation comes and descends down and our deeds go up how do you understand all of these and we can go on for hours talking about the evidences proving that allah is above his throne that allah is in the height and allah is not everywhere allah is not in the bathroom in the shaytan regime may allah be exalted when you say that allah is everywhere in the bathroom what is this this is total disrespect of allah the authentic hadith when a man slammed and and hit his slave girl the prophet asked her two questions he says he said to her where is allah she says in the height allah is above everything who am i she said you're the prophet of allah the prophet said to her owner set her free she's a believer so if you don't believe that allah is in the height there are many question marks about your islam so definitely allah azzawajal is closer to us than our jugular vein in the sense that he sees everything he he hears everything and he controls every single thing while he is above his throne above the seventh heaven above paradise without any problem so this is what is meant in allah's best"
