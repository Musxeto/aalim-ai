  "transcript": "in today's time where we have many coming from different Scholars as we say uh who allow themselves different things but do not allow things to the masses whereas uh IMI here he would allow he would make it easier for people and makeing things difficult for himself uh how do we kind of reconcile on that uh and the other question that I had is like almost answered by you in all the different answers uh where that he would uh but it's just that that abstaining something uh or from something which is like a blessing from Allah subhana tala like the food that he has allowed us uh but abstaining from it due to tawa uh just kind of extension of the on which regarding the first question see it is a generalization that I uh beg to differ with you when you come and say that there are Scholars who would make things forbidden for the masses and would make it permissible for themselves I would believe that these would be Hypocrites rather than Scholars how would this be when I and and you have to bring evidence without mentioning names so if you come and tell me that the grand Muti of Saudi Arabia says that dealing in riba dealing with usury is forbidden getting a loan from A bank is forbidden and we find out that he himself is dealing in riba and he is lending people in RBA and taking interest from them yes this is hypocrisy this is he's not a scholar he would not be a Scholars but to generalize and say there are Scholars like this and there are plenty of them who would make these things Haram for the masses and they would make it permissible from themselves I think that this is a bit unfair because we don't have track record and if we did we would label these so-called Scholars to be Hypocrites or at least not worthy of giving fatwa what use is it to me that someone comes on TV well shaven and when he is asked about uh growing the beard this is yes this is mandatory and it is must that every Muslim uh should every Muslim male should grow his beard and he himself is clean shaven would I accept his rhetoric definitely not therefore uh i' like to differ with you in in this concept and Allah Knows Best"
