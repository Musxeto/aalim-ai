  "transcript": "Ibrahima, from Ibrahim, from Guinea. Hello. Ibrahim. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam. Is it Ibrahim or Ibrahima? It's Ibrahima. Okay. But I mean I'm called Ibrahim, it's not a... Yes, what can I do for you my friend? Sheikh, I have a question. I mean it's a little bit like a confusion in my head. Maybe I'm going a little bit extreme. But usually, you know, I don't know where is the limit on what is considered a sin. For example, especially when we talk about respecting the laws of the country. Here I'm going to talk specifically about like driving in traffic, for example. They just say that, I don't know, in the traffic it says that don't exceed 50 and you go to 60 or 70. Or maybe on some places, like maybe in the traffic laws, it says you should pass a car from the right, but you pass it from the left. Usually I drive a motorcycle. So sometimes I'm asking myself, is this like, I don't know, sinful because I'm transgressing some kind of law? Even though many people do it here, like everybody does it here, but like it's like, I don't know, is that considered a sin in Islam? Okay, I understand. I understand your question, Ibrahima. First of all, if the violation of the law constitutes endangering others, it is sinful in Sharia. In addition to disobeying the law and the ruler and the community as a whole. But if it's not endangering people, if it's a freeway and I have a fast car and I do instead of 50, I do 150. And the wheels are fine, the tires are up to 200 kilometers per hour, they're high quality, the brakes are fine, suspension is fine, the road is fine, there's no one in the road. I wouldn't say this is sinful, maybe a little bit ridiculous, but it's not sinful. If I'm caught red handed, I'm going to be fined. And I'm going to pay the fine. I'm fine with paying the fine. I have no problem with that. So I would not consider it to be sinful. Now other sins or other violations of the law may constitute cheating, lying, deceiving. This is also haram in Sharia, in addition to breaking the law. So I hope this may clarify it a little bit. For more information, visit www.fema.gov"
