  "transcript": "um yosha from India sh my question is if a person does something which is Major kuf for examples he dislikes parts of Islam or goes to grave etc etc but he does not know that these acts are major kuf will he still become kaf okay I will answer inshallah um yosha from India says if someone does or loves something of disbelief of kufur but he doesn't know the ruling will he be ful if he's in a country where nobody has ever told him that this is Haram and he never thought of it to be Haram it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that when people don't have knowledge Allah would not hel hold them accountable"
