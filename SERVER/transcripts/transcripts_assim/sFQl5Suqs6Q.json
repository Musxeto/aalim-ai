  "transcript": "felt hardship when quran was being revealed on him i heard that something or sometimes he used to sweat at the time of revelation but why and the answer would be why not indeed we will cast upon you a heavy word the quran is allah's words allah says in the quran if we were to reveal the quran upon a mountain a big huge mountain you would find that the mountain is submissive with cracks in it due to the heaviness of the quran so the quran is heavy when given and revealed to the prophet because it's the word of allah the prophet used to sweat when revelation came to him one time he was sitting next to jabber i think it was jabber and jabba said the prophet's knee was on my thigh they were sitting close together and when revelation came i thought that my thigh was going to break and crack due to the heaviness the prophet's knee on my thigh this how heavy the revelation was and this is normal because this is the word of allah what do you expect it to be you"
