  "transcript": "Abdul Aziz from Sri Lanka. My question is what is, what advice would you give to a person who thinks that he has done some sins in the past and he has repented but then he wants to ask Allah for a need and he keeps on asking dua but then he's convinced it will be answered because Allah says I will give you a need. Because Allah says I will respond to the call of the supplicant but then he still worries that his sins might block his needs like he's feeling ashamed to ask those needs from Allah due to his sins and scared that it won't be answered. So Jazak Allah Khair. Can you clarify this? This is from Shaytan. Yes we know that Allah has pledged to answer the call and the supplication, the dua of a person and any person making dua must have certainty in his heart that Allah will answer him and he has to have positivity thinking of Allah Azza Wa Jal. Now having said that, we have to acknowledge that answering your dua might be in giving you what you want or deflecting harm that is equal to what you're asking for or by storing it for you on the day of judgement when you come to meet your Lord. So this is being answered. Oh Allah grant me a million Kuwaiti dinar and I've been calling for Allah Azza Wa Jal for the past 40 years and nothing happened. I'm still positive because if I don't get it in this life, I know that Allah has deflected many harm that was predestined to happen equivalent to that amount but I don't know it. People might have been killed, I might have run people by car, accidents, fires, so many things. Or Allah Azza Wa Jal is storing it for me when I meet him on the day of judgement. Now having said that, you make dua and you have to be positive and certain that Allah would answer it but at the same time thinking negatively of Allah that oh he will not accept my repentance. Oh Allah is still going to have my old sins, haunt me though I've repented and I felt remorse and I moved on. This is thinking negatively of Allah Azza Wa Jal. So you have to rectify this immediately."
