  "transcript": "he says is it true in Islam that a man first has to get his wife's permission or approval to get a second wife and so on the answer is no there is nothing in Islam that compels or obligates a man to see seek his wife's approval or permission to get a second third or fourth wife otherwise he wouldn't qualify to be a man this is a decision taken by the man of the house now I know this may sound cold but this is a fact and the harsh and hard reality that we have have to accept there are decisions that can only be taken by men as the Guardians as the protectors as the alpha of the house that controls everything in the house otherwise if you have two captains on the same flight one says descend and one says go up you have you you're going to crash so this is how life is run you have to have a ruler and subjects and citizens you have to have a boss and subordinates you have to have a husband and a wife there are tens and hundreds of reasons why a man may need and require to get a second wife nowhere in the Quran or the Sunnah he's obliged to to justify his decision nowhere where we are told that you have to have a valid reason so this is something up to the man if he's a real man so before he attempts such a crucial lifechanging decision he has to put his options on the table is there a real requirement for that yes or no if it's a real requirement are you willing to stand by it through out the process till the end or are are you going to collapse in the middle of the way what do you mean meaning that if you get married to a second wife and then your first wife claims to be crazy and insane and files for divorce or want or threatens You by various means are you going to stick with your decision that was justified a while ago to take a second wife or are you going to collapse and call it off and divorce the second wife unjustly and unfairly this is something you have to put in mind before you ride the wave and and try to claim to be a macho man or a a someone who has more than one wife But to answer your question Y no he's not required or obliged to get his wife's permission at all"
