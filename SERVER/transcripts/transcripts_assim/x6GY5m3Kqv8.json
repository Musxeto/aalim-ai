  "title": "There was no imam for Fajr prayer so a Kuwati lead prayer & read surah nas & masad, is prayer valid?",
  "transcript": "In our masjid, in Fajr prayer, there was no imam. So a Kuwaiti came up and recited Surat al-Nas and Surat al-Masad in the Qura'an. Is this Salah valid? Of course it's valid. Just because he's Kuwaiti, it's valid, definitely. Racist? What has his nationality have to do with the question? Ya Akhi, people are so racist nowadays. It doesn't make any sense. By the way, this is also part of ignorance. Because people don't know what are the pillars, what are the mandatory acts, what are the Sunnahs. غَيْرِ الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ Allahu Akbar. The prayer is 100% valid. Not only that, the Prophet ﷺ in Hajj, in Mina, he recited in Fajr, إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الْأَرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا in the first raka'ah and also in the second raka'ah in Fajr. So, what did the guy do? He did right and he recited the Sunnah and there is no problem in the Salah at all."
