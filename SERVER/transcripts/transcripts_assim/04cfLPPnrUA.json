  "transcript": "[Applause] uh just quick question regarding the youths and youth youth youth yeah nowadays everybody's busy with football what advice do you give the youth and the parents who buy T-shirts on uh Premiership football for the Youth Basketball is good no I I know I know but there's lot as you can see there's lot of youths ah okay so it's not for me it's for are you asking me about the sport no no no no what advice do you give children wasting time on football no no no let's be fair when you come to children and say don't waste time on football okay what should I waste it on video games don't waste time on video games should we go and join gangs and sell gut in the streets don't waste time on selling G what do you want me to do see we have to be logical and fair as a young man as youth give me something to spend time and something that is useful if there isn't anything useful is football better or doing drugs football alhamdulillah listen to me it's a package deal we have a saying in Arabic and most of you inah know Arabic either when you want to be obeyed you should ask for something that is applicable and people can do you can't come to people and prevent them from doing anything he said this is Haram this is Haram this is Haram this is Haram okay what shall I do go to the Moon I don't know it's not of my business no it is your business Allah substituted us with everything so don't fornicate don't commit Zena okay what should I do get married don't do drugs don't drink intoxicants okay what should I do drink juice eat meat eat vegetables eat everything you want but don't do this so whenever you prevent something you have to provide something else an alternative now if you see that the children are wasting their time in football I disagree if they play 1 hour a day good for them it's very healthy it's very good no swearing no cursing you pray in time in Masjid and this is why the advice to all Masjid and Islamic centers to control this have a backyard or a playground for them and the Imam be fit you go and be a go goalie for them so that before 15 minutes of m y stop we go make come to the Masid and they pray in the Masid it becomes in their system good communities invest money and this is the responsibility of the rich unfortunately when Allah gives money to people they become more stingy they don't give back no real Muslims like the Companions and we don't have time otherwise I would have told you stories like crazy about the companions they give without account and they receive double and triple and quadruple the amount they gave imagine if rich men would do this and they would invest in the community so they built a sports club for the Masjid and they insist that those who play Come and pray in the Masjid and maybe assign foran and go for trips what will happen to our country we will be flourishing but when you don't give yeah Alternatives you when you say to your kids this is Haram this is Haram this is Haram they will explode this is why we have to apply wisdom playing football is good being addicted to it and spending six or seven hours flipping channels and insisting on not wearing any Jersey except one saying ronal then Dino or whatever his name is and and and and so on this is wrong this is an obsession I am a Muslim I don't put a caf's name on my back messy no no even messy it's the same thing so you have to be really really careful in addressing problems putting problems in front of everybody's easy I can detect 100 problems putting a solution this requires y wisdom and Allah Knows Best"
