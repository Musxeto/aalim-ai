  "title": "Is it ok to justify our sins or shortcomings on pre-destiny?| Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "odda says i recently saw your video on predestiny but my question is that when we are about to make a decision between something good or bad both is written by Allah and when I am going to sin or not Allah knows what I will do as it is already written but is it me who is going to decide or Allah what does it matter to you now we have to believe as al-sunnah wa l-jama'a that nothing happens on earth without a Las permission yet we believe also that a las permission does not mean that he loves it so when Allah permits someone to steal though he said to him do not steal and if you steal and you're caught we're gonna amputate your hand and he goes and still was it with Allah's permission definitely he could not have stolen without a Las permission yet again a Las permission does not mean that Allah endorses it or Allah wants it it has to happen volcanoes have to happen tornadoes have to happen it's by Allah's will and for a wisdom that will be made no yet this perpetrator this thief this rapist this murderer cannot justify his actions by saying that it is Allah who allowed this because you don't know what Allah has written upon you and hence you cannot justify this afterwards it's like me coming to you beating the heck out of you taking your wallet abusing your wife or your daughter or your sister in front of you and when you want to retaliate I say aji it is something that a lot agreed upon me will you let me go of course not I have to punished if not by you by the authorities if not by the authorities by Allah by throwing me in hell likewise you cannot justify your actions by predestiny now having said that we know that Allah is just we know that Allah is fair and we know that Allah owns us so by making us do whatever and then putting us in hell or putting us in paradise it's up to him he gave us the will he gave us the choice now whatever we choose to do this is by his permission no one can do something and say I did it and you could not do anything about it I would have Allah just total blasphemy whatever you do you're given the power the blood that runs in your veins the air that your lungs sucks all comes from Allah so just so Allah is giving you the power Allah is giving you the permission Allah is facilitating the way for you but after he had warned you that this would happen as a consequence of your own choice so I hope this answers your question"
