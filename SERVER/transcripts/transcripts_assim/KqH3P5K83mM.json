  "transcript": "foreign stocks exchange or outside okay now are you a Trader or just living over on the dividends uh no no no actually I am working uh full-time because I have some extra money and I mean uh interested to have some profit not dividend at all so you're selling Buy yeah just selling right okay now first of all I'm addressing brother asif's question regarding stocks uh uh traded in the stock exchange in Saudi Arabia this is different ruling than any other stocks elsewhere why because it's part of the government rulings that all stocks uh uh owned companies must give zakat annually on their properties or products or business so this is done by the government therefore such company for example we have company a and they deal in manufacturing pipes or they sell dairy products and this company um is obliged by the government to give 2.5 percent over whatever assets they have over their um stocks that they have in their warehouses over the cash they have whatever so they have to they're obliged to give zakat me as a shareholder I'm one of two persons either I am a day to a day-to-day Trader meaning every day in the morning I open my bank account and see the rates of stocks I sell and buy according to whether it's green or red this is different from someone who buys stocks and leaves them in the drawer 10 years 20 years doesn't care about their prices all what he cares about is the dividends that they he gets every year this individual who only consumes a dividends does not pays a cat why because he's a partner in that company he's a shareholder and the company is giving zakat so he doesn't have to give any zakat the devenness he receives if it remains with him for a whole lunar year and it reaches the threshold then he has to give there's a cat and the uh most likely that this is done with his own zakat money he pays it in Ramadan the first of the uh depending now the second person who is a day to uh today Trader is different because he's not a shareholder rather he is a traitor so these stocks when he started to work in the first of rajab he had a hundred thousand dollars he invested by buying stocks put in his portfolio every day he sells and buys a year later on the 1st of rajab we calculate how much he has in his portfolio the actual prices of today's Market if it's 150 he gives 2.5 over 150 000. if it is 70 000 we've lost 30 000 he gives zakat on the 70 000 his portfolio is worth after one year from commencing and starting the business and Allah knows best brother"
