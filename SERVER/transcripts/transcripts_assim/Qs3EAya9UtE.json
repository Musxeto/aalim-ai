  "transcript": "Bisan from Jordan If you go to the Qur'an in Surah An-Nisa Chapter 4 Verse number 140, you will find that Allah Azza Wa Jal addresses this issue by saying that you must not associate yourselves with people who indulge in sins or ridiculing Allah's verses or making fun of religion, which scholars say that all forms of sin fall under this ayah. And we have to leave them until they change the topic, otherwise we will be like them. So in your case, you have one of two options. Option number one, which is the best, is to be blessed wherever Allah places you. And to be blessed wherever Allah has placed you is by managing to steer the gathering into what pleases Allah. So if they're talking about their private affairs or backbiting or indulging in sin, if you're blessed with the knowledge and the diplomacy and the good character, you can manage to steer them away from it by opening another topic, by giving examples of real-life scenarios or stories, by changing this negativity into positivity. There are so many ways. But if you are unable to do that due to your own flaws and shortcomings, you're not equipped, you are a hot-blooded person who does not have diplomacy, and you would make more problems. In this case, the second choice or option is to leave the gathering. Go and sit somewhere else. And this might be a bit difficult in the beginning, but sometimes you can manage to select one or two good other teachers, good other women, who share your conviction and resent what's happening. And both or three of you or four of you could go and sit somewhere else and have your own environment. And Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
