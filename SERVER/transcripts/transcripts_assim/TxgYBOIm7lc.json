  "title": "Is standing up for national anthem permissible ( good word in anthem ) - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign considering that the anthem contains music but the wording itself is okay the wording includes fearing by Allah and praising the original lovely first of all the national anthem is composed of music and in Islam music is prohibited and there are verses of the Quran and there are a Hadith that are authentic Beyond doubt is and in so many different types of hadiths that are authentic Beyond doubt and also the consensus of the four schools of thought that musical instruments are Haram therefore such Anthem is prohibited regardless of the lyrics secondly standing up is an imitation of the disbelievers we Muslims don't do this if the Quran is recited we don't stand up if the prophet's name is mentioned we don't stand up why would we stand up for anything else do we respect that Anthem more than we respect the Quran and the Sunnah doesn't make any sense finally if you are at a school or a government Institution and you know that you will be punished or jailed or harmed if you don't stand up stand up no problem it's not worth it to fight with or for such a Cause Allah knows what's in your heart Allah knows that you detest standing up and even if they force you to stand up it's not out of respect rather out of compulsion then there is no sin on you insha Allah and Allah Knows Best"
