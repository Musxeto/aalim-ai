  "transcript": "hadith number 302 I did 302 page to 0-7 chapter cheerfulness and now was even some ran a lesson and sorry said he asked the messenger of allah so allah wa salam about righteousness and sin he said righteousness is good character and sin is what pricks on your heart and which you dislike for other people to become aware of authentic play this hadith is a great hadith and an explanation of the concise of speech that the Prophet was given alehissalaam very eloquent very short but very concise the Prophet Alice of Salaam was asked about righteousness about Al bill and the bill in Arabic has vast big and wide meaning so the Prophet answered a lot of serum albero house no Hollow righteousness is good character is this it isn't salat part of righteousness isn't fasting zakat it is to highlight the importance of good character like when the Prophet said that is awesome l had you are offal what does it mean it doesn't mean that if I only go for Arafah and then return home I have performed Hajj no there is a harm there is to offer a father there is sorry al Hajj all of these are pillars of Hajj if you don't do them your Hajj is invalid so what does the Prophet mean Ras a lot to Sam he means that the most major pillar of Hajj is a lava and likewise to be righteous if you pray if you fast if you give zakat these are all righteous deeds if you don't have good character you're not righteous I could pray all night long I could fast every Monday and Thursday I could give my money in the cat but if I am lewd if I'm inconsiderate if I am selfish if I don't pay attention to your feelings if I'm not generous I am NOT righteous so this hadith highlights a very important aspect which the Muslims should work very hard on this is why we have the edible Offred this good character is the main aspect of Adam to be kind to people you hear so many things and you have to fix your inside your heart the way you behave so many times I get people coming to me and commenting on a hadith or explaining a story for me and I know the story better than they and I can say it better than them but I have to out of good character pretend that I have not heard it and said masha'Allah so after half an hour he concludes his story feeling that he had done something good as he haha I know it how does he feel or if I interrupt him if I correct him so part of the good character is to fix your shortcomings and this needs training this doesn't come all of a sudden it needs among someone who guides you who teaches you who gives you your shortcomings in a way so that you can fix and help that the second part is about sin and burden what is the word and dislike and sin and the hadith is an ism which is a wider meaning of Adam sin so sin the definition of it is what pricks in your heart and which you dislike for other people to become aware of which means that even if you don't have knowledge of the Quran and the Sunna there are things that are natural that the majority of human beings agree upon so even Muslims and non-muslims agree that killing is unlawful you don't need to be a rocket scientist to know this stealing people's property is unlawful lying is unlawful slandering cursing beating being rude all of these are what universally known to people not to be lawful so the Prophet is directing us at a hiss alarm that if this feeling of sin being ashamed of it this feeling that pricks in your heart it doesn't feel good and you don't want others to know about it so maybe I do something and I'm doubtful whether it is a sin or not but sure enough I don't want you to know about it then this is an indication that it is what this is a sin when I don't want people to know about it and I'm hesitant to acknowledge that it is a sin then it is a sin this feeling this natural feeling of concealing it makes it a sin"
