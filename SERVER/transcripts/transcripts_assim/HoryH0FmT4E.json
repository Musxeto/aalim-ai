  "transcript": "so to answer your questions Hamza from Bosnia says that if I'm speaking with one of my friends and we're talking about voluntary acts and I tell him about practical ways of doing these acts for example night prayer and I tell him that one of the practical ways of to be able to pray night prayer and offer to have Judas to sleep early to drink a lot of water before going to bed so that you have the urge to go and answer the call of Nature and you wake up in the middle of the night and you can find do your way to the toilet and then make wudu and to designate little by little of portions of the Quran to read and increase it little by little meaning that I'm telling him about practical ways of doing these voluntary acts without telling him that I'm doing it myself would that be exposing my own good these definitely not why would it be exposing your good deeds when you're not telling him I'm not I'm doing this even if there is a hint or he may understand that you're practicing this there is nothing wrong in that none whatsoever and this is a good way of calling people to righteousness and virtue foreign"
