  "title": "Reciting Fatiha in graveyard for deceased and reciting Quran to give reward to the deceased",
  "transcript": "likewise reciting the Quran can we recite the Quran on behalf of deceased and give them the reward the answer is no or an was there and the Prophet had never told the people to recite Quran for their deceased or when they visit a graveyard this is one of the big innovations in the Muslim world they go to the graveyard and they raise their hands and recite al-fatiha we are at a gathering and they say Allah Akbar last year our brother Abdullah used to pray taraweeh with us in the Masjid now he's dead al-fatiha o people and everybody starts with what are you doing so reciting the fatiha it's the most important and the greatest surah in the Quran I know that but why are you doing it for the deceased so you'd give him Baraka give him reward do you have any evidence from the Quran Sunnah dancers No then this is an innovation"
