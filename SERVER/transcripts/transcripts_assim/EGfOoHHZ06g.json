  "transcript": "You don't have to go, Fatima, my cuz, what's happening? Haven't seen you for so long. God, you've gained weight. Masha Allah, you still look young. Hey, hey, hold your horses. What are you doing? Saliheen from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh, please share with us a guideline to uphold the ties of kinship with the kinship that are non-Mahram, for example, cousins and so on. Like, are we allowed to, if we meet them at any gathering, are we allowed to talk to them or say salam or like, what is the guideline? Wafikum Barak Allah. Akhi, Islam sets the guidelines for Muslims that protect them from any wrongdoings or fitnah. So, when the Prophet, Alayhi Salatu Wasalam, said in an authentic hadith, Do not enter upon women folk, meaning don't enter upon non-Mahrams. So, a man stood up and said, O Prophet of Allah, what about my brother, my uncle, my cousin who are in-laws of my wife? Are they exempted from this prohibition? The Prophet said, Alayhi Salatu Wasalam, Alhamu al-mawt. Those you're referring to are death. If you want death to get in contact with your wife, in this case, allow them in. Otherwise, the brother-in-law is more dangerous than a total stranger. I'm a total stranger. Your wife would have hundreds and thousands of reservations before lowering her guard, but not the same reservations when it's your brother or your cousin or your uncle because he's family. And this is what shaytan utilizes the most. So, to answer your question, Salihin, when you come in contact with female cousins, you don't have to chit-chat with them. If it's an open area, you just give Jarrar Salam, Assalamu Alaikum. You don't have to go, Fatima, my cousin, what's happening? Haven't seen you for so long. God, you've gained weight. MashaAllah, you still look young. Hey, hey, hold your horses. What are you doing? He said, Shaykh, I'm just trying to be, you know, friendly. No, this is not permissible. This is haram interaction with the opposite gender. You enter, you say, Assalamu Alaikum. You meet her with her husband or siblings in a public place. She says, Assalamu Alaikum. How are you, Salihin? You say, Alaikum Salam because Alhamdulillah. That's it. But do not go the extra mile and Allah knows best. Al-Fatiha."
