  "title": "Can a woman go to the masjid that is 30 minutes away from her home? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "there is a mosque near your city yeah near my house near my city and it's 30 minutes to my house am i um can i go by myself 30 minutes yes sir this is even if you're a man you're not obliged to go and pray there this is too far but as long as it is within the city borders and it is safe for you if you want to walk if you want to drive and if you want to commute there to pray there is no problem in going there alhamdulillah but you have to be aware that allah azzawajal told us that a woman's prayer in her home is far greater in reward than praying in the masjid of the prophet medina so imagine the reward now i know that lots of women when they go to medina for example and they see the masjid and they're staying in their homes or in their hotels and they say should i pray in the masjid or in the hotel room we say to them praying in your hotel room is more rewarding they say we would like to go to the masjid up to you it's halal but if you are after the great reward then praying home is best for you now the same goes for you why would you go to a 30-minute masjid far away from your home when allah has not made that mandatory upon you yes maybe you would say we have a circle of knowledge for the sisters we memorize the quran we are listening to a lecture if this is the case and as i said earlier it's safe there is no problem in that inshallah"
