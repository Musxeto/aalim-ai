  "transcript": "I was wondering what the accountability of the day of judgment that the prophet told us about that Allah shows us our sins and he looks other way and the other type that so I'm wondering how we can not be of the other type of the same the same question was posed was posed to the prophet and he said orak meaning that whoever is questioned about every single detail then he's doomed what you're referring to is the the the placement or the display where allel places his sit and cover s an individual from all other people so they don't see him and Allah shows him his deeds in general not in specific and when the person feels that he's doomed he acknowledges and says yes I've done this and he knows that Allah will throw him in hell here is when Allah reveals to that person his mercy and he says I have have concealed them for you on Earth and I shall forgive them for you here in the day of judgment here is when that individual becomes greedy and he says oh Allah there are many many other sins much more than this that I don't see in my on my record book and this is when Allah laughs subhanahu wa'ta'ala and he forgives his sins and puts him to Paradise this is different than when Allah wants to hold someone accountable for each and every individual item he had done throughout his life on day so and so at the hour of so and so you did this on day so and so you did that this is when that individual is doomed because Allah does not question and hold someone into interrogation like this except wanting to put him and place him in hell and Allah Knows Best"
