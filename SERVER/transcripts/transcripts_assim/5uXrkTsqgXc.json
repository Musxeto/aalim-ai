  "transcript": "the prophet tells us that whenever there is something between you and he or brother you have to clarify it in this life you have to clean it in this life so if i've back bitten you this brother of ours is very fat why doesn't he do diet he's very short why doesn't he do pull-ups or something maybe he gets taller and this woman is so ugly look at her makeup she looks like barbie on that guy is doing this backbiting so the prophet tells us that if there's anything wrong between me and my brother i have to clear it in this life why because on the day of judgement there is no dirham there is no real hadith so it's only good deeds and bad deeds and the prophet says do you know who is the one who does not have a penny the broke they said a man who does not have money said no and muflis is the one who comes on the day of judgment with prayer fasting and charity but in this life he has bitten he has not been beaten this person he has taken this person's money he has uh uh uh back bitten someone he has shed the blood of someone else so on the day of judgment allah azza would take from his good deeds and give to each one who he whom he has transgressed against and if his good deeds are finished but he still has a lot of balance he would take from their bad deeds and they would put on him and he would be thrown on hell so the prophet salallahu instructs us to clear our account in this life before it is too late you"
