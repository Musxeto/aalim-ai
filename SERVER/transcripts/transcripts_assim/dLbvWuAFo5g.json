  "transcript": "uh yeah uh my question is uh my wife wants to work but I don't want her to since I think it's just not the best thing for my family uh I know Islam is okay with women working under some circumstances but uh I think we're in times of fitner and of course my country is far from being a Muslim country so I just think it's better if she doesn't work while I provide for her um and she takes care of our home and my question is would I be oppressive if I stop her from working and does she have to obey me okay okay first of all Abu Bakr in Islam things are crystal clear and it's black and white nowadays under the pressure of the media of liberal organizations of ignorant people of Hypocrites who undermine Islam and of disbelievers the Muslims are becoming weak unfortunately under such pressure a lot of the Muslims are compromising their religion and this is a a great and severe and serious mistake all the scholars and Di must stay and remain steadfast we should never allow the enemy to advance we have to hold our grounds having said that as you clearly stated it is permissible for a woman to work providing number one her husband allows her to number two and this is an important condition there is no FNA there is no free mixing she's not in danger endangering her religion by exposing herself without hijab or free mixing or being in a place that she shouldn't be in if these conditions are not fulfilled it is totally prohibited for a woman to work now if you provide for your wife and for your family 100% you put the food on the table there's no need for her to work then you have the full right to prevent her from working even if you don't have any reason Simon says I don't want her to work this is your god-given right as a husband a co-pilot when sitting on the right seat if the captain says descend 500 feet and the co-pilot says nope I'd like to go right or take another route is this permissible definitely not because they have one Captain there is one Guardian one leader of the house and that is the man usually he's the one wearing the pants nowadays in the west it's the opposite and the other way around it's the women who wear the pants unfortunately and this is totally wrong so hold your grounds you don't want her to work and you're providing for her say to her no if she's defiant and she's insisting and breaking your word and not adhering to what you say you have the full right to admonish her to remind her of Allah to follow all the steps needed in bringing her bringing her back to her senses if nothing works bring a meditator uh from your family an arbitrator from your family and hers to talk it over if it doesn't work ditch her divorce her and put your mind at ease and get someone who's righteous practicing that would make your life a paradise because such an evil woman is not worthy of investing the rest of your life with you've tried all means to explain to her that this is the Islamic ruling she doesn't want Islam she's not interested and even arbitration she's not interested from her own family so what good is she to you unfortunately nothing Mustafa from"
