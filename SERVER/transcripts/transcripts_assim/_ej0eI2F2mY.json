  "title": "If a person repents from kufr but not from sins, is repentance valid & sins forgiven assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so if someone commits a lot of minor sins and also kuur and he wants to revert back to Islam if he doesn't ask forgiveness for all of his minor and major sins because he thinks he doesn't have the right amount of remorse for that or he is not ready to leave that sin right now if he only feels remorse and only ask forgiveness for his kufur is his ref is his repentance invalid because he didn't ask this is a difference of opinion among Scholars and personally I believe that people who revert back to Islam Allah forgives their kufur and their apostasy but their sins that they've committed they are still held accountable for until they seek forgiveness and remorse and show remorse from them if you refrain from what you used to do in the past then it would be forgiven as Allah says but while repenting from kufur and still insisting on watching porography and listening to music and not being remorseful over that this does not uh count and as I said it's an issue of dispute among soers but this is what I'm inclined to and Allah Knows Best"
