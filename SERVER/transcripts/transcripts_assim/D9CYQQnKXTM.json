  "transcript": "on uh if someone intends to do a sin very badly okay yes now i remember the question so i said in an interview uh on a podcast once that if a person intends firmly to do a sin and this is mentioned in the hadith the prophet says islam whoever intends to make a sin and does not make it allah azzawajal would reward him with good deeds but i said if he firmly intends to do it and if he was unable to do it not because he did not want to but something out of his control prevented him from doing it while he's still insisting on doing it he'll be sinful for that an example the hadith of the prophet assalam when two people meet with their swords the killer and killed the victim will both go to hell so the companion said whoa the prophet has a salam the killer we understand he's the murderer he goes to hell what about the victim the one who was killed and murdered the prophet said assam he was so keen on killing his friend his opponent so this intention though he did not kill him he had the firm intention to kill and yet he's and therefore and hence he's in hell so the scholars say if a person intends to do a sin and doesn't do it he's rewarded with a good deed if a person intends to do a sin and he's prevented from doing it due to the cops surrounding the house he wanted to steal so he said i'll call it a quit and goes back this is not sinful but he's not rewarded for it but if a person intended to do the sin and did not do it while still having the intention to do it he will be sinful for that so brother um khan is asking what about the good deeds no the good deeds is all totally different in the sense that just the intention of doing it allah will reward you for that and this is from allah's favors and blessing and grace upon us so just intending to do something that is good allah almighty excuse me will award you as if you had done it even if you did not do it so it's a higher gift and higher grade altogether allah azza knows best"
