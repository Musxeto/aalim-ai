  "title": "What are permissible Jokes in Islam and what to avoid? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and he says what are the permissible jokes in Islam and what must one avoid when making jokes well la hey Ali and I'm afraid I'm I'm the last one to talk about this subject because I feel that I would be saying what I do not do I joke a lot and I'm not proud of this but this is who I am however there are boundaries when it comes to joking you are not allowed to lie the Prophet said that is awesome I am a guarantor of a house in the middle of Jenna for those who abandon lying even while joking and the Prophet said Isis I am also woe to those who address people to make them laugh woe to them woe to them woe to those who address people and lie to make them laugh so stand-up comedians May last shall be with you you guys are in deep trouble because you are gaining your income from totally Haram there's no way any nothing comes out of your mouth except which is Haram and at least a minor if not a major sin and joking must not be by terrifying or terrorizing others so I cannot joke by just taking your wallet while you're not watching or scare you or a prank you as so many people do this is not permissible I must not use vulgar language I must not backbite I must not imitate a group of people or make fun of an ethnicity or a race a Polish man did so-and-so Irish did so-and-so Egyptians did so-and-so Pakistanis did Sonne so and we make fun of them and laugh all of this is Haram and as I said this requires a full fledge lecture on the do's and the don'ts in joking but I hope this answers your question roughly Anna Lana's best"
