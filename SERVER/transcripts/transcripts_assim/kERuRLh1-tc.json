  "title": "Abaya must start from head & not shoulders? (Sheikh Bin Baz) #Assim #assimalhakeem assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um so my question is that um I follow sheas and I read his F that he said it's not permissible for women to wear AAS that start from the shoulder but um in my country it is not common for women to wear um like saas that start from the head and um most almost all women we are just normal abas so uh I'm confused about that because I don't want to stand out um like outside so okay first of all ABD abdah may Allah be have his mercy upon him he's one of the great imams of Islam he was the Grand Muti of Saudi Arabia and he is well respected in all countries of the world and he died like 20 plus years ago or something like that so if you're following him and he's your IM and sheh you should continue to follow him now if you want to understand why he said this he said this alongside with many other Scholars because wearing your outer garment on your shoulders see when I wear my top uh gear my head gear like this you can't tell what's the width of my shoulders you'd probably think I'm short I'm clumsy and fat that maybe that's true you never know and this is good because it disguises the shape of a person and with women it's way way best rather if I wear it underneath like this now you can tell the wdth of my shoulders you can see it and you can identify my physique and with women it's way way more dangerous and this is why the scholar is saying wearing it on your shoulders it would resemble the black robe that men in the Gulf area wear with the golden straps on the sides so wearing it this way would resemble men as some Scholars say which I beg to differ because it's totally different what they wear compared to what men wear nevertheless it does expose their body shape so the best and more convenient is to wear this what we call Balto or it's like a lab coat that women wear black which covers them properly but in order to avoid exposing their shoulders and bosoms and the likes they wear AAR which is a headgear that has an opening for the face where they wear and it falls and covers them to their waists so it is as if they're wearing the Abaya on the head and it conceals their shoulders and their body shape perfectly and it gives them the freedom of movement unlike the that is worn on the head that may hamper their movement and restrict it and Allah Knows Best"
