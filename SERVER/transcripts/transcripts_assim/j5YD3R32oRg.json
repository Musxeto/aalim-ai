  "transcript": "from your side would they be perhaps a hadith or well statements among the in terms of their belief with regard to certainly inauthentic or certain aspects that people may be relying upon that you would like to clarify in this regard yasher a lot of the people depend on dreams and the prophet allah hadith clarifies this he says i see that most of your dreams indicate that it is this particular night so we believe that the dreams may have a a role to confirm whether it is or it isn't but where people say uh that they've seen lanterns in the sky they've seen windows open they've seen this and they've seen that all of these things have no basis in islam and one should not yani uh put any emphasis or importance on what people uh say we get out of whatsapp messages swearing by allah it was last night and and and taking strong oaths that it was this particular night and all of this as i as i said earlier is a deterrent these are obstacles so if i am convinced that it was last night what should i why should i try and pray in the remaining six or seven nights i will let go and this is a grave error that muslims may fall upon and allah knows best"
