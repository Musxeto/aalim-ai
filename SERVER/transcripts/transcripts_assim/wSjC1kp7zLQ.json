  "transcript": "what are the things that an imam can say out loud to the people praying behind him before he starts the Falk prayer one Imam said pray this prayer as if it was your last prayer is this from the Sunnah well the Sunnah of the Prophet is of Salaam whatever that Yama was given he used to look and check if the rows are straight when the rows are straight you don't say anything there's nothing for you to say so why tell the people's straighten up your rows when this straight everybody is closed and standing according to the Sunnah you don't say anything you just go and pray but if it needs to be straightened the gaps need to be narrowed then you say is the era today loo a pretty moon so who  wallet telephone item was soft well oh well I fell oh well etc these are all authentic hadith that the Prophet used to say asking them to narrow the gaps to fill it up to become close one another to be lenient in one another's hands lead no fee idea wanna come the Prophet used to say be soft and lenient to your brother's hands not as we see today when there's a gap between you and the one next to you and someone wants to fill it up you try to push him give him an elbow or tighten it up so it you make life difficult this is not from the Sunnah you do this you fill your heart and his heart with hatred towards one another in this device the purpose of salat now is it correct to say pray the prayer of a person who's bidding farewell and who would not pray another prayer no this is not part of the Sunnah this is not part of the Sunnah though the hadith is authentic the Prophet did say early his salat WA Salam pray when you pray pray the prayer of a person who will not pray another prayer after it this is true but this is an advice not what the Prophet used to say erase all option when straightening rose"
