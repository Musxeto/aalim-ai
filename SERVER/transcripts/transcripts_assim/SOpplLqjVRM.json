  "transcript": "I began my 29th day of fasting in Ramadan and then traveled to a country that same day that was celebrating Eid what happens to my fast in this case you continue your fast because you began your fast in a country that Ramadan was still ongoing so I'm in Saudi Arabia I'm travelling to India so today is the 29th I'm fasting ie which is a Wednesday I reach India on the Wednesday morning but it is Eid in India I continue my fasting because I began when it was Ramadan and is still Ramadan to me once the Sun sets that's it I celebrate my aid of course because I'm traveling I can break my fast but what counts is the time when I started let me reverse this today is Eid in Saudi Arabia and I'm going to Morocco and Morocco they are still fasting and there it is tomorrow so today I celebrated ate with my family and at noon time I traveled to Morocco and they're still fasting should I consider this to be Ramadan for me now says no I completed fasting 29 days in my hometown so what count is the number of days you fasted meaning Saturday Ramadan starts in Saudi Arabia I fasted until it was 27 days and then I traveled to India which was the last day of Ramadan so I fasted with them a day now I completed 28 days and they celebrated rate I have to celebrate Eid with them because I'm in their country now after the day of Eid is over I have to make up for a day why because the Prophet said Allen is a lot of Sam the month is either this or this so in Islam the lunar month is either 29 or 30 days it can't be less so if I fasted my own personal days twenty-eight days I have one day missing if I fasted 29 30 or 31 days then my month is complete I did not miss a single day of Ramadan unless Wow come on you're confusing us bear with me if I fasted in Saudi Arabia 29 days and today is the 30th of Ramadan and I'm fasting and I traveled from Saudi Arabia on the 30th my 30th day to Morocco and they were celebrating eight so I skipped this day which is the 30th for me of Ramadan because I'm traveling I reached Morocco when it's 8 so I said hamdulillah I have no day to make up no you do why because the 30th day you were in Saudi Arabia this is a day of Ramadan for you and you skipped it because of traveling so you have to make up to stay and if someone said that our community fast 30 days every year of Ramadan so is this permissible the answer is no they're sinful for that the Prophet salatu salam prohibited fasting the day of doubt and what is the day of doubt the day of doubt is the 30th of Shaban 29th finished we have to observe the newborn moon if we did not see it by default tomorrow is the 30th of Shaban some people say I'm going too fast the 30th of Shabbat why said just to be safe it can't be the first of Ramadan this is sinful you cannot disobey the Prophet RSS on by your own whims and desires you cannot be more Roman than the Roma's are you more careful than a prophet or a sorcerer you have to fast when you see the moon and you have to end your fast when you see the moon to have it fixed 30 days every single year this is totally unacceptable and an innovation so I hope this Danny did not confuse you if it is see it again inshallah and it should be helpful [Music] you [Applause]"
