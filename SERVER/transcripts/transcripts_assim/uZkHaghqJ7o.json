  "transcript": "down for Allah am I simple for loving Ibrahim more than Professor Islam like not loving but I feel more connected to Ibrahim like I when I hear his stories I feel like emotional but for Muhammad I don't feel like that okay there is there is something wrong in you this is not logical because we love Prophet Muhammad more than ourselves the prophet said in an authentic Hadith he will not be a full-fledged believer who does not love me that is a prophet Muhammad more than his father his mother his wife his children and his own self he will not become a believer so what would happen if someone loves Prophet Ibrahim more than Prophet Muhammad there's something wrong in his mind what did Prophet Ibrahim do to you compared to what the prophet Muhammad had done to us we definitely without any doubt love Prophet Ibrahim we mention him in every salutation when we say so we definitely love Prophet Ibrahim we know his sacrifice we know that he was an um of his own we know that he was thrown in the living fire and in the infernio and Allah saved him we know that he was ordered to slaughter his own son who was like 13 14 years of age and he complied and Allah saved him in sacrificed him and substitute him with a great Ram we know that he opposed his father his tribe the whole world and stood alone in front of them and destroyed the idols we know all of this but then what compared to what our Prophet Muhammad had done and it would take me ages just to say the tip of the iceberg of what he had done to us definitely you have something wrong there are a fuses you know a short circuiting up in your head if you love anyone more than the prophet yes you will love Prophet Ibrahim Prophet Prophet Musa Prophet Issa and all the prophets of Allah and each one has a special place in our hearts but none all and all of them combined would not become even close to our Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam so would you be sinful yes you would without any doubt would I be a Muslim I'm not sure you're not hating the prophet but in order for you imagine there are three questions for you to be asked on the day of judge on in your grave when the two angels come to you who's your lord what is your religion and who's this man who was sent to you if you don't have complete and undoubtful and unconditional love to Prophet Muhammad won't be able to answer these questions and if you don't you're going to be hit on your head with a hammer that would turn you into salt may Allah protect the soul so think again go and buy the book called how he treated them where it describes the shemael and the characteristics of the Prophet Allah in like three four months time or maybe less inshallah on Huda TV on this blessed Channel I will begin inshallah they will Air the series that I'm recording about the prophet Allah of the book compiled by Lima termidi and authenticated by Sheikh al-bani Hashem it will tell you who Muhammad is and I hope this would help you open your eyes and see the sun in the middle of the day and acknowledge your Prophet Muhammad to be the most beloved person on Earth to your heart may Allah shall make us under his Flagship on the day of judgment may Allah grant us a sip and a drink of his pool on the day of judgment and may Allah make us among those close sitting to him in Paradise I mean"
