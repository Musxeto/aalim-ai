  "transcript": "I met my mood says he has two questions is it obligatory to follow a specific method the answer is no it's not necessary but people are divided into three categories you are either a scholar or a student of knowledge or a layman you're definitely not a scholar because you are here watching me you might be as a student of knowledge but if you're not either one neither one then you must be a layman and what do we mean by a layman a layman can be a professor in university can be a scientist in physics or mathematics but in Islamic studies he is classified as a layman he cannot tell the difference between an ayah or a hadith he doesn't know the rulings of a lot of what he sees and reads about now if this is the case then such a layman is obliged to follow a scholar in everything that the scholar says why is he obliged because this layman has does not have does not possess the ability to distinguish between evidences and hence he would be like a small rowing boat in a storm in the ocean therefore he has to follow one particular scholar among the living if not then he has to follow a school of thought that he believes in and entrusts because of it is this ability or inability to know what is right and what is wrong now if he evolves and becomes a student of knowledge capable of searching and comparing Apple to Apple knowing where the scholars got their evidences from and evaluating it and coming with a conclusion based on knowledge proper knowledge and not on based on his whims and desires in this case he is able to do that so to answer your question again no it is not mandatory to follow a particular method but if you're a layman you are not permitted to cherry-pick and to do fatwa shopping by selecting what you like and neglecting what you dislike based on your whims and desires because this is more sinful and a larger knows best"
