  "transcript": "uh I have a complicated question so if we if someone drinks hammer and then he wants to repent then it's free his intention should be I know I want I never want to drink again but if I remember something I did and I don't know whether it's Haram like if I eat something and I think I don't like it what should my intention be should my intention be I never eat it again but it may be Halal and generally when repenting what should my intention be so that should I form without a sentence in my head like I I'll try my best to behave correctly or should I should or should I or should I just say like what should I think in my head what should my plan always be okay first of all first of all such questions May indicate that a person has a problem and why do I say this I sit a lot with people with OCD and I mean a lot and I know how they speak how they talk how they think the issue of overthinking and exaggerating trivial things to be as big as a mountain in their heads is almost uh any a fixed situation with all of them we don't assume the worst everything by default is halal until proven otherwise so if you remember something and you're not sure that it is shrug your shoulders and move on just brush it off because it's halal but maybe Sheikh don't maybe or what if this is what shaytan does best to distort your process of thinking and derail you from the straight path totally ignore it you ate something Haram you're certain of it's being Haram ask Allah for forgiveness and repent you're not certain then the default is it's halal until proven otherwise this is the only way to save yourself from OCD to ignore if you don't ignore and you start saying what if this would have the Snowball Effect it will grow bigger and bigger and bigger until it takes you in its path and may Allah azzawajal saves us may Allah"
