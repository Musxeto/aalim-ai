  "transcript": "Saifah from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Sheikh I have watched your videos regarding memorizing and later forgetting the Quran but however I still have a doubt and the doubt is because of the hadith in Sahih Bukhari where the Prophet ﷺ saw a man's face being crushed for forgetting the Quran. Could you clarify please to whom this hadith refers to? Like who is the one who's being crushed? There is no such hadith in Sahih Bukhari. Do you have the hadith in front of you? Hudaifa Sheikh I don't have a hadith in front of me but it was the dream of Prophet ﷺ Yes I know what you're referring to. See the problem is that you guys go and depend on a translation of someone who may not be able to give you the right meaning and this is very dangerous. The hadith was referring to the Prophet ﷺ seeing a man being asleep and another person holding a big boulder or rock and crushing his head with it and the boulder rolls away, the man goes and picks it up and comes back again when the man's head is fixed and he crushes it again. It's not his face, it's his head. And when the Prophet ﷺ asked about who are these two men, he was answered by the angel that this man used to oversleep of the Quran, not to forget it, which refers that he memorised the Quran but he does not pray, whether it's night prayer or fajr prayer and he oversleeps whether he doesn't implement it in his life so he knows that riba is haram and he memorises the verses yet he has a mortgage and he deals with riba and with interest without any problem. This is what the hadith was referring to and Allah knows best."
