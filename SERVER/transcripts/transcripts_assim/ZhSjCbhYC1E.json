  "title": "Are we rewarded if we give charity to people who PRETEND to be Muslim beggars wearing abaya & hijab?",
  "transcript": "talk from india all right and actually my question is that here in india i mean when we look for people to offer charity we we get to see a lot of people pretending to be beggars especially we get to see a lot of hindus wearing their and the niqab pretending to be muslims so if we knowingly or unknowingly give them charity will we still be rewarded and what can we do from our side to ensure if a person is genuine or not okay i will answer inshallah as haqq from india says so many times we go on the streets and we see beggars who pretend to be muslims and the same thing you can see those in europe and especially in england in london you see gypsies wearing the black abbaya and covering their hair and and body and with abaya and they pretend to be muslims and they beg well the norm is that beggars are professionals whether they're muslims or not and the money that allah has given you is supposed to be put in the hands of those who are truly in need of it and deserve taking it so i would highly recommend that you neither give those beggars on the streets anything and every time like some people do every time they go out and they encounter beggars they take the money that they wanted to give to the beggars and put it in a box and then once it's collected after a couple of weeks they take the whole amount and they look for truly needy or poor muslims who do not beg who are concealed in their homes rarely you will find people knowing about them this is the best instead of giving those professionals"
