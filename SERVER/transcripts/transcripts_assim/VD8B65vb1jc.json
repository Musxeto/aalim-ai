  "title": "Online Games involving Gold, are they permissible? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "sam from france my question is i asked the question online but i think it wasn't clear so i'm that's what i'm clarifying here so as a teacher i usually create a list of vocabulary for my students to uh to to revise and to practice and there are online games where you can create the where you can create your list and then students will play the activity in class and when they have the correct answer so they have questions they have to find the correct answer when they get the the correct answer it's a kind of a gold quest so they get they get gold and um they have three boxes and they don't know what's in inside each box so they pick one randomly and one of the boxes is you can take money from another or you can say gold actually from another person another students playing and i was wondering if this is permissible knowing that the the other students knows that student a took your gold and obviously that changes the ranking and it's not real gold it's just it's just it's a game to practice the vocab so i was wondering is this permissible there is nothing wrong in it because it's a game it's like playing unu and you know uno so if i have a card that says draw four and i throw it to my opponent to my right and i refuse to give it to my opponent to my left because i want to get a high ranking this is a game there's no problem in it the issue that may confuse you is the issue of gold and snatching it from a friend is this stealing or not this is a game so i don't see anything haram in it especially that they did not contribute anything and there is no riba there's no interest it's it's just to get a higher ranking and allah knows best you"
