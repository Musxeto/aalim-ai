  "transcript": "me oh the prophet's father was abdullah who married amina and soon after they got married abdullah who was a merchant by profession left on a business trip and while his wife amina was pregnant with our prophet salallahu he passed away and died and this pregnant woman talked about herself saying that i did not feel the burden and pains of having this baby because she didn't know at the time and she didn't know except that it was very light and very easy for her to bear this child the prophet salallahu was born on a monday and it was 570 or 571 a.d now the consensus is that he was born on monday but what was the particular month scholars have different opinions some of them say he was born on rabbi al-awal which is the third month in the lunar islamic calendar and they still differ about the date some of them say he was born on the 12th of rabbi alawah some say he was born on the ninth and some say he was born in muharram the first month of the islamic calendar and either way as muslims we do not have any great value to the day that he was born in because he never told us to celebrate his birthday as many people do and muslims are not like christians christians have their christmas that celebrate the birth of jesus christ may peace and blessing be upon him muslims do not have this because it's on islamic to celebrate the day of his birth only the only way you may celebrate his birth is to follow his sunnah and how is that the prophet sallam was once asked about fasting monday why do you fast monday the prophet sallam sunnah is too fast monday and thursdays so in one case he said that on mondays and thursdays all the deeds are raised and presented to allah so i usually like my deeds to be presented while i'm fasting it adds value and in another case or another incident the prophet when asked why do you fast on monday he gave a justification he said this is a day that i was born in i was born on a monday and this is a day that i was revealed to so the first revelation took place on a monday so whoever wants to celebrate the birth of the prophet he is instructed to fast the day of monday not to throw a party and to start singing and chanting like so many muslims around the world do this is an innovation by itself it's a diversion from the sunnah from the religion of actions and deeds and belief of allah it is not only merely the love of the prophet salallahu that will enter will allow you to enter paradise as so many people think no it is not if you love the prophet sallam this this is good and great but to add to this you have to follow him you have to practice the religion but to just stay there indulge yourself in sins as many muslims do and only celebrate one day during the whole year and claimed that by celebrating the birth of the prophet allah all of my sins would be demolished and and erased this indeed is a misconception that has to be cleared to all muslims but it's it's a custom of my of the people in my country to spread and give away sweets and trendies yeah again this is uh uh not permissible because this is a form of celebrating the birth of the prophet sallallahu sallam and to be objective what is most important his birthday or the day he was revealed to the day the day he was revealed to me because when he was born alistal he was born like any other child but when he was revealed to the day he was commissioned then this is the turning point to all humanity getting them out of darkness into light by his message so we unfortunately there are sects and groups that would like to emphasize on his birthday rather than anything else and they tranquilize people with uh whatever they say about him to divert them from actions from deeds from following his sunnah from applying his sharia from instructing people to abide by the quran sunnah they give them they sedate people with the stories of his birthday and with parties and so on and trying to convince people by if you celebrate then you're on the safe track you are in paradise and neglect anything else there is no jihad there is no need for pray for prayer in mosques there is no need to implement the sharia and the rule of allah and the rule of the quran because we believe in muhammad is also it's exactly like what the christians say if you believe in jesus then you are saved he is your savior once you believe in him then you will enter the kingdom of heaven regardless of what you do even if you commit adultery fornicate drinking toxic and steal kill rob do whatever you want but just believe in the savior uh may peace and blessing be upon him muslims nowadays are trying to to go into this direction because it's much easier than praying you know walking uh uh uh uh to to uh wake up in the middle of the night just before the break of dawn and pray five times a day fast the whole month of ramadan this is a lot it's much easier for me just to throw a party for the birth of the prophet sallam and then it's a day call it today and and this is enough no it's not so coming back to our subject the prophet sallam was born on a monday and but before going on his birth okay uh are there any is there any prophecy or um foretelling about any of those fortune teller about the coming or the birth of the prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi or in the books of the previous okay messengers i heard some say that muhammad is the supplication of abraham the the prophecy of moses and the glad tidings of jesus what does this mean well in order to answer this question we have to go into details of the scriptures as for uh the supplication or the prayer the answer to the prayer of abraham this is mentioned in the quran where abraham is asking allah azzawajal to send one of his offsprings to all mankind to guide them and to show them the right path this is understood moses as in the old testament jesus christ as in the new testament also mentioned this but i did not bring the actual quote from the old testament and the new testament where moses it is said that allah tells us in the old testament that he will send a man from the brethren of the sons of israel and the the the brethrens of the sons of israel's are the sons of ishmael yes because they are the two divisions of abraham and he said that i will allah says in the old testament so claimed to be i will put my words into his mouth and he will not say anything except those that i tell him to and if you look at it the brethrens of the sons of israel are those of the offsprings of ishmael the only similar one to moses is the prophet sallallahu sallam because jesus did not have a father moses had a father prophet muhammad had a father muhammad and moses all died jesus did not die and of course this is the the the belief of muslims that jesus christ is not dead he was resurrected alive and he is in heaven awaiting for the permission from allah azza to descend back again to kill the antichrist and to rule with the sharia with the religion of muhammad so if you look at this verse from the bible you will find that muhammad ali never talks of his own all what he says are the words of allah the almighty and this is the holy quran that has been preserved for the past 15 centuries without any one claiming to a alter or change anything in it jesus christ may peace and blessing be upon him and exalt his mentioning also said that and i i i'm saying the meaning i did not get the quotation he said that it's better for you that i leave because if i do not leave i will not send you the comforter and this is the translation into english the comforter and if you look at the word muhammad or ahmed and they're all names of the prophet sallam it comes from being the praised one and the one that gives you the appraisals so he is a comforter salah his teachings are comforting to the followers of him and this is again the prophecy of uh jesus christ and it's also our the glad tidings of jesus christ and the prophecy of moses and the supplication and prayer of abraham may peace and blessing be uh upon them all this is regarding all scriptures now there are things that the books of sirach claim to have preceded his birth such as the demolishing of some of the uh uh balconies in in persia and uh the light uh or the fire that uh the people in persia worshiped uh was put off and so on but all of this are not authentic so we do not claim it to have happened we have a short break and inshaallah will continue just after the break if you're 18 or if you're 80 if you'll be muslim for 50 years or 5 minutes this is a show for you you know when five times a day i've our foreheads touch the ground in prayer we beg for what's most important in our lives we want to be good people better muslims we want to serve allah almighty with all our hearts in this show let's talk every week we're going to talk about islam and life how to relate with other people and how to serve allah we'll have studio guests we'll have a live studio audience there'll be an email for you to write to talk at hoodah.tv so if you're looking for something different looking for something that will make you think maybe even touch your heart this is the show for you again the prophet salallahu was born on a monday morning and the minute he was born swabia or thueba who was the maid of abu lahab took the glad tidings and went to abdul muttalib telling him that he has a grandson abdul muttalib was very happy to hear this because he loved abdullah his son who passed away and he felt so kind to this orphan his grandson that he was so happy with him he took the child he went into the kaaba and he named him muhammad which was a very a strange name at that time it was not quite popular and he chose that because he thought that muhammad sallallahu salaam would have a very bright future and he would be someone with a heavy weight in his society and i think he said he said that woman free and who who brought him that glad well he did that he did not it was said that abu lahab who was the owner of suwaida once she told him that he was born he was so happy that he set her free there are few hadiths though abu lahab is the uncle of the prophet sallam yet he was his strongest enemy an attacker in everywhere he goes but because he was happy uh when he heard the the news it it was reported that allah azzawajal has made it little punishment every monday on him because he set the maid free because she brought him the glad tidings but this is not authentic so we should not build a lot of hopes on that abdul muttalib on the seventh day of the birth of muhammad ali circumcised him and there are reports but again not authentic that he was born circumcised but these are not uh authentic hadith it is custom it is the sunnah the tradition of islam that any male born child is to be circumcised on his seventh day after birth so he did that and he gave him the good name of muhammad now the first one to breastfeed the prophet sallam was dismayed fueba and thuyba also breast fed his uncle hamza before him and also his companion abu salama before him so these three men great men of islam are all brothers by or through breastfeeding and this is one form of brotherhood other than that having a paternal father and that that gives uh that he's a brother of your father and mother yes you have also brotherhood through breast feeding after a while it is oh it was the custom of arabs to send their children their infants for breastfeeding in the countryside because they thought that or the custom was the idea was that breastfeeding children at the countryside makes their bodies healthier and stronger and stronger and also it gives them fluency in the language in arabic because the people at the countryside speak proper arabic not like the people in the city where you have non-arabs coming in or different dialects and languages mixing with your own you mean eloquence in liquids and speaking is i didn't understand that eloquence or uh being uh um strong in uh in their language yes yes well the dialect is different because they had different dialects in makkah itself but once they sent their infants and and children to the countryside to the bad yet to with the nomads they had only arabic and pure clear arabic with all the poetry with all the nice prose and and and verses to learn from so this was the custom now we are told a story by halima asadiya and she is the mother that breastfed the prophet sallallahu alaihi she tells us about herself of being in a very uh dry year and they're all bedouins you know they they rely on their sheep and where they uh travel so she is talking about herself that it was the time to go to mecca to seek children so that we would breastfeed them and on that year it was a dry year i went on my donkey and my donkey barely walked because it was so thin and weak and we had a small camel and that camel was dry it could not produce any milk because it didn't eat anything and i had a child of my own an infant who was breastfeeding and this child kept on crying days and nights because there's no milk in my breast to feed so we went to makkah me and my girlfriends who were also seeking children to breastfeed and they used to go to mecca because it was a wealthy city and they were seeking the money that they would get from the father of the children they breastfeed and they you would benefit from that she said throughout the way i was the last in the caravan and everyone was shouting at me come on come on don't delay us and my donkey would not move and we did not have anything to eat and my child would cry day and night until we reached mata we could not sleep that night because of the cry of my child and everyone from my girlfriends got a baby to breastfeed except me and the only one that was left was muhammad ali and whenever the mother amina took muhammad to one of the girls of or the women to breastfeed they would refuse the minute they knew that he was an orphan because they were seeking money money and if he's an orphan who will pay his mother his grandfather so they did not accept him harima says that she kept on looking but no one was left so she hated going back with her girl's girlfriends with her friends without empty-handed so she went to amina and accepted taking muhammad sallallahu alaihi who was days old or or months old and she says that the minute i took him wonders started to happen i took him back to my tent and the minute i put him in my lap my breasts were filled with milk him and my own child started eating and drinking and breastfeeding until they were full and they slept like babies as they are babies on the way back to their a camp to their homeland at the countryside the donkey was the fastest of all and the people were complaining halima what is this when we came it was at the end of the caravan now you you're raising us come on take it easy on that camera on that on a donkey and she could not stop him the the donkey was so healthy was so fast all of this with the blessing of allah azza through the miracle the prophet and the camel that was skinny and started producing milk like nothing it was so strange they haven't seen anything like this and they started to eat from that milk and that was the only source of food and spreading it to the others and everybody was astonished the father or that is the husband and he was called the husband of halima he's the one who encouraged her to take that orphan he told her take that orphan don't go empty-handed you never know what allah might bring and when he saw this he told halima o harima remember my words i think that we have taken a blessed spirit we have taken with us a blessed soul and indeed it was once they got back to their camp their sheep whenever the shepherd would take the sheep it would come as fat and full as possible and the others in that community used to tell their shepherds go and follow the shepherd of halima wherever he goes by allah we see her sheep are so healthy and fat and big come on we have to do the same thing and they never realized that it was the blessing of allah azza through our prophet salallahu so they had this blessing among them she breastfed him for two years and after the two years she went back to makkah with her child and she sensed the blessing so she did not want to let go she didn't find it easy for her to just let go so she kept on convincing her mother his mother amina that you don't want him to become sick he's two years old macca is filled with pollution they didn't have any cars of course they didn't have any uh airplanes yes it's it's a different type of pollution still with all the fires with all the buildings it was not as pure or clean air as it was in the countryside in the bedroom and the no man's land so she convinced the mother and the mother agreed that muhammad sallam though he was her only child though she loved him greatly and it was they didn't have any phones or you know means of communication so that she could see him it was two full years and she could not see or talk to her child but she wanted all the best for him though she was carrying a loving mother but she wanted all the best for him went back with halima to spend two or three more years in the countryside or in the desert if you wish so that he would learn more and become a healthier person insha'allah we will continue to talk about this when we meet next time until then oh"
