  "transcript": "ibraim from the UK recently I I heard U bribery is like a major sin and I'm traveling and in my hotel they don't offer parking that that I booked but the hotel next door offer parking I want you to know if I tell the security guard from the building next door hey like I'll pay you like Â£50 if I can park for the weekend okay uh and then he accepts it does that count as bribing I don't understand what bribing means in terms of the major sin the prophet Alat wasam said may Allah curse the one who gives a bribe and may Allah curse the one who receives a bribe this security guard takes a monthly salary from his company or from the other hotel when you ask him to park your car in that garage is he charging you the 50 Quid for himself or for the hotel if you say no he's charging it for himself we go and ask a second question is he deserving to receive such money does he own the property answer is no actually the money is given to him so that he would turn a blind eye so this is a clear bribe likewise if you go to a government official and you give him money underneath the table so that he cut corners for you that he could help you do something if this government official was sitting in his home and was not on that position he had nothing to do with that position or with the government would you have given him a red penny the answer is no in this case the money allocated and given to him is for his position which is a bribe and both of you are cursed uh by Allah"
