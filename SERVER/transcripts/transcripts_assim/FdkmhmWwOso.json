  "title": "Advising people against watching Movies, Dramas etc, people call me Religious Police Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "our third question says that watching TV and soap operas and movies whenever we tell people that this is Haram they come and they discourage us they say you can't be the Muslim or the religious police telling people that this is Haram and this is not Haram this is something between them and Allah and as long as they don't they're not distracted from watching from praying etc then there is no problem in what they're doing and it's not diplomatic to go and tell people about wrong things they're doing this is totally prohibited what they're telling you is totally bogus and wrong it is part of our religion to enforce virtue and to forbid and prevent vice and evil couldn't um hi omote in Oakridge at Leena's allah says in the quran you were among the best of nations brought forward to the people because you enforce a goodness and virtue and you prevent and prohibit vice and evil so don't listen to them whenever you see an evil with diplomacy with wisdom with fine preaching you have to tell people what is wrong if they listen to your handle if they don't listen to you on the day of judgement no one would hold you accountable for not advising them while seeing them do something that is wrong"
