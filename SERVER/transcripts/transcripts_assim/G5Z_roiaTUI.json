  "title": "Qurbani: Parents order me to read a long Dua & mention names of 6 people with Prophet’s ‎ﷺ  ￼name?",
  "transcript": "A man from India. Okay, my question is, every year Eid-ul-Adha, I go with my father and uncle to slaughter buffalo and they order me that if I want to slaughter buffalo then I have to read a long dua. Then, they give me a list of names, to take six names of them, and one name is of our Prophet ﷺ. This is because they are bareevis. So my question is, can I slaughter buffalo? The answer is yes. Sacrificing a buffalo, or a cow, or a camel, or a bull, such an animal suffices for seven individuals, or their families that they provide for. So if they tell you to do so, yes you can do so. Reading the long dua is an innovation. If it's not related to the slaughtering, Allahumma hadha minka wa ilayka, then you ignore it. Just say Bismillah Allahu Akbar when you slaughter it. And offering it on behalf of six individuals and stating their name is okay. As for offering it to the Prophet ﷺ, this is an innovation and you should not do that. And you should not tell them about it either. And Allah knows best."
