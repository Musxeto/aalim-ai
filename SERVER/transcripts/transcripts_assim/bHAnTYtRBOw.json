  "title": "Anything wrong in holding a Mushaf while making Tawaf?  assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Zubay from Saudi Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh I wanted to ask a question on behalf of my mother She told me that when she is doing tawaf, then often times she actually takes the mushaf and then reads from it while doing the tawaf And she does this silently so others can't hear Now she also told me that she heard that some of you are doing this is wrong So could you advise me whether this is correct or not? There is nothing wrong at all in holding a mushaf and reading while doing tawaf Because in tawaf there is nothing prescribed for us to say other than remembering Allah Except between the Yemeni corner and the black stone, we are recommended to say Other than that, the sky is the limit You want to say Subhanallah, Alhamdulillah, Allahu Akbar You want to make dua, O Allah forgive my sins, O Allah guide my spouse, O Allah make my children righteous imams of Islam The sky is the limit You want to hold the Quran and read from it, you have my blessings You have no problem with that Just make sure that you don't bump into those in front of you Or you wander off and go somewhere else thinking that you are in the tawaf But there is no problem in that insha'Allah You have something else to say? Zubair is gone, ok Thank you for watching If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they are poor I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days And by Allah's will, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all"
