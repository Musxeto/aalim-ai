  "title": "Wedding with music & Free mixing, how to tell I can't attend, giving gifts before function starts",
  "transcript": "and most Lima says my niece is getting married and it is going to be a mixed function with music etc I know it's not permissible to attend this but what should be our approach in telling our close relatives that we cannot attend without the danger of severing kinship can we just go and congratulate them and give gifts before the function starts to begin from the end the answer is yes if there is a Haram function there is free mixing between men and women there is music and they are close relatives to you if you know that it starts at 9 o'clock and you go at 8 when the bride is getting ready and you go and visit them before the free mixing begins then the music and you give your gifts and give you congratulations and leave this is totally permissible and there's no problem in that now how to break the news for them this should be our motto in life that religion comes first the pleasure of Allah comes first when wow you have nabi sophia and may allah be pleased with the man with his father was appointed as a halifa amirul mumineen the head of state and the ruler of all muslims he sent a message to mother aisha may allah be pleased with her and he said to her advise me but be brief this is how the Arabs speak they don't want long essays be brief and to the point it saves time and it saves me from forgetting all the information that you had given me earlier so mother Aisha wrote back to him Woori casera murat allah i heard the prophet alayhi salatu salam say so she replied in hadith and this is as brief as it gets i heard the prophet salallahu alaihe salam say whoever seeks the people's pleasure by angering allah allah will become angry with him and he will make the people angry with him and whoever seeks the pleasure of allah while angering the people Allah will be pleased with him and Allah will make the people pleased with him as well was said that's it so this muslima who's asking the question has no other choice but to please allah azza wajal how to pray how to break this to her kinship this depends on her wisdom her diplomacy her way of conveying the message this might be done by first addressing the bride or the groom whoever is related to her and then conveying to their parents then conveying to the her parents and to the relatives that listen I'm at the fork of a road either to please you and attend or please allah azza wajal and remain steadfast on Islam or do you think that we are not Muslims I didn't say that I said that Allah said so-and-so the Prophet said so-and-so about pre-mixing about music about this and that so once you make it clear to them whether they are okay with it or not whether they're pleased with it or not this is not your problem anymore you've done your due diligence you've done your duty and you freeze a large the Rogell and this worked this is what counts most"
