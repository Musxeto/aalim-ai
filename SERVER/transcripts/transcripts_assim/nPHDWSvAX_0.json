  "title": "Is asking from parents or siblings also considered to be Begging? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Alim from Ireland. I noticed in one of your videos, you were talking about begging, how asking is begging. So if I ask my siblings to get me something like a computer or a game or something like that, or ask something from my parents, is it categorized as begging or is it just me requesting something? Begging is asking people for something that such people are not obliged to provide you for it. Your parents are your parents, so they are obliged to provide you for whatever you may need, especially if you're not working, if you're a student, if you're not earning. And asking them is permissible, it's not begging. Asking your siblings for such favors, when you know that they are giving without any ill feelings, and when they ask you to do something for them, you would do that similarly, this is not begging. Begging is when you go to people you know, and you say, well I like that pen you have, can I have it? Can I take this or that? Can you buy me something? Can you give me money? Can you pay for my gym subscription, etc. This is begging. This is something that honorable people don't ask. And this is why the companions, may Allah be pleased with them, they say that we gave the Prophet, alayhis salatu wasalam, the pledge of allegiance when we accepted Islam. And among the pledge of allegiance is that we do not ask anyone for anything. And the narrator of the hadith goes on to say, and I used to see one of them, that is the companions, riding on his camel, dropping his whip, and he would dismount of his camel to take the whip, instead of asking the people walking around him, excuse me, can you hand me the whip? He would not do that, because this is what he gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet, alayhis salatu wasalam, to honor themselves, and not to ask people for such favors, in order not to be among those who beg others or depend on them. And Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best."
