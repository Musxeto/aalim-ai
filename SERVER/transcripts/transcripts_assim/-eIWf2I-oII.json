  "title": "My husband compares me with everyone, praises them and puts me down, I am hurt - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Rocinha says I'm losing confidence in myself because my husband looks down upon me I'm hurt by my husband's words he always compares me to his sister to his mom that they make great food and I cannot he also praises other women see how they do the job see how they take care of their kids and husband how good they are when he sees them outside and says to me that I cannot do anything like them I stay at home and I care for my family I wear the niqab and gloves and only go out with him or with a Muharram rohila everyone has a test from Allah even the richest man on earth has tests from Allah Azza WA Jalla the head of women in paradise are for as a prophet said ELISA loves them and one of them is hacia as he is the wife of pharaoh so her test was to be married to the most tyrant individual on earth and we know who Pharoah is and what he had done to the sons of Israel and how he rejected Moosa and tried to kill him etc he claimed to he claimed divinity he said that I am your Lord and she was his wife yet for her patience look where she is at the moment and the status she managed to achieve with the grace of allah azza wajal and after that with her patience so everyone has a test some people are tested in their health like prophet Ayub 18 years an illness that made people resent him and stay away from him he lost all of its children his loved ones he lost his wealth and nobody took care of him except his wife 18 years and he's a prophet we get a calamity for a day or two and we raise our hands why Allah what have I done I have supplicated six hours and you did not answer me prophet Ayub 18 years yet people are impatient people are tested in their security your tests rowena is with an abusive husband he is ignorant he's an imbecile what can you do it is difficult to teach someone like that someone who has a brain of an ant it's your test from Allah so you can't do anything about that he criticizes the way you look yet he fails to look at himself in the mirror he fails to see how bad the order of his mouth is or of his body showers maybe every couple of days he stinks he doesn't look at his belly which prevents him from looking at his toes when he smiles he thinks that the whole world is lit by his beautiful yellow tarnished filled with lake teeth but such imbeciles can't do anything more than that this is how they live on picking up and picking on those who are under them it's an inferiority complex because most likely his parents do the same with him look at your ugly face your brother is more handsome than you he's richer he gives us money and you don't and his superior at work does the same thing to him you're a failure you don't know how to how to do anything look at your colleagues they're all get promoted and getting a raise while you are thinking in the stagnant place of yours so when he comes home all those whom he can flex his muscles upon is you he criticizes your food but as long as this is the best you can do Allah Azza WA JAL will praise you for that so my advice to you is not to be affected with what with whatever he says in Arabic we say let it come from the right ear and come out from the left ear as if he said nothing whatever he says just give him a smile and don't reply abusive people they thrive on our responses so if someone comes to me and says Sheikh you are like this and you're like that and I'm angered by it and I start to defend myself and justify what I had done he will only get more and more abusive he will be happy because he got a negative response a reaction from my side I could keep on arguing with him and he can go on until fed your time this is not taking us anywhere but when an abusive person starts cursing you pointing fingers at you you don't know how to cook and look at other women they do job they bring money to the family you can't defend yourself and say yeah but this is not my job this is a man's job it's your job to provide for us my job is to take care of the house he would keep on going yeah but you're not taking care of the house you don't know how to cook look at the houses dirty my shirt yesterday was not ironed the children are not clean you're not giving them proper teaching and they're not studying well and that it never ends and only it would increase you in depression in sadness and which would cause a great rift between you and your husband eventually and inevitably you will hate him present him and at the end of the day you want to divorce this is not a way you have children you don't have another life outside of your husband yes he is abusive but there are good things about him so flip the coin and look at the positive signs in him while dealing with him as you deal with abusive people what do I do when the people are abusive dealing with me totally ignoring them so they speak they curse you they point fingers at you they accuse you of things to give them a smile do not say anything not even I didn't do that no oh yes you do nothing just smile when they want to engage in an argument don't accept maybe sometimes you say you might be right and that's it so you keep on talking you keep on talking while you're giving them a smile and not paying attention to what they say and that's allowing it to penetrate your heart which is difficult but with time you get to learn at the Shalom after a few times of such an argument they start to feel silly they start to feel irritated because they're not getting any response so you're turning the table on them by not responding to them you are killing them softly but if you do respond then they become stronger it's like oxygen to them they get a good sense of breeze breeze and a breath of fresh air which you don't want because oxygen fuels fire eliminate oxygen the fire dies so may Allah make it easy for you remain steadfast remain staying home wearing your new pub your gloves taking care of the children and and of his house and soon inshallah he will leave what he is doing"
