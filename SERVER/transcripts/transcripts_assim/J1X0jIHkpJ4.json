  "transcript": "Usama from the US. So I wanted to ask a question on behalf of an individual who missed a few fasts intentionally, meaning they made a mistake. I tried searching for an answer on many forums like Islam Q&A and even your past videos but all answers are relating to breaking the fast intentionally rather than failing to keep the fast due to an invalid reason. So in this case they informed that they missed sahur in the past as a result of being under the influence of alcohol, drugs, etc. So I informed them that since this is not a valid reason for missing the fast that they may have to pay kufarah. So is there a recompensation in this case for missing a fast or they just repent and make up their missed fast after Ramadan? First of all there is no kufarah for missing the fast intentionally or breaking your fast except if a person has intercourse during the day time of Ramadan. When there is this major expiation which is freeing a slave if not possible, fasting two consecutive months without breaking a day if not possible, then feeding 60 poor people for having intercourse during the day time of Ramadan. But other reasons, someone started fasting then broke his fast by drinking or eating, then there is no expiation, he had committed a major sin and he has to make up for these missed days. And in our videos we mentioned the opinion of Shaykh Ibn Aithaymeen where he says those who skip the fasting of Ramadan are one of two. Either someone who started fasting and in the middle of the day changed his mind and broke his fast. This person started a form of worship and broke it so he is obliged to make it up. The other scenario is someone from night time intending I'm not going to fast tomorrow. I don't have a reason but I'm not going to fast. So there is no intention. This person can never make up for that missed day because he missed it intentionally and did not want to fast initially and the time that was this form of worship prescribed at was missed. So he cannot make it up. Let him move on, repent, ask Allah for forgiveness, have deep remorse and do a lot of good deeds hoping that Allah may forgive him. Now if I understand your question correctly, someone who has been fasting for the past seven eight days and his intention was to fast the whole of Ramadan. We say that the most authentic opinion is the first intention for the first day is sufficient. So when announced that tomorrow is Ramadan and you eat your pre-dawn meal, the suhoor, this is your intention. Do I have to have the same intention every single night? The answer is no because it's connected. So the first initial intention is sufficient. Unless you break the fasting by illness or by travel, then when you resume to fast a few days later, you have to have an intention at night time. Those who were intoxicated, they were drunk, they were drugged, though they intended to fast the following day, but they did not eat their pre-dawn meal because they were wasted. If they wake up in the middle of the day, continue to fast, their fasting is valid and they don't have to make it up and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
