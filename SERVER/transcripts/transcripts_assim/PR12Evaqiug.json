  "transcript": "Ilyas from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh I've been going up to the masjid to stand right behind the Imam however, the family of the Imam have been getting upset because they say the second Imam should be sitting here and they put a Salamat there and I moved to the way and I made Salah because I know there's Space at the beginning of Salah for all of us to fit in But when they we stand in Salah, they squeeze me purposely because they don't like me Making Salah in that position Should I tell them that this is not the way of Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam or should I just make Salah in another? Salah. JazakAllah Khair. First of all, Akhi Ilyas, the masjid is so huge You can pray anywhere However, I've seen this myself There are certain brothers Who come five or ten? minutes before the Iqama Where the first row is fully booked the second row is booked or not that booked and they insist on Wanting to pray exactly behind the Imam Some of them even come two or three minutes before the khutbah of the Jumu'ah and the masjid is fully packed and they keep on jumping the hurdles and crossing people's shoulders and necks From one which is something that the Prophet Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam prohibited. They don't care. They keep on jumping and jumping rows from the very back till the behind the Imam and they insist on Separating the people sitting there for two hours Some of them for three hours. They've been sitting there He insists on praying behind the Imam. What I what do you want? Oh, I want the reward liar. You don't want the reward You want people to say that you prayed in the first row if you wanted to reward you should have come three hours Ago not now. So there are people who are professional in squeezing themselves Trying to show that the people that I came and prayed behind the Imam when they're late comers There's no Praising for them. I'm not saying it. Yes that you're one of them. Audhu billah, but I'm just you know Giving you a head up heads up. Now if you come and there is a place and you know that this is Reserved for the deputy Imam just in case something happens to the Imam. He has to deputize someone else to pray and you insist on Praying there Why? Doesn't make any sense You say it's a Sunnah. I'd like to be in the first row next to the Imam. Okay, that's a Sunnah What about cleaning your heart and being a brother to the other worshippers? This is mandatory So when you insist on Achieving a Sunnah on the account of something that's mandatory and you're causing friction and hatred and grudges and enmity in the Masjid There's something wrong up there. You have to rectify and Allah knows best"
