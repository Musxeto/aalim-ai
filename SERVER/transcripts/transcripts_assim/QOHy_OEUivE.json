  "transcript": "Raslan from Sri Lanka. What is the ruling of Islam in becoming a certified accountant and working as an accountant by recording of interest etc. for a company that takes interest based loans for financing of its projects? Also, one question, one question, second part. No, no, no, you have only one question. So, In Sha Allah, you have to go to the bottom of the line and ask your question again. The first question, what is the ruling on working as an accountant in a company that deals with Riba? The Prophet ï·º said, May Allah curse the one who takes Riba, the banks, and gives Riba, the debtor or the one who took the loan, and writes down the Riba, the clerk or the accountant, and the two witnesses who testify, they don't earn. They are all the same in the curse of Allah. This shows you that this is one of the major sins in Islam, and it's not something to be taken lightly. So, an accountant who registers these loans and the interests, and he calls the bank, where is our interest? We have $100,000 in your account and you did not deposit the interest on the loan. Or, we borrowed $400,000 from you and we gave you the interest of last month, why are you asking for another one? So, he's the one who is facilitating and registering, definitely it is haram for him to work in such a position and job, and the income is also haram, and Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
