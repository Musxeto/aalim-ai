  "transcript": "it says i heard a scholar saying that there is no abrogation in the quran and i don't know where you get these so-called scholars not everyone with a beard and wearing something like i'm wearing and appearing on tv is a scholar a scholar is a person who teaches authentic knowledge in the quran brother uh shihab if you read surat al-baqarah allah says in the quran whenever we abrogate a verse or we make it forgotten meaning that it is totally abrogated recitation and ruling and presence we will bring something similar to it or better so this is what allah says in the quran and then he says abrogation is not possible in the quran there are so many places in the quran but the time doesn't allow me to tell you about this but i'll give you an example the verses that talk about the prohibition of intoxications so in the beginning intoxications and drinking wine was totally legit and permissible and then the prohibition started gradually so first allah said that they ask you o muhammad concerning intoxications and gambling what's the ruling say to them that there is some benefit and a lot of harm and the harm outweighs the benefits so this is stage one so now if i want to drink yeah i think uh i'll pass because the burden and the if the the sin is uh far outweighing the benefits in it so i think i'm going to skip but it's not haram then the second stage came when allah azzawajal said to the believers do not approach prayers while you are in the state of intoxications until you are aware of what you're saying so if you're drunk or stoned and you want to pray instead of saying oh allah forgive me you may say oh allah curse me so no don't pray prayer is haram so now whenever i want to have a pint of lager or a shot of whiskey islam tells me listen isha is after five minutes if you're gonna drink you're not gonna be able to pray asha until you sober out and this may take five six hours depending on your hangover so now okay there's there are times that you're not supposed to drink the third stage abrogated the second and the first when allah said completely to stay away from intoxicants so now the first two verses can we apply them in our lives this scholar of yours if he says yes you can drink but providing that you don't don't drink at the times of prayer he goes out of the fall of islam definitely not these two verses were abrogated so choose who to learn from"
