  "transcript": "says that if a husband is frequently travelling for a job or he is living away from home does his wife have any say in this and can she object the relationship between a man and his wife is very delicate however it is not something that is beyond communication meaning that it is not black and white you are allowed to object to the food he gets but you're not allowed to object to this or that no the life between a man and his wife there is a lot of communication give-and-take may be ups and downs so there is no problem for a woman to object if she sees something that she does not like however the final word is for the husband he is the one who determines whether this is necessary or not and as Ozma stated and a question he is traveling for his job so he's not doing this for fun and he's not leaving the home for fun though a man is entitled to do this once in a while there is nothing wrong in halal recreation if he travels for few days just to refresh if she goes to her family or travels with her family without him just to ignite the love once again this is permissible so there's no problem in objecting there is no problem in requiring or demanding more quality time however the final word is for the husband to decide after being asked from his wife"
