  "title": "How can I stop the cycle of sinning & repenting and find khushu in prayer? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh I have a I would say serious problem you would say what I have a serious problem so don't we all yeah um sometimes [Music] I do the Sims I do the sins and then I feel sorry and regret and then repent against Allah but couple days I do this in again feel regret feel sorry over and over again um uh I feel maybe so many years doing like that I feel desperate maybe Allah will accept my topic or not I do not know and then uh recording according to your speech in the early speech that when the story of then fill the closet then the beauty of the salaam beauty of the prayer the beauty of of recite the Quran I feel that I do not feel that deliciousness or goodness In Praise so many years maybe I will try too hard I feel I try hard to to feel again that that the connection but I the question is is that okay I it's not okay maybe I had to sin and repent again but maybe the question is what is the ultimate uh strategy or what should I do to cut off this this cycle of and so on and so on so I can gain my happiness with Quran with Salah and so on inside okay first of all the prophet Allah said every son of Adam is sinful but the best of those sinful are those who repent good news is you repent Allah forgive you bad news is that the more you sin the more less remorse you have I know many days students of knowledge they were this high in dawah they have tapes they have books they were giving and lectures like me but little by little shaytan dragged their feet so in the beginning you make sense you feel very remorseful you cry you're ashamed and you ask Allah for forgiveness one two three four weeks you're good doing fine then you do the sin again and you feel remorseful but less and you're ashamed but less after two three weeks you do it again and the remorse is less and less until you reach a level where you do the sin you enjoy it you feel that you want to finish Risha prayer to go and watch two three hours of Haram content which has a lot of the Muslims say so many people I ask them you have this no no no do you have that no no no no no I'm a living a Muslim life do you have Netflix he said yes mashallah why this is sinful so the bad news is that shaytan drags your feet until you feel no remorse and you enjoy there is more after some time you don't feel that you're ashamed of people knowing so you go and say yesterday I saw this movie and it was a good movie very nice and you share sins with others you don't feel ashamed now before you were remorseful you're crying now you're sharing it take this DVD spiders it is okay it's from China and watch it so you're sharing it after a while you become a diary you become asking people come and you propagate Haram and you become one of the soldiers of shaytan this is a different topic altogether needs a lecture by itself how to counter it number one by always remembering Allah Quran number two by associating yourself with Muslims if I'm alone shaytan can easily play with my head if I have brothers around me I'm in good hands every time I want to do something I said brother this is Haram it's not good brother let's we have a lecture let's go we have this DARS next month we're going for Umbra they're encouraging you so the sin is less and less and less among other reasons you have to look where the sin is coming from and cut it meaning a lot of the youth complain from porn and masturbation this is 90 percent so what to do I'm ashamed I'm remorseful stop internet what about my social media what about my Instagram I have more than 50 sisters on the Instagram you know we just share dawa and share Hadith Masha Allah look how shaytan is messing up with your head everyone who complains of this addiction to porn use Nokia no smartphone no stupid phone no computers you have to use computer in the house no problem put the screen to the wall not the opposite the time you enter the house and you see your brother even your father even your mother giving their back to the wall and doing this they're doing something wrong do it do it this way no the minute I the minute I did this is he's covering no I'm joking so I think I'm too hard he has to buy me dinner tonight you know so it is important that you cut the means by not having Internet you have to have internet have the screen in the living room where everyone coming and passing will be behind you and they can see you will never sin now when it comes to the beauty of Prayer how do we reach this it cannot be reached by steroids this is something you have to hit the gym you want muscles you have to hit the gym and you don't hit the gym for three months and say I don't have muscles you have to go for five six years every day and work out the setup used to say I struggled with prayer for 20 years I'm trying 20 years every day trying to reach for sure trying to find the sweetness after 20 years I enjoyed it for another 20 years reached the peak now 20 years masha'allah I'm having fun so it needs dedication it needs practice and as I said The more you know about Allah's beautiful names and attributes the more you love Allah the more sweetness you will find when you read the Quran When you pray when you make zikr when we make liquor what is this you want to make things Allah alhamdulillah for what for everything that Allah has given me so you can feel rather than just parroting it like parrots and Allah's best"
