  "transcript": "Ahna from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu If one has mandatory charity due because he has some debts he cannot pay back to the original owner, can he give this charity to his mom who is in financial need? Note that this person doesn't have any money of his either, it's just the money that his friend had gifted him which he'll use to pay off the debts. The answer is no. Such hitting two birds with one stone is not permissible. If you have mandatory charity that you have to cleanse your wealth from, you cannot give it to your mom or to your dad or to your children whom you're obliged to provide for them. You have to give it for poor or needy Muslims that have no strings attached to it and Allah knows best."
