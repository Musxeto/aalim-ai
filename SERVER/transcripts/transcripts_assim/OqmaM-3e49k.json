  "title": "Would Allah accept bad dua of someone made against me when I have done nothing wrong assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign [Music] not aware or know about them for example most people know about the fact that someone can make bad against them and there is a possibility that this the world could be answered even if they had not done nothing wrong to them and are saying a score in the morning and evening such as Bismillah to the end three times in the morning and evening and I say in the free calls three times in the morning evening so a lot of people know about this but a lot of people don't know as well so my question is safe by the war is made against a person who did nothing wrong who does not have and this person does not have any knowledge of it and does not know that it could affect him would Allah be more lenient in not answering the door that is made against them compared to a person who knows about it and knows it could possibly affect him first of all is a weapon which an individual can use against others or in the favor of others and when you make Dua Allah azzawajal either answers it or deflects harm that was predestined to come your way or stores it for you on the day of judgment and we've answered so many similar situations before so when you make Dua for yourself or for others this is what happens now if you make Dua against others their applicability of two either you are oppressed and you're making Dua against the one who had oppressed you and in this case Allah azzawajal deals with your Dua in the three ways either answers it or deflects harm that's coming your way or stores it on the day of judgment the second option is that you were not wronged you were not oppressed rather you are doing it unjustly and you're transgressing by oppressing others with your Dua in this case Allah does not accept nor answer your Dua because it includes either transgression or the sivering of kinship and this is something that Allah does not answer or accept at the end of the day as long as you have done your due diligence and you observed your car in the morning and the evening after Salah before going to bed before leaving the house these are cars that are supposed to protect you you are with the grace of Allah protected unless Allah Wills something else for a reason that we cannot see or understand or comprehend at this moment but we trust Allah's judgment and Allah's wisdom and we are content with it and I hope this answers your question"
