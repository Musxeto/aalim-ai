  "transcript": "what are the conditions that should be fulfilled by a person in order to lead the salat as an imam his beard and being half of necessary well first of all the Prophet and I saw it was salam told us that there are conditions for those to lead the prayer these conditions apply on selecting an imam when there is no imam appointed by the Muslim ruler or the government so if I go to a Masjid and the salat is given and the Imam appointed by the government wants to lead and I said hey wait wait wait wait how many Jews of Quran do you memorize what knowledge do you have I am more worthy of praying than you know this is inapplicable at all and accepted because the Imam is the ruler who appoints those who lead prayer the Prophet said alayhi salaatu Sam in other cases where we are a group of five ten people and it's time for prayer and we're looking for one to lead so which one should lead is it the one with the biggest beard or the shortest robe or the most beautiful voice or the handsome person of all no no the Prophet said I Samuel Nass homely Kitab Allah the most learned of them in Allah's book meaning memorizing should lead the prayer if not then the first of them in which in he draw those who came for he drew if not then those who are eldest of them in some narrations if I'm not mistaken those more knowledgeable so the Quran is the criteria it's the benchmark and if not the knowledge if not then Hejira if not then the age factor comes as a determine factor not as what we see today when the arm has given they look oh this chair has a white beard he should be the best of us no we should at least know because so many times we appoint someone to lead and prayer and it is a catastrophe the guy cannot even read the Fatiha so this is what the Prophet said a little awesome now having a beard or not of course this is an added advantage because this is Sunnah but if he doesn't have a beard and he memorizes the Quran I have a beard but I don't memorize the footprint he should lead this is the instruction of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam"
