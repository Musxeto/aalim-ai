  "title": "Prophet’s ‎ﷺ  love for Aisha Radi Allahu Anha assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "foreign whenever she drank from a glass let's say milk the prophet would take the glass and search for where she had placed her lips on to drink from and drink from the same spot just to show her how much love he has for her and of course a woman would be delighted to see her husband not being repulsed or discussed to use the same utensils she had used like we always make a joke when I say to my wife bring me a spoon please so I can eat with she says take my spoon I said okay wash it seven times with water and once with soil and then I get smack on the face this is a joke but unfortunately there are men who may act like this no no I wouldn't eat with the same spoon the prophet saws did that he even went further to see when she had a bite from a bone that had meat on it he would take it and look where she snatched the meat from and do the same from the same spot and this makes the love grow between"
