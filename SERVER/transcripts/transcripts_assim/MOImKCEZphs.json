  "title": "Hair coming in between the forehead and ground during Sujood impact the prayer?",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing from india is it true that our forehead should completely touch the ground during suju in prayers and if something comes between a forehead and the ground for example people who have long hair their hair might come between the forehead and the ground so this will invalidate the prayer so because of this people advise to wear a cap during salah is it true first of all what they say is not true see what i'm wearing on my head if i prostrate i would prostrate on that would it be permissible the answer is yes and if i take it off and pray straight on my forehead would that be permissible definitely yes so if there is a barrier it is not part of the prayer to pray with such a barrier like the shia i do some of the shia may carry a stone they say it's from karbala and they prostrate on it did the prophet ever pray on such a thing no some of them say no no no it's not a stone it's a piece of nature so it's a piece of wood or a piece of clay or maybe a piece of i don't know marble either way did the prophet ever alison carry such a thing or he prayed on whatever was available wasn't he's the one who said has made the whole earth for me a place of worship and a means of purification this is what the prophet said so to claim that if there's something between my forehead and the ground my prayer is invalid is totally bogus the companions as in the sahih authentic hadith used to prostrate on their sleeves and on their clothes to avoid the heat of the sun when they prostrate there's nothing wrong in that and sometimes they would do that on the tip of their turbans again there's nothing wrong in that and allah azza knows best you"
