  "transcript": "and if you want to help our brothers in Syria you don't do this by messaging and circulating such innovations we help them by sincere dua in the last third of the night you praise Allah so easily you express your inability and helplessness you we have nothing to do except dawn some people may have something a bit extra by influencing their representative in the parliament or in their government by providing humanitarian aids maybe something a little bit more it depends on each individual's ability but what we see is that the Muslims are not doing anything and dua is one of the strongest weapons we have yet is not sufficient we have to do something more other than doing it was reported that the invaders came to invade the country and all the scholars I think it was Napoleon coming to invade Egypt couple of centuries ago and all the scholars went to the message started reading sahih al-bukhari what what is this going to do for you if you don't know how to fight if you do not defend yourselves you got to be slaughtered like sheep and if you don't help your brothers after they're through with them they're gonna come to you to finish the plot they have plotted it years and years ago so you you do not help them by spreading such innovations every Friday people say let's circulate this message offering salutation to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam let us reach 10 million let us reach a hundred million then what what are you doing this is clear innovation neither the profit has not recommended this nor his companions that had never done such a thing so what you're doing is actually engaging people in something that is not part of the Sunnah on the contrary it goes against the Sunnah and this is not permissible"
