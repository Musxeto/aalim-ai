  "transcript": "who came who gave name to the chapters of the quran and who arranged them like uh al-fatiha is the number one chapter and chapter number two okay i will answer it uh well i'll actually answer you now because i don't know how many minutes do we have left um sufyan the vast majority of chapters or surah of the quran was named by the prophet alaihis for example al-baqarah ali imran anisa and so on all of these were named by the prophet himself some surahs were named by the companions and the name itself does not signify a lot because it's just a name so as umar or let's go to al-isra suratul israel is known to be as surat bani israel so that's another name of it and there are various numbers of sur like surat sajdah or alif sajdah surat tabarak is known as surat al-mulk and so on so the names the vast majority was given by the prophet islam some of them were ishtihad from the companions may allah be pleased with them"
