  "transcript": "in the UK assalamualaikum law um regarding uh so my parents have passed away and um I just want you to know uh because so if I want if I donate um some sort of on behalf of my self then I heard there's an opinion um where uh when if I donate 100 pounds for example then I should make the intention not only for myself I should make the intention that this donation is also for my parents for my siblings for my neighbors the entire ummah in that way if I for example donate 100 pounds then everybody uh who in the whole ummah would be will give the equal amount of reward and I will get more obviously because I am the person who gave the charity um so obviously if that is the case then obviously that makes sense because you know I'd rather have everybody sharing the same reward as myself but I just wanted to find out what is uh the you know the stronger opinion or if even if that is an opinion that we should I should be considering when I get original time I give donation okay no this is not an opinion you should consider because when you donate something let's say you're giving in charity a hundred quid so a hundred pounds is registered for you if you say oh okay I'd like to share this hundred quid with my wife this would mean that 50 pounds would go for her and 50 pounds would register to you if you include your parents then it would be 25 25 20 and the more you share the Lesser you get so the issue of yeah donate a hundred pounds and include the entire Muslim ummah in it and everybody gets a hundred pound worth of and you get also the reward of donating on others this is not valid at all and Allah Knows Best"
