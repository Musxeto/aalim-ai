  "transcript": "zainab says do angels have free will or do they only do what allah commands them to do both angels have free will and at the same time they do exactly what allah commands them to do because if they did not have free will there would be no reason to praise them for but allah has praised them because they have the free will and to claim that they are or they do not have free will is baseless there is nothing to support this they have a free will but their will is totally in sync with what allah orders them to do and this is why allah praised them of being so pure so obedient and fulfilling allah's commands to the letter without any exception or a problem to that and allah knows best you"
