  "transcript": "i work for a local fam a solicitor they are in charge of remote kit but i work as a case assistant that i receive call from their customers so just of power documents and everything so i want to know if it is permissible for me to work in such a setting since i work uh for the lego film but they are him to remodulate with banks and they also work from other firms like the electricity companies okay first of all you are in a kafir country which means that they do not legislate by the sharia law and they do not deal with the islamic sharia therefore it is not permissible for you to work except at cases that do not go against the sharia so if you work in cases dealing with mortgage with insurance with financing with riba with legislating other than what allah has permitted or enforcing laws that go against islam such as banning the marriage beyond at the age of 21 or 18 as it's in some countries this is haram this is legislating against allah's law so you cannot work at such cases defending them or advocating them or endorsing their haram laws but if you're working in things that are in according to islamic sharia someone who is complaining about another who stole his money or engaged in a fight and broke his arm or um took his rights unlawfully such things for you to work in in order to restore the right to their lawful owners according to sharia according to the civil law there is nothing wrong in that and allah knows best"
