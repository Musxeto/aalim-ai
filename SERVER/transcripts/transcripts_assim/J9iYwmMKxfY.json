  "transcript": "you know set another fallacy you know him you know I would up that come on don't lie listen when did that first mi-8 this guy's name he's one of the Companions brought one of the Companions of the Prophet I saw sir he may Allah have be pleased with him was known to be the Hakim of the Companions the wise money because he has so many statements that he used to say that were so beautiful that you could always get he remember them this man at the very beginning of time when the Prophet has some migrated from Mecca to Medina when the migrants with muhajireen arrived in Medina they were stone broke they had nothing so what did the Prophet - Allah so son he made them brothers in the beginning he used to take one from a mahogany and he would say to the one from al-assad he is your brother if one of you dies the other one inherits him as if he was his flesh brother you know so the Prophet is about salaam made a black man in the north and saddened about dear brothers when you know this is the story of course everything yes do you know the story of Sodom in the valley and now no I'm an earth was a merchant from orange but when he came to Medina he did not have anything sadly never be when the Prophet told him that this is your brother he came to him he said I'm the rock man everyone in Medina no sir under richest in Medina so here's half of what I owe this is my wealth 50% is yours he is the richest he could have said listen this is a thousand quid that I try to do something with it he gave him half of his wealth not only that he had two wives he said I have two of the most gorgeous wives in Arabia of excellent lineage and I'm a very jealous person but because you're my brother because you are a Muslim and because the Prophet ourselves old us to take care of you you look which one you like and I will divorce her and after she becomes Haddad you can marry her if I was in his shoes it oh yeah now you're talking money and every mistress Wow my mouth is one of the ten heaven bound commands top ten companions of the process up in heaven what did he say may Allah bless your wealth and then Allah bless your family tell me where the sook is and in a couple of weeks time he got married he got a mint money he's sold and bought on credit not discredit credit and without any River and subhanAllah after few months time he became the richest man in Arabia this is balance did he skip a prayer but your prayer why didn't you play fetch it Oh Russell Oh prophet of Allah who I had the meeting last night was the dinner meeting we had to go to Hackney you have to go to this place and that place escaped what you know he never skipped 100 he never skipped one battle with the prophets he never skipped one lecture or any place that the Prophet did or what Joe yet he became the richest man in Arabia so this is the palace we're talking about this is not our subject our subject is that a Buddha and Sandman the Prophet made them brothers so upset man want to visit his brother in his house he saw mrs. a Buddha was Huma duck down he was mad to home with the Cobra she died he married another one in nickname her own with the death so on so he looked at her knees he saw that she was not taking good care of herself and that was before each other that at the very early times of Medina so I said what's wrong why aren't you taking good care of yourself she said well I'm your brother I would like that mashallah he spends all night and all days fasting hamdullah meaning it's not gonna have enough time it will look even at his wife so son I said okay and he waited until I would duck him and he served his guests at my food okay brother this is food so sad man told him you eat first you're the owner of the house sitting on plastic city master said well body would eat I would not eat until you eat so the dragon waited and they said okay I'm gonna break this belong to the person so what's that he broke his fast and he ate they prayed Asia after Asia I would adapt performed ablution and mr. awawa what are you doing some plain night prayer quickly is 8 o'clock go to sleep soon and I went to cranes and I said go to sleep so he slept for an hour then nine o'clock stood up to pray Sandman was still awake to go to sleep 9 10 11 3:00 3:30 it's an hour almost the pleasure said and I said now you come you go and pray so they all woke up war trade night prayer and after they finished sandman addressed a Buddha teaching him and the Prophet said about Salman Sandman Linda Allen Betty said man is one of us and his story is a different ball game altogether he is known in the books of history as the seeker of truth how his father was the guardian of the fire that the fire worshippers worshipped and Kircher in Iran and how he fled and believed and then he went to LA to a priest to another priest and how he was God he went to sham and then how he was sold as a slave only seeking the truth this is a different story so after they prayed my prayer just before fetcher Sandman said to I would that that that Allah has rights over you and your wife has rights over you and your body has rights over you and your guests have rights over you so give each its due right about that that then that's all it is quite well so great fight through the process went to the prophet and he said listen to whatever the Sandman said he said so and so and so and so what did the Prophet SAS sada up Sandman Sandman has set the truth meaning that our religion is based on balance you have to balance you cannot be a good dirty and you don't know what your kids are doing or you your wives don't get the time to spend with you quality time every time they talk to you I'm busy I'm busy answering emails I'm doing lectures I'm travelling and you cannot be good Muslim if you play for hours sitting with the missus and the kids playing around and having quality time never attending prayer in the machine and you cannot be a strong Muslim if you don't work out you know with your Billy like muscle are six seven foot ahead of you and once asked you what's the size of your shoes I don't know I haven't seen my legs you have to have the balance the balance in acquiring proper knowledge of the children and the balance of being a good citizen benefitting the Muslims studying engineering medicine accounting Islamic accounting economics etc and you have to be a good parent a good husband again in good loving husband and a good driver no offense good when you're driving on the street you have to be a good neighbor so many of us don't know our neighbors why the traffic so what the Prophet had covered neighbors our son used to take care of me used to visit them so we have to have the balance not to go too extreme on the account of other"
