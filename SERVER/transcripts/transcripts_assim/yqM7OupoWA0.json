  "transcript": "and the third question is that is it necessary for a woman to cover her head while reciting Quran and while doing AAR especially if there's no one else except her mahs now this is a misconception that a lot of the Muslims have it is not at all mandatory nor it is part of the Sunnah for a woman to cover her hair or to wear the hijab when she's reciting the Quran or when she is making Vick and I've heard also this question so many times a lot of the sisters ask and they say that the elders whenever the aan is being called they start to wear the hijab so is this part of the Sunnah and the answer is definitely not this is part of innovation you are not supposed to cover yourself unless you are in the presence of nahs or or you are praying you want to pray other than that you are at the comfort of your own home surrounded by your mams there is no need for you to do any such thing"
