  "transcript": "the brother who is asking about making dua after congregate after prayer individually because he knows he says that I know that doing it in congregation is an innovation and this is prevailing in some countries unfortunately that after the Imam concludes a prayer he faces the congregation and he starts offering salat on the BRS salatu salam or subhanAllah hamd allahu akbar or reciting ayatul kursi and making grinder people say I mean I mean I mean this is an innovation people that may wonder why is it in an innovation it's due I'm calling a lights a good thing said yes it's a door ah you're calling a lot it's not a good thing why simple Allah says in surah al-maida chapter 5 a glioma Akmal to Allah come Dina come today I have completed your religion what mum - alaikum near Matty and I have finished or accomplished my favour upon you what are we to allocable Islam Adina and I have accepted Islam to be a religion question was this revealed at the time of the Prophet Elisha Ram answered yes it was question was the religion complete was it completed at the time of the Prophet Isis Salam answer yes it was then question anyone who comes nowadays and tried to introduce something would that be accepted in the religion or would that be considered as an innovation sure it is something good don't play around answer the question if I come and say let us add to records for whatever conference opening let's pray together is it good said yeah it's good it's prayer said was it done at the time of the Prophet as Sam no Hollis this is better I'll give you another example what's your ruling on congregational prayer school the Prophet said a prayer in congregation is 27 times better than praying alone okay what is a ruling on praying two Rakas after the prayer it is highly in Phatak recommended shouldna part of the 12 records that will build you a parrot a house in the paradise excellent if we combine both meaning we finished it for $1 prayer alhamdulillah we ask the congregation come on stand up and let us pray the - emphatic recommended Sunnah in congregation how would that be well I share it sounds very nice okay it sounds nice but did the Prophet do it arrest a lot Salam no he did not now question one did the Prophet know that this is very nice yes he did did he tell us no he didn't then is he withholding information about Islam this is co for sure no no no no no no I scratch this I don't want to answer this question let me ask you again did the Prophet know about how nice the Sunnah is no he didn't subhanAllah you considered this to be part of the deal and the Prophet was ignorant about it sure this is Cofer again then what you do then it the easiest and safest thing for you to do to say that this is an innovation be da and you have to not do it coming back to your question doing dua after salat alone is it soon is it okay answer if you do it once every blue moon no problem but if you do it after every salat like we see people after Salam alaikum some of them even wipe himself and what are you doing so that was making door okay why are you shampooing yourself I said no no this is for Baraka Baraka from you this is not done except before you go to bed or were you sick other than that this is an innovation so if you do do after every fourth salat this is an innovation the Sunnah is to do it while you are Institute or to do it before salon while you are still in prayer this is what the prophet has recommended that is awesome and lah knows best"
