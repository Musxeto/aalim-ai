  "title": "Is taking Citizenship of a Non Muslim Country Haram? (Sh. Assim al Hakeem)",
  "transcript": "aside from qatar i have a question it's taking a citizenship of a kafir country haram for example like applying for canada citizenship and signing the oath that we respect their laws okay basically speaking sad if a muslim is not forced not compelled to flee with his religion or with for his life or to escape oppression like for example the people of india if they're not forced to do so and they belong to a muslim country like pakistan like bangladesh their country is a muslim country then it is not permissible for them to apply for a kafir national a nationality or citizenship why because their allegiance is a must to a muslim country and by going to this kafir country and applying for their citizenship and pledging to give allegiance to her majesty the queen or to do this or to do that and abide by their kafir laws this is not permissible but in the case of a muslim living in a kafir country already and being oppressed in his religion being banned from a practicing islam properly their daughters are being forced to take off the hijab in some areas they're killed and lynched and uh tortured just because they are muslims they can't even eat meat when they want to and they're forced to do these things then in this case it is permissible because it's it's committing the lesser of the two evils and allah knows best you"
