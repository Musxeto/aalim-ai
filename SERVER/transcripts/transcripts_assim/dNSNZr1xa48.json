  "title": "Better to say Astaghfirallah or Dua to say when you wake up in the middle of the night?",
  "transcript": "Adi Kunal from Nigeria. Adi Kunal. Hello, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. My question is based on this dua one makes after waking in the middle of the night. So is it that one can actually combine it or is it better to, you know, say Astaghfirullah? No, say both, Akhi. So say, La ilaha illa Allah wa ahdahu la sharika la ahlahu l-mulku wa la l-hamduhu wa a'la kulli shay'in qadeer. SubhanAllah, alhamdulillah, Allah Akbar, la ilaha illa Allah wa la hawla wa la quwwata illa billah. Allahumma ghafir li. And then you start, Oh Allah, give me this and give me that, and guide my children, guide my spouse, and make me improve in religion and increase my health, cure my illnesses. Some people I know spend like 10 minutes after waking up in the middle of the night, succeeding to say this du'a to be the first thing they say after waking up, and then they spend 10 minutes making du'a afterwards. This is totally permissible. So it's not only to limit yourself to saying Astaghfirullah, rather make du'a as much as you wish without any problem. And have you ever taken a counselling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counselling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it InshaAllah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
