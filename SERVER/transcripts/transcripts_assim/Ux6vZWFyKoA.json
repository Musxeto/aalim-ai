  "transcript": "our shape like question is regarding the ruling of giving the Adan I understand that the Adan is given in the in its proper timing in in the five times a day prayer my question is is it okay or proper to call the Adan outside its proper timing like for example 2 p.m and outside the Masjid one example or one scenario is that there is a conference and a certain convert to Islam is that okay first of all it is true that Azan is made to I uh to notify the people that the time of prayer is due however there are incidents where the Adan was given way after the time of the prayer as for example in the case of moving from Arafat to muzdalifa so we move as Pilgrims from Arafat when the sun sets that then should have been given there nope we move about an hour to muzdalifa when we reach muzdalifa the adhan is being called and we pray Maghrib with one Yakama then come likewise in the authentic Hadith when the prophet salallahu's companions overslept until the sun was up in the sky the prophet woke Bilal up and said we told you to notify us when the dawn breaks so that we can pray said well I forgot I I overslept like you overslept of prophet of Allah so they the prophet ordered them to move the whole Caravan the whole expedition to move to somewhere else because that was a place where shaytan was present and he ordered Bilal to give the Adan though the sun was in the sky so there is no problem in in other times other than the times of the prayer itself some Scholars even say that whenever you're as you are in the wilderness and you're scared from Jinn that you may call the adhan and they narrator Hadith some authenticated some they say it's weak some say it's only up to even Abbas either way they say that this is legitimate cause and a reason for Adan though it's not time for prayer so I hope that Yani this is permissible in a sense Whenever there is a reason a legitimate reason for that and Allah Knows Best Shahid from India"
