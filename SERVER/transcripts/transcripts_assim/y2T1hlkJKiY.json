  "transcript": "[Questioner] from America I was just wondering \nwell I saw this matter online it's called the   a lot of Muslims a lot of young Muslims are \ngetting better with their Deen but a lot of them   are struggling with uh you know trying to get out \nof music so they're using a crutch called Lo-Fi   and I'm just wondering there's a version of Lo-fi \ncalled Lo-Fi Quran and is that permissible what   what is it called Lo-Fi Quran Lo-Fi is low \nFidelity it's uh basically they're trying to   have a recitation and a style of music That's \nreverbed which is electronically which is an   electronic Echo and slowed with a low tempo okay \nfirst of all I don't have knowledge about this so   I have to research it and look into it before I \ncan give a verdict but tentatively it seems to be   disrespecting the Quran whenever someone \nis addicted to music and he thinks that   listening to the Quran with sound effects \nand trying to manipulate The reciter's Voice   so that it has these variations similar to a \nsong or music so that it would have the same   impact this is without doubt disrespecting \nthe Quran insulting and humiliating the Quran   when you degrade it to that level so \nbasically speaking Quran is the word of Allah   it has to be respected the vast majority of \nScholars say it is respected to the extent that   you cannot hold the musaf the copy of the Quran \nif you are not in the state of abolition or wudu   it shows you and this is the only scripture \non Earth that requires such a condition   so to degrade it into the level of substituting \nmusic then what tomorrow a rapper comes and   recites [ __ ]in a wrapping way and then \nwhen he raps he does this and all these   stupid things this is not permissible this is the \nQuran this is Islam this is religion so this is my   yeah any uh uh attentively speaking my opinion \non this issue but as I said I have to listen to   or research it so that I can uh know what \nit is about and and take a listen to it and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
