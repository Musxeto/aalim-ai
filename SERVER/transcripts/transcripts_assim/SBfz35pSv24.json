  "transcript": "Muhammad from the UK, Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. We have a few seconds, Akhi, so make it quick please. Muhammad from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Yes Sir. Alaikumussalam. Sheikh, there's a brother over here, I know it sounds strange, but I'd like to know how to advise him. Essentially, in ablution, if he spits the water out of his mouth, like a number of times, or he puts the water in his nose, like slowly, so he can make sure it's in each nostril, or if he does this or that in his ablution, he thinks it's innervating, so he keeps repeating his ablution. How do I advise him? By saying to him that every time you repeat it, Allah is angry with you, but Satan is pleased with you. What you're doing is definitely against the sunnah of the Prophet, and the way of the companions, and you do not by any chance claim that you know more than them, so definitely you're following the footsteps of Shaytan, who's very pleased with you because you're an advocate of his, and a very good student of his. The bad news is, Allah is angry with you every time you waste money, and waste water, and obey Satan in whatever he tells you, and Allah Azzawajal knows best. you"
