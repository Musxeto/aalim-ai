  "title": "Muslim married a Christian Girl, how to rectify their marriage, is it valid without repentance?",
  "transcript": "Ilna from Albania And until that time they considered this relationship marriage to the best of their reasoning because people in that country embarrass and tell what a shame to young couples who get married the civil way before they have finished university studies and have a steady job. But their families and relatives knew each other, interacted very kindly with each other and knew all about this relationship. Now the girl's family is still Christian and she has no guardian. Is this relationship considered marriage because it comes as a relationship before entering Islam at least from the girl part or is the couple obliged to conduct a proper Islamic marriage? Marriage is a contract between two. Has its pillars, has its conditions and if these pillars were not fulfilled there is no contract. Imagine if I come and say I bought this from Abdullah. Abdullah says I didn't sell anything. He says well I bought it. Is this transaction valid? The answer is no. Because there has to be a reciprocation between the seller and the buyer. The seller says I sell you this mug for a dollar. I say I accept. The deal is sealed. Likewise in marriage. There has to be a number of conditions to be fulfilled. Among them is there has to be ijab and qubul. Proposal and acceptance. Proposal from the guardian of the woman. I give you my daughter in marriage. Acceptance from the bride to be I accept her marriage in the witness or the testimony of two male Muslim witnesses. Otherwise the marriage is invalid. So this did not take place with this couple. Therefore they are not married. They are living in haram. They are living in fornication or zina. Now they want to rectify this. They have to immediately stop communicating, repent to Allah, ask Allah for forgiveness. The woman has to wait until her womb is not occupied by ensuring that with one monthly cycle once she gets her menses. This means that she is not pregnant. Then we can make a marriage contract. Her family, they're all Christians. In this case, as a Muslim woman, her guardian becomes the Muslim judge in Albania or the Imam, the authorized Imam of the Islamic center in the area. He would be her guardian and he will do the proposal to the bride to be and the marriage will take place insha'Allah. Insha'Allah. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
