  "title": "Can a father who does not pray be the wali (guardian) for his daughter's marriage? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the u.s says can a father who does not pray become a welly of a woman in her marriage this is a very wide topic to discuss whether this is before the marriage or after the marriage whether the father is proven not to pray and he was labeled as a person who does not pray or not what does that mean the default in islam is that the guardian has to be a muslim so if a person is not a muslim he cannot be the guardian of his daughter for example a woman who was christian accepted islam someone wants to marry her her father who's a christian cannot be her guardian because he's a disbeliever and the difference of religion blocks the guardianship likewise a person who does not pray and when asked to pray he says i don't believe in prayer i don't pray and he never prostrates a single prostration despite the number of people talking to him and trying to convince him the islamic centers imam the judges he doesn't want to pray this guy is a blatant kafir he's an apostate he cannot be the guardian of a woman in marriage but if a person doesn't pray and when he asked why don't you pray so i know prayer is valid and it's mandatory and it's obligatory but i'm lazy how allah should pray inshallah and he prays on and off maybe a friday every now and then maybe he prays when people come to his house or he goes to people's house and they pray he prays with them such a person is not labeled he's not confirmed to be a disbeliever because he prays on and off and it was not proven in front of a court of law or panel of judges or scholars that he's a kafir therefore he can be the guardian you"
