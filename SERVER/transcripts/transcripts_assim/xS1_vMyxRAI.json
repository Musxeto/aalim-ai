  "transcript": "Yassir sent us an email he said is it Haram to become a pilot now the issue of halal and Haram there are things that are common sense so is it Haram to walk is it Haram to sit is it Haram to teach Arabic is it how to do all of these things are common sense what governs them the nature of the work itself the things that go side by side with such work so when we come to a generic question such as is it how long is it prohibited it is it forbidden for a Muslim to work as a pilot for a male we have no problem providing it's an Islamic environment for a female we have a problem why you share the segregation there is no segregation in it no male domination chauvinism or whatever they call it or what governs this is the Quran agenda a woman cannot travel without a male man this is crystal clear and there's no dispute in sha Allah upon this the Prophet stated this is awesome so a woman has to travel with a Muharram ok what about a man well let's look at a pilot's job description his job description is to fly an airplane from point A to point B ensuring the safety of the passengers or the cargo and that he is punctual on time dutiful etc in this case it's like driving a bus it's like driving a car it's like sailing a ship there's no problem in that but if there are things that would affect your job as a pilot in this case yes we may hesitate for example someone says I work as a pilot and I fly cargo airplanes and all the cargo that I carry is Haram whether it's drugs he's a smuggler or its intoxicants he works in Europe in non-muslim countries for a wine company or whatever etc in this case we say no it is Haram but generally speaking a pilot's job is halal he is taking and carrying and flying passengers from point A to point B there's nothing wrong in that what happens inside the airplane is beyond his ability such as there might be mixing well this is not my job I don't have control over that there might be flight stewardesses who are not properly addressed this is not my job I just fly there might be even serving alcohol I personally would recommend that people Muslim practicing Muslims do not work in such airlines that serve alcohol this is totally prohibited but flying it still is halal serving it is Haram so for the crew members who serve alcohol or Haram food such as pork this is totally prohibited and they have no excuse none whatsoever even if they're serving kafir passengers this is SIL goes against their belief"
