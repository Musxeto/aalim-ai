the laws of Allah love a way of life a way of life a way of life way of life Islam is way of life all praise is due to Allah we praise him and we ask Allah to exalt Di menion and gr peace and send his blessings upon the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam his companions his wives and all those who follow them on their righteous path until the day of recompense brothers and sisters in Islam welcome to this episode I'm your host AB to my right is brother ABD green and brother Sal and brother and we will be discussing a very hot topic Allah says in the qu oh mankind protect yourselves from the punishment of your lord who created you from a single soul Our Father Adam and from him he created his partner and from them he dispersed many men and women upon Earth the idea of men and women coming together in a lawful manner under legal wedlock is an issue that requires a lot of aberation and this will be an attempt and we ask Allah's facilitation and Aid to address some of these critical issues pertaining to marriage and perhaps uh brother ABD Rim would like to give us some preliminary comments on the issue of marriage well continuing from what you said as we know the prophet sallallah wasam that marriage is half of um our Dean so yes we need to look after the other half of the dean but it's really significant to think half of the dean that's a lot what makes marriage half of the dean why is it something so significant why is it something so momentous that the prophet sallallah wasallam described it as that so I think that's something for us to think about inshallah most likely um when you look at the Hadith it's athetic Hadith the prophet said whoever gets married then he has secured half of his Deen so he should fear Allah in the other half why would would marriage be half of the dean some of us those who are married and I'm joking huh so don't take this for his face value but it's it's a joke some of us may feel it's not those who are married would think of married as a menace and The Bachelors would think of it as a bless and it all depends on how you look at the cup whether it's half empty or half full but all in all definitely marriage is a blessing and a favor of Allah why Allah described this to us in the Quran when he said that oh you people that Allah among his signs that he created for you your spouse uh so that you may find Repose compassion and mercy and affection so it is a blessing from Allah but to explain it this would take ages going back to brother abdim's Hadith that he quoted why is marriage half of the dean Scholars say that the sources of all evil usually are originating from one's mouth and one's private parts and that is why in the Hadith the prophet said whoever preserves these two things these two organs I'll guarantee for him Jenna I'll guarantee for him paradise and what are these two things your what's between your jaws and what's between your legs or thighs or whatever so when you get married half of this is secured so one would not look around he would not think of fornication or adultery because this part of his desire which is a great bulk of his desires has been secured the other half it is what a person should fear Allah in the things that he say in the things that he consumes and his financing Etc and all this is part of the other half of the de Brother s what are your comments on the Sheik mentioned in regards to that it's half and that once one secures that then one shouldn't be going out and looking elsewhere but we find uh that people still do that and they're not satisfied it seems that there's lack of satisfaction even though they're married what do you think is the reason why people continue to behave in this fashion alhamdulillah first of all the philosophy of marriage created you in pairs Allah subhah wa ta'ala created everything in pairs everything from everything we created them in PS we created you and PS from human beings Kingdom of animals plants male female going to the atom even Neutron protons electrons even in the subshells of the atoms everything Allah created and Pairs and the humankind the purpose of the marriage is not the Fulfillment of the biological needs that's a byproduct the real aim and objective is to save the human race from Extinction otherwise no marriage will be just like other species they don't exist anymore so the marriage is a must it's a need otherwise the human being they will reach a state they don't exist anymore they reach Extinction become extinct and that's why now many of the thinkers they realize this fact because of this promiscuity and freedom of fulfilling the bi biological needs people they they don't get married and they don't want to have children because having children is a responsibility so that's why Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala has planted in each one that natural affinity and inclination towards the opposite sex Allah has beautified and adored the love of lusts this inclination towards the opposite sex so they have to meet but under guidelines under the guidelines and that's the marriage so that they will have children it has a responsibility but the F this instinctive feeling and this innate feeling drives you towards that and this is the wisdom of Allah subhanahu it's not a matter of just have a girlfriend and boyfriend and that's it and fulfill your needs you should have children otherwise there will be a gap because those people this couple they will age and now this is a fact this is the Dilemma now they are facing they are starting we have done something wrong so where is this Gap who's going to fill this Gap no one and that's why in Islam alhamdulillah Muslims mashallah are multiplying and because this is the blessing of Allah subhana wa ta'ala and then are fulfilling the wish of the Prophet sallallahu alhi wasallam when he said so he wants us to reproduce to reproduce to multiply and to marry those who are prolific and he once asked that our number to outnumber the the number of the Believers on the day of Resurrection so this is the aim of the marriage in and in Islam and in in general beautiful regarding white people that was your question right correct you see Subhan Allah Allah subhana wa ta'ala this uh desire it has to be vented in one way or another so the way to satisfy your biological needs is through the marriage and Allah has giving the man the permission to marry up to four if one wife is is not sufficient then you have the second third and fourth one what about if the wife is not sufficed by one husband and there's a lot of people who will ask this question genuinely not just to be that goes against the nature of a woman actually the nature of a woman is not like the man even her desire is not like the man he will reach a certain age when that desire will start to diminish not like you you will be in your 60s and your 70s okay and you are C reducing you're you're going to cause us a lot of problems with with the it is true it is a fact and alhamdulillah I'm saying this now my youngest sister now she is only one year and my dad is already in the 70s so Allah knows see Allah subhana wa tala he knows but there's a fact I'm sorry for Interruption but we understand that we could say generally yes generally people are like that now you will find women who will beg to differ and and they would tell you well I know myself and no no so you see there always be exceptions okay there so how do we address talking about the exceptions the TA the fear of Allah subhah waala because thean as IM he said Shan reaches one's heart via two openings the Gate of desires and the Gate of doubts we'll be back shortly insh a way of life way of life welcome back so we were saying that thean as he saidan reaches one's heart via two openings the Gate of desires and the Gate of doubts two gates exactly so to lock the gate of the doubts the remedy is the the knowledge to lock the gate of desires is the tawa the fear of Allah so when my naps dictates to me look at this watch this Allah is watching me what if I die now Allah is watching me so it is the tawa the fear of Allah that will prevent you from indulging into sinfulness perhaps you can add that the women let's say those exceptions to the rule who may be listening and saying well you know this and that we say yeah if you look at one aspect let's say the physical aspect let's say a woman may have such Tendencies but when it comes to the responsibilities you know that come along with marriage if a woman were to have four husbands which means she has to cook for four different men and she has to do the house sces and whatever will come along with it one is is plenty of of headache let alone two or three or four you see that actually goes against the nature of any decent woman right any decent woman will be offended if you tell her there are 100 men waiting for you in the J she will be offended because a woman who loves her husband wants to be with her husband Subhan Allah this is her nature the sound Allah who created he knows but the man when you tell him there are you see proud smile on his face it's very true but I think brother you're talking about uh you know maybe many audiences in the west would even not really relate to your idea that women are in the home cooking for their husbands and for husbands cooking for them because women a lot of them are outworking so you're using a bit of for some people what might be an outdated cliche especially if you're talking about women with a type of appetite you know but I think there's a whole another way we could look at this topic and I think it's really nice sometimes to go let's go back to the very Basics why has Allah given us a Dean why why did Allah give us a way of life in the very first place so if the prophet sallallah alai wasallam is telling us that marriage if it's half of your religion or half of your way of life I think this is a nice way better way to translate it the way of life that is ordained by Allah subhana wa tala what is the purpose of life from the beginning it's to worship Allah which is as IB Abbas said to know Allah subhana wa tala and I think there's a whole spiritual Dimension to marriage as well um to do with our psychology as human beings to do with our spiritual uality as human beings and I think this is uh something very profound uh that this Dean that Allah has this way of life Allah has given us Islam is for the happiness of the human being the happiness of the human being individually and collectively one of the things that I think is a message that we have to get through especially to people in the west today and in fact in the whole world because we have got used to this idea that we should just follow our desires that happiness comes from just doing whatever you feel like and this propaganda that everybody is exposed to the whole time of you know of sexual open sexuality you know promiscuity the whole materialistic concept is really about following your desires but when we look at a Dean any religion but specifically Islam it's a lot to do with controlling your desires disciplining yourself living within a framework of rules and regulations but actually it's very interesting that more and more evidence scientific evidence in this developing field of psychology shows that actually human beings are most happy when they are living within the context of these disciplines and that actually by controlling ourself and disciplining ourself uh we find a really more profound happiness and I think what we find in Islam is marriage is the context within which that can happen so it it really also it's a an arena where we can draw closer to Allah subhana tala and this is very important at the end of the day that's what it's bringing us closer to Allah we know more about Allah we are grateful to Allah and I think this is all what marriage helps us as well you just reminded me with what said said towards the end of his life he said by Allah I force myself you see I force myself not that I have appetite that I have a desire no but I force myself okay to come in contact with my partner hoping that Allah will bring from my Lo one soul that will worship Allah we were saying that marriage are you obliged to get married is it optional what do you think or what does Islam say in better words well Islam encourages people to get married and the question whether it's obligatory or recommended or forbidden even it depends from case to case you cannot just give a ruling for all one size fits all Islam in Courage is marriage and this goes without any doubt the prophet himself addressed the youth by saying oh you youth whoever is capable of getting married he should do so why he justifies by saying because it is best for you to be able to lower your gaze and to preserve your Chastity when you're married you don't look around your passion and desire has been already F and that is why in another Hadith the prophet said if you go out and you see something you like and your desires are arosed so you go back to your house meet your spouse and then alhamdulillah you fulfilled your desire because what the one on the street has it's the same thing with your spouse so it's logical alhamdulillah our religion is not something it's not rocket science it is natural it is addressing your desires so the prophet is telling Al the youth to get married so that they can be able to lower their gaze and preserve their Chastity what about those who can't get married either financially or because of the culture or and I get a lot and all of you guys get a lot of questions and emails saying that my father does not want me to marry this person because he's from another sect and I have this desire and I have this and that what to do the prophet says fast he's giving the solution for the Youth when you fast you reduce the means of Shan to you and your desire gets less so this is time bound inshallah until you are able to get married marriage becomes obligatory when you have money and you have physical capability and there is the fear of you falling into sin and you say well I don't want to get married until I finish school until I get my PhD until I become the CEO until I become one of the 100 top in Forbes Magazine you're going to die and you're not getting married what is this you must it's mandatory for you to get married but it also can't be forbidden if someone has a wife like you guys and you want to get married to a second wife but you know your not capable financially or physically or you're unable to satisfy your first wife in terms of spending the time with her and with the kids so you say okay I'm going to spend like three nights with the first and one night with the second and inshallah Allah will forgive me here this marriage becomes forbidden because Allah made it a clearcut a condition that if you're unable to be fair and just to more than one wife then it becomes Haram for you to to get married again and likewise if you want to say if it's recommended or if it's not recommended or if it's permissible it falls under this category Haram or not recommended no it's is Haram for you if you're unfair and just Haram if he's going to fall into yeah yeah being unjust this is what I said If a person knows if he gets married to a second wife and he will not be fair he he is saying that I will not be fair I know this now this fairness or Justice is Material Justice things regarding 10 to three nights and one night three nights for the first wife yeah and one night for the second wife and then three nights for the first wife without any agreement but if they accept if they accept it's a different issue this will go get us to a whole discussion yeah but I think what might be worth pointing out as well I'm sure people are thinking of the famous uh Hadith where the three young men came to asked the family of the Prophet sallallah Ali wasallam about how was the life of the prophet and you know his worship and when they heard they said who are we compared to the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam Allah has forgiven his you know mistakes from before and after so one of them said you know I will Fast every day another one said I will never sleep in the night I will pray all the night and the other one said I will never marry the women so when the prophet sallallahu wasam heard this he was very upset he called the people it was his habit and he said who is fan who says this and that he says I fast some days and I don't fast some days and I sleep in the night and I pray in the night and I marry the women so whoever does not follow my Sunnah has got nothing to do with me and I think some people use this as you know they use this to establish that if you don't get married you're not following the Sunnah and therefore you have nothing to do with the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam I think the first thing I want to point out about this before I hand it over to you for further explanation is uh something that is very clear from this is Cate thinking that being celibate is an act of piety and this is something you find in some religions for example there is a tradition of celibacy obviously in Christianity specifically in the Roman Catholic faith and also the Greek Orthodox faith of monks being celibate but also you find this tradition amongst any many Aesthetics like the Hindus and the yogis they have this idea of celibacy as an act of piety to God so it's very clear that this is not a way that is pleasing to God you can't draw close to Allah subhana wa taala through purposefully being celibate but how else would we explain this statement of the Prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam some people may take this as a clear indication that it's Haram not to get married let me add something here there's no room for caby in Islam number one the prophet made it very clear to okay so there's no cacy in Islam that's number one the marriage it is the one of the means the things that are natural and innate and it they are obligatory so we have to understand this the prophets and Messengers Allah mentioned them with their the examples they have families they had progeny children offspring the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was encouraging the US to reproduce and to have more children so all these things come together they give us the idea about the ruling of the marriage in Islam the issue that the urist discuss is it obligatory or is it recommended we've uh covered a few points but I believe there are more but the time for the episode is about to end in fact it's ending right now so inshallah in the next episode we will pick up from where we left off for tuning in catch you next time insh way of"
