  "transcript": "uh back in the days of prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam they prayed in congregation for the reign my question is that if i have a specific issue or a problem can i call certain people and we pray and do dua in congregation for rain he didn't say just say this if there's some no he definitely he's just giving an example that if the prophet prayed allah for reign then can i gather people and make dua to get my raise or to get a good bonus or to help me move from my house to another house answer is no such congregational dua for this person purpose is an innovation ask allah on your own ask allah when you are in prostration in salat ask allah azzawajal at times where you know that he answers dua and supplication most and there are many of them and insha allah you will get what you want"
