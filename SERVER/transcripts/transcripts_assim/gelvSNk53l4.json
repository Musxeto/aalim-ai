  "title": "I pray fajr at masjid Stay making dhikr till sunrise but pray 2 rakahs at home Do I still get reward",
  "transcript": "so Sheikh my question is uh if I go to the Masjid at the time of pleasure and I pray further in congregation and then I stay in the Masjid till it's time for his truck making bigger and Dua and then if I come home and pray to raka of Israel would I still get the reward of hajjan Umbra or do I have to pray to raka in the Masjid no if you did not just a little hardship which is that if you did not pray the two rakas in the Masjid you don't get the reward because the Hadith is a package deal if you pray Fajr in the Masjid in the congregation and stay until the sun rises by 10 or 15 minutes and remembering Allah reading the Quran making Dua and then you leave you did not complete the package because the package said then he prays to rakas meaning in the Masjid but if you go and pray them home no you don't get the reward and Allah Knows Best"
