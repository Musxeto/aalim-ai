  "transcript": "what's the ruling on seeking medicine seeking a healing for one of our illnesses is it mandatory is it permissible is it something up to you to do or not what do you think it is Sunnah always no one would say mandatory always no what's a permissible no so alhamdulillah whatever you ask a question say it's an issue of dispute among Scholars anytime someone asks when I say it's an issue of distributed scholarism you're saying the right thing it's correct but seriously speaking what is the ruling on me taking the medicine when I feel sick Scholars say that if taking this medicine if not if not taking this medicine means I'm going to die because 100 the medication cures my illness and I don't take it I'm sinful so first of all if you have 100 percent confidence that it would cure your illness with the grace of Allah of course or you have 90 percent confidence so it's most likely you must take the medication it's a must but the prophet says seek healing and medication and treatment for your illness this is an instruction Scholars say that if taking this medication most likely would cure my illness but my illness is not fatal is not something that's going to kill me so if I don't take it I'm not going to die but if I take it it's going to cure my illness so if I leave it then it is highly recommended that you take it it's not mandatory I've mentioned how many points two first one if I take it I'm gonna get better if I don't I'm going to die what's the ruling you must it's mandatory two if I take it I'm going to get better if I don't I'm not going to die it is recommended to take it it's highly recommended to take it but if you don't take it you're not sinful yes I don't want to get healing the third is when it's equal there is a possibility that if I take it I'm going to get better but it's not 100 it's 50 50. like most of surgeries today if you the doctor tells you you have a 50 50 success what would you do Scholars say it is best for you not to take it but unfortunately because we love this Dunya if the doctor tells us that there is a 10 success rate we're going risk of not being successful so they don't have to get better I have to go back to my sports I have to go back to my family so this now you know you know the percentage likewise you can apply this to cancer patients you can apply this to uh heart uh disease patients some of them they tell you Allah actually we have a a procedure we would put something in your artery and you would feel good how what's the success rate so it's 90 percent okay you have to do this but sometimes the doctor says we have to have an open heart surgery and we have to change four arteries for you and Allah the success rate is yeah any fifty percent sixty percent don't do it and I'm shocked when I see people who are in their 80s and they're undergoing heart surgery how long are you gonna live seriously come on 18 years old get ready get your uh rug prayer rug and pray and sit on it until death comes to you you're dying not that I'm telling you don't live no live but live with the vision that you're going to die in a second now don't live forever and I'm not saying that people should want to die now the longer you live the higher you go in Paradise insha Allah imagine"
