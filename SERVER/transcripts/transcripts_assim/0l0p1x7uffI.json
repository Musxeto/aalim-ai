  "transcript": "hello ah we're still studying the chapter that deals with mustafa in prayer which is humility in prayer or submissiveness in prayer and this is very very essential because the essence of your prayer is what you benefit out of it and this is the greatest thing that one could benefit out of his prayer is to reach the level level of khushor and we have hadith number 188 brother muhammad can you please read it for us yes again i have to interrupt i apologize we've stated before that saying bismillah rahim before every hadith we read is not correct simply because it is not part of the sunnah to read bismillah when do we read bismillah before us in the first of uh surah in the beginning of every surah of the holy quran with the exception of surat but other than that we generally speak and say bismillah and then afterwards we go on and to study because imagine what would happen if we are in a circle of knowledge of and before everyone speaks he says and then he answers or asks a question this would take too long and the prophet didn't do this go ahead narrated messenger said if super is brought supper if supper is brought and the prayer is ready start with it the food before you pray the maghrib okay now this hadith has lots of brackets in it so just to explain it before going into the things it has the prophet says if supper is brought if the food is present in front of you and maghrib has been called the prayer so what should i start with the prophet says assalam start with your food start with your supper with your dinner with your father with whatever meal it is and before we go even to explaining the hadith mustafa has a question what about in ramadan we see that sometimes people they just eat and forget praying or they delay too much well the hadith tells you to begin with supper to begin with the food now the extent of eating is an issue that one should you know contemplate on because the prophet says begin with supper begin with the food so that you are not distracted when you pray because if you pray while you're hungry and you're thinking of the food and you can smell it and you start to have images and and flashbacks and so on this is not uh wanted or requested in prayer but the extent of how long should i eat because i could eat like a dish in front of me and then i'm full and the person said well i have to finish the whole table with six or seven different types of of food and drinks and so on and this we will come to talk about this inshallah later on abu malik yes i want to ask does the hadith only talk about suburb or any other meal like if there's breakfast okay that's that's a good question and to answer this we have to look into the sunnah and the sunnah says to us that the prophet saws said that there is no acceptable prayer la salat in the presence of food or when you are in in the need to answer the call of nature the prophet says la salat which means no prayer accepted or completed or you can have many interpretation but it all pours in the same direction it all tells you that you have to pray with a clear conscience and with nothing bothering you or occupying your mind any questions okay does this mean that it actually reduces the thought their word or it just you cannot pray at this time see this is yes this is how some uh scholars interpret it when they when the prophet says la salata does he tell us that the prayer itself is void or does he tell us that la salata meaning there's no prayer perfect this is the most authentic choice that la salad meaning it's not perfect it's incomplete now going back to our hadith before going back to our hadith abu malik i'm sorry okay okay if somebody was asleep and they woke up like and they didn't pray and there's like five minutes left frost but they're really hungry what do they do you know if they eat then you know the time out what do you think fadi i think then they should pray first you should pray first what do you think nor i think he has to pray first mustafa i don't know but give it give it a shot well if i was in the shoes then i just pray okay yeah he should pray for us that he should pray first why because if you have two things which is food and then pray or you have to pray otherwise the time will run out and then you would have abandoned prayer deliberately scholars say that you have to pray and then come back to your food because there is not enough time you may delay the prayer if there is an interval that allows you to to pray it afterwards but if it's so tight that if you eat the time will go out no you have to pray which is not five more than five or ten minutes and then go back to your meal this is what the scholars say so going back to our hadith the hadith tells us that there are things that allow us to delay prayer i'll repeat that there are things that allow us to delay prayer such as presence of food the presence of food when you're hungry abu malik answering the call of nature answering the call of nature mustafa rain rain you can this is an excuse for you not to pray in the mosque it's an excuse for you to pray home what else storm storm rain hail thunder earthquakes volcanoes it's all a natural thing about mali sickness illness sickness religious lecture no religious lectures does not allow you to delay the prayer if the mosque is next door so if you hear that that is a lecture in in the in the mosque yes yes because you're in the congregation this is not delaying it you're praying it on time but are there things if we consume them allow us to not to pray in the mosque garlic and garlic and onions if you if you eat them this gives you the excuse not to pray uh in the mosque because the prophet tells you not to pray in the mosque and do not think that this is an excuse for you to skip prayer you know like some of people do whenever it's the time for prayer they just take you know onions from their pockets and what's this i don't want to pray in the mosque so i have an excuse this is my alibi no this is not acceptable because this is tricking allah azza you are trying to play tricks on allah and allah knows your intentions so this is not acceptable when it's acceptable it's when you come home hungry from work you find that your wife cooked for you and you start eating you start eating and all of a sudden you discover that there is garlic or onions in in in your food and it's really bad do i answer the call do i go to the masjid and pray no you have the excuse mustafa does this exclude for example if you can wash your mouth clear of the onions and the garlic smell i love onions i adore garlic and no matter how many times you brush your teeth or you take cinnamon you take a hair you take mint whatever you do the the smell is not in your mouth the smell comes from your guts so it stays probably like 15 20 hours personally i avoid eating garlics and onions because of prayer until i travel abroad when i travel to non-muslim countries and there are no mosques i eat them like hell i just consume i love it but because i love prayer more i stay away from them is it forbidden to eat no it's not but it deters you it stops you it prevents you from praying in the mosque so you have to choose and if you do it intentionally then you're sinful and this is a sin by itself for someone who frequently eats onions and they still want to go to the masjid do they actually send if they go and pray in the masjid yes it's a sin to go to the masjid when people can find the smell of onions or garlics and it's a sin to eat it deliberately to avoid going to the masjid so what do you do you either cook it and eat it but then the taste is not there or you try to eat it you like when there is enough time especially in winter when you have like 12 hours of night or 14 hours of night then this is almost enough from after isha prayer to fajr prayer then you may eat it and you have to make a choice so come back come again to uh coming again to the same hadith there are excuses from allah azza to delay prayer or not to pray it with the congregation now uh one of the clearest examples is what we have here in the hadith where the prophet says if the food is there then you may delay prayer until you have what you need from it now some scholars say like shafi and others uh if i recall correctly he says that yes you may eat but only a bite or two just to take it off your mind and then go to prayer but there's another hadith which is authentic that the prophet says you may sit down and eat until you had all what you need you know until you're satisfied so this hadith tells you exactly clearly that it's not a bite or two no you should eat until you completely your mind is completely off the food and and yes in ramadan what i do is i go to the mosque and have some dates and like some hot milk and then we pray in the mosque and then we go upstairs at our house and eat is this better or eating at home until no this is okay this is acceptable a lot of muslims do this they break their fast in the masjid now is the food present yes no you're in the masjid now i'm not talking about things that are not present in what you're dreaming uh uh in your house in the masjid if you're sitting in the masjid and the call for maghrib is there and you break your fast with dates and milk or whatever and the call for margaret is there the food is not present so you have no problem in praying and then going back to your house and finishing your meal and you may also invite us to come and join you uh i think we have to stop here for a short pause inshallah we will be right back islam is a comprehensive way of life it deals with everything the prophet wanted to empower people and he wanted them to feel the responsibility not just to rely on the state the companions and in particular abu bakr umar uthman ali in the beginning they were not pleased and they were not proud to become the khalifa these days we see the candidates running to become the amir islamic state has to provide all inhabitants with the basic needs it has to fulfill their basic needs of the main foundations of the islamic state is to establish justice ah and welcome back believe brother mustafa had a question just before the break yes so what if the event for maghrib calls and you're fasting and the food is just on the table well you you the the hadith is crystal clear the hadith tells you go ahead and eat and in another version it tells you to eat until you're satisfied so you can easily go ahead and eat even if you miss even if you miss and that is why in lots of uh mosques in the arab world they delay married by 10 to 15 minutes so you have the excuse to do this but again you have to balance things you know sometimes you could stay for about an hour eating and eating and eating and i don't believe that people would you know stiff themselves uh up fill themselves up with food and then when they go to pray night prayer of ramadan you hear the guggling sound of water and liquids and food and whenever they bow they see them you know almost ready to throw up and they can only pray two raka's and they go home retire because they can't this is not the islamic way of doing it yes if somebody misses like another prayer do they pray in the jamaat they pray by themselves because i heard that some says spoke about the second jamaa yes this is a controversial issue again that uh may allah al-imam mercy on him and those who follow him say that it is not recommendable to pray more than one jamara in the same masjid meaning if i am late and i come to the masjid and find the congregation is over according to imam al-bani that one should not pray with the other people with him everyone should pray alone and there he reported may allah have mercy on his soul some uh hadiths uh by anas and by abdullahi showing that they used to do this now personally and this is the uh opinion of the majority of scholars such as bimbasmanatheme and bentaymia maquim and so on they say no you may pray more than one jamar in the same masjid and the easiest uh evidence behind this is when the prophet sallam prayed fajr once and a man came late so the prophet looked at his companions and said who would go and pay charity to this man by praying with him and one of them stood up and prayed with him another jamara so this is another jamara now to differentiate and say well it is another jamar but one of the people praying in this already prayed a previous jamaat you have to have a strong evidence to say no you cannot by saying this we don't encourage people to make a second a third a tenth german the same masjid because if you lose if you miss the first jama intentionally this is a sin by itself and you cannot make it up by just praying another gemara and encouraging people to not pay attention to ikama and to be with the congregation with to be with the group the majority of muslims by saying well i can catch the second third or tenth jamal but what appears to me as it appeared to the majority of scholars that the hadith of the prophet by saying by instructing one of his followers to pray with this person a second jamara means that it is allowed to pray i think we should move on to the follow or do you have any questions okay uh the following hadith hadith number 189 narrated by abu dharr allah's messenger said when one of you is praying he must not remove pebbles from his face for the mercy is facing him and ahmed added to the above hadith remove the pebbles once or leave them it is also reported in a sahih on the authority of without mention of the reason okay this hadith shows us that movement does reduce the reward and the submissiveness the in your salah though this hadith hadith is weak yet it means that if you're praying and if you're praying those who have experienced this praying on sand when you raise your head from the prostration position you will have pimples and sand on your face so if you remove them this is considered to be a sort of distraction because you're going to have this every raka and cleaning them is this movement is not recommended but hadith itself is life so if it's something that is bothering you you may you you may remove it even if it was sand or so better than you not concentrating on your prayer uh the following hadith narrated may allah be pleased with her i asked alaihi sallam about looking around during prayer and he said it is something which the devil snatches from a person's prayer in another narration of anas may allah be pleased with him avoid looking around when you are engaged in prayer for looking around as destruction and if you must and if you must do it do so in the voluntary prayers okay now the first part of the hadith is authentic because it's narrated by al-bukhari but the second hadith is not authentic where the prophet says that you may do this in voluntary prayer now the first hadith is with her is asking the messenger of allah about looking around you know you know about uh looking at the sides this way so is it okay so the prophet told her that this is considered to be the snatching of the devil from a person's prayer and what does that mean it means that as you remember there is a devil especially found for whispering for wudu and there's another one especially found to whisper and to distract you from prayer so do you know the name of of the of the uh shaytan uh concerned with rudolph okay what about the shaitaan uh concerned with salat with prayer his name is and the prophet tells us that if a person is contemplating concentrating his prayer shaytan comes to him and this happens a lot with people praying if somebody moves all of a sudden on one of the sides and he just goes and look at him yes is this prayer concert accepted or not well if a person looks sideways with his face and neck his prayer is accepted because the prophet did not say as islam when ayesha asked him may i'll be pleased with her he did not say that this voids his prayer he said that this snatches the devil snatches from his prayer which means he takes bits and pieces parts of it only so scholars say that if a person looks and turns his head and his neck if it's if it were for a reason then there's nothing wrong in that what kind of reason if he saw something or if he's afraid of something and he looked then this is acceptable but if it's it was not for anything legitimate he was just looking then this decreases the reward of his prayer if he moves entirely with his shoulders so this is the qibla i'm praying and i move this way the the scholars say that the prayer is void because you went away from the qibla which is one of the conditions of salah so it depends on your shoulders and your chest you should be facing if you move away from it this voids your prayer now what i've noticed is that lots of the muslims lots of the brothers look around without knowing it could this be possible yes i know lots of the brothers that when they pray they look around it's shaytaan is making them look around but they are not aware of it and it's your duty it's your job after he finishes prayer that you come to him and talk to him in a very nice way and trying to you know pamper him and telling him that you know lots of people do this without knowing and shaytaan is there you're my brother i want you to advise me and as this a good token i'll advise you that i've noticed that you look around while praying so try to concentrate a little bit more this is your duty yes if somebody like is like moving in the prayer moving ahead or trying to get out of the way of something if he loses balance and falls is his pair cut no no not necessarily if and this one would say whoa is he walking a thin line here no it happens if somebody is you know really tired really sleep and he makes prostration and boom he falls on his face and he stands up no this is something that is not within his control so it's okay but i hope it doesn't happen to any of us because then as as the brother said that if a cat comes in while you're praying and people start jumping and everybody would break into laughter and and then the prayer would be void but if it happens well inshallah so he just gets up and finishes you stand up and finish prayer and this happens a lot you know you may goof and do a lot of things without you know paying attention to for example in the case of people uh sitting in the shahood a lot of the guys when the mm says allah raises his head and sit for to shahad a lot of the guys are sleepy they stand up and thinking that this is the second raka and they start reciting the fatiha and after five or ten seconds they look whoops everybody's sitting down and immediately sits down this does not void your prayer because you did not do it intentionally and it is beyond your control so again we come back to the subject which is that in prayer you should focus you should look at the position where you should put your head your your forehead on and you should preserve your prayer you know the prophet sallam said that which is the highest level of faith and iman is to worship allah as if you are looking at him is this possible nobody can look at allah or see allah on this life so the prophet said if you cannot look at him if you could not reach this level of looking at allah with your heart and having 100 submissiveness then remember that he the almighty is looking at you and this adds more value to your prayer we have 60 seconds all right i have a small question if you can correct some information that i i read that his uh his method in something in looking in the prayer just look ahead of you not look at the place of uh no no you should look at the place of sajud this is when you are looking when you are in the sitting position and you are pointing out your index finger some narrations say that you should look until the very end where it points but the scholars say no the right place is to look where you are sitting unfortunately that our time has run out and we still have few things here and there but probably inshaallah if allah grants us the will and the power we will go through them next time we meet and until then allah"
