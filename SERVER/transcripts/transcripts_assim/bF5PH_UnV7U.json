  "transcript": "no Sabre sent a question stating that is the checkered floor haram to use in my home i like the style of it and that's all now again go back to the basics where do you take your religion from is it from Tom Dick and Harry definitely not we take our religion from the Quran and from the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam so there is it say in the Quran or in the Sunnah that having checkered floor halal or Haram it doesn't mention this so you can have whatever you want to have and anyone claiming because you will find so many people coming to you and saying this is Haram this is Haram this is Haram anyone who claims that something is Haram he must provide the evidence because the religion of Allah is not a game it's not something for anyone to come and contribute or write a post or say this is permissible and this is not it has to be done through knowledge it has to be done through evidence through the Quran and the Sunnah"
