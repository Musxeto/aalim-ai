  "title": "No masjid near home, will I get reward of praying Taraweeh in masjid if I pray home? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "but you know there is no Masid in my vicinity so I'm not able to pray in the Masjid but uh like I have the intention of praying it so I pray at home whatever I can maybe not that perfect but I pray at home will I get the reward of praying in the Majid though I have this intention like if it was there near my house I would have done so this is an issue that only Allah has the ability to answer because this is in Allah's hands we know that whoever prays in the Masjid behind an Imam until the Imam concludes his night prayer Allah would reward him as if he prayed the whole night someone who does not pray in the Masjid though he is eager to pray in the Masjid but there is no Masid in his vicinity would he get the same reward this is in Allah's hands so my advice for you is to pray as much as you can and try to read as much as you can from the Quran while in in night prayer and hopefully Allah would reward you for that and Allah Knows Best"
