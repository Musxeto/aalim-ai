  "transcript": "hello ah last time we talked briefly about hadith number 170 so i believe that we should read it once again when any of you comes to the mosque he should look and if he sees impurity or felt on his sandals or shoes he should wipe them and then prevent them now this hadith tells us that there is a condition of salat here one of the conditions of salat which is purity and we've mentioned before that purity in the sense is divided into two when we talk generally about purity and divide it into two sections the first section is removing the physical impurity which is the najasa from the place where i pray from my clothings and from my body so it's a physical thing that i should wash it off i can see it so this is the first division the second division is lifting a state that is not physical lifting this state it's called hadith can be done either by the total or obligatory bath also or by performing evolution and this state comes if a person either has intercourse in the case of total evolution or if a female is menstruating and she's pure or after uh she gives birth and the bleeding stops she's cured she takes this obligatory bath and the uh the other state of impurity which is done by if you make any nullification any of the things that nullify your wudo then you have to perform evolution again so this is pahara this is what we how we define tahara by talking about both divisions now in this hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to pray wearing his sandals or shoes and the companions used to do this so in order for you to pray wearing your sandals or shoes you have to do something and what is that noor uh we have to see our shoes or sandals is it clear or not if it's clean from any from any impurities because if they have tar for example on them can i pray with them you know tar as if if if there's tar on my shoes can i pray with them when you ask people how do you feel it says zift so it's a star you know it's life is tarnished mustafa well everything in and by normal by default is pure unless there is something from the quran another proves it is impure which means it's pure it's pure abomalic if it's dry then it's all right it's it's dry that's fine okay what about if it's wet well it'll be kind of hard to be able to walk with it you know originally so no it's sticky you know it's sticky it's just fresh and it's on your thumb can i pray with it it's on the throat yes yes i assume you can if it's not gonna affect the mask or anything no it's not gonna fit the musk so again you have to know what are the things that are impure what are the things that are nudges so that you can determine if i can pray or not now there is a difference and this is very important there is a difference between najasa things that are impure and things that are not clean you may have things that are very clean and considered to be impure for example a great number of scholars say that alcohol is negis physically which means that if you have a bottle of perfume and it's very nice it smells nice it's considered to be very clean yet in their opinion it's considered to be this is the jazza now is this authentic opinion of scholars no it's not the authentic opinion of scholars that alcohol is not physically impure this this means that you can put perfumes uh you can wear your perfume and pray there's no problem in that even if it contains alcohol and on the contrary you could have things that are considered to be not clean yet you can perform model with for we always give this example of when you turn on your faucet and the water comes rusty and dusty yes it's called is still called water it is still called water this is yellowish water now would people drink this no they say that this is not clean yet it's still considered to be water and use you can perform evolution with it so don't mix things up don't mix impurities and adjacent with things that are not clean it's they're not necessarily necessarily uh related now this also means that if any of us has any impurities in the jazz set whether on his clothing or body must not be allowed in the mosque because mosque is a holy place it's a sacred place only those who are pure and and and capable of performing prayer should only be in there the question that i would like to ask you would be what happens if i enter the mosque with an ajassah on my thumb on my clothes and i i was not aware of them or of it and i performed the prayer and after i performed the prayer i found this najas this impurity should i repeat the prayer or not and justify your choice with evidence from the quran or from the sunnah this sounds like a good test let's uh see brother noor uh you have to read it again because because uh one of the uh the conditions of prayers must be pure so yes is according to the hadith that we have read before okay fatty i'm with the same opinion you have to be pure in order to pray and in order to be pure you have to have the both conditions performing a pollution and removal of anything that just doesn't just on so i'm not pure so i can't pray mustafa yes purity is a condition okay well if we go back to the hadith of the prophet there was uh jesus on the sandals and jibril told him and he took it off he didn't stop his prayer and redo it he just took it he just removed the jessa and completely completed his prayer so if you find it after the prayer i don't i don't think you have to do the prayer over again but in the middle pair you have to remove the article that has it on if we can okay mustafa i agree with the world you agree with abu malik muhammad no i think he don't have to re repeat because and hadees that we said that that our nation is excused whatever they do out of ignorance forgetfulness or mistake okay now what abu malik said and was agreed upon by with the uh by mustafa is authentic opinion it was reported that the prophet prayed congregation wearing his sandals and all the companions were wearing this their sandals too because they wanted to follow the prophet sallam exactly in everything that he does and in the middle of the prayer the prophet sallam took off his sandals and put them aside so the companions immediately took off their sandals and put it aside and when the prophet saws finished prayer he asked them why did you take off your sandals during prayer they said that's that's easy you took it off we took it off you are our leader whatever you do we follow you he told him the archangel gabriel came to me and told me that there is impurity on your sandals so i immediately took them off so whoever and then he said this hadith the prophet sallam said when any of you comes to the mosque uh uh he should look and if he sees impurity or filth on his sandals he should wipe these and then pray in them so this is the origin of the hadith now scholar said that if having najasa on your body or on your clothes without your knowledge this does not uh uh nullify your prayer because if it nullifies your prayer the prophet saws would have stopped prayer and restarted it again because he had impurities on his sandals which means that it is not something that nullifies prayer unless you know it and you do it intentionally what about if a person has this impurity and he knows that he has this impurity on his throat and on his clothes but he forgot to remove it and he went into prayer and prayed and afterwards he remembered that he did not wash it off some scholars say that he has to repeat the prayer again but the general evidence says that no again if he forgot if he did not know it has the same verdict and he does not have to do them again now we say if he forgot or he did not know to remove the impurities then he his prayer is acceptable but mustafa what happens if he forgot or he prayed thinking that he has wudu that he has performed evolution when he did not so would this be the same thing and his prayer would be acceptable no why not because a pillar of prayer it's not a pillar of prayer it's a condition also it's a condition like removing the impurities so what do you guys think yeah if you certainly think that he he has he take ablution so he don't have to repeat but if he was depth that he he maybe he is not he didn't take ablution so you know then you're talking about the the issue of certainty if he's certain that he performed evolution but he's not certain that if he has nullified his rule no this is a different case i'm talking about a person that went into prayer thinking that he performed evolution and after he finished prayer he remembered that he did not perform evolution so what do you think mustafa prophet muhammad saw allah said if one of you does not have wudhu then his prayer is not accepted therefore yeah if you forget then you should repeat the prayer what do you think fadi i'm of the same opinion well scholars say especially there is a difference between when you are told not to do something and you forget and when you are told to do something and you forget so the things that you're forbidden to do if you do them unintentionally due to forgetfulness or due to ignorance you don't know that it's not uh acceptable they there is no problem whatever was done was done and there's no uh thing for you to do but if you were told to do something and you forget it out of forgetfulness then you have a problem i'm gonna reiterate on this point inshaallah just after the break islam is a comprehensive way of life it deals with everything the prophet sallam wanted to empower people and he wanted them to feel the responsibility not just to rely on the state the companions and in particular abu bakr um in the beginning they were not pleased and they were not proud to become the khalifa these days we see the candidates running to become the amis islamic state has to provide all inhabitants with the basic needs it has to fulfill their basic needs one of the main foundations of the islamic state is to establish justice ah just before the break we talked about the difference between when a person does not do something out of forgetfulness though he is ordered to do it and when he does something he is denied from doing out of forgetfulness and i'll give you an example in hajj there are things in pilgrimage there are things that you're not supposed to do you're not supposed to when in the state of iran you're not supposed to put perfumes you're not supposed to cover your head you're not supposed to wear shirts or trousers now you're not supposed to this is mahador you are forbidden from doing this now if a person does any of what was mentioned because he forgot or he did not know the verdict he did not know it was forbidden scholars say that he does not have to do anything he doesn't have to do or pay any thing because he has the excuse of forgetfulness and he has the excuse of ignorance on the contrary if a person does not perform an obligatory act in hajj such as farewell tawaf or does not spend the night in muzdalifah until the break of dawn or does not or moves from arafah before sunset these are all obligatory things if he does them out of ignorance he didn't know or he does them because he forgot he has to slaughter a sheep there's no burden on him at the side of allah he's not sinful but because he left something that he was supposed to do he has to slaughter a sheep likewise in prayer now one would argue and say that you are ordered to clean your thobes well this is again philosophical because actually you are ordered not to allow dirt impurities and filth to come into your thoughts but you are ordered to perform evolution so if you forgot or out of ignorance allowed impurities to be on your thumb or on your body then this is forgiven but if you forgot to perform evolution you are requested to perform it and pray again the prayers that you prayed while you were not in the state of purity we move on to the following hadith hadith number 171 allah's messenger said if one of you steps on filth on filth with his two leather socks then the earth is their purification what do we understand from this hadith we understand from this hadith that if a person steps on an impurity then if he makes 10 or 15 more steps when the soil is clear and clean this would make the impurity go away and this is what the prophet meant by the earth is considered to be its purification and it shows us how easy islam is because imagine if you stepped on filth or an impurity and allah tells you to wash your shoes that would be difficult because then there are so many times and places that you would step on filth or najasa and it would not be convenient for every for you that every time you step on something you wash your shoes again and on and on and on the prophet says no it's enough if you walk a few more steps then the soil itself would take this impurity and purify your shoes which also gives us an idea that if you come to a mosque with impurity on your shoes you can remove this by just rubbing it through or by rubbing it by soil and sand this does the job you don't have to wash it and this brings us to another point which is uh do we have to remove impurities with water mustafa i think that depends on the impurity if it's impurity in your clothes i think you have to remove it by water but if it's impurity on your socks or in your leather or in your sandals you can just remove it by rubbing it on the ground what do you think mustafa i agree too okay we don't necessarily have to remove all impurities by water because there's an evidence that some impurities like for instance urine in the mosque was at the time of the prophet was dried by the sun was it no by the sun yes there was no jesus and it was by the sun no no the prophet requested a bucket of water and it was poured out isn't there another evidence that the the dogs used to urinate in around the muscular in the mosque and by the sun would come and after a few hours or a couple of days the it would dry the impurity and it would be allowed for us to pray it seems abomatic wants to comment yes uh well the first statement of brother father you know i agree with him that uh everything has to be done by water but things that are excused uh comparing to the dogs and all that that's that's you know that's uh as you said earlier a couple of programs ago that um he says the droppings and then the the leftovers of animals no no i mean if in a person's house if you know if we don't know exactly where something is so we're not sure so that's you know that's not us because the original you know the us of all this is that's pure it's all pure everything you know this purity so you mean that even if the dogs enter the mosque as long as we're cert we're not certain that on this spot there is a urine of of dogs or whatever then it should be considered to be clean as clean and pure to pray well to cut a long story short the authentic opinion of scholars says that removing of najasa does not depend on water so in this sense if i have an adjacent on my thumb and i put soft drinks on my thumb and i wash this najasa with this soft drink and the jazz itself is gone but of course a big stain of my soft drink is there so can i pray with this though scholars some of them say no it has to be moved by water other scholars said no it can be removed with any other substance so water is only needed when you are performing evolution i cannot bring my tea and perform revolution with my tea but i can remove filth and impurities with my tea because as long as the impurity is there and present i cannot pray now how it moves out how it's transformed how it is cleaned this is another issue if i can move it without using water or with using any other substance then this does the job it's exactly like when someone cleans himself using toilet paper or stones for example he did not use water but he removed the impurities and there is nothing left afterwards and this shows us alhamdulillah that it is easy for us to remove the naja sat and to have one clean i believe that we have two comments so we begin with abu malik could you please express the matter about the dogs entering the mosque now this was reported by some of the companions that the dogs used to go in and out see the mosque at the time of the prophet allah did not have any doors and it was open in the sense that anybody could enter amendment sometimes you may have donkeys coming in because it was an open area the thing is that as long as you're not certain that there is an ajasa then there is okay this is okay a dog by itself it is not a najasa it's not an impurity the impurity is found only in the nose and and the wet areas in his mouth and nose of the dog yet no one would say or claim that the dogs used to come and urinate or defecate in in mosques and companions would look and say well tough luck we will wait for about a day or two it will dry off and it's okay it will not dry off in a day or two not in a week or two maybe probably take a month or two after being exposed to uh the heat of the sun so it would you know completely dissolve and and and go this means that there were stray dogs at the time of the prophet sallam and there was a possibility that they may enter and an exit but no one could claim that there were form of naja's impurities of the dogs and the companions let it be so i i hope that this is clarified mustafa yes i wanted to ask about using something that is pure in itself but not water to remove impurity like using pepsi to remove impurity as you said well why not coca-cola why pepsi so yeah yes as i've mentioned you can use this see the in in removing impurities the most essential thing is for the impurity to be moved out so if you use water it does the job if you use soft drinks it does the job if you rub it off if it's hard rubbing it off does the job for you so yeah does this answer your question you can do this and this is the choice of sheikh islam that removing the filth and impurities by any means does the job you don't have to have water to do this of course some scholars say you have to does this also include rust can you do hustle with anything now i've made i made i think i made myself clear there is a difference between removing impurities and there's a difference between lifting al hadith now to perform a pollution or to perform obligatory bath you have to have water there is no substance that does or take the role of water except when you cannot use water than you do the dry evolution using the soil but for removing the filth from the place where i'm praying for example if there's urine in the place where i usually pray and i traveled and i came after one month it was exposed to the sun i come the stain is not there the smell is not there the taste i'm not going to eat my carpet though it has gone it's dissolved it's disappeared completely do i have to wash it again no i don't i i can pray because there are no characteristics of najasa no smell and no color no taste and so on and even the color some scholars have their different opinions regarding it i'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so insha allah until we meet next time foreign"
