  "title": "Dua Istiftah opening dua before prayer or before every rakat? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Daniel from Norway. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. I had a question. About the istiftah, do you only say that at the beginning when you start your prayer or do you say it at the beginning of every akhirah in the prayer? Du'a al-istiftah, the du'a of inaugurating your prayer, has different forms. The two most famous forms, subhanaka Allahuma bihamdik, tabarakasmuk, wa ta'ala jadduk, wa la ilaha ghayruk. And the second one is, Allahuma ba'id bayni wa bayna khatayai, kama ba'idta bayna al-mashriq wa al-maghrib, to the end of the du'a. And this is to be said immediately after giving the inauguration takbir. In the first rak'ah, only. And not to be repeated in the remaining rak'ahs. So immediately after saying Allahu Akbar, you say subhanaka Allahuma bihamdik, tabarakasmuk, to the end. Then you say audubillahi minash shaitanir rajim, to reciting this du'a again except when you start another prayer."
