  "title": "Why do some Hadiths Contradict One Another? (Hadith about Ummah being divided into 73 sects)",
  "transcript": "abdullah from canada says why do some hadiths contradict some hadith say that the ummah would be divided into 72 sects the other one says the ummah would divide it would be divided to 73 sects first of all do you believe that the hadiths are from allah azzawajal and they are revelation the answer is yes this is crystal clear in the quran where allah says whatever the prophet the messenger sallallahu assalam brings to you you have to accept and whatever he tells you not to do you have to refrain and this is only from the hadith the quran is there and allah azza always says always obey allah and obey the prophet what does that mean it means that allah has preserved this deen through the quran and through the prophetic hadith so excuse me if you believe in that you have to accept that the hadith is preserved from allah number two whenever there is a conflict there are a number of processes that scholars follow and it's important that you refer to scholars because laymen who do not understand arabic who do not understand us who do not understand the sciences of hadith muslim hadith and and how to differentiate between sahih they would shoot from the hip and they would put themselves in doubtful things and it may lead them to reject the islam altogether because with this concept of yours you can even go to the quran and see that the quran speaks about a day that is equivalent to a thousand days a thousand years and a day that is equivalent to a 50 000 years and a day that is our normal day so anyone with improper iman and submission to allah and adequate knowledge would be tested with such information that he could not digest and would lead him to leave islam probably may allah protect you and all of our viewers thirdly you have to go and search what the man said in this now i did not do this research i know the hadith of the 73. which talks about the whole entire ummah 72 are in hell and one in is in paradise and hadith is authentic now having said that maybe the hadith that talks about the 72 is talking about the 72 that are in hell not mentioning the one that is in paradise because this is known by default and other hadith that talks about 73 the prophet says afterwards all in hell except one so you cannot think that verses contradict other verses or verses contradict hadith because the contradiction is only in your mind as a muslim we believe that this is all from allah azzawajal so it is either the contradiction does not exist allah yet the prophet said allah two dead meat and two blood were made permissible for us allah says it's prohibited the prophet says it's permissible this is general and this is specific if you did not understand he will not understand this but everything that is dead meat is haram with the exception of the lucas and the fish and if you cannot combine between the two so conflicting evidences you go to level two which is which one is abrogating the other so one obligates the other like in the three verses of the quran talking about intoxicants that they ask you about intoxicants and gambling say there is some benefit and there's a lot of harm and the harm is more than outweighs the benefits okay stage one stage two do not approach salat when you are intoxicated until you recognize what you can recite okay stage three abrogated both two verses stay away from it and this is decisive so if you don't understand abrogation and the concept of it you'd say oh three verses that are conflicting contradicting the quran is this and that and this is all in your mind if you're unable to know which one came first so that you know which one abrogated which then you have to start to outweigh which one is more authentic so quran is always more authentic than the hadith if there is any conflict conflict then we take the quran if the hadith is in bukhari and the other one is in tirmidhi bukhari always outweighs etc and this is for scholars not for any tom dick or harry finally the fourth stage if all these three cannot be implemented the first stage is i refrain from a an abs abstain i just hold on i don't have any say i don't know but definitely there are other scholars who know the answer so i don't give a verdict of conflicting or contradicting rather i go in search with other scholars until i find the right answer and i hope this answers your question"
