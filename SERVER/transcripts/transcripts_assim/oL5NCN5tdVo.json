warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Aisha may Allah be pleased with her said that the prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam said five kinds of animals are harmful and could be killed in the harem in the sanctuary these are the crow the kite the Scorpion the mouse and the rabid dog Muslim said may Allah have mercy on his soul in sahih five philosopher that is the harmful animals to be killed in Harlem and outside the harem area in this hadith we learned that when the Prophet said adding salatu salam that the game must not be chased in the sanctuary the animals the birds that people hunt cannot be frightened cannot be chased and cannot be hunted in the harem area the Prophet is giving us an exception sallallahu are you selling because people might think that these animals these harmful creatures must not be killed and this is not the case the Prophet is telling us that these five creatures can be killed whether you find them in the sanctuary or outside of the harem area why because of their harm so the crow is to be killed and some scholars food regarding the crow is it the crow that attacks the crops or is it the crow that feeds on dead animals and does harmful things it appears to be it is the same in both so they found and it is harmful it must be killed the kite is also a different type of bird it's a short of a scavenger and the Scorpion we all know and also the Scorpion you can kill it in the sanctuary but even if you're praying you must kill it and the mouse the Prophet of Islam instructed us to kill the mice if we see them and also to kill the rabid dog the dog that attacks the dog that is harmful has to be killed and scholars said anything that is harmful can be killed so if it's a wolf if it's a tiger if it's a lion it takes the same ruling as the rabbit if it is let's say also a snake can be or must be killed if it is any other type of insect that attacks and that harms people you can kill it without any problem but what you're not allowed to kill is something that is not harmful and scholars say that things that can be killed in the Harlem area usually are 1041 the normal life stock so what is the ruling on slaughtering livestock in the sanctuary of Harlem it is permissible people have to eat so you can slaughter sheep a cow a chicken etc all of this is permissible for you to slaughter because this is not considered to be game it's not considered to be something to be hunted the second type that can be killed in harem things that are not considered to be game but at the same time they're not harmful for example a cat this is not something that you hunt but at the same time it is not harmful so if you kill it it is not recommended in Islam and you will be sinful for killing it without any legitimate reason but hypothetically speaking if a person runs over a cat is he sinful by mistake no is he instructed to pay an expiation the answer is no the third type of things to be killed in harem are things that are harmful like the five mentioned earlier and scholars say that you must kill it and there is no sin in killing it and there is no expiration as well for killing it the fourth thing that you may kill in harem is the hunted animals the game so if you hunt a pigeon there is an expiation you have to slaughter for example a sheep if you kill something that is bigger for example if you kill an ostrich and at the time of the Prophet re so salaam the Arabian Peninsula was inhabited by ostriches so if you kill an ostrich then you have to pay the compensation for that the expiation for that which is to sacrifice a camel and so on now we move on to hadith of an assembly Malik may allah be pleased with him and this is regarding entering makkah and this hadith was narrated by annas and he said that the prophet alayhi salatu salam entered mecca in the year of the conquest wearing a helmet on his head and when the Prophet took it off a person came and said even hopple is holding the covering of the Kaaba meaning that he's taking refuge in the Kaaba the it's a dolly salatu salam kill him now in this hadith there are a number of lessons to be learned among them is the ruling in entering matka without having the state of a romp the most authentic opinion is that it is a must for a person to enter matka if he did not perform umrah in his life then it is a must for him to make ombres because room Rob is mandatory as we know if someone decides to come for business and he says I'll make ambra next year or the year after he never made Rumble and his life this is not permissible he has to fulfill his obligation as long as he's coming to Mecca he must make umbra first but if a person has already made umbra once in his lifetime and then he wanted to go to makkah either for business or for visit or just spraying the Harlem is it permissible for him not to offer a Haram and make rum bruh and the answer is yes the evidence is this hadith of Anna's that the Prophet entered macari salatu salam wearing the helmet meaning that he was not in the state of harm which means that if you have a reason to enter matka and you don't want to make a harm you don't want to offer umbra this is permissible and when he entered matka they told him about even huddle and em- huddle was a Muslim and then he committed the act of apostasy and he had slave girls of his chanting poetry criticizing Andrew the cooling of Islam so not only he committed the act of apostasy but he was an enemy of Islam from this hadith the Prophet allister's have entered mikkel with a helmet why because this is what the a warrior where's to protect his head from any blows that he may receive and the Prophet when he used to fight at a salatu salam he used to wear his armor and from this we learn and know that it is not against the what cool it is not against your reliance on allah azzawajal to take the means we have deviant sects saying that you have to have full tower cullen allah azzawajal and network and not do anything and stay in the masjid and allah will give you provisions and this is wrong this is insane it is like saying sit in the home and pray that Allah would prepare food for you we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back so believing or thinking that to have full reliance on allah azzawajal independence that you should not take the means this is against our code so if someone goes to hedge for example and he does not take money he does not take food what are you doing said I'm going to a cool on a large zone this is insane if someone sits in the home and says oh Allah grant me a child o Allah grant me a good righteous son and people tell him get married no I have to look good on Allah you will not be rained by children it's not raining children anymore no you have to work for it likewise you're hungry you have to cook food so your dependence on allah azzawajal is matched or must be followed by taking the means and the Prophet was the greatest of those who had to occur on a la yet when he fought he had a helmet that protected his head he had the armors he had all the means to protect him when he left and migrated from mecca to medina with abu bakr he didn't say Allah will guide me he hired a professional person a professional guide to take him to Medina who knows the roots and who knows how to take them there safely so we have to also understand that Islam does not promote people not to be active not to work not to take the means yet the opposite also is completely unacceptable that is when you depend on the means entirely so if you depend on the medication to cure you and not on allah azzawajal who cures you if you depend on your salary to buy food and to pay for the rent and to take your children to schools yet you neglect that Allah is the provider Allah is the supporter and the supplier of provision this is shirk why because you're depending on the means rather than depending on Allah they have to go side by side with the dependence on Allah having an edge and the means follow because Allah is the one who told us to take the means where did the prophet alayhi salatu salam enter and how did he exit to Makkah haditha wilmer may allah be pleased with him and his father said that the prophet of allah sallallahu alehiwassallaam entered mecca from queda or could day and queda is a place known in Mecca which is the highest hanya which is alberta and used to leave Mecca from the lower Sania so these are places locations of market explaining them and describing them would not do anything to you however you know that the Prophet entered from one place and exited from another place why is that scholars say that this is similar to what was happening in heat you recall that an eight the Prophet is lost i'm used to go to the masala from one way and returns home from a different route so likewise this is too to have as many areas witnessing and testifying your form of worship and the day of judgment and this is convenient for the prophet Isaiah as he came from one direction which is from Medina and then leaving from the other direction and it depends from person to person how they managed to enter and what is more convenient the following hadith is narrated by Abdul of normal may allah be pleased with him he says that the prophet alayhi salatu salam entered the Kaaba along with Osama bin is a awesome and even Paul ha and Bilal may Allah be pleased with them all and close the door entered what entered the Kaaba after closing the door when they opened it I was the first man to enter meaning of the love Muhammad did not go so he was the first to enter he asked belong did the prophet erase the lobster and pray Bilal replied yes between the two Yemeni pillars if you go to the Kaaba you will find that it has only pillars inside there's nothing in it as some people think that there is a grave or there's a tomb or there is some sort of structure no it is not and when the prophet alayhi salaatu entered el khabar he went in there with Osama bin zaid and belong and when was that that was on the tenth year of Hell Hedra as some scholars say because hatch was made mandatory on the ninth year of a Hydra and the Prophet aerosol salam conquest matka on the eighth year of Hydra so if the Prophet entered a today's salatu salam in the eighth year of hijra it's a possibility but there were a lot of statues a lot of idols and that is why the prophetess m did not perform hajj on the ninth year he instructed abu bakr and Ally to take some people and and bounce in Mecca that after this year normal will be allowed in and no person performing umrah or Hajj is allowed to go in nude because only the people of Mecca were allowed to make power off wearing clothes wearing the ROM others who came from outside they had to perform Tawaf in the nude unless they knew someone in Makkah who would lend them clothes and this was completely prohibited in Islam as Islam as we know protects the chastity of people and covers their hour on so the Prophet re salatu salam entered the Kaaba with earth man even Paul ha who is Earth madam and Paul ha earth man even Paul ha even schaber ash a bee and they're up till today are the holders of the keys of the Kaaba so his descendants until today remain and they have they are the custodians and the holders of the keys of the Kaaba the Prophet entered there with Osama bin zaidi Haditha may allah be pleased with him and with his father and with merriment on with blood and they close the door now we know that Abdullah Mohammed is so close to the Prophet yet it is not a place for people to come in and sit so he had to have his seclusion there and not to be bothered by other people or other worshippers who wanted to know what is he doing so once they closed the door and then came out and the love Lamar was the first to ask bilal and he asked him did he pray because the first thing that someone may think if we are instructed to face the Qibla if you're inside what to do which direction should i pray i'm inside of it so he asked him and he said yes and he pointed to him the place where he prayed and this is why scholars different whether it is permissible to pray in the Kaaba or not and the answer is definitely yes and they differed whether it's only voluntary prayer that is permissible or any prayer even the mandatory and the most authentic opinion is even mandatory prayers and the scholars also differed regarding praying on top of the Kaaba is it permissible or not and they reported a hadith but this hadith is weak where they say that even oma may allah be pleased with him the prophet for bait praying in a junkyard in a slaughterhouse in a graveyard in the middle of the road in a Turkish bath it's like a sauna and in the places of camels and the barns of camels and on top of the Kaaba but this hadith is not authentic and therefore scholars said that the most authentic opinion is that praying on top of the Kaaba is permissible now this is a hypothetical situation because who will be able to go on top of the Kaaba except a very few handful of people usually people who are working in maintenance you never see people go on top of the Kaaba inside the Kaaba yes it is possible if you know someone to go once they are cleaning the car by washing the cabin you know that we wash the Kaaba twice or three times a year so at that time people may enter the Kaaba then you can be among those who wash it and enter it but is it something of importance that you should look up to know is it sooner to pray in the Kaaba no because the companions did not do it may Allah be pleased with them all but the Prophet did Italia salatu salam hence if you follow that sooner without any obligations without needing to pull any strings then inshallah this is permissible but there isn't any specific real award for that now from this hadith we learn how careful with the Companions of the Prophet re so sir I'm to learn his Sunnah Hibben Omar was anticipating the door to be open to be the first one to ask why because we know that he be normal may allah be pleased with him was very careful was very keen on learning the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salatu salam as much as possible and also we know that the prophet alayhi salatu salam favoured some companions over the others for example zaid Hibben Haditha was the adopted son of the Prophet era solo sanam until adoption was forbidden in Islam yet he remained one of his closest companions to the Prophet because he treated him as a son and when they didn't inherit that had a son which is Osama the Prophet loved Osama greatly and Osama used to be known as the love of the Prophet Adam and the son of his love because he was like his grandson zaid was his adopted son and then Osama the son of Zade he also loved him alot alayhi salatu salam yet his love to him was not a reason to go against the Sharia and this is something that the Prophet Adam would never ever play with that is why when Osama bin zaid went to the Prophet when a woman from Benny masoom was arrested for stealing and the Prophet sentence that she must be punished for that Osama bin zaid was approached by her family telling him please go and talk to the prophet at least ought to Sam so when Osama went to the Prophet erase a lot salam trying to make the sentence a little bit lesser not to amputate the whole hand the Prophet was furious and angry and he said Osama are you talking to me in one of the prescribed punishment of allah azzawajal by Allah if Fatima the daughter of Muhammad stole something I would have cut her hand off and this shows us that when it comes to Islam when it comes to the Lord's nobody is above the law not even the daughter of the prophet alayhi salaatu was salaam this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
