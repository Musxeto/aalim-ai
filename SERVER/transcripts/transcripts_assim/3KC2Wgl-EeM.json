Dear brothers and sisters in Islam, Assalamu\nAlaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. And welcome to this new episode of The Role\nModel, coming to you live every weekday at 2 o'clock pm Mecca time, during the month\nof Ramadan of 1444 Hijra. One of the greatest forms of worship that\na lot of us don't know of is pondering and contemplation and working your mind and heart,\nthinking about what's beneficial for you in this life and in the hereafter. This is what energizes your heart. It gives it its energy, the power and the\nstrength to go on. Allah Azza wa Jal praised such form of thinking\nin the Quran in so many places. Allah says, if we had sent down this Quran\nupon a mountain, you would have seen it humbled and splitting from fear of Allah. And these examples we present to the people\nthat perhaps they will give thought. The Prophet, Alayhi Salatu Was Salaam, as\nwe all know, lived his first 40 years of his life in Mecca. Before becoming a Prophet and a Messenger\nand receiving the revelation, in the beginning, a few years before that, he used to sit in seclusion in the cave of\nHira, in the Mount of Nur. Doing what? Spending days and nights there, contemplating,\npondering and worshipping Allah Azza wa Jal without a Shari'ah, without any direction\nbut only following his instinct and his nature. And if you go and look at Mount Nur and at\nthis Ghar Hira, the cave of Hira, you will find that it's about a couple of miles outside\nof Mecca, surrounded by huge mountains and a clear sky. And this by itself gives you great opportunities\nto ponder and think. And this, by the way, was done before the\nProphet received the revelation, Alayhi Salatu Was Salaam. Because after he was made a Prophet and a\nMessenger, he never went back to that cave, by the way. Ever. Neither did any of his companions or the Tabi'een. No one would go and visit that place, let\nalone take it as a shrine to pray two Rak'ahs there like so many ignorant people do nowadays. Though this form of seclusion would relieve\nthe Prophet, Alayhi Salatu Was Salaam, from the bad environment Mecca inhabitants used\nto live in, yet the Prophet only did this for a short period throughout the year. And that was in the month of Ramadan. And the rest of the year he would spend among\nthese people, living like every other person. And after he was revealed to and became a\nProphet and a Messenger, the Prophet, Salallahu Alaihi Wasallam, reduced these days into only\n10 nights every year. And that was vastly on the last 10 nights\nof Ramadan, where he used to perform I'tikaf. And I'tikaf is done in the Masjid, where it's\ntotal seclusion. And this is where the Muslim, especially Da'is,\nwho mix with people and meet them and may be affected by such meetings, they need to\ncleanse their souls every now and then. And to re-energize. And this shows you the importance of quality\nover quantity. It's not what you do throughout the year,\nhow many Muslims accept, how many people accepted Islam, or what are the things you've done. It's your heart that counts. Because this is what Allah looks at. How pure it is, how clean it is, how filled\nwith Iman and tranquility and trust. And all these good things that Allah loves. This is all the result of what? Of pondering, contemplating, thinking about\nAllah Azza wa Jal and His magnificent creations. About what's around you, about the Quran,\nabout the whole world and how things are taking place and how they will materialize in the\nhereafter and what will happen. The Prophet, alayhis salatu was salam, used\nto ponder a lot. So he used to be silent most of the time,\nprolonging his thinking and contemplation. Even at night, he used to offer night prayer,\nhe used to offer tahajjud, he used to also contemplate. Abu Dharr, may Allah be pleased with him,\nsaid that the Prophet, alayhis salatu was salam, prayed night prayer once and in that\nprayer he only recited one single ayah. The whole night. And again, quality versus quantity. The whole night you only recite one ayah? Yes. He used to just recite it and repeat it and\nthen make ruku and sujood and complete his prayer and then do that over and over again. What is, what was this ayah? Allah says, what translates to, if you should\npunish them, indeed they are your servants. But if you forgive them, indeed it is you\nwho is the exalted in might and wise. So the Prophet kept on praying to Allah, complimenting\nhim and praising him. The Almighty urging him to forgive and to\npardon his servants. Ibn al Qayyim says, and this was the routine\nof the Salaf, that they would repeat one single ayah until the break of dawn. And Nawawi says, a lot of the Salaf used to\ndo this, repeating one ayah until the break of dawn. Not only that, sometimes the Prophet salallahu\nalayhi wa sallam got emotional when reciting some verses of the Quran. Unlike us, we just parrot and repeat the ayahs\nwithout contemplating or pondering. The Prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam read\nthe verses of the Quran with his heart and it had a profound impact upon him. Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, may Allah be pleased\nwith him, once said that the Prophet came to me and said, Abdullah, read the Quran so I can hear it. Ibn Mas'ud said, O Prophet of Allah, you want\nme to read it? When it was revealed to you, you know it better\nthan me. The Prophet said, yes, I like to hear it from\nsomeone else. So, Ibn Mas'ud, he was one of the greatest\nreciters of the companions of the Quran. We were ordered by the Prophet to take the\nQuran from four. Among them is Ubay ibn Ka'ab, Ibn Ummi Abd,\nwho is Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, Salim Mawla Hudhaifa, etc. So he says, I started to recite from the beginning\nof chapter four, Surat An-Nisa. Until I reached the 41st ayah of the surah. So I kept on reading until I reached where\nAllah says, So how will it be when we bring from every\nnation a witness, and we bring you, O Muhammad, against these\npeople as a witness? And that is on the Day of Judgment. How would it be? So the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam,\nsaid to Abdullah, stop there. So I looked at him, and his eyes were filled\nwith tears and he was weeping. Reported by Bukhari and Muslim. This is the reaction we need when we read\nand recite and hear the verses of the Quran. We need it to penetrate our hearts and leave\nan impact on us when we ponder upon it. Such pondering and contemplation gets you\ncloser and draws you nearer to Allah Azza wa Jal, because this is what Allah loves. Some chapters of the Quran made a huge impact\non the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam, to the extent that he said once, Hud, Surat Hud, Al-Waqi'ah, Al-Mursalat, Amma Yatas'aloon, Surat An-Naba, And, Ithash-Shamsu Kowwirat, Surat At-Takwir, These surahs have made my hair turn grey. Such surahs included the description, the\ndetailed descriptions of the Day of Judgment. And it was frightening, it still is, to those\nwho ponder and contemplate. So the Prophet said that, Such description of the Day of Judgment made\nmy hair turn grey because of my reaction to such surahs. Not only that, the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi\nWasallam, used to threaten and warn those who recite the Quran and fail to contemplate and ponder upon it. Mother Aisha was asked once, may Allah be\npleased with her, to recall some of the things she remembers\nmost of the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam. She gave it some thought, and then she said, One night, the Prophet, Sallallahu Alaihi\nWasallam, while lying next to me said, Oh Aisha, leave me so that I can worship Allah\nAzza wa Jal a little. So Aisha said to him, Oh Prophet of Allah,\nyou know how much I love to be next to you. Yet I also know how much you love to worship\nAllah, and I'm not going to stand in your way. So you can go and worship Allah. So the Prophet left the bed, made a perfect\nablution, and stood up in prayer. And he kept on weeping, and his tears were\nrunning while in his prayer, until it wet his lap, then it wet his beard,\nthen it made the earth, the ground underneath him wet from such huge amounts of tears. Then it was time for Fajr prayer. Bilal came and saw the Prophet, Sallallahu\nAlaihi Wasallam, weeping, and said, Prophet of Allah, why do you weep when Allah has forgiven your\nprevious sins and the upcoming sins? So the Prophet said, Oh Bilal, shouldn't I\nbe a grateful servant of Allah when He has given me such blessing and favor? Tonight, verses were revealed to me, and these\nverses, woe and destruction might befall upon those\nwho read them and not contemplate upon them, not give them thought. So the Prophet is warning us, if we do read\nthese verses and not contemplate upon them, what are they? These verses are the last verses of Surah\nAli Imran, the last ten verses, beginning with, Indeed, in the creation of the heavens and\nthe earth, and the alternation of the night and the day, are signs for those who, or are signs for\nthose of understanding, who remember Allah while standing or sitting\nor lying on their sides, and give thought to the creation of the heavens and the earth, saying, Our Lord, You did not create this\naimlessly. Exalted are You above such a thing. Then protect us from the punishment of fire. What a beautiful set of ayat. The Prophet, salallahu alayhi wa sallam, reacted\nto such verses, and his reaction was illustrated by his weeping,\nhis fear of Allah, his appreciation to such huge and great creation\nof Allah, azza wa jal, that the creator of all of this majesty and\ngreatness is the creator of me, and I have so many sins, I have so many shortcomings\nand flaws, yet I still have this arrogance in me, I still\nthink of myself as something worthwhile. It means that I'm not comparing myself to\nthe environment, to my country, to my continent, to earth, to this solar system we're in, or this galaxy\nwhich contains millions of other solar systems, or these millions of galaxies around the world. Who am I to have this arrogance and to refuse\nto worship Allah, to refuse to pray on time? Who am I to indulge in such filth and sins\nwhich Allah abhors and resents, yet I continue to do them, knowing that Allah\nis watching me, Allah is listening to what I'm listening to. If I don't contemplate upon these things,\nwhat will I contemplate upon? We have a short break, stay tuned and inshallah\nwe'll be right back."
