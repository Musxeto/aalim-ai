  "title": "What is more rewardable, volunterring in a  masjid or listening to the Khutbah",
  "transcript": "yusra says what is best for someone who wants to reward to get reward is it best for me to volunteer in the masjid to organize the rose to ensure that there is social distancing to make sure that they park uh in the right place and that they leave the masjid in order that no one comes into the masjid with a shotgun or with a machine gun to kill the worshipers like it's becoming the norm now and islamophobes say this is okay no problem hijab is prohibited but killing people in the masjid it's okay it's fine so is this best or is it better to sit down and listen like the rest of the people to what the imam has to say well this is a difficult question because there is a communal obligation that one has to do in order to save the rest of the thousands of worshipers from getting any sin so if this task is mandatory and there is no one who can fulfill it and do it better than you it becomes mandatory upon you and more rewarding than sitting and listening to but if it's something that's trivial that's not a big deal uh arranging the parking lot and ensuring that people are parked in this in the right position and wasting my own benefit from learning from the imam and hearing the khutba no i save myself first and i don't care about others i would like to benefit myself because this is a communal obligation there are people who are not interested in the khutba don't understand what the imam is saying let them be and let them take that role and allah knows best"
