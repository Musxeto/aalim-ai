  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates? One question or two questions? Huda has no boundaries. It's not like AskZad. So you can have two questions. Alhamdulillah. So I know that we're not supposed to remind people of favor done to them, like if you give someone a gift. But if there's someone that asked for something, maybe like a year ago, that says, if you give me this money, I want to use it to rent a shop. But the person didn't rent the shop. And it goes to another person that keeps going around and taking money from family member, saying that it needs to go to shop, but it didn't do it. So when the person comes to you again, can you remind them and say, listen, last year I gave you money for a shop, why you asking me again for the same thing this year when you didn't rent it? As for Umm Amina's first question, reminding others of the favors you have done to them is one of the major sins. It's called in Islam Al-Mann. And the Prophet said, alayhis salatu was salam, la yadkhulu al-jannata mannan. And among the three sins that Allah does not look at the individual, does not speak to them, does not have mercy upon them and would not purify them, is Al-Mannan, who goes to people whom he had helped and said, didn't I do this for you? Didn't I give you a loan yesterday? In the sense of reminding them of their favor upon them. So this is a major sin. But if you know that there is someone who is a con man and he's going around taking people's money unlawfully, and he forgot and he came to you and asking you for money, or you're scolding him for what he's doing because now it's apparent that he's a blatant liar, not that he's needy, no, you know that he is scamming people for their money when he pretends that he wants to open a shop or start a business and to stand up on his own two feet. And he's a blatant liar. He's a manipulator and a cheater. So you tell him as a form of scolding him, I gave you money last year and you did not do anything with it. There is nothing wrong in that, insha'Allahu azzawajal. You're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azzawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
