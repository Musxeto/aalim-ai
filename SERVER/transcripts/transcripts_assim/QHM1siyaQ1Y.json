  "title": "Work in a company that deals with mixed haram and halal projects, is my income halal?",
  "transcript": "Adikunel from Nigeria. Yes, I just want \nto clarify a question I asked a couple of weeks ago concerning working as a construction \nengineer. We are working as an engineer that constructs mini power plants. \nThis is a mobile power plant. So the person is actually not \nworking at the power station itself. with a company that constructs \nsmall power plants for hotels, you know, [ ] and churches. So even if I don't work on those projects, but I still work with that company, will my salary be Halal if my salary is maybe from the revenue \ngenerated from these projects, even if I don't work on those projects? So there is a company that builds power plants or installs generators. This line of work is halal. They \ndo this for schools, universities,   [ ] areas, factories, dairy products, \nshopping malls, all halal products. But among the work they also provide is for \nchurches or theme parks or bars or interest-based banks, and these are Haram. So if I understand your question correctly, \nyou work in this company in the transportation department or in HR and you hire people to \nwork on different projects which these haram projects may constitute five or ten \npercent of the revenue of the company. Is your income halal? The answer is yes. As long as you are not directly connected \nto the haram projects, your income is halal."
