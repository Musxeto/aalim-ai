  "transcript": "lessons from the prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim alhim dear brothers and sisters in Islam Abu may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallah alai wasallam once said six are the duties of a Muslim over another Muslim it was said to him oh prophet of Allah what are these the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam replied when you meet him offer him greetings when he invites you to a feast accept it when he seeks your counsel advise him and when he sneezes and says alhamdulillah all praise is due to Allah you should say may Allah have mercy upon you and when he falls ill visit him and when he dies follow his funeral in this great Hadith that was reported by Imam Muslim in theah which grades it in the highest level of authenticity in this Hadith the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam is illustrating to us that every individual has duties and obligations as he has rights of his own and throughout Islam if you study it thoroughly you would find that Allah the almighty and the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam state to us that mothers have duties the wives have duties the children have duties your next of kin your neighbors even the disbelievers all of these have duties upon them yet they also have their rights that should be given to them and if every individual does what he has to do and performs the duties that he supposed to perform we would not have any disputes or any problems none whatsoever and the biggest problem is that people demand and request their own rights yet they neglect or ignore their duties and obligations the prophet Alat wasam corrected this throughout a number of hadiths for example when it comes to the rights of a citizen to the rights of an individual versus the rights of the ruler the prophet Alat wasam when he mentioned that there would be some rulers who would be unfair and unjust so the companions may Allah be pleased with them ask the prophet am what should they do when they are met with such unfair and Tyrant rulers the prophet Alat wasam answered in a statement that reveals how Islam has this balance and how Islam looks at the brighter side rather than look at the dark side of things the prophet said am do and execute your obligations and as far as your rights ask Allah for them now if we Cascade this down we have the problem of a father and his son the father has rights and obligations and the son has rights and obligations as well yet if the father is not doing his job properly the son has no right to say well in this case I'm not going to obey my father I'm not going to provide for him if he is unable to provide for himself I'm not going to give him his rights because he is not fulfilling his obligations towards me as a son well this is not what the prophet saidat wasam execute and do what you are supposed to do give to your father his right fulfill your obligations towards him and regarding your own rights if your father is unfair and unjust well this is his problem and it's not yours whatever Injustice he does to you Allah will question him about it but when it comes to your part ask Allah for your own rights and do not disobey your father or disrespect your father as this is aaz major sin that Allah would question you about also when it comes to the relationship between a man and his wife a man has a lot of obligations towards his wife yet the obligations of the wife towards her husband are far greater and that is why Islam puts a lot of emphasis on the wife being obedient on the wife seeking her husband's pleasure on the wife going out of her way to please her husband the prophet Alat wasam tells us that if a woman obeys her husband this is one of the things that would allow her to enter Paradise in the authentic Hadith the prophet saysat that if a woman prays her five daily prayers if she fasts Ramadan if she observes her Chastity and protects herself and if she obeys her husband Allah will make her enter Paradise a number of things that seem to be very easy for her to execute and to offer but if the husband does not fulfill his obligations if the husband is rude if he is impolite if he's not kind if he's not loving if he's not caring can the wife do the same to him in the sense that if he requires his rights from her does she have the power to say well sorry because you do not fulfill my rights I will not fulfill yours the answer is no she has to fulfill his rights she has to offer him her obligations towards him and she has to ask Allah for what is hers and he's not offering or he's not providing for that and he would be questioned on the day of judgment therefore if you look at the Hadith once again you know that there are duties upon every individual upon every Muslim that he has to offer and give to his fellow Muslim and inshallah this is what we're going to go through next time we meet until then lessons from the prophet's sayings a program presented and prepared by aim alhim [Applause] [Applause] he [Applause] [Applause] for and"
