  "transcript": "chef i am sick right now and also usually on me i cannot take because of sickness but i can make vudu should i make vudu or do time cure your illness and give you quick recovery and restore your health to be better than before europe as for your question when rusul is mandated upon you you have to perform russell and allah has mentioned in two places in the quran in surah nisa and in surat al-maidah that when people are sick or unable to use water due to that there is no water to be used so they have to perform therefore if you're unable to make russell but you are able to make wudu this does not suffice you have to perform tayammum to uplift your major ritual impurity so that you can pray now after that whenever you want to pray you can perform wudu because wudu is available so in order to pray you can perform mudu but not before performing your russell and allah social knows best"
