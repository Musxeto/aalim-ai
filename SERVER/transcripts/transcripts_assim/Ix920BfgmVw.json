  "title": "Am I sinful for organizing an Islamic Conference that has women in a Quran competition?",
  "transcript": "Ibrahimah from Guinea Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Allah bless you and your family and your team And you as well Sheikh, there is an Islamic conference coming that is being organized by a friend of mine who had asked for my help So I was helping him in doing that. It is about the hijab The problem is at some point he decided to insert a woman like Qur'an competition So I told him that no this is not permissible Unfortunately he asked the people of knowledge here and they all told him that it was permissible, no problem Even one in front of me actually So the real problem is now I want to ask if I help him but not in the Qur'an competition but in everything else Am I sinful for that or should I just refrain completely 100% as I am trying to do right now This is something that is up to your own judgement You see Allah Azza wa Jal when He spoke about gambling and intoxicants in the Qur'an He said they ask you about intoxicants, wine and gambling They say there is a great deal of sin and some benefits However the sins outweigh the benefits This is a rule in Islam The pros and cons, whatever ways then it takes the ruling If you believe that this conference is beneficial for the Ummah And that there will be a lot of good speakers, good topics It's all according to Ahlul Sunnah wal Jama'ah And according to the most authentic opinion And that you evaluate it to be 90% success And 10% for the girls Qur'an competition which is a minus In this case you can go for it If it's 50-50 then stay away from it If it's less then definitely it's a deviant event you should stay away from And Allah knows best"
