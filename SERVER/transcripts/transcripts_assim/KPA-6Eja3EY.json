  "transcript": "Who dictates on Allah what to do and what not to do? What kind of a question is this? Allah says in Suratul Anbiya, Allah is not questioned about His actions, they are questioned. So no one can say, why doesn't Allah do this? Why doesn't Allah take your soul and burn you in hell forever? Answer me, because you don't want to. So Allah does what He wills. You have to understand few essential basic things. One, Allah Azza Wa Jal owns everything in this universe. So if He takes everything in this universe and tosses it in hell, nobody can complain or say anything. It's His possession, it's His right. If I take one KD and I burn it, the new currency cannot be burnt. I don't know, anyhow. If I tried, can anyone say, Akhi, what are you doing? It's my money, none of your business. Number two, Allah is fair and just. Allah would never have dhulm on anyone. So always put this at the back of your head. Number three, Allah is wise and knowledgeable. So if you have these components at the back of your mind and you know this, whatever happens in this universe, you're content with it. When you don't, you start arguing, you start objecting. Why is this? Why is that? And then this is a sign that you are not a true believer."
