  "transcript": "Sonia sent the first email saying what is the ruling on solitude Tessa B or solitude tess be so loud Tessa B there is a hadith that is narrated by a bass even Abdul Mutallab may Allah be pleased with him the uncle of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam where the Prophet told him Oh a bath Oh uncle of the Prophet shall I give you shall I favour you shall I offer you something something if you do it allah azza wajal will forgive your major and minor sins your previous and upcoming sins your current your small your so many it covers everything so what are or what is this thing the Prophet said that is awesome in this hadith you pray for records in the first tracker you recite the fatiha and a surah and then you say 15 times after the surah subhanAllah alhamdulillah la illaha illallah wallahu akbar then you make record and you repeat the same vicar ten times then you rise from record and you repeat the vicar ten times then you go for sujood and do the same then you sit between the two prostrations and you do the same then you do sujood again and you do the same then you sit before you stand up to the second raka and say that the the same vicar ten times then you stand up and these are 75 times you say this thicker and you repeat it in every rakah if you do it every day that's good if you do it once every week that's good if you do it once a month that's good if you do it once in a lifetime that's good narrated by abu dawood in the southern and others this hadith is well known and practiced among a lot of the Muslims especially in the subcontinent and especially when it is the middle of Shaban shall be bharat as they call it or in laylat the 27th of Rajab the that they think that this refers to the glorious night journey but what is actually this hadith is it authentic see as Muslims it is not what we hear and practice immediately without authentication it's like when people are afraid of the covet 19 virus or the corona virus and you hear someone coming on whatsapp posting that if you drink bleach this will protect you and cleanse your system who in his right mind would do something like that drinking bleach you want to kill yourself what is this people are with things related to Deen to religion to Islam are like that any Tom Dick or Harry comes and says this is a good hadith this is a nice form of worship do this you practice this you'll get more reward you'll do you'll have so much reward and he lists things that are not found in the Quran or in the sender okay sure with all due respect the hadith is incident a bit that would this is true but not everything in soon an IBD wood is authentic there are weak hadith and the scholars of hadith the sciences of hadith know that the scholars of Frick also know that there are weak or not authentic hadith but don't listen to me let's go to our four schools of thought the school of Abu Hanifah the school of Malik the school of Shaffer II and the school of ammidon hanbin these are the four schools of thought that the vast majority of Muslims follow and you should be one of them you should follow one of these schools so what do they say about this hadith well for your knowledge Imam Abu Hanifa Imam Malik and Imam Shafi had never heard of this hadith never reported it never encouraged anyone to do it whoa that's a first not only that Imam Ahmed even humble who was Imam wha-hoo soon that you will jamar one of the great scholars of hadith the compiler of muslin Allah Muhammad he himself when he was asked about this hadith he said he did this with his hand and this is says moo cow this is weird this is not from the Shinda and this this is the four schools of thought a lot of the scholars also fabricated this hadith like Sheikh Ali Salman taymiyah he said that this hadith is not weak it is fabricated and if you look at it in a realistic way logical way which we usually we don't do because we don't apply logic in things that deal with Islam we deal with authenticity we deal with the understanding of the three phase favorite generations of Sahaba turban and Tabitha being their understanding is what governs the way we understand things so if you look logically the hadith says if you do these four raucous Allah will forgive your major and minor sins and we know that the vast majority of additional Gemara say that major sins require repentance not an action or something you say so you have to have repentance not only that in the hadith it makes doing it once a day equivalent to doing it once in a lifetime not only that the format of the prayer is unheard of where you make thicker subhanim allah alhamdulillah wa la ilaha illallah w'allahu akbar wild standing position after the surah and you say it in rock or after you raised from the rock or institute after you sit and she do it again and then you sit in the first raka after the second sujood for a long time to say it ten times no where in other prayers that this is similar therefore the vast majority of scholars say that this hadith is fabricated and we should not apply it or do it because simply it is not authentic now those who abide by it and hold on to it saying that no we are going to do it this is up to you but again logically thinking what do I have to lose whether you do it or not if the hadith is authentic why am i stopping you from doing it that's not logical we call people to Quran and Sunnah the authentic sooner but if it's not authentic don't expect me to endorse it and promote it rather we cleanse our religion from any impurities that try to creep in to infiltrate infiltrate our religion we have to protect and defend our religion from such things and Allah Azza WA JAL knows best"
