  "title": "Islamic ruling on Pyramid Scheme, Multi layer Marketing, Ponzi Schemes - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "this one is about networking or multi-layer networking or the pyramid schemes and the vast majority of scholars say that this is haram why there's a difference between you coming to me and saying to me shaykh assam sell this pen for a dollar and i'll give you 10 cents halal product i'm getting a percentage no problem in selling it this is halal network uh multi-layer networking uh or the pyramid scheme of ponzi schemes they work on a pyramid like those in the bottom feed those on top until they reach the top of the pyramid how does it work they bring a product and they tell you you as a condition must buy this product from us once you do you become a representative of ours you sell these products to others the more you sell the more people would be under your network so they themselves become representatives we give you a percentage of what they had bought from you and whatever they sell others we give them a percentage and then give you a percentage of their percentage so by this people get greedy so they buy this product and they try their level best to convince others and they may succeed and then the others also become greedy and they try to sell these products so what's wrong in that chair first of all your initial purchase of the item was not to buy the item rather to enlist in this program to make money out of it secondly when you go and ask people about the value of the pen you'll find that it is three or four times more than what the actually costs so the company is selling you a product that is four times more than the actual price to make money out of you and to use this profit to give you a percentage and those under you percentage and those above you percentage where they get richer and richer for doing nothing i got two representatives coming to me trying to convince me of its halal and showing me some fatwas and paperwork etc and logic and and i ask the man whom i thought had some religion in him and i said what did they sell you he said they sold me a medallion they claimed 2 000 medallions only exist on earth so i said okay let us assume it's correct what's the actual value of it he said i bought it for like 2 000 reals and and i would ask him about what's in it gold or silver whatever he said i took it to the jeweler's shop and he said that this actually cost 400 reels so they sold it to him five times higher claiming that's a gold golden medallion which is haram for men to begin with but this is beside the point there is no gold in it it's fake yet they are convincing him so that he would enlist therefore such networking is not permissible unless for example cosmetic company came to me looking for a fatwa everything is legit except that you cannot enlist in their program until you buy their package and the package contains samples of their cosmetics makeups and a brochure how-to or a manual how to sell and to describe with a bag so i said to them okay the money is peanuts of this don't take it if i come to you and want to become a representative take me in give me commission no the company back home in sweden told us that you have to sell this i said putting this as a condition makes it haram and this is a waste of so much potentials but when people are so rested up in their minds and defiant on no we want this amount of money for the samples and for the brochure or for the catalog then this is their problem you"
