  "title": "The true Fajr (break of dawn) & mistakes in some timetables  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister asks shake the place where I live now for Ramadan it has in sac and after 30 minutes its fetcher but I see no light so it is not true fajar should I delay the fetcher an hour later now when it comes to the issue of fetcher which is the break of dawn there are so many opinions and views and rather than give you a fish every day it's best that you're taught how to fish yourself therefore let us look at some of the hadeeth governing this issue the Prophet tells us in an authentic hadith that there are two fetcher one which is a false fetcher and it's like the tale of a wolf or a fox meaning it's vertical and then comes the true fetcher after a while which is horizontal and can be seen on the top of the mountains and the hills it's pitch black before fetcher forty minutes thirty minutes you see this vertical light that comes for few moments and then disappears this is false fetcher then you can see the whiteness the white thread in the head in the direction of the east and this is the break of dawn so it's not necessarily that the whole world glows so it would be dawn it can be simply this thread of whiteness in the direction of the east then the Prophet says in another hadith if the night comes from here and the day goes from there then it is time to break her fast likewise in the opposite when to refrain from eating and drinking when the day comes from here and the night comes goes there meaning the break of dawn and also the hadith of Bilal and ebony ami Maktoum the Prophet told us that there are two a van for fetcher one it is done by Bilal and this does not prevent someone from eating and drinking it's only a reminder so that those asleep can wake up and have their pre-dawn meal while even only Maktoum's are than is forfeiture and everyone has to refrain and they can pray fetcher from these evidences and also the verse in the Quran that you must eat and drink until you see the white thread from the black thread which meaning the break of dawn we know that as an individual I can eat and drink until I know it is time for the break of dawn if I can see that visually I would not pay any attention neither to the Adhan of the masjid nor to the timetable and the calendars so if I'm living in an open area in front of me is a desert or the ocean and I can see it's pitch-black then I can see the white thread I will refrain even if the event has been called ten minutes a half an hour before no problem I can see it visually the problem is that when you cannot see it visually so you have to trust and rely and we have two methods of trusting and relying either on the timetables or on them or Advan the man who caused a van in the Masjid as a Muslim I can trust the person giving the event because he's an individual a Muslim and trustworthy the timetables I have can be trusted but the problem is my watch may not be accurate some reasons here may be I did not put the right day for the calendar etc therefore it's best always to rely on the more Advan however if I know for certain that the more Arvind is not reliable meaning that on the 30th of Shaban the identify sure was at 5 o'clock a day later which is the first of ramadan he gives the Adhan at quarter to five fifteen minutes in one single day definitely this guy is taking a buffer zone and I should not pay attention to his call because it's not accurate I believe that the calendar or the timetable of UML kora calculation is the most accurate as I've stated this so many times before except when it comes to Isha prayer Asia prayer is wrong but the other 4 prayers are insha'Allah according to the correct thing however the concept of emsac this is found in Egypt and Turkey in Syria when they were Syria in Jordan in other countries they usually give fifteen or twenty minutes before the actual identifier and they call it in sack so people refrain from eating and this is wrong you eat and drink and do not refrain from anything that is halal until the van is called the time of the event the break of dawn is the time of refraining from eating and drinking"
