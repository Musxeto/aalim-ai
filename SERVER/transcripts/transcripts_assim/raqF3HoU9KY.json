  "title": "Permissible to backbite non muslims as long as its not about physical appearance? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": " my question was regarding back biting a non-muslim so i read it on islam qa and in honestly that it is permissible provided that we don't uh we are not saying bad things about his physical features and he is not a me we can back by it's permissible so am i right well this is an issue of dispute see the verse of the quran says and it is addressed in the beginning or who you believe and it says do not backbite one another so this is supposedly only for muslims backbiting other muslims nevertheless it is not at all part of the muslims character to be little others even non-muslims or to backbite them or to slaunder them or to say bad things simply because this falls under the general guideline where the prophet said allah a believer is not a person who slanders or curses or uses profanity or vulgar language so it is not befitting for a muslim to sit with another muslim and talk about a disbeliever whether he's a president a minister or and make fun of them definitely if it's about their physical uh characteristics and appearance this is how allah created them but to speak about them freely and chit-chat and gossip as if there is nothing more to discuss in this world but to make fun of them this is totally not befitting of a muslim for him"
