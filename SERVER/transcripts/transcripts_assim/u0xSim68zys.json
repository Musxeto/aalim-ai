  "transcript": "she's awesome it is possible now that actually some of us or some places in the face of this earth especially in America here I think it's already decided that part of Ramadan we're going to be at home does this mean that we we cannot live Ramadan I mean we cannot worship Allah you know there is a lot of talk especially in social media now people considering just having the fear of the covet 19 is a reason or an excuse not to fast so just the fear because there is an ocean out there which says you have to make sure that you you drinking enough liquid and all of that does the fear of it becomes a reason or an excuse which is legitimate in the Sharia not to observe fasting and was talking about someone who is eligible a Muslim a resident healthy all of the above please first of all Allah is the most merciful and he told us in the Quran that whenever you are sick or traveling and there is hardship then you are exempted from fasting and you may make up later on now Abdul Raj to cut the robucket area necessities that may make things that are Haram permissible are measured by the situation itself in Islam if I am stranded in the desert and I'm about to die out of hunger there is not a single thing eatable in front of me except a big chunk of cork whoa or it is haram for us I've always heard about pork chops but now this is the only thing front of me Islam tells you this is a necessity you may eat so I start cooking it seasoning it hey wait what are you doing is it I want to I'm just missing the balsamic vinegar and man I'm gonna make a feast out of it called people come homies come join in I would have been laughs you can eat a bite that sustains your life and not feast on it not be happy so let us go back to coffee 19 Ramadan is around the corner a couple of weeks only shot a lot okay I don't want a fast why because they say that you have to keep your throat and system moist with wet water who said that Tom Dick or Harry no this is not medically proven first of all second of all are you classified at the moment as sick no I do belong I'm fine then you don't have an excuse yes your but I'm afraid okay tomorrow I have a placement test and I'm afraid if I go to the tests while fasting MA I may flunk it tomorrow I have a driving test so I have to break my fast if I don't have my Starbucks latte I'm gonna get a headache hey wake up you're a Muslim Allah tells you to fast . he's not telling you please it's an instruction you have to do it but if there is a genuine fear or hardship meaning someone who has the virus and doctors say that you have to be on medication or a ventilator or a hydro chloro a quick caloric screen whatever they call it now and you have to take it yes Islam tells you you must not fast but someone who is healthy who is fit who's sitting home doing nothing then you have no no excuse none whatsoever and this question pops up when our Eman is negligible is this small yes and this is why we have - look everyone you talk to says Eric Aloha what awoken masha'Allah they all know this hadith a man came to the Masjid and he said o prophet of Allah I left my right I left my camel outside should I tie it to a tree or should I leave it and have trust in Allah the Prophet said no go out tie it and have trust in Allah you have to have both good luck now medic medically speaking we did tie the camel we did everything in our possession world regarding worldly matters taking place masks precautions wearing gloves sanitizers everything the whole nine yards but when it comes to trusting Allah we have a strong and powerful deficiency so this is something we have to look into - just fix ourselves fleeing to Allah rather than then fleeing away from Allah like the questioner was asking about trusting Ramana some Maliki Lafayette written a very well put together inshallah"
