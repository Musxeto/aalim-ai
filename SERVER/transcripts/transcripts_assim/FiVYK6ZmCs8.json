  "title": "Is it backbiting if someone talks negatively about someone I don't know and mentions their name?",
  "transcript": "uh if someone is telling me about the negative characteristics of someone who i don't know and then somewhere down the conversation they mention that person's name but i still have no clue who that person is does this fall under backfiring this is problematic if he tells you about someone and you don't know that person this is not backbiting so yesterday while coming to uh meet you i met someone he crossed in front of me and we had a fight and he swore at me said bad words you don't know him this is not backbiting but if i say at work i have a colleague and his name is farid and fareed does this and this and this and this now still you don't know him but saying his name may result in you getting to know him from a colleague from a friend from an announcement that this fareed did this and that and now it becomes a backbiting so it seems to me that it is closer to backbiting than not being backbiting and you should uh tell this individual yes i don't know him you you said his name and there is a possibility that i may get to know something about him and that would result in making it straightforward backbiting and allah knows best you"
