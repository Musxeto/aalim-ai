  "transcript": "Suad from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Yeah Sheikh, there are some friends and family member who whenever I call or see always ask if one is fasting. How do I respond to short frequent question? Usually if you're fasting, you say yes. What about you? Yani, throw the ball back into their court. Or you can say to them, if you have your period and you're ashamed of saying that, you say to them, what month are we in? They will say Ramadan. You say, what do you expect? What kind of a question is this? Why don't you ask me if I'm a Muslim or not? Why don't you ask me if I have prayed Fajr or not? What kind of a question? So you fire back at them, they will know their limit and will stop Inshallah."
