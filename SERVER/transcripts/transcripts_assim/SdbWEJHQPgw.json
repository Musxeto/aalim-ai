  "transcript": "Hada uh says that my question is regarding paying back my fast she's pregnant for the second baby and and Ramadan is approaching how do I make up for the fast that I missed do I feed a mskk do I feed a poor person for each day during uh or after Ramadan or do I fast for the M days after Ramadan she says that she fed a msk for the first baby that's for the days Mist before and some people are telling her that it is wrong and that she has to pay back fasting for the whole month that she has missed the majority of Scholars say that if a pregnant woman or a breastfeeding woman misses days of Ramadan due to the pregnancy or to breastfeeding or for the fear over their infant or their pregnancy then they have to make up for these days and some of them say they have to make up for these days and also feed a poor person if they do not make up in the same year if another Ramadan comes and they did not make up for the first Ramadan they have to feed a poor uh uh person as well and the authentic opinion the most authentic opinion is that no there is no feeding none whatsoever if you were pregnant prant and you missed first Ramadan and after delivering the baby the second Ramadan came and you were breastfeeding you were unable to fast it then the third Ramadan comes and you're pregnant again you can't fast the fourth Ramadan you could not also uh uh make it up you have four Ramadan Ramadan to make up so after the obstacles are gone after the fact that you can uh uh make up because you don't have anything to prevent you from doing this you're not breastfeeding and you're not pregnant and you have no reason for you to skip Ramadan you have to start making up for the days missed in Ramadan and you can do this in Winter you can do this when the day is short you can do this uh not necessarily in a row you can make it one day and Skip one day or you can do it on Thursdays and Mondays but you have to make up for the days missed and the opinion of feeding a poor person for every day that was missed and not making it up is uh not a strong opinion of Scholars"
