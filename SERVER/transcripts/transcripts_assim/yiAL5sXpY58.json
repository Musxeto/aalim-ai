  "transcript": "So my question is if a brother has bad judgement   and he can't um figure out how to uh weigh the \npros and cons correctly or he's hot tempered   so whenever he speaks or uh enjoins good \nand forbids evil it causes more problems   than good uh What means can you use to advise \nthe people or enjoin in good and forbid evil   this individual it seems that it's a pattern \nthat he uses the wrong means and that he is   um always hot blooded and this causes more \nharm than good so in his case if he's unable   to control his anger issues if he's unable \nto be diplomatic and knows how to use wisdom   he must refrain from mixing with people and \nforbidding evil because the harm is going to cause   Falls underneath the same category of not cursing \nthe idols so that they won't curse Allah this is   usually something that can be fixed with knowledge \nwith perseverance with wisdom and practice but if   this individual knows that he's hot blooded \nover 100 and he's got this issue that would   make him flare up and instead of fixing things \nmaking more damage he should not get involved"
