  "transcript": "jasmine from sweden uh i have a question about i go to university but i need to pay my books and everything so i need to earn money but i try to find a lot of jobs so i can earn halal money but most of the jobs this this haram things to its like and sometimes i need to wear jeans so there's a other man that can see me so i i try to find a job that that is suitable for me so i find a nursing home job so i work a night shift so i don't have to have a colleague so i can walk alone but the things that i need to change diapers from old man but they are not awake like they have alzheimer's so they are like babies can i continue working that or else i need to have a loan so i don't want that okay i will answer inshallah it's me from sweden she says i have to go to uni to uni but i can't afford the loans and and the money so is it permissible for me to uh work all the jobs that i have seen require that i wear jeans or i take off my hijab and or free mix or have something haram in it so the only job that i found suitable for me is a job in a caring home for the elders who have alzheimer's who are totally out of this world but they need someone to care take care of them the only problem is that i sometimes need to change diapers and the elderly who i change their diapers are not conscience they're almost like children because they've reached an age of alzheimer they don't know what's happening so what to do there is no problem insha allah in that as long as you are abiding by the hijab you're wearing gloves and you're avoiding looking at the aura as much as possible then there is no problem in such a job insha'allah"
