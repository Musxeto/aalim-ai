  "transcript": "from Canada so shik uh my question is our Prophet sallallah alai wasam has prohibited us to ask for Haram stuff right in Dua in Dua correct yes so but yet if a person asks for Haram things out of his desire and then if he gets it out and he praises knowing that it is Haram and this is ridicule it's not ridiculing but acknowledging it is Haram so what would be the ruling on him will he is sinful he would be sinful but it is not what you thinking of that oh he asked for something that is Haram and he's praising Allah for something that is Haram so so this makes him a cfir this is how Shan wants you to think and you said it he's not ridiculing it he's stupid that's all yeah you you know that Allah prohibited Haram Allah prohibited fornication yet you say oh Allah let me have this one night with this woman and you know it's Haram and Allah hates this and Allah is angered by it but out of weakness out of knowing that no one can facilitate anything except with Allah's permission you do this stupid Act and you get it thinking that oh you've got it made and you're a lucky one this is stupid but I wouldn't say that oh you've exited the fold of Islam because exiting the fold of Islam is not something that is easy yes it's a major sin what you have done you're going to be punished like Allah knows how in your grave and in in on the Hereafter and also in this life with the depression with all the whole nine yards but this does not take you out of the fold of Islam"
