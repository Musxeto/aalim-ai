  "transcript": "It's a pleasure for me to be back once again in pace for the second pis international sunnah convention. The first was held last year in January and the theme of this year's convention is Al Quran the divine guidance and the topic of my talk is Al Quran the last and final revelation from God. Al Quran is the last and final revelation which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. It's mentioned in the Quran in surah chapter number 35 verse number 24. There is not a nation or a tribe to whom you have not sent a warner. It's mentioned surah chapter number 13 verse number 7 in every nation have we sent a guide by name. There are 25 messengers mentioned in the Quran. Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, Muhammad, peace be upon them all. By name 25 messengers have been mentioned in the glorious Quran. And if you read the hadith of the prophet, it's mentioned in Mishkat al- Masabi that there were 124,000 messengers sent on the face of the earth. But by name only 25 are mentioned in the Quran. All the messengers that came before the last and final messenger, Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, they were meant only for a particular group of people. And the message which they bought, the revelation that came was only meant for a particular time period. But because prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was the last and final messenger. He was not sent only for the Muslims or the Arabs. He was sent for the whole of humanity. And Allah says in the Quran in surah amyia chapter number 21 verse number 107 mean that we have sent thee not but as a mercy to all the worlds as a mercy to all the nations as a mercy to the whole of humanity. Because prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was the last and final messenger. He was not sent only for the Muslims or for the Arabs but for the whole of humanity. And Allah says in Sabah chapter number 34 verse number 28 that we have sent thee not but as a universal messenger giving glad tidings and warning them against sin. But most of the human beings yet do not know. Allah says in the Quran in surah the chapter number 13 verse number 38 Had in every age have you sent a revelation in every age Allah subhanana wa ta'ala has revealed a book by name only four are mentioned in the Quran Torah Zabur injil and the Quran tora was the revelation which was revealed to Moses peace be upon him zabur was the wahi the revelation which was revealed to David daisam peace be upon him and injil was the revelation the which was revealed to Jesus peace be upon him and the glorious Quran is the last and final revelation which was revealed to the last and final messenger prophet Muhammad peace be upon him all the revelation that came four I mentioned my name but there are many others for example SFA Ibrahim etc but all the revelation that came before the last and final revelation they were meant for a particular group of people and the message was supposed to be followed for a particular time period. It wasn't till eternity. But because the glorious Quran is the last and final revelation from Allah subhanana wa ta'ala revealed to the last and final messenger prophet Muhammad peace be upon him. It was revealed for the whole of humanity. Allah says in surah Ibrahim chapter number 14 verse number one alif lamra. This is a revelation revealed to G prophet Muhammad peace be upon him so that he may guide humankind from darkness to light. It's mentioned in surah Ibrahim chapter number 14 verse number 52.
