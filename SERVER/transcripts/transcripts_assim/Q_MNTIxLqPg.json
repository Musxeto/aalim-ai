  "title": "Can she decide not to get married if she is attracted to the opposite gender but CAN control herself",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh so I saw many of your videos regarding whether \nthe marriage is obligatory or not and if someone   decide not to get married and in one of your \nvideos you said that a person who has no desired   to get married at the moment here she can postpone \ntheir marriage for a couple of years and so on but   my question is if someone has desire for the \nopposite gender but they have control over   that desire and they know they will not fall into \nHaram can hear she decide not to get married ever   this is well this again is not the question to be \nasked someone who does not have any desire to the   opposite gender is he obliged to get married the \nanswer is no but it is not how we look at things   marriage is one of Allah's signs \nAllah created spouses so that they can   inhibit one another and Allah made \nbetween them mercy and compassion even if you don't have the desire you may have it \nand develop it next year five years from now 10   years from now but the more you get older the \nless the demand is and the market is open and   it is ruled by demand and supply women in previous \nyears their marriage average rate was 18. 17.   so when I got married 40 years ago about \n40 years ago that was the norm 17 or 18.   if she was 23 whoa that's too much nowadays \nit's like 28. why because men are not interested   a lot of them are unfortunately not practicing so \nthey fulfill their desires through Haram means or   they are more oriented towards their jobs and \ncareer so they don't get married until they're   40 or 45 which is very sad for a Muslim to wait \nthis long and waste the most beautiful years of   his life without a companion nevertheless if \na woman says I don't want to get married ever   and she doesn't have any desire for the opposite \ngender and there is no fitna that's her problem   is she doing a good thing definitely not she's   going against against the Sunnah of the \nProphet (Peace and Blessing upon him) Umar may Allah be pleased with him saw a man once \nand ask him are you married and the man said no   and the probably the man was in his mid-20s or \n30s so Umar looked at him and said one of two   nothing is preventing you from getting married \nexcept either impotency or you are a Playboy a   fornicator because this is not normal everybody is \nlooking forward to get married this is a natural   thing so are you following the Sunnah definitely a \nlot are you losing a lot of reward because you're   refusing to get married definitely yes but am \nI sinful it depends from one case to the other"
