  "transcript": "foreign space so sometimes people come from the front trying to pass by the sides of a person making up a missed congregational rakas but while doing so they end up invading his personal uh prayer Space by entering a leg or foot or arm like the space to pass by safely is really small so they still take the risk so is he obliged to raise his hands and stop them from passing one point that the person faces this issue in a Masjid Marquez and mostly their teachers and students pass by like this and also there they are usually intolerant to opinions that are not part of the uh first of all the prohibition is from passing in front of a person praying putting his hand or his leg does not invalidate it so if there is a person praying in someone reaches in front of him with his hand to pick up a musaf from a shelf or something in front of him this does not invalidate the Salat because the prohibition is in him passing him being stationary in front of the prayer a person praying does not impact the prayer as in the case of mother Aisha when the prophet used to pray and she was lying in front of him throughout the whole prayer so no one would say oh this invalidates the prayer because she did not pass she was in front of him stationary there's nothing wrong in that secondly if you're making up for mistrakas the moment Imam gives salaam you stand up you move forward a step or two or three no problem until you reach someone who's sitting and you're so close to him that would prevent people from invalid in invading your personal space when praying or you walk to a pillar or to a wall providing is a step or two so usually when you do this you block people from doing that and Allah knows best as for the fact that their job or they are intolerant the hell with them I'm following the Sunnah who cares what they think the prophet ordered me as a slam to stop who wants to invade and walk through and if he doesn't stop I should push him and fight him so this is from the Sunnah because he's the one who's transgressing not me I'm just following what the prophet taught Allah and one has to use wisdom and see the consequences of his action because sometimes you have to lose a battle in order to win the war with such ignorant people it's highly advised not to pray in their masjids go and put yourself with people who follow the Sunnah the way of the Prophet assalam who love the prophet Allah and worship Allah through following him not through blindly following their Scholars and their mawlanas who teach them against the sin of the propheta this is what you should do and if you can't find such a place make such a place you and a person or two or three from the community to start a nucleus of people following the Sunnah don't bow down and submit to Innovation and to such people who do not follow the Sunnah and want you to be submissive to whatever they say oh don't do Rafael oh don't say I mean loudly oh don't put your hands on your chest don't move your finger within the childhood don't do this don't do that subhanallah what is this Simon says I never knew that you bought this message and it's registered in your name or your father's name this is Allah's Masjid we follow the Quran and the Sunnah what do you follow so-and-so this is not applicable so be wise try your level best to de-escalate situations and confine yourself to people who follow the same Akida the same methodology of the Prophet Allah"
