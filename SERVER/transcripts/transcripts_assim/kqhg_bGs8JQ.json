  "transcript": "Mel from Germany Assalamu Alaikum Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh I know that most scholars are of the opinion that if you are on and off with prayer, you are still a Muslim. Yesterday I missed prayers and I got so panicked and scared because I didn't pray them. I'm convinced of my faith and I'm a practicing Muslima. Alhamdulillah, I'm not a Kafir. But I'm afraid that I have left Islam and my marriage is invalid because of the other opinion. What should I do? You should slap yourself once or twice to wake up from your delusions and abandon Shaitan's whispering. If you are of this sound mentality, knowing how to present your case and knowing the majority of scholars say that you're not Kafir and you're still insisting on being a Kafir only to destroy your marriage, you have a problem. You're a wacko. And this is not the first time. You keep on asking the same time privately on the phone, on Twitter, on a live TV. As if you just have a death wish. If you want to divorce your husband, go ahead. So, no, no, no Shaykh, I don't want to, I love him. You're either lying or you're a wacko. Look what Shaitan is doing to you. Take a good look in the mirror. Just stand in the mirror and look. And see how Shaitan is in the background laughing his head off. Because no one in his right mind would do such things. And keep on asking, is my marriage valid? Oh, when I got married, I didn't actually know the meaning of la ilaha illallah, so am I Muslim? One of the witnesses was this and that, so is my marriage valid? I don't know about my guardian, my father. He was not praying at the time or he said a joke that may have nullified his Islam. Is my marriage valid? And you keep on asking these questions. You need someone to give you a good whipping. So that these demons would go away and you would concentrate on what gets you closer to Allah. Because you're diverting way off track. And Allah is angry with you. If you don't want, ask for khul'a. Let your husband get a second new wife, younger, more beautiful, more righteous and more sane. That would fill his life with comfort and ease. Instead of asking these questions every now and then. May Allah azza wa jal purify your head from such whispers of demons and return you back to your sanity."
