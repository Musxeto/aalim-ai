  "transcript": "khadija says how long can a husband and wife live away from each other some husbands have to go abroad to earn and cannot come back for three to four years this is permissible as long as there is an agreement between them he can stay even for 20 years and the marriage is intact not every people can have the luxury of working in their own country or in their own hometown sometimes it's difficult and a man has to travel overseas to make ends meet and to be able to provide for its children and to give them a decent life to pay the rent or to build them a house or in some cases to pay for their schools and education if he were to stay behind he would not be able to do any of those so the couple reach a settlement a compromise you go earn i'll stay with the kids and raise them hopefully in 10 15 20 years you will be able to save something sufficient for us to get back together of course he comes as many times as he can and afford some of them come for the annual vacation for 30 days a year some can't afford that so they come every two years and so on it all depends on the agreement between them you"
