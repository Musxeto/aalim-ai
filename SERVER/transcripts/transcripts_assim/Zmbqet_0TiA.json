  "transcript": "NAD from the Emirates may Allah subh bless and reward you for this great effort and that it entirely and you as well my question is regarding investing in share market both for Commodities trading as well as companies uh in one of your videos you had explained that as Muslims we can deal in gold silver grein pulses directly hand to hand online is not allowed what about buying and selling online brand crude or crude oil or buying and selling shares of multinational companies like Tesla Microsoft Google okay first of all buying gold silver or currency the prophet saidat that such transactions have to be simultaneous Gold by gold exactly the same weight and caliber or carrot and exactly the uh uh s it has to be simultaneous give and take if the types differ if I'm buying gold with silver of course they can't be the same weight but it has to be simultaneous so if I'm buying gold online with money it has to be simultaneous give and take at the same time which is not possible online uh uh transactions this has nothing to do with buying other products so I can buy dates for example or salt or barley or wheat online without any problem because I'm paying in cash money I can buy crude oil because this is not gold silver or currencies I could buy diamonds I could buy uh rubies I could buy uh uh Platinum I could buy copper there is no problem in that online as for other company's shares whether it's Tesla or Microsoft and the likes when you buy their shares you're actually becoming a partner so we have to look into their balance sheets and their annual report if they deal with riba which most these companies do so they finance their um charging stations Across America for Tesla for example by borrowing from Banks they don't pay from their own money and pocket and now they have the technology sold to other car manufacturers so that they unite the charging port and they're financing it through banks this means that on I am in involved in a company that deals with riba and invests its own cash in riba in Banks and taking interest and this is all coming back to me as dividends or profit and the likes this is not permissible because you are a partner in it and Allah Knows Best"
