  "transcript": "okay chapter consultation alhassan said people never seek advice without being guided to the best possible possibility available to them then he recited and whose affairs are a matter of counsel uh chapters 42 verses 38 okay so consultation who is hasan mentioned here the companion of the prophet al-salat the grandson or the taber he is al-hassan al-basri one of the greatest of the taberean whose words they used to say resembles the prophet's hadith because he was up brought in the house of the wife of the prophet alaihis um if i'm not mistaken consultation in arabic is isticara this has a great role in islam there's an old saying for the scholars some make it a hadith but it is not a hadith it is a famous well-known statement he who seeks consultation will never regret it and he who prays this tihara will never fail now is tishara or surah is mentioned in the quran allah azzawajal says so be so by the mercy of allah you were lenient with them and if you had been rude and harsh in heart they would have this abandoned you from about you so pardon them ask forgiveness for them and consult them so allah is ordering who the messenger allah to consult and also allah says and those who have responded to their lord and established prayer and whose affairs is determined by consultation among themselves so it's part of our deen to consult to seek guidance and this is an amanah what is meant by amanda it is something to be entrusted with why because when someone comes to you and seeks your consultation you have to be fearing allah azzawajal and give them the right consultation you must not consult someone who is inexperienced and you must not consult someone who does not have the piety and righteousness why if you ask and consult someone who is inexperienced what will happen he will give you the wrong consultation imagine you have stomachache you have pain in your stomach and you go to a dentist what will he do for you he will extract your wisdom tooth and charge you for it but your pain will remain so you have to seek consultation from an experienced person in marriages so many times people when they have problems they go to someone who is inexperienced a man comes to me sheikh my wife did this and this and this and this and this i say divorce this so-and-so divorcer this is inexperience a woman so many women come to me and say my husband did this in this industry please advice i said i will not advise you why sheikh i have to listen to his side of the story sometimes i listen to the sister i say your husband has to be hanged but then the husband comes in the afternoon and says my wife did this and this and this i said your wife has to be put in front of a firing squad at night i bring them both together and i listen to them half of what he said and half of what her say of she said were lies they do not repeat them in front of each other whenever i present my case i always try to show the good points in my side and my favor so you should and must ask someone with experience in whatever you do you want to start a business you don't go to someone who has no experience in business you want to start farming you don't go to an expert in industry he doesn't have any knowledge in farming and he has to be righteous and pious why because he might cheat you go to someone and he doesn't fear allah and tell him uh you you know that sister masha allah she knows the quran by heart and she knows the six books of sunnah and she has great knowledge in islamic studies and by the way she's a revert and before she accepted islam she was a beauty queen and she knows how to dance ballet and plays the violin and she speaks seven languages and she is this feature and so so do you think it's good if i propose to her what would he say a woman like that with such a past and history marry someone who is pure and muslim thank you he goes and marries her so consult someone who feels allah and who is experienced now if you manage to do this you will find that there is stage two so i consult i take feedback from people from the elders from the experienced what is stage two what what to do next and the issue of snehara will come inshallah later on hopefully before the day is over and there is a lot of talk about it how to do it the results do we see a window opening from the heavens saying do it or do we see a dream or what what so people have confusion about istihara we will come into that inshaallah"
