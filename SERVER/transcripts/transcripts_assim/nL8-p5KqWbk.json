  "title": "Can we ask for forgiveness or pray for Jannah for parents or people who die on shirk Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says can we pray for jannah for parents who committed shirk this is problematic because this question to be answered we have to first of all get something out of the way which is your parents are dead correct yes they used to commit shirk correct yes do you have any evidence that they knew that this was shikh did any alim scholar a muslim judge labeled them as mushrik no in this case we assume that they died on islam because in order to label someone as a mushrik we have to fulfill the conditions and remove any obstacles preventing us from doing this otherwise i assume hakeem would go and label the vast majority of all muslims as mushrik because they go to dhargas they ask peers they may deal in magic and many many of them don't know that this is haram so it's not easy just simply to say ah i remember my uncle and he used to say with nabi he used to swear by the prophet so this is he this means he is mushrik and hence i am not uh going to ask allah for forgiveness no this is accusing someone condemning condemning him being the judge issuing the verdict being the executioner at the same time this is this doesn't work like this so if a person committed shirk while he was not knowing that it was ship we would not label him as a mushrik if a person abandoned salah died without praying but not knowing that this is an act of kuffer and no one has told him this or established that he knew yet he still was defined and insisted on it it would not be labeled as kafur but let's assume that someone is a blatant mushrik he knows that going to graves and worshiping them and sacrificing from them his ship we showed him the evidence from the quran and the sunnah he acknowledged but he said this is what my forefathers used to do and i don't care about your islam this is my islam i and we've tried our level best and he died upon the akhida of shirk after fulfilling the conditions and preventing any obstacles in this case you cannot ask allah for forgiveness for him allah says in surat what translates to it is not for the prophet sallallahu alaihi and those who had believed it's not up to them to ask forgiveness for the polytheists even if they were relatives after it has become clear to them that they are companions of hellfire once a person is labeled as a mushrik or a kafir and a companion of hellfire you cannot pray funeral prayer over him you cannot ask allah for forgiveness for him you"
