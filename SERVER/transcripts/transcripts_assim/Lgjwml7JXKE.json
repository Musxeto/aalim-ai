  "transcript": "gia says I'm scared of pain of death is there any special deed that can eradicate this pain while dying I have heard people who are pious that they do not feel the pain of death is this true first of all this is inevitable life is a test and your final test is on your dying bed do movement do believers suffer before they die the answer is yes can you explain and elaborate because we heard that the soul of a believer when it departs his body it is like a drop that is falling from a water container or a water back so smoothly and softly that you don't even feel it so how can we reconcile there's no contradiction before the soul exits the body this is an area or a period of time where it is a chance for a believer to erase a lot of his sins I'm the love and mustard may Allah be pleased with him visited the Prophet ala saw someone he was sick so he put his hand on the prophet's chest and it was boiling he was hot with fever so I'm the love Masood voiced his concern and he said o prophet of Allah when we talk among each other we say that you get sick twice as much as we do the Prophet said yes the most severely tested people at the side of Allah are the prophets and then the righteous and then those who are below them and those who are below them a believer is tested the Prophet says Alistair according to his level and strength of Eman of belief so if he has strong belief Allah would increase the calamities and testing upon him and if his Eman and belief is weak allah azza wajal would reduce the amount of testing and calamities mother Aisha witnessed the pain and agony that the Prophet Allah salatu salam underwent on his dying bed he used to suffer a lot from it and he had a cup of water next to him and he used to insert his hand in it and then wipe his face and says la ilaha illallah in almaty Sakura to that death has its moments as its pains that come on and off and then when he passed away sallallahu alayhi wa sallam when he died mother aisha said after what I had seen from the Prophet arezzo Salam I would never ever hate such hardship when dying to any of my loved ones because if the Prophet SM who is the best of all humans if not the best of all all those creations suffered this much this means that it is something good and we would not at all object to it coming to any of our loved ones so in order to reconcile this suffering is before the departure of the soul as for the departure of the soul of the believer it goes smooth and easy without any problem with Allah alhamdulillah Welman for"
