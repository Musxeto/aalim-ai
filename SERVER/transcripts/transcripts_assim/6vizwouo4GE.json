  "transcript": "be at a time but never give up no giving even when success seems out of sight the patient ones turn today's topic is one of the most beautiful moral conduct and good manners in islam we'll talk today about amman and the prophet sallallahu alaihi was known to the disbelievers of mecca before he became a prophet he was known as assad al-amin which means the one who says the truth the truthful one and which comes from amanah allah azza tells us in the holy quran truly we did offer al amana and what is the manna well it is translated as the trust or moral responsibility or honesty and all the duties which allah has ordained allah azzawajal offered the amana to the heavens to the earth and to the mountains but they declined to bear it and were afraid of it but man bore it verily he was unjust to himself and ignorant of its results therefore amana is translated into or defined as anything that a person is entrusted with and he's instructed to do so a manner can be between allah and his servant by fulfilling allah's commands to him by offering what allah ordered him to do and by staying away from sin and from things that allah forbade upon him so part of the amana is your prayer your fasting your pilgrimage part of your amana is to stay away from intoxicants from stealing from lying from backbiting etc also amana can be between humans among themselves and that would be by doing what you are entrusted with so if you are given and awarded a position then you have to fear allah and do what you are entrusted to do in that position and if you are entrusted with being the guardian of someone you have to give your guardians the best of your knowledge and of your capability as far as trust is concerned otherwise you would have betrayed them likewise if someone deposits something with you you're entrusted with it and if someone tells you a secret you're entrusted with it and all of this part of the amana and it is a muslim's duty an obligation not to cheat not to lie and not to betray neither a believer or a disbeliever neither in major things or even in small things it is allah the almighty who commanded us to fulfill the things that we were entrusted with allah almighty says verily allah commands that you should render back the trusts to those to whom they are due last night i was having dinner with one of the dais the and this sheikh was telling me about a man who appeared to be another daddy this was in the states and he sheltered him he hosted him he gave him money and he requested some money to borrow from him so the sheikh gave it to him as a form of good gesture and good will and the sheikh was telling me that he did this because this was another so he thought and then after a while he discovered that this person started talking badly against him and started saying that he is following the wrong manhattan and that he's doing this and he's doing that it's a matter of difference of opinion but not to the extent that you slander people and you talk badly about them and even if it reached that level even if i think of you these bad things does this justify that i do not give you your money back the sheikh was telling me that this man did not give him till this date the money he borrowed from him so does this mean that if i have a different opinion to yours that your money is halal and that i can attack you and embezzle your money and take it definitely not this is not islam islam forbids that i do this with a disbeliever i cannot take the money of a disbeliever because he's a disbeliever who gives me the right allah will throw me in hell if i do this if i take the money of my neighbor who is a disbeliever and i look down at him and say that he's a disbeliever i can take his money i can rape his daughters allah will throw me in hell with the disbelievers at the bottom of it because of what i have done this is not lawful and this is not part of being a muslim described those who do such a thing by saying o you who believe betray not allah and his messenger nor betray knowingly your ammanna the plural of a manna and it is the things entrusted to you and all the duties which allah has ordained for you therefore allah called this betrayal so if you betray your amman at you doomed this is not part of the muslim character the good manners and the moral conduct does not have in its dictionary betrayal this is not a muslim and a muslim should not be like that you know who is like this do you know who has this character of betrayal in him a hypocrite a hypocrite who pretends to be a muslim but inside he is not the prophet said alaihis wasallam the signs of the signs of a hypocrite are three when he speaks he lies when he makes a promise he breaks it and when he is entrusted with something he betrays that trust does this sound any familiar to you do you know muslims like this personally speaking i do i know a lot of muslims who are like this but they have only islam and their id cards not more if a person lies and breaks his promise and betrays the trust put into him he is a hypocrite and by the way hypocrites are at the bottom end of hell fire so they are lower than lots of the idol worshipers and lots of the disbelievers because they are worse than the idol worshipers and the disbelievers in the term that these disbelievers say openly that they disbelieve and they did not accept islam while the hypocrites are worse in the sense that they hide their belief they camouflage it and they claim to be muslims so that they would undermine islam and they would harm the muslims as well the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam had warned us from betraying the trust that people have in us the prophet says salaam there is no iman for the one who cannot be trusted and there is no religion for the one who does not keep his promise wow this is what i call mind blowing there is no eman for a person who cannot be trusted so if you lose the trust of the people because you betrayed them so many times you've got a problem the prophet says allah there is no eman we have a short break stay tuned and inshaallah we will be right back there is no iman there is no faith there is no iman does this mean that he is a kafir no but it means that he is not a full believer you remember the hadith of the prophet where he says that iman is composed of so many branches 70 plus branches or 60 plus branches the highest among them is there's no god worthy of being worshiped except allah and the last one of them is removing obstacles and harmful things from people's way and he says ali and bashfulness is a branch of iman this means that if you do all the 70 plus or the 60 plus you are a true believer and a complete practicing muslim but if you do not you have few shortcomings here or there this means that your iman your belief is not complete and this is one part of the branches of iman and in so many cases satan does his thing he comes and he whispers in our ears justifying betrayal so this is what he does best you may find two people who look practicing who sounds to be practicing they have a joint venture they work hard in a business and something happens and they split and subhanallah once they split you start to see the true identity of these two guys likewise if a man divorces his wife or they have a problem or dispute and it goes to court their true identity is revealed by lots of betrayals lots of lying lots of promises being broken and this is all on islamic this is not part of the teachings of our prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam you have to know that when shaytan when satan comes to you and whispers to you that it's okay to betray because he deserves it he did this first this is wrong and in so many cases people fail to consult others they only follow their own desires and whims and they say that no i thought it over he deserves it i have to do this to him i have to betray his trust and i have to punish him and this is wrong allah will punish you for that you should consult those who know more than you do you should ask people to give you the proper judgment instead of you being the victim and the prosecutor and also the one inflicting the punishment this is un-islamic satan comes to one of us and says listen he betrayed you so you betray him instead or as returned to his betrayal the prophet said alaihis was in the authentic hadith give or render back the things you are entrusted with give it back render it back to those who entrusted you with it and never ever betray who betrayed you so it is not as in the case of an eye for an eye betrayal is something bigger than that so if someone betrays you this does not give you the right to betray him you have to fulfill and you have to render the things that you've been entrusted with because these are parts of the qualities part of the ethics and moral conduct of a proper muslim the prophet alaihis was told us that a person who betrays the trust of people will come on the day of judgment not an announced on the contrary everyone would know on the day of judgment that this is someone who betrayed the people's trust how is that the prophet tells us that allah azza will erect a flag next to his backside saying that this is a person who betrays trust so wherever he walks on the day of judgment people would know that this is a person who betrays the trust and betraying a trust not only limited to giving back the money that you've been entrusted with it goes further than this for example the prophet told us that keeping secrets is part of a manna if a man tells you something then he looks around it is an amana if i'm talking to someone and this someone says hey listen i'd like to tell you this and he looks right and left and he tells it to you the prophet says this is an amana this is something you're entrusted with so you have no right to go out and say to your friends listen so-and-so just told me blah blah blah this is betraying the trust that he had in you he tells us again the prophet salallahu that the gatherings not only limited to two people but even if we were more than two and we are in a closed room we gathered and we talked the prophet says a conversation in a gathering is a trust innamel which means that you do not have the right to go out and say well i met so and so and he said so-and-so and disclose things that he only said in a gathering with the four or five or the ten of you he did not want this to be publicized now having said this one usually asks and says but sometimes people entrust me with secrets that if i do not disclose or if i do not take action harm will happen to people and this is different if someone comes to you and says i don't like my neighbor and tonight i'm going to kill him i'm going to assassinate him and he tells you about his plan but he tells you that this is a trust this is a manner you have no right to tell anyone about it well you do you have to report this man if you knew about people wanting to make terrorist attacks they're plotting to blow up a building or assassinate someone or to create chaos in a society you live in have it be a muslim society or a non-muslim society you have to report them because this is something that allah does not approve of this is not the trust you're betraying you're betraying allah's trust if you do not remove this evil advice and be an obstacle in their faces you have to report it if you know something that is bad going to happen to others you have to stop this from happening part of the amana that allah azza entrusted you with is when you are a guardian to your daughter for example if you give your daughter in marriage to someone who is not worthy of that honor then you have betrayed the amana and how does this happen well where i come from a lot of the people give their daughters and marriage or the sisters in marriage if the person proposing comes from a very big family or he's rich or he has a phd or he has a big income they immediately accept his proposal and they do not check on his background does he pray who cares allah will guide him inshallah after 20-30 years does he deal in haram he will repent he will repent i know that he has girlfriends and he fornicates and commits adultery but he will repent inshallah he drinks intoxicants and he does drugs he will repent inshallah he will repent he gives his daughter and marriage to such a person to such scum and then he is throwing his daughter in hell living with such a man torturing her abusing her making her live in real hell in his house and whose responsibility is this it's the father's responsibility who betrayed allah's trust in him so there are different forms of betraying allah's trust among the trust that we are entrusted with the amana we are entrusted with are the positions we assume and hold so it is not an honor to be the ceo of a company to be a minister or a governor or a king or a president this is a responsibility it is a manner may allah be pleased with him went to the prophet and said o prophet of allah why don't you appoint me as a governor as a ruler of one of the districts of the countries of the muslims he wanted an official position he wanted to be a civil servant with a position the prophet hit him on the shoulders and the chest pushing him and this is a form of reprimanding not hitting him or beating him but this is just to wake him up and he said it is a fact that you're weak you're not a strong man to assume such a position and it is an amana the position is not from my pocket to give to you it is a trust that you and i are entrusted with so you're weak and it is an amana it is something that we're trusted with but on the day of judgment it is means of being sorrow and being disgraced so you'll be humiliated and disgraced on the day of judgment if you do not do it as you're supposed to and that is why the prophet said al-islam it is a disgrace and it is means of being sorry unless you fulfill it to the max and you do what you're supposed to do with such a position this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time"
