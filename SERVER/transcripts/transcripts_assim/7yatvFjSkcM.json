  "transcript": "vidan from turkey um so i i'm a bit confused about this i think i've asked this before though uh so if someone does have like gold uh pure gold which is let's say 90 grams and they should pay the calendar um but it's in a form of jewelry so it's like if they go and ask the price of it to know how much they should pay from the cat the person who buys themselves gold they will say higher price because the jewelry itself looks good or maybe it is like a brandy from some brand or maybe has some other stones on it how can one know like um the exact price of only the gold we've explained this before fidan and said that zakat is mandatory upon the gold the mineral itself the metal and silver precious stones diamonds any other thing these are not included so how do i know you take it to the jeweler's shop and they with their experience can weigh so if they weigh a hefty heavy necklace they would say that oh this weighs like 150 grams but through their experience they know that 120 grams of it is made of stones and only 30 grams is gold so they tell you there is no zakat in it even if the value of the necklace is 50 000 it doesn't matter what counts is the amount of gold in it so the jewelers shop has this ability to distinguish that you"
