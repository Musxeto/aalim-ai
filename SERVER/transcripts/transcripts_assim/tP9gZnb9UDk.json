  "transcript": "foreign when we hear the adhan it's not only vikkar but there is also liquor involved in repeating after the adhan and what to say after the adhan and different phrases and format for it and this is done five times a day so what should we say when the adhan is called that one should repeat every phrase as it is everything except when the says why because he's saying come to prayers come to prosperity so it would be appropriate instead of saying to him come to prayer come to prosperity to reply and saying there is no might nor power except with allah i cannot come and answer your call without allah so you say what is needed to be said which is then what to say after the then the prophet told us hallelujah to say and i testify that now some say that this statement is to be said at the end of the full event while others say that we should say this statement after the shahada in the athan you know that is four times allahu akbar and then is this is one version of what scholars said and either way in sha allah they both are correct and valid so after the add-on is over what should we say is the salutation upon the prophet islam so when the mother says either you say the previous to the end or you say you offer salutation upon the prophet to the end and then you invoke allah azzawajal with the vikar which is so hadith 25 this dua is what you should say and the difference of among scholars with the last phrase in which translates to uh verily you never fail in your promise is it authentic or not shaykh al-bani says it's not authentic says it's authentic and it seems to me that it is acceptable to say and there's no problem because the narrator who said it is thicker and there is no problem in accepting what he has said now these supplications by the way must be done silently why are you highlighting this shikh because i've heard in different muslim countries where the muadhin after saying he offered salutation upon the prophet in the loudspeakers so it became part of the adhan and then he offers the dua on the loudspeakers so now this is a clear manifestation of what an innovation is did the prophet ever do this allah did bilal may allah be pleased with him ever offered salutation upon the prophet sallam on top of a message after the adhan never ever had any of the companions done that never ever so you tell me those who do this through the loudspeakers in masjid are they following the sunnah are they following the sharia or they're following their whims and desires no doubt they're following their whims and desires satan is pleased with what they're doing and happy but they're angering allah likewise some folks in muslim countries and i've seen this in syria and other countries between and turkey as well between the adhan and the iqamah in the masjid people are praying two raka's of sunnah people are reciting the quran people making dhikr the then make takes up the microphone and recites in the loudspeakers what are you doing he said no this is thicker no this is not thicker this is an innovation you're disturbing the others and you are innovating in the religion of allah nowadays nowadays people consider this to be part of the sunnah and they enjoy the melodious recitation of the then and so this is okay this is fine it's beautiful no it's not beautiful either you follow the sharia or you follow your whims and desires and if it's not part of the sunnah it's not part of the quran then definitely you're following the steps of satan and this is sinful and it angers allah the almighty this is all the time we have until we meet next time um [Music]"
