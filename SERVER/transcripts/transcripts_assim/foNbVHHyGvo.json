  "transcript": "from sri lanka says that he was attending rookia online from iraq in the uk personally i believe that rookie online does not work and rookia through social media or facebook or twitter also does not work rookie has to be face to face in presence of people otherwise we would have simply offered rookie on mp3 distributed it and got the cash back from people it doesn't work or people send you a picture in you look at the picture and you recite right of course and you blow in it alhamdulillah a mission accomplished this doesn't work rookie has to be face to face but this guy has a rookie with a iraqi in the uk and this rocky came to the conclusion that the uh that abdul aziz has a jinn and this jinn is meaning he is a romeo jin he is a loving jinn is the utmost in love and intimacy so when you have a jinn asha meaning that this jinn loves you so much that he would not let you go now i don't have knowledge in these things they are not from the quran the sunnah for sure and people have come up with so many things and when you tell them that this is not from the quran the suicide no no it's experience how would you know that this guy has a jin hashem origin talif or jin whatever does he plug you in in a computer screen like they do in cars to analyze and and see the system is working fine and says okay we have an error here i think you have black magic and it says that the black magic was done by your uncle's wife who lives in uh uh mozambique what is this come on give me a break what is this this is not from islam so a lot of the iraqis have gone overboard and it is a lucrative business it they make a lot of money out of it and who's going to hold them to account they say whatever they want as long as they can bring you over and over and over again but i would not go to the extreme and accuse them all out of allah there are many of them who are righteous and good brothers and practicing but you have to yeah and he use your common sense so again if you did not fall into seizure if people when you're having these sessions did not say that oh you went into a fit or a seizure and foam came from your mouth and you started speaking in languages and another voice of a person came out of you and you're not aware of all of this if this did not happen this raki is an imposter he cannot know whether you have jinnahship or you have evil eye or you have black magic he cannot know that but if you fell into a seizure and you went unconscious you started speaking and the people around you say that you did this then this is a possibility and allah knows best you"
