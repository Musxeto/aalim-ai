  "transcript": "sri lanka he says if i committed a major sin and i repented to allah do i have to do this once or continue to repent through the rest of my life the answer is continue to repent till the rest of your life one would say oh sheikh this is too much it's it's a great burden it's giving me anxiety attacks and depression when you repent once do you have any guarantees that allah has accepted your repentance and forgiven your sins the answer is no therefore as a sunnah we think positively of allah hoping that he accepted our repentance at the same time and in the same level we are fearful that allah may have not accepted our repentance due to our own flaws and shortcomings maybe we were not sincere therefore we continuously repent and ask allah for forgiveness till the day of of we we die and this is why the prophet alison used to say all people the prophet says seek allah's forgiveness and repent to him for i seek allah's forgiveness and repent to him more than a hundred times a day and this is the prophet alaih he never felt bored or depressed because he has to repent over and over again you"
