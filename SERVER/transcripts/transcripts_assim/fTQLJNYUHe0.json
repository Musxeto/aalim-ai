  "title": "Do we say Allahuakbar takbeer twice when rising up for the 3rd rakat",
  "transcript": "Bailey from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Sheikh I am confused I saw your prayer video but I'm still confused after our second Sujood Insha Allah when we rise from Sujood and sit for Jalsa we should say Takbir when sitting up and we don't need to say Takbir when we stand up from Jalsa but if it is second Raka and we say Takbir when rising from Sujood and sit then say Tashahud then we stand up we should say Takbir again is that right first of all you have to differentiate between what is Sunnah action in Salat and what is a pillar so in your first scenario when I'm in the first Raka did my two prostrations and want to stand up to my second Raka according to the Hadith of Malik Ibn al-Huwairith may Allah be pleased with him the Prophet used to sit a small short pause then stand up so this short pause is a Sunnah if you don't do it no problem therefore you do not offer to Takbir the moment you rise raise your head from Sujood and you sit you say Allahu Akbar and then you stand up only one Takbir in the second scenario in the second Raka after I do my prostrations I sit for Tashahud, At-Tahiyyatu lillahi wa s-salawatu wa at-tayyibat when I rose from the second Sujood prostration to sit for Tashahud I said Allahu Akbar and I did At-Tahiyyatu lillahi now if I want to stand to the third Raka that's a pillar here I have to say Allahu Akbar again because the first Takbir was to sit for a mandatory act of Salat which is Tashahud sitting to it then the second Takbir was to rise to a third to a pillar of the Salat which is standing up for the third Raka."
