  "title": "If I pray ONE rakah of a salah before its time ends Does it count as praying on time assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the prophet said and I quote whoever catches up with a Ruck of fuder prayer before the sun rises has CAU up with fuder and whoever catches up with a Ruck of user prayer before the sun sets has caught with user end quote shik what I wanted to ask you today was would this same principle apply to other prayers for example if someone prays one R of D before the time for D expires or if someone manages to pray one rqa of mug before the time for mug expires or finally someone praised one Ruck of Isha before the time for Isha expires what each and any of these prayers count the answer is yes if you manage to pray one full unit one full ra of a prayer before the time expires then you have prayed the prayer on time so if you manage to pray a full ra with one and two and you stand up this is a full a fledged raak then your prayer has been offered at the time uh um even if the time expires when you are at the second ra and this is cascaded to all five prayers and Allah Knows Best"
