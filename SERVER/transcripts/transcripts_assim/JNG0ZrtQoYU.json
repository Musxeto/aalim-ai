  "transcript": "says that we um a couple got married and when they got married they did not pray and afterwards the wife started practicing and she invited her husband to pray and he started praying so do do they need to renew the contract the answer is no because they were muslims when they got married they were not labeled as disbelievers they were not confirmed to be disbelievers so the default says that they're muslims sinful yes committing major sins yes but if it were it was proven that they were apostates or disbelievers or did not believe in salat or in the quran they were kafir and they got married yes we say we they have to renew their marriage but by default just not by not by praying we cannot say that they are by default kafir until we look in why they did not pray maybe they were randomly praying every now and then it all depends so i see that there is no need for that"
