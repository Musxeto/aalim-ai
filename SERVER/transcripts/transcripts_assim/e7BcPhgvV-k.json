  "title": "Must we only 'waste time' AFTER we have done all the work for the day?",
  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu All the work I want to do before I can do time-wasting, like playing football, working out, talking with my friends. So I have to do everything I want to do in a day, like the works and studies, or you can do that anytime. Why? Why? What is binding you to do these things before you work out or play football? Did you take an oath? No, I thought these things are wasting time, so before you waste time, you have to do all the things. No, no, this is not true. As long as these are halal things that entertain you, there is no problem inshaAllah in doing them moderately, while at the same time ensuring that your obligations are fulfilled as well."
