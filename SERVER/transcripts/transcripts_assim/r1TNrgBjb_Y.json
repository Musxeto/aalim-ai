  "transcript": "Uh omdman she says is it permissible to visit the dead sea and stay there a while to benefit from it as some people said that this is not permissible this is an issue of dispute among scholars and to put it in a nutshell those among the scholars which are a lot of them those who say that the dead sea is actually the place that allahel tormented and punished the village of Sudum, which is uh the village that used to do homosexuality and and allahel punished them with three or four different punishments unlike any other previous parished nations. They were uplifted to the heavens with J uh uh Jabriel's uh uh tip of his wing. And then there was this loud cry and there was this shiver and that they were turned upside down and thrown onto earth. So many punishment to show the severity of their sin. And this is mentioned in the Bible the old and in the new testament. So it's not something that Islam says or Islam is against homosexuality.

The prophet goes on to sayam and if you must there's no other way you have to go through then you have to do it as quick as possible and do not and and and be fearful and try to fake crying because you're afraid of something similar happening to you. Having said that, the prophetam also when he passed by that place, he ordered his companions not to drink from the well of that uh uh parish nation or of that uh place that the torment of allahel fell upon. And if they had made dough, they should feed the dough to their camels and not to eat from that because it was made from that water of the well. So likewise, scholars say the Dead Sea has the same ruling. Some scholars say no, it's not the it's not the place where the village of uh uh Loot was there and it's not the tormented uh area. But the majority say it is. So to be on the safe side, just to stay away from any difference of opinion, you should not go to that place and you should not use the products of"
