  "transcript": "sh sometimes we feel lazy to pray Salah sometimes there are too many questions whispering in our minds like why Allah need us to pray what's the point of praying Salah how Salah benefits me in this worldly life sh Allah instructed us to pray Salah so we pray but apart from this are there any intelligence psychological or notable reasons to pra I mean how can we ignore such laziness and Whispers ignoring such Whispers would be by identifying whether they are from shatan or from an angel and definitely anyone with his sound mind would identify that this is from Satan Satan is trying to mess up your religion to mess up your head so that you would be with him in Hell Fire on the day of judgment as long as you are a Muslim and you've submitted your will to Allah it doesn't matter what's the logic behind this or that because once you start looking for the logic you may succeed in finding 99% justification for everything in Shar this one little percent is what Satan banks on he utilizes it to get you out of the fold of Islam so you say I found 99% justifications now this 1% I failed this means it's illogical I'm not going to accept it I'm going to reject it and now you're rejecting the religion of Allah so this is not how Muslims roll we Muslims go with the flow go with the Quran go with the Sunnah whether we find the justification or not we believe like Abu Bak may Allah be pleased with him said why was he named the one who believes because when the prophet sallallah alai wasallam went on the miraculous night Journey from Mecca to Jerusalem to the seventh heaven back to Jerusalem back to Mecca in few minutes or hours where the journey from Mecca to Jerusalem took one month in a caravan and he did this in few moments of time the idol worshippers could not believe it so they went to Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him trying to shake his Iman and they said didn't you hear what your friend said he said what did he say they said he claims that he traveled to Jerusalem and then to the seventh heaven and back to Jerusalem and back to Mecca in few moments Abu Bakr said he's telling the truth the idol worshippers were shocked what do you mean he's telling the truth said guys I believe that Allah reveals the Quran from the seventh heaven to him don't you want me to believe something like that this is nothing Allah is capable of doing it this is true conviction and Iman that we all have to embrace"
