  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] uphold the truth choose to always be in the light and let us never dwell in darkness receive the light and always seek for the light the best of you who learn the quran and teaches it and this is why once we learn it's an obligation that we share what we learn with others stands out in the sense that it calls lecturers scholars and students of knowledge from all over the world to come and convey the message and to educate their congregation with the authentic information from the quran and the sunnah once again and welcome back to the straight path convention 2021 with our theme this year be steadfast for those of you brothers and sisters who just joined us this is in fact the first time ever that the straight path convention will be held online so it does feel a bit strange to call it a convention because i'm in the comfort of my bedroom but alhamdulillah we we are grateful that allah azzawajal grants us this nevertheless so once again we'd like to thank all the brothers and sisters who are the paid participants and it's because of your contributions that you made this event possible alhamdulillah and for this talk alhamdulillah we have sheikh al-hakim alhamdulillah once again joining us for the straight path convention has been a regular speaker at the straight path since 2016 every year he's been joining us uh of course with the exception of last year when we didn't have our face-to-face convention so alhamdulillah this will be the fifth time that the sheikh will join us on the straight path convention so brothers and sisters without without further delay let us welcome with a topic of the next topic of our talk are we as an ummah embracing immorality and corruption let us welcome s it is a fact that we are meeting from long distances so i'm here in saudi arabia tens of my thousands of kilometers away from kuala lumpur from malaysia but the people of malaysia are in my heart their cousins and i have the straight path to drink my coffee from just to show you how much i'm related to the straight path invention now the prophet allah has been given the concise of speech so few words of him you can write books explaining because of the richness and power and he is the one who said ali salat was there is nothing dearer to allah than dua so dua has a great status in islam that we should pay a lot of attention to having said that if you look at the dua of the prophet indeed it would be the best thing to call allah with because this is what the prophet saw used to do so when you call allah azzawajal through the duas of the prophet you're hitting the nail on the head you can't miss your way to jannah and in imam muslims sahih abdullahi masrud may allah be pleased with him said that the prophet used to say so this is not a one-shot dua rather he frequently used to ask allah by saying allah for words that collects the goodness of this life and the hereafter the prophet asks allah azzawajal for these four things and seldom you will find any of us asking allah for them o allah i ask you guidance piety chastity and wealth this can be interpreted into self being self-sufficient or actual money now each one of these four categories require a lecture of its own but we will talk about something that is relevant to our conference and that is chastity what is chastity chastity has been defined in different ways generally speaking they all revolve around the same meaning so it is to refrain from haram anything that is prohibited to refrain from anything that does not befit a muslim to refrain from anything that would incriminate you in this life or in the hereafter whether by rhetoric or by actions to control your human urges your desires your lust and harness it with the harness of sharia so this is in general the meaning of chastity and a muslim cannot be chaste until he is chased with his glimpse chased with his tongue chased with his eyes chased with his ears so being chased with your eyes and this is a big topic is by not looking at haram and by not desiring what others have and you don't chastity in your here that you do not listen to haram such as music you do not spy you do not engage in backbiting etc chastity in your limbs in your hands that you do not act over things that may make you fall into haram by touching by walking by participating chastity of the things that are all involved the tongue the ears the the eyes and the limbs this is a combination but this is not what we're going to talk about because it's more specific we have to focus a little bit more so generally speaking the purity of the heart the purity of the soul preventing oneself from falling into haram this is chastity allah says in the quran it is he who has sent among the unlittered the illiterate that is the arabs he sent a messenger from themselves to do what reciting to them his verses and purifying them so the role of the prophet is to profi purify us purify us from what to encourage them to do good moral conduct and prohibiting them to do bad things and this is what the prophet said allah sent merely to complete moral conduct good moral conduct to complete which means that it existed before that so when he came all what he needed was to patch things here and there and the prophet highlighted the importance of moral conduct and good ethics by saying i was merely sent meaning that it is so great among the things that islam calls for that as if this is the most important thing it's like when the prophet says aslam hajj is arafa but we know that hajj is more than arafat but is the main event like when the prophet says invoking allah is worship though we know that worship is prayer zakat etc but the prophet is highlighting this so the prophet tells us that he was merely sent to complete moral conduct to perfect the system of morality in islam and chastity is an essential part of our religion and this is something that a lot of us may not know and a lot of us may fail to call the disbelievers to islam through that so jaffa be taught me allah the cousin of the prophet when he was sent and migrated to abbasid when the king summoned them to ask them about why they are in his country he said to him allah sent to us a messenger from among ourselves whose lineage honesty trustworthiness and chastity we knew well these are the highlights of islam and hercules when he summoned abu sufyan and at the time may allah be pleased with him was mushrik so he summoned him to ask him about this man who was sent to them and being a mushrik he did not lie he said the truth so hercules or the byzantine ruler said to abu sufyan after the interrogation was over or the interview you call it whatever you want he said to him i ask you what he enjoins upon you that is the prophet was he enjoined upon you and you said that he enjoins you to worship allah and not as to associate anything else with him and he forbids you to worship idols and he enjoins you to pray give charity and remain chased look at the heights then this ruler said if what you say is true then he will gain surely dominion over the place where these two feet of mine are standing and he was right islam conquered the whole area until date it's a muslim land occupied by the jews may allah curse them but inevitably it will come back to us the prophet allah used to invoke allah for what for money for better health he used to ask allah azza for purification and to be chased he used to say o allah grant my soul its piety was it and purify it purify my soul you the best one to purify it and if you have a pure and chaste soul this is a glad tiding that you will be among the people of jannah the prophet gave this glad tiding to women by the way because women are an essential part of preserving the chastity of this earth i know women are saying oh now this uh uh male chauvinist sheikh is blaming us again these are the feminists but the muslim women won't say this what is that tithing the prophet said allah when a woman prays her five fatal prayers and fasts her ramadan and preserves her chastity and obeys her husband she will be addressed on the day of judgement enter paradise from any door you wish from any gate you want four things among them is preserving her chastity and being chased is the characteristics of the prophets of allah look at yusuf peace be upon him yuri is in the quran every day he said o my lord to be imprisoned to be thrown in jail is more beloved to me than what they are calling me to and they're calling him to sin so the arabs though pre-islamic era they were ko far they were mushriks they had a very high amount and level of morality compared to other women oh what they'll expect don't sue me compared to other nations and how is that you see women of again i'm talking about women i'm i'm making a mistake between women and nations to show you how much i value women i consider them to be nations nations mistreated women before islam and until recently for example the chinese law considered women to be worthless in the greek law demosthene says we take he's talking about himself the greeks we take prostitutes for lust concubines for our daily health and wives to bear our legitimate children this is how they look at women this is how they consider women in the 5th century in makon christian convention they gathered to discuss whether a a woman is a body without a soul or she has a soul like men in france the country that prohibits hijab and nihab in year 586 a.d they also we're debating whether women are humans or not and they came to the conclusion that she was created to serve men and if you look at a greek civilization as they call it take a tour in rome and look what they praise most you will find everywhere you go that they used to praise human lust and desire that was closer to the animals than humans all what you see are sculptures of nude women of nude men private parts displayed in a repulsive fashion and the children look at it and consider it as art you can see how civilized they were when you see the art the colosseums when you see the music the plays the drawings it most probably reached it peak just before the destruction and the fall of the greek and the roman empire why is that this is a sign from allah azzawajal that no nation that would share the same art quote unquote the same lack of chastity except that it will be destroyed as they were destroyed listen to this beautiful ayah in chapter 17 islam whenever we intend allah says whenever we intend to destroy a society we command its elite to obey allah but they act rebelliously in it so the decree of punishment is justified and we destroy it utterly look around you who is the most civilized in arts music theater movies tv media hollywood the destruction is coming from allah not from me alhamdulillah bollywood and now in nigeria they have nollywood i don't know what else we will see in the future but this is what's happening around us in the whole world not only against the muslims this is mainstream this is something that was planned decades ago and it's bearing its fruits at the moment the jews have a great role in it the head of such movements are all from the jews whether in hollywood whether in the music industry whether in the film industry whether in anywhere the jews are having a footprint that is obvious to all and their attempt to spread in the world sins desires lust nudity homosexuality the way they are targeting the whole world to legitimize l g b t q x y z and whatever comes afterwards they are forcing it down the throat of everybody and unfortunately some muslim countries are recognizing them and why is all of this is happening allah told us in the quran and the quran is our constitution this is our roadmap if we follow it we reach salvation jannah if we fail to do so we are doomed allah says allah wants to accept your repentance but those who follow their passions want you to digress into a great deviation this is the quran so if you look around you will find not only the muslims the whole world is being stripped of its morality the whole world is being deprived from any means of chastity and this shows you how efficient the enemies i wouldn't say of islam the enemies of humanity are in a survey done a few years ago by islam q a you all know the famous website they said that there are more than 40 million program chronographic website in different languages and that was a few years ago now it may be it's doubled 68 of the youth 18 percent of the females watch pornography once every week twenty percent of those addicted to such filthy websites watch it even during work 35 of downloads are porn material in the whole world 35 more than one third of what's being downloaded to people's laptops and pdas and mobiles is probably uh chronographic pornographic whatever who cares every second 28 000 persons are visiting porn sites every second of the day 28 000 are visiting and one third of this number the 28 000 are women and if you focus a little bit on the muslim countries imagine among the first 10 countries on the list of countries searching for the word sex in search engines the first ten countries six of them are islamic countries four of them are arab countries what does this tell you we have the best and perfect system but the muslims are not abiding by it they're falling in the pit hole that shaytan has dug for them this immorality and corruption is like quicksand the more you move the more you sink until you drown and die now we are less than let's say three weeks almost from ramadan the month that the masters of the jinn are cuffed and tied so in this month the gates of paradise are open and the gates of hell are closed are we safe in ramadan you find that the satellite chance the corrupt satellite channels they are racing who can deviate the muslims more than the other in one of the largest countries of the muslim world in arabia the budget reached over 300 million dollars for production of soap operas in ramadan alone with the wages of an actor reaching four million dollars one of the most popular and most famous arab satellite channel that used to produce masha'allah rumors series and islamic series they used to display and show 10 hours every single day of ramadan with these soap operas 90 percent of the advertisements on such a channel depends on women and 50 percent of the advertisements not only depend on women depend on the body of the women through scenes that are inappropriate and sometimes really direct if you look at these soap operas what we call an arabic musl series you will find that it praises immorality it fights chastity it shows sexual explicit scenes dancing nudity inappropriate clothes seductive moves sins and fornication nightclubs homosexuality profanity exposing topics that should be are rated and not for the family encouraging having illicit relationship out of the ma of the institution of marriage they even promote in some of their series incest haram relationship between mahram's they encourage like a piece of cake infidelity and women cheating on their husbands and husbands cheating on their wives in a survey done by an academic dr malikal ahmed about the programs shown in ramadan 22 series 22 soap operas only displayed in ramadan he came with this statistics 3100 sexual seductive nudity and inappropriate sexual jokes were displayed 3100 in ramadan 135 seductive and erotic scenes 223 scenes including profanity violence and torture 328 scenes showing in ramadan the consumption of intoxicants drugs and huka or what they call as hubli bubbling 76 scenes in ramadan and these are only 22 series not the whole program 76 scenes were insulting and insulting islam directly so when we come and visualize these statistics and try to figure out how many of it do we have in our homes we are stunned by the amount of it and not talking about arabia we're talking about malaysia we're talking about indonesia we're talking about muslims in america in europe how are they managing to grow chastity in their own chests not only that but in their children's chest how is it possible that we rise with the individual so that the whole ummah rises up with him and be able to be saved from this destructive illness that destroyed the nations before us and that will destroy the current nations well it is difficult but this is what allah azzawajal ordered us to do and follow and this is the only way to survive and to be saved because life is a test so if we want to be saved from such immorality and such corruption we need to revive allah's piety in fear in our hearts we have to observe allah azzawajal whether in public or in secret we have to fear allah's punishment because at the end of the day you and i are either going to heaven or to hell so it's a serious issue it's your choice that defines you if we fail to instill this in our own hearts that we have to fear allah if we fail to acknowledge that before i look to something allah azzawajal sees it before me so don't make allah azzawajal the least you care to be watching you in order for us to make it and survive we have to learn how to lower our gaze and this by allah is one of the most difficult things to do especially in our societies i am a sheikh and i get on the mobile inappropriate messages some of the muslims who are practicing just because i joke a lot they think that oh the sheikh is not genuine oh the sheikh is like us and maybe i am worse than you but there is a limit some of the brothers what they do is you find them sending you inappropriate pictures inappropriate videos and i talked to the brothers what are you doing you're a muslim you're a practicing muslim and you're sending me clips like this of women and some of it of nudity and some of them sexual content what is this yeah if you were to send it to a normal person maybe sending it to a share means that we have a problem i remember in the uk about eight years ago before they banned me i used to go five six times a year and alhamdulillah my visits were usually useful and fruitful for the community one day a brother picked me up to go to a conference i think or to to a lecture and while we were driving we passed by an ad for a movie and the guy was laughing and said oh oh well like this movie did you see hangover too i said what the heck what do you mean he said the the then he realized um uh the movie they say they say it's very funny and i said we are muslims even if we watch things on our own we never expose our sins how is it possible that these things are becoming normal so lowering your gaze is extremely important in our religion to the extent that allah azza mentioned it in the quran allah says tell the believing men to lower their gaze and guard their private parts that is pure for them indeed allah is fully aware of what they do some of the brothers boast about it he said alhamdulillah allah grant me this eyesight it takes me one second to look at a woman and i can tell you her measurements and he's happy what are you doing you're boasting about something that is sinful so we have lowered our guard so low that shaytan is is now overwhelming us and we don't know it among things that would save us from such immorality is to stay away from places of fitna to stay away from things that would provoke your desires your sexual desires from erotic places to stay away from mixing with women who are or being alone with women who are non-mahraan whether this is in transportation or places of learning university schools or places of work and as if i can hear 95 percent of the population saying oh no no sure this is not possible why everybody says well sheikh you know universities are mixed workplace are mixed etcetera who owns the workplace muslims who owns the universities muslims the schools muslims when people push others to phoenix they have an agenda their agenda is we don't want chastity we want free mixing we want illicit and haram relationships no problem if a woman conceives of haram out of wedlock this is good for the business good for tourism good for this good for that but it is bad for your it is bad wallahi for your dunya because allah would not order you to do something except in it the best of everything in this life and the hereafter yet some of us tend to go to these places of fitna to these places of sexual desires and lust how much time do we do you as an individual spend on snapchat instagram youtube facebook i wouldn't say twitter because usually twitter doesn't have any of these things all what you see are images inappropriate haram yet men and women are addicted to watching the profile of a famous singer or a an actress or etc watching their profile pictures and following their videos tick-tock muslims do this this means that they are deteriorating really fast in order to save our community our ummah we must encourage early marriage we have to support it most countries now limit the age of marriage to 18 and some to 21. why is that i ever thought of it if a girl comes to me and i've seen this girls come to me saying i'm 14 years of age i'm 15 years of age i want to get married i fear fitna there is fitness everywhere i don't want to fall into haram i want a halal relationship i get people in high school 17 18 years of age who are capable of getting married financially and they say sheikh this is too much for us we want to get married before we fall into haram and this is what the prophet ordered us all youth whoever has the ability financially and physically to get married he must get married so we are encouraged to do this no no no no no laws prohibited why oh because a girl was married she was 15 years of age and she was abused and blah blah blah one out of a hundred thousand so you're making 99 999 000 suffer for this are you nuts but people don't want to think like this it is simon says not what allah azza says or what the prophet salallahu sallam says ramadan is approaching and it is one of the best training courses to gain chastity so if you strive in allah's cause allah would lead you to his way and when you try your level best in ramadan to boycott all types of social media especially those that you away from allah and you know what makes you tick so you have to block yourself delete your accounts in order to repent to allah and the best time to do this is now and ramadan is approaching among the things that would help us a lot in surviving and protecting ourselves is good company and i never ever stop emphasizing the importance of good company the prophet said a wolf attacks only a stray sheep which means that shaytan attacks only someone who is not with the congregation with not is not with the jamaa does not have good companions to hang out with he's a loner once you're a loner shaytan has power over you and has control over you among the best thing things to do in order to protect yourself from such fitna is dua the prophet's dua allah is available everywhere the most dua that he used to frequently repeat allah of hearts make my heart steadfast on your religion because we are in great danger wallahi i know friends colleagues famous people guys long beards masha'allah talking about salafi spreading the sunnah of the prophet sallam who flipped who changed who think that they have evolved when they had deteriorated so i do not ever trust my heart and i need to invoke allah azzawajal and you need to ask allah azzawajal like the prophet used to say allah it rains in kuala lumpur trains like dogs and cats masha allah invoke this is time of answering raise your hands and ask allah azzawajal to make you steadfast in islam to make your heart steadfast on islam to protect you from all types of immorality and corruption and your children and your loved ones invoke allah expressing your humility your poverty and you need because no one can do that for you except allah azzawajal you should also do a lot of voluntary deeds because when we do a lot of voluntary deeds allah loves us and when allah loves us we see through allah we hear through allah we do all our actions through allah in a way that pleases him we at the moment extremely need to upbring our girls our own daughters our own sisters our own wives to bring them up on being shy and bashful nowadays in the west you would never ever hear anybody promoting being shy or bashful rather they encourage their daughters from an early age to dance to sing to behave in a fashion that does not befit their age you have beauty pageants for five or six years old girls what do you expect these girls are going to grow up to be when they're 16 they lose their virginity when they're 11 or 10 in america and this is a well-known fact to anyone this is how the society is when you don't have any shyness or bashfulness we have to bring our children to become chased at a very early age we have to dress our girls modestly i know a family their girl from three or four years of age used to wear underneath her dress a long trousers we call it sarawili the white leggings like and the girl grew up now she's like nine years of age and she never she's never seen without these leggings that protect her chastity and not reveal her legs though she's young she's a child but this is what her parents chose to bring her up to be and at an early age it's very easy when you have a twig that is ripe and wet you can fix it as you wish but when the twig is dry any type of fixing would break it and we have to upbring our children boys and girls upon religion upon to hate and upon chastity we have to ensure that in our houses in our homes our women abide by morality by chastity by moral conduct and high standard of ethics i feel ashamed when boys or girls call me on my counseling sessions and say to me that my mom sits with us her children wearing shorts and sometimes wearing very see-through clothes i don't know what to do she's my mother but i i feel embarrassed to look at her and i get these whispers of shaytan this is found in many muslim homes a real practicing righteous couple they walk the talk in their homes they are as they are out of their homes they abide by islam and if we manage to do this we will be the ummah the best um that was presented to mankind to humanity to the worlds wallahim that he saves us and protect us from all types of fitan from all types of tribulations intestines and calamities i pray to allah azzawajal that he grants our children to be among the chaste and to be among the steadfast on islam i pray to allah azzawajal that he shows us the plans of our enemies against us that allah exposes the hypocrites who are putting their hands in the hands of the the enemies of islam so that we can know who to fight and how to fight them for the enlightenment on how we as an ummah are indirectly embracing immorality and may allah azzawajal grant us chastity to guard our iman and god our honor and may allah azzawajal grant us the patience to raise our children in that manner i mean"
