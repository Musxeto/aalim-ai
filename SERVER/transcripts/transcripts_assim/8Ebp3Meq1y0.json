  "transcript": "And Iqanol from Nigeria. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. I've read an ad where one Sahaba looked at another and they fell. I just want to know, with regards to evil eye, does the person have to look at the other person physically or can it transcend through time and space? I do not understand your question Iqanol. Okay, so my question is that there's a... Okay, I'm saying there's a particular hadith on evil eye, where one Sahaba looked at another and he fell to the ground. So my question now is, for evil eye, does the person have to look at another person or can it transcend through time and space? Okay, the most authentic opinion is that it has to be direct. So the hadith of Sahl ibn Hanif, may Allah be pleased with him, when he got the evil eye, it was from the companion looking at him directly. Which means that if a person looks at a photograph on your Instagram, would that have an impact? The most authentic opinion is that it would not, because it's not direct. But you never know what can happen. However, if you see something, whether it's direct or indirect, you say, Allahumma barik. But to be haunted by the idea that, whoops, somebody's going to look at me and give me evil eye and this. Akhi, if you're observing your adhkar in the morning, in the evening, after Fard Salat, before you go to bed, before you leave the house, inshallah, you are protected."
