  "transcript": "uh Shahid from India I expect my question is that if a person lives in an area where the Masjid is not within his feet it's extremely far but he has the intention and he gets to go to the museum but since the malays are not within his reach he cannot go but Yani Allah knows that he if the Masters was within his reach he would have brought so believe me if I understand your question correctly though your line broke at the end and again I'm not sure this is our internet or your internet um the question is I live far away from the Masjid and it's too far for me to reach however I have this strong earning for attending the Salat but it's not feasible at all would I be rewarded the answer is yes Allah will reward you for your intention to be there and though and due to the fact that this is not possible due to the distance due to the means you have Allah will grant you the reward according to your religion alhamdulillah"
