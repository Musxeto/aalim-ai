  "transcript": "weird uh I have a interesting question Chef I wanted to ask like uh sometimes uh you want to go and make prayers with Jama and you people are praying and maybe they are they are already maybe a doctor and they are almost finishing so you have maybe to make it uh with them and maybe you feel like taking out air like or something like that can you hold it and make the prayer with them or should you release there and then make you do again and you're fearing You're Gonna Miss pajama with the with a mom you know so you did not you did not join them yet I did not join them yet but you know I feel like taking out air and I don't want to and is this something that's happening frequently or once in a blue moon uh it happens uh once in a blue moon but some when it starts you know it can go the whole day you know okay I will answer inshallah so the issue is the prophet Allah prohibited us from attending the prayer when the food is served or we are suppressing answering the call of nature and why is that because the essence of Salat is to contemplate to have submissiveness and to concentrate on it so that you would taste its sweetness and benefit from it if you're agitated because you need to answer the call of nature but you're suppressing it or you're starving and the food is served and you're praying while thinking of the food and you can hear your uh stomach making weird sounds this defies the purpose of Salat so the prophet says no answer your call of nature it's going to take a few minutes then attend the prayer if it's gone no problem pray on your own or with the second congregation likewise with the food eat until you don't feel starved or so eager to consume the food so your mind is free from thinking about how tasty the food is and pray and in your case if you're suppressing the urge to release gas or to release wind if it is so overwhelming to the point where you feel that if you pray it's not going to be a good prayer you're going to be agitated and so preoccupied with it in this case we say no go release whatever need this needs to be released and perform wudu and come and pray whatever is still there remaining or make a new Jamara or pray on your own because this is once every move once every blue moon however if you feel that you can suppress it because it's not something of urgency it's something that's within control and you can suppress it and still enjoy the prayer in this case we tell you do suppress it"
