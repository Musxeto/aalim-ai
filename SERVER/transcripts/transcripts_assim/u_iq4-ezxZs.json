  "title": "Two witrs in one night in the same Masjid & giving Zakat ul Fitr in your home country-Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "ah Kayla's question is about a Masjid where they have taraweeh and in the last 10 nights they have to hedge it later on so he says that in tella we we pray like 20 rockets or a trackers either one and then the Imam goes back and the adven or his deputy comes in and he prays three Rocca's Witter however after 3-4 hours at night the Imam comes back again and leads us in prayer and then prays with her first of all what the Imam and his deputy are doing is totally wrong because it is not permissible to perform to whitter at the same night and by the more Advan or his deputy leading the congregation and offering whitter this should mean that this prayer is over because it is not the masjid of the imam it is the message of the person who's leading it so for example in the harem we have three or four imams leading night prayer each one of them or all of them are considered to be one and this is why we offered a witcher at the very end with the last one though three preceded him therefore what's being done is wrong what to do as an individual i would highly recommend that you pray with them Oh Advent the three raka whitter when he offers salaam you stand up and pray an additional raka so now the total is even numbers and then you pray with her with the imam at the end of the night Shahji says we live in canada but can we give our fat rana I think she is referring to the cattle cutter to Pakistan the answer is yes you can relocate your zakat or footer in Pakistan but it has to be given before the Eid prayer in Canada so you give it on the 27th 28th 29th giving it after the 8 prayer in your country that would not suffice"
