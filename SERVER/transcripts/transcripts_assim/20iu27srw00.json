  "transcript": "a black man is asking his first question was about how our righteous predecessors used to deal with the Koran in Ramadan if you go to their biographies and to the seer of these righteous predecessors of the self you'll find wonders and you'll find that their focus was a lot on the Koran where did they get this from they got it from the hadith of even a best may Allah be pleased with a man with his father that every Ramadan gibreel would revise the Quran with the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam so every single Ramadan gibreel would come sit with the Prophet as Salam and the Prophet would revise the Quran recited and gibreel would listen to it from the Prophet as some to ensure that his memory of it is perfect except for the last Ramadan gibreel memorized the Quran twice with the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam so the scholars stated that if this was done by the Prophet ELISA lapsim it should be done by us as a any default and this is why you find that a lot of the companion of the set of such as Malik Imam Shafi Abu Hanifa remember much of an authority Sophia Nina the line number all their life biographies you will find that when it was Ramadan they would put aside the books of knowledge such as hadith firk there wherever they were writing and only focus on the Quran and you have stories that shows you how dedicated they were to reciting the Quran as one would recite it once a day maybe twice a day the full Quran which is way beyond our comprehension understanding however this does not mean a all that we do not engage in something else especially for you and I about the ramen we as humans get to get bored quickly so even if someone is playing a computer game after some time his board he changes it someone will inaudible ah may Allah protect us who who watches a movie afterwards his fed up he goes and watches a comedy show or a stand-up or whatever so by nature and there is no comparison none what to whatsoever between the Quran and all this nonsense yet this is human nature so yes focus on reciting the Quran if you feel a bit tendency to become slow in what you're doing and you're not that enthusiastic there's no problem in reciting or reading the tafseer which is related to the Quran and as the man said what about father al-quran the virtues of the Quran found in sahih al-bukhari which is a hadith no problem if you read something in the serie of the Prophet a little of Salaam or in fact or q and A's or whatever all of this is accepted so that you refresh so you you go back to the Quran after an hour - with a fresh soul and you can enjoy and benefit from it much more so yes there's nothing in Islam that says restrict everything in Ramadan to the Quran otherwise the Prophet s term would not have asked mother Aisha to say in lailatul Qatar Aloha Monica who into Herbalife over for unnie he should have told her recite the Quran he would not be engaged in sadaqa and doing a lot of vicar and he would have just recited the Quran which apparently he did not alayhi salat WA Salam"
