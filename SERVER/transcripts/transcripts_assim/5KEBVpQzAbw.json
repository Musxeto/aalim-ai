  "title": "ðŸ†• Does a child break a row of a congregation? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mehwish says, does a child below the age of puberty break the Raw, break a Raw if he is praying in congregation with other adults? Is the Raw's prayer valid with the child being in it? The answer is yes. Don't pay attention to some of the school of thoughts that say if there are a Raw of adults and a child of seven or five years of age stands in between, then the Raw is broken and the prayer is invalid. This is all bogus. This is baseless. It has no credibility, none whatsoever. And this is unfortunately some of the flaws of these schools of thought. That they don't base their allegation on the Qur'an and the Sunnah and the words and understanding of the three favorite generations. Rather, they compile their verdicts over what some of the scholars of that school of thought may have said. And it has like a ripple effect. They built something on something someone said who built it on something that someone else had said without going back to the Qur'an and Sunnah, making up these weird verdicts that do not relate to the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Allah knows best."
