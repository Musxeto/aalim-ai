  "title": "How to clean different types of impurity, can we use only water or water + hand",
  "transcript": "Asim from the UK. My question is if there is some impurity on your arm for example, do you have to pour water on it so that the impurity runs off your arm with the water or is it sufficient to get some water in your hand and rub the area with that water in your hand? If this impurity is a drop of urine or something that is a liquid-like material, pouring water on it would be sufficient because this impurity is a drop or two and the water you're pouring on top of it is overwhelming it. And the most effective purifier on earth is water. And this is why when we make wudhu and when we remove impurities and when we perform ghusl, we don't use soap, we don't use detergents, we just pour water and that's it. Now if you want to clean more and have detergents just to or soap to remove any smell or something, this is up to you. But it's not part of ghusl or wudhu. So to answer your question, yes, pouring water would be sufficient if it's a liquid-like, but if it's a physical barrier or something that needs to be physically removed, pouring water would not suffice because it would remain, you can see it still, you have to remove it either by rubbing or scratching, scrubbing or whatever. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
