  "title": "Difference between Kahen (soothsayer) & Arraf (fortune teller)! Kufr / 40 days prayer void Assim",
  "transcript": "my question is what is the difference between al-qaeda okay so al-qaeda is can be translated as a priest or a monk or someone who is related to the jinn as a soothsayer araf comes from the word arafa to know so he pretends to know the unseen and to be a fortune teller and in general they're similar in their job description in general this is why the prophet said alaihis was whoever comes to a a cahin then 40 days of his prayers would not be accepted and or and whoever comes to ekkahin and he believes him then he has disbelieved in islam and what was revealed to prophet muhammad ali so they're similar they're both fortune tellers they're both pretending to know the unseen they both most likely have a connection from or with the jinn and all of these are acts of apostasy and takes them out of the fold of islam the problem is with those who go to them if you go to them and you don't believe them it's just for the fun of it you go to the circus and this old woman has a crystal ball and she tells you about what's going to happen and you just go just for the fun of it you know that she's a liar this renders 40 days of prayer invalid unaccepted but if you go and you believe one thing of what she had said or someone who reads your palm or someone who reads the sand tracks and traces and tells you that on that day this and that will happen and it happens of course he tells you a hundred lies and none of them happens but this particular thing sticks in your subconscious so when it happens this is what he said he was right this takes you out of the fold of islam to believe in that may allah protect us all you"
