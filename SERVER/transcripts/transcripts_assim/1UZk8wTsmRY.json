  "transcript": "Ashiq from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh when my father was alive, he bought two houses in the name of my two elder brothers My first brother is physically challenged so he got a larger property compared to second brother And there is no property registered in my father's name My father used and received rent from the house while he was alive So is my inheritance nothing because my father has no property in his name or should I ask from my brother's property? Akhidist is dependent on the fact whether your father Registered it for legal Purposes to evade taxes or to evade any other thing That prevented him from registering it in his own name If this is the fact and Everyone knows that he did not sell it to your two brothers And he did not give it to your two brothers in this case. Yes, you do have right of inheritance in these two properties however, if your two brothers don't fear Allah and Legally the properties are in their name and you tell them that These are my father's property I have a share in it and they don't fear Allah They don't fear the torment of the grave. They don't fear hellfire They don't believe in it to begin with What can you do? Legally, you cannot take them to court because you have no proof and you cannot address them or advise them or admonish them Because they don't believe they don't care in this case make dua to Allah Azza wa Jal to compensate you for the money they stole from you, which is your God-given right and Move on with your life, but be certain that Allah would not leave them alone those who steal like this or Utilize things in the law To their advantage while knowing deep down That they are thieves and crooks Don't be fooled It's matter of time Allah's torment to you is coming whether it's in the form of an Illness a chronic disease cancer Whether it is in your children who are disobedient or who go astray prostitution drugs crime or in the lack of peace and tranquility and the continuous fighting and Discord and bickering between the spouses and the family and the whole thing is is busted and corrupt and this is a portion of what until they Wait awaits them in their graves and then in hellfire on the day of judgment. May Allah protect us You"
