  "title": "Praying while commuting - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "brother Mohammad he travels over 100 kilometers a day again question can he make jam can he join his solos well if he is traveling then he can join prayers and he can shorten them but unfortunately for brother and those who are alike him who commute daily it's not the distance it's what they're actually doing so even if you commute 150 kilometres you work and you come back 150 kilometers and this is the case in Europe for example lots of the people live in the suburb of of London and they commute by train approximate distance the scholars say that this is not considered to be traveling because if someone calls you at your home and says where is chef jameel they will say well he went to the office no one would say he travelled to the office so this is not considered as the customs of that city or that country to be traveling and you are working therefore you have to pray each prayer on on the designated time and you have to pray it fully"
