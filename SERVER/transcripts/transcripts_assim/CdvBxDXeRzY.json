  "transcript": "so if one maybe intends to maybe organize the family but maybe in a car or maybe a willima or maybe a living ceremony or any event at all and one was to you know make it as a islamically compliance when it comes to segregation so um my question is what's the best way to go about is it you know it's um having a single half and where we have the meals and maybe meals in the front the females at the back on two separate holes and how what is the best you know way to go about making events as Islamic as a complaint as possible in the Masjid the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that the best Rose of men is the first and the worst Rose of men is the last and the best rows of women is the last and the worst rows of women is the first so the last and the first rows of men and women are the worst because of their a proximity and being close to one another and you don't have to be a rocket scientist to understand that Islam promotes endorses and encourages the segregation of the genders it's the best situation for men to be away from women and for women to be away from Men any Community or Society you have men mixing with women you'd have children born out of wedlock you'd have illicit Haram relationships you would have a very high rate of divorce among poverty depression and mental illnesses this is the norm or you would have free Haram relationships strip clubs orgies and exchanging of spouses and like so many places in the cafe world may Allah protect us and save us so for the betterment of the community whether people like it or not you have a walima you have a wedding simply make it segregated women are in their own whole waiters are not allowed in only waitresses no men are allowed in that Hall they can dance they can sing they can enjoy themselves privately women among women the men will have the same function of course they will not dance because this is an appropriate for men to do but they would gather Chit Chat socialize dine and leave to have them all in the same Hall is like putting fuel next to Fire and pray to Allah it would not ignite women are in full Arsenal makeup foundation perfume wearing their hair wearing the best attire even you would not recognize your wife if you see her there through damn who's this because she's a different person now putting them together is not proper or Islamic so if you want it to be Islamic this is how it should be done and Allah Knows Best"
