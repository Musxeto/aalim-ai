  "transcript": "today's value that we will discuss insha'Allah is one of our noble values of Islam our religion calls for it our prophet was the role model sallallahu alayhi wa sallam in doing it see in order to function correctly we have to live along side others we cannot live in isolation we have to mix we have to meet others we have to talk and this means that we will encounter a lot of the people who would make mistakes who will have shortcomings who will do things that may not appeal to us and in other cases it may cause us harm or discomfort it is not logical to interrogate every person about everything that he said or done it is not appropriate to question people what were their motives what was their intention because you cannot live like this people cannot tolerate you and the more you neglect or overlook others shortcomings the better person you are the higher in level in their eyes and the more praised you would be among the people now there is a difference between not being able to see something and this type of person is usually considered be a fool when he cannot see what is so apparent and people take him for a fool and there is a difference of noticing and knowing yet willingly and intentionally neglecting it simply because it's trivial it's not of importance my honor my pride and dignity reject the fact that I go down to this level and interrogate people and ask them why they did this this is why mmm Schaffer may Allah have mercy on his soul used to say a smart and intellectual and an intelligent person is the one who notices and ignores who's the one he's the one who does not pay attention and scrutinize things and others for their motives and intentions now this is found in the Quran and in the Sunna and in the stories of the cell of allah azza wajal says in the quran and remember when the prophet sallallaahu ylim confided one of his wives a statement so the Prophet Isis sallam told one of his wives a secret and when she informed another of it and Allah showed it to him he made known part of it and ignored a part and when he informed her about it she said who told you this he said I was informed by the knowing the acquainted Allah the Almighty so half Sami Allah be pleased with her the mother of the believers was told the secret by the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam but she told that issue about this secret when Allah revealed this to the Prophet Isis and he went and he sallallahu alehiwassallaam approached her he blamed her a bit but he did not disclose the whole thing that she told Ayesha only a part of it which shows that this is a characteristic of the noble people like wise use of peace be upon him Joseph when he was betrayed by his siblings thrown in a well in a well left to be dead after so many long years of hardship he became the aziz of egypt the ruler of egypt so they came to him asking for food and provision because of the famine that struck their land and he plotted so that he would take his younger brother into his custody and they were accused of stealing so they said if he steals that is the younger brother a brother of his there is Yusuf has stolen before and this is of course a false accusation now if you were in the shoes of Yusuf what would you do Yousuf as Allah says but Joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them again overlooking others shortcomings see this is the norm with noble people when you keep on blaming others reproaching them you will end up questioning everyone else and people would not like to be with you and in poetry the Arabs say it is not if the fool who leads his people he cannot be a master of his people but rather the master of the people is the one who pretends to be a fool he knows everything but he neglects it willingly the Prophet Allah salatu salam used to ignore a lot of similar remarks not stop and question and interrogate on every single incident"
