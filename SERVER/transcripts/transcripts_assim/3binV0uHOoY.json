  "title": "Shaytan cries when the son of Adam Prostrates? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Hameed from Nigeria. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. My question is, is the hadith of Abu Huraira authentic which says, when the son of Adam recites a verse of prostration and he prostrates, Satan withdraws and he weeps. Jazakallahu Khair. Wa Jazakum. Yes, the hadith is authentic. The Prophet ï·º said, when the son of Adam prostrates, Satan takes a side and cries and says, he was ordered to prostrate and he prostrated, so Allah forgives him. I was ordered to prostrate and I refused, so Allah condemned me to hellfire."
