  "title": "If my gold is below the nisab & cash is above, how to calculate, do I combine to reach the nisab?",
  "transcript": "Marilyn says if my gold jewelry is balonus up but the cash I have is above the nisab amount do I take only the value of cash into consideration when calculating the zakat or do I have to take both the value of the cash and gold into consideration an issue of dispute among scholars cash was not present at the time of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam so it is something new there was only gold and silver and this was the means of transactions and hence because Islam is a universal religion that accommodates all new topics until the day of judgment scholars looked into it and they said what is the purpose of gold and silver other than using it as jewellery they came to the conclusion that throughout time until recently before the existence of banknotes gold and silver was made as a means of exchange so that you set the value of things with gold and silver so you say that this car costs XYZ of gold that house equals so much this pan this sheep this crops equals so-and-so so people relate to the value when you tell them that so much grams of gold or silver is the value of such a thing nowadays banknotes the currency we have whether it is reals dinar dirham euros dollars etc these are the means of evaluating the value of something so if someone says my car is for sale and say how much you want for it if he tells me like twenty-five thousand apples I would not compute that but if it tells me it is like fifty thousand reals immediately I would know whether it's a good price or a bad price therefore scholars said that banknotes money currency is Zach a table exactly like gold and silver but what is the threshold where is the nisab what is the limit we're below it there is no zakat above it there is the cut on the whole thing is it gold or silver because the difference is huge so like gold is maybe eighteen thousand reals silver threshold is probably 2,000 plus reals almost nine times so the scholar said that it is best for the poor that we take the silver to be the threshold of there's a cat when it comes to currency and money another issue was can we combine gold to silver and silver to gold the threshold of gold is 85 grams of 24 karat gold and the threshold of silver is 595 grams of silver assume i had 80 grams of gold only is there any circuit irit answer is no as you might have 500 grams of silver only is there any circuit in it nope but if I have both 80 grams and 500 grams gold and silver can I combine them both because the value would be above the threshold the answer is no it is not mandatory and you're not supposed to do this why because Allah Azza WA JAL gave the threshold of each an individual or each specific category of its own so if I have four camels and 39 sheep one missing from each for the threshold I'm not supposed to combine them and give the cat there's no circuit in both if I have gold and silver that both do not reach the nisab I do not complete one with the other but and it's a w a bu T in a bold and underlined preferably capital letters but if I have cash or if I have merchandise that I trade with known as a root of T Challa commodities that I sell and buy a supermarket but a shop that I sell clothes in a pharmacy etc these are all the catapult items because I sell and buy if I have cash and these things then they must complete the threshold of gold or the threshold of silver I can't combine cash to gold or cash to silver but not cash but but not gold to silver or silver to gold therefore if you have 80 grams of gold and you have like 20,000 reels by default you give 2.5 on the gold you have because combined together it is above the threshold likewise if you have 50,000 reels and only 500 grams of silver you have to give the cut on the 500 gram silver because alongside with the cash it reaches the nisab and I hope this answers your question"
