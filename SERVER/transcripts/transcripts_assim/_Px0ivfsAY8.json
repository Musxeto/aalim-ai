  "transcript": "Ameena saying that which we have just Yanni read quickly till when should I continue to make dua I made dua for a couple of weeks couple months couple years and nothing happened and I've read that some prophets would make dua and on the spot they would be answered Subhan Allah you're not a prophet there therefore don't have that kind of expectation yet even prophets allah azzawajal may delay answering their door for example prophet Ayub peace be upon him he was tested by Allah a calamity that bestowed that was bestowed upon him where he had illnesses all over his body all of his family died except his wife and he became poor after being after being rich and he remained in this calamity for eighteen years one eight and then Allah Azza WA JAL restored all of his favours and blessing upon him and he was patient and Allah complimented him as being patient so you're not a messenger and definitely or not you have not been making dua for eighteen years secondly it is a big mistake then when we ask Allah for something we think that this is the best thing and either my way or the highway either it's gonna happen which means Allah loves me and favors me or it doesn't happen which means I'm cursed I'm jinxed Allah doesn't love me why does Allah hate me and such nonsense that people talk about and this is wrong I ask Allah Azza WA JAL for a beautiful car and Allah does not give me a car I shouldn't be sad because when I ask for something the Prophet told us in an authentic hadith alayhi salatu salam that allah azza wa jal gives us one of three answers us in one of three ways o Allah give me a car boom the car is in front of my house a gift from a brother a gift from work you know you never know this is one the second oh Allah give me a car Allah doesn't give me a car but it was predestined that there will come an illness that would put me in hospital and the hospital bill would be a hundred thousand reals exactly the amount of that car and allah azza wajal deflected that illness and it did not come to me i don't know that this was predestined it was going to happen to me but because i'm making dua Allah Azza WA JAL took it away from me number three oh allah grant me a car open the door there's no car outside look around there's no illness that was coming and it was deflected away then where is it well you'll find it on the day of judgment when it's the day of reckoning and you know that you have done X amount of good deeds but you will come and find X to the power of five or ten this is so Han Allah I didn't do all of this and Allah will tell you yes but you asked on that day for a car and it was stored for you as good deeds here on the day of judgment and this is what why the companion said prophet of Allah if this is the case then we will make a lot of dua Allah and the Prophet said or some Allah is even greater than that so you make dua and you will find it with the grace of Allah so you should not give up hope keep on making dua until it happens or you add much more to your good deeds on the day of judgement"
