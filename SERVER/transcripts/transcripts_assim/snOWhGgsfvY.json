  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is all right as the first start our we here ton night with family around a nice meal we're making do I I feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love oh and welcome to this new episode of Virtues of fasting and today inshallah we will begin to speak about voluntary fasting and some of the hadiths that the prophet encouraged Us in to offer these voluntary forms of fasting and the first Hadith is Hadith number 30 this Hadith was narrated by Abu Al may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet sallallah Alam was asked about fasting on the day ofafa which is the 9th of the month of he replied sallallahu alaih wasallam fasting on the day of araa is an experation for the preceding year and the following year he was also asked about fasting on the day of Ash which is the 10th of the month of muharam he replied fasting on the day of ashur is an experation for the preceding year the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam was also asked about fasting on Monday and he replied this is the day on which I was born and the day on which I was sent with The Message of Islam or the day on which I received Revelation and this Hadith was related by Muslim now in this Hadith the prophet Alat wasam is answering a question from a companion and this indicates to us that the companions may Allah be pleased with them were so keen on learning the knowledge and acquiring it from the prophet Alat so the prophet was asked about three days two days that come annually and one day that comes weekly so Ina orat and this is a location's name but also it has been given to the date as well so the day OFA is the ninth day of the 12th month in the Islamic calendar which is the month ofah this is where all the Pilgrims go and stay in that area of Mount arafa or around it supplicating and invoking Allah till sunset the prophet is highlighting the importance and the great reward in fasting arat so he says that it expiates the sins of two years the preceding and the following and when he W he was asked about the fasting of as the prophet saidat that Ash expiates the preceding year one year so Arafat is definitely more more rewarding at the S of Allah and more important than as now is everyone recommended and encouraged to fast Arafat the answer is yes with the exception of the pilgrims those who are on their pilgrimage it is not recommended for them to fast and this is what the prophet didat on the day of while he was on his camel he ordered them to bring him a cup of of milk and he drank it in front of all the pilgrims to indicate that he's not fasting and they shouldn't be fasting and why is that this is so that they would be more uh uh um or having more strength and energy to invoke Allah to recite the Quran to make vick the whole full day instead of feeling weary and tired and maybe falling asleep it's a day of utilizing your time to the full and to the max and it is permissible for some pilgrims to fast and this is for those who could not find a sacrifice so they're obliged to fast three days during Haj time and seven days when they go back to their uh uh homes and to their countries now as far as Ash is concerned we know that at the very beginning the second year of Hijra or before that the first year of Hijra it was mandated upon the Muslims to fast and this is when the prophet came to Medina and he saw the people of Medina fasting the day of Ash so he asked why are these people fasting they said because the Jews fasted and they say that Allah has saved Moses peace be upon him man the sons of Israel with him from Pharaoh this is the the day where they crossed the sea and Allah destroyed pharaoh and his soldiers and his armies so the prophet said we shall fast it because we are more deserving of Moses we are closer to Moses than the Jews so the prophet recommended and encouraged us to fast it and this wasn't only in Medina because a may Allah be pleased with her told us that the people of quray even pre-islamic era before they became Muslim they used to fast ashur so when the prophet came to Medina and found them fasting ashur as well he asked and then he encouraged the Muslims to fast it and why did the idol worshippers fast ashur we don't know was it because of Moses as well or was it for another reason we do not know but we know that they used to fast it and so did the people of Medina or specifically the Jews of Medina and now it became uh uh something of a Sunnah for us to do and from this Hadith we also learn that the favors and blessings of Allah upon previous nations are considered as favors and blessings for us as well so because Allah saved the people of uh uh the sons of Israel alongside with his messenger Moses peace be upon him this is a day of Jubilation and the day that we should be grateful to Allah for though it was not us who were saved but because these nations were Muslim nations so we share the same fate and we share the same Jubilation as well so these two days are recurring every year and the prophet was asked about the day of Monday so he said and he justified him fasting the day of Monday in this Hadith with two reasons and the narrator doubted whether it was the second or the third reason so he said or so the first reason was it's a day that I was born in so the prophet is showing Allah uh uh his gratitude to Allah by fasting it and then he said and it's a day that I was sent in meaning Allah made him a messenger and the narrator was doubtful whether this was what the prophet said or that it was a day that I was revealed to in it and they're quite relevant and quite close so we would not make an issue of it because the day he was sent in is similar to the day that he was given the revelation though there's a few days difference between him becoming a prophet with the Revelation and then becoming a messenger with the message being ordered to him so that he would relay it to the people now having said that the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam Justified this by saying it was a day I was born in not only that my birth is not a big issue to the umah the biggest issue is that I was sent in it I became a messenger to humanity now this is the most important thing because 40 Years of his life sallallahu alaihi wasallam he wasn't a messenger and he was like anyone else until Allah favored him with the message when he became a messenger and when he became a prophet of Allah then he became a totally different person he became the perfect human being but before that he was like any other human being Allah favored him with the message that he has given it to him uh sallallahu alaih wasallam now can this be the foundation for those who claim that it is permissible to celebrate the M of the Prophet Alat because there are people who say that practicing or celebrating the mold of the Prophet is something of a good deed we love the prophet so we celebrate his M sallallahu alaih wasallam and our evidence is that the prophet fasted itat and we tell them well first of all the prophet did not celebrate his birthday annually he celebrated it weekly so if you want to celebrate his birthday and you want to express your love to him fast every Monday like he used to do and this isn't the only reason why we fast Monday the prophet Alam was asked why do you frequently fast Thursdays and Mondays of every week and he said that these are two days where my deeds and the Deeds of the umah and the Deeds of humanity are displayed to Allah asael they are raised to Allah and they're displayed to him so I would like my Deeds to be displayed to Allah the almighty while I'm in a state of fasting so there isn't any evidence in it for those who inovate to celebrate the mid the birthday of the Prophet Alam and this is something that is as Crystal as or as clear as Crystal the prophet never celebrated his birthday none of the companions did none of the T did and all these favored Generations did not celebrate his birthday so how dare we do such a thing that they did not do not only that they celebrated on the 12th of R and historian said that he wasn't born on the 12th of RAB but rather he was born on the 9th of RAB so even that they are making mistake in but what is not mistaken among all historians and all Scholars is that he died on the 12th of RAB and you see the irony the innovators are actually celebrating his death not his birthday because his birthday was not on the 12th it's an issue of dispute what is not an issue of dispute that and all Scholars agree upon that he died on the 12th of R and you can look at these celebrations the mixing the singing the dancing all of these are not related to Islam at all so we can say without any fear or without any doubt that those who innovate such an innovation are deviant and they're taking the umah away from the path of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam and with his companions moving on to the following Hadith Hadith number uh 31 and this Hadith was narrated by Abu a Al Anar may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of Allah sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam said whoever fasts during the month of Ramadan and then follows it with six days of shaal will be rewarded as if he had fasted the entire year and this Hadith was related by IM Muslim whoever fasts the month of Ramadan well during the month of Ramadan Ramadan this is not a correct uh translation it should have been whoever fasts the month of Ramadan this is accurate translation in Arabic so the prophet is telling us and giving us the Glad Tiding how would you like to meet Allah Asel on the day of judgment after living like 60 or 70 years and it would be recorded for you that you have fasted your your entire life wow that would be great the the Deeds would be uncountable is this possible the prophet tells usam yes it is possible how to do this the prophet said sallallah Ali wasallam whoever fasts Ramadan which means that you have to fast the full month of Ramadan from day one till day 29 or the 30th excuse me so if you do this and then follow that with six days of sha in this case alhamdulillah you will be rewarded as if you had fasted the whole entire month in another Hadith the prophet Alam gives us the math he tells us that a good deed is Multiplied up to 10 Good Deeds so if you fast the month of Ramadan this is equivalent to fasting 10 months of the year and if you fast six days of sha this is equivalent to 60 days which is two months and this is the full year there is another Hadith but we will not uh um have to go through the whole process but for example fasting three days of every month also would have the same reward so the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam tells us that you have to fast the whole month which means that if a woman misses some of the days of Ramadan due to her monthly period and after Eid she wants to begin with the six days of shaal we tell her stop this is not recommended and you will not get the same reward she says why and the answer would be because the prophet said whoever fasts Ramadan not part of Ramadan and you did not fast the whole of Ramadan and followed that by Sha six days of sha on the contrary you fasted parts of Ramadan so the Hadith and the reward would not be given to you unfortunately so what to do you have to first of all begin with your missed days and afterwards fast your six days of shawat some say okay some of the sisters say that I haven't fasted uh of Ramadan except 5 days and the remaining 25 days I was on my post- nail bleeding after delivery so I could only Fast 5 days so I have to make up for 25 days says okay go ahead and make it up for 25 days she says even if I fast 25 days of shaal if you include the day ofid these are 26 days I still have four days left in shaal and I cannot make my six days Scholars say no you have a legitimate excuse because the time of making up is so big make it up and then if you make up for the six days of sha afterwards this would be considered as part of sha even if you fast it in because you did your best and you tried your best now we have to acknowledge that there are some Scholars who said that no this is not intended so if someone fasts 25 days of Ramadan then follows that with six days of sha and later on makes up for the five days of Ramadan missed this does the job and he will get the reward there are some Scholars who said this but what the opinion I chose is opinion of goes side by side with the Hadith of the Prophet Alam and it's best to be safe in making up then following it with six days of sha rather than take the risk one would say now okay pleas with her used to say that I used to skip days of Ramadan due to my mensis and not be able to make up for these days except in Shaban a whole 10 months or 11 months afterwards so does this logically mean that AA did not fast the six days of shaan the answer is yes and this is not a must on her to fast these six days of shaan so definitely she may have not fasted it and most likely she did not not fasted and this is not a must so if may Allah be pleased with her as she reported herself when the prophet used to pray night prayer sallallahu alaihi wasallam she did not pray with him she used to sleep in front of him and whenever he prostrated he touch her so that she would remove her feet so that he would be able to prostrate and then at the end of the night he may wake up wake her up so that she praise with her only with him so this is possible not necessarily being pleas with her that she has to do the whole nine yards and she has to fast every uh so given volunteer days or pray the whole night prayers like the prophet Alam no she had more priorities in serving the prophet Alam in being ready for him Sall wasallam now these six days of sha must they be consecutive it is recommended it's easier but it's not mandatory at all so so if you split them so that you would fast Mondays and Thursdays Mondays and Thursdays Mondays and Thursdays these are six days in shaal and you've got it made a lot of the Muslims begin immediately after Ramadan of course you cannot fast the day ofid this is totally unacceptable and if you do it will not be accepted from you you have to fast after the day of Eid so if you begin from the second and finish on the seventh this does the job alhamdulillah without any uh problem what about fasting voluntary days before making up so the six days of shaal this is over now I have three days uh uh missed in Ramadan due to traveling and then 3 months from now I did not make them up but then I got so can I fasta which is voluntary before completing my 3 days of man mandatory the answer is yes because Allah has given you the duration of the whole year till the following Ramadan to make up for the M days of Ramadan so you have no sin you have no problem in delaying itat you can fast it as you can fast it without any problem the sixth days of sha no you have to make up first then fast the six days of shaah and one of the good things that we can also uh try is that you can get double reward so if a person has a day missed in Ramadan and he did not make it up and it so happened that tomorrow is the 9th of so he fasts tomorrow with the intention of making up for the day of Ramadan but because it coincided with the nth of which is Allah would give him both rewards making up for Ramadan and at the same time experation of two years preceding year and the coming year likewise witha so the advice would be try your level best to make up for the M days of Ramadan during Mondays Thursdays and the white days so that you can get double reward we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back lives again for them happiness let us bring Ramadan Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala commanded Us in the Quran saying hasten to the Forgiveness of your lord and to Paradise the

from Saudi I have a question regarding fasting on I've heard and in that we are we are supposed to fast on 9th or 10th or 10th or 11th of muharam just to make it different from the Jews okay and my second question is about um what about a woman who is a divorce or a widow the the duration that she has to spend after the death of her her husband and how is she supposed to spend that time because in the subcontinent in Pakistan like the the woman is supposed to stay inside inside inside a room sometimes or like she's not supposed to come in front of anyone like that so can you please explain this okay I will answer you inshallah thank Aisha from Saudi yes your line your line is breaking okay STC now is on on the line okay uh Iman she says what she heard that um fasting of ashur is to be a day before or a day after so that we would be different to the Jews and what she said is is correct in regards of the day before because the prophet alhat wasam as we learned earlier that when he came to Medina in the first year of Hijra asur was mandated and then it was abrogated and became Sunnah so he continued to fast Ash until the last year where he lived that and uh until he died on the 11th year of Hijra he said that on that year if I live next year the 12th year of Hijra I will Fast the ninth this means that he used to fast only the 10th but after 8 years he wanted to go against the Jews and there are so many things in Islam that we are ordered to go against the Jews and the Christians and the rest of the disbelievers to have our own identity among them is this but he died so now it is the recommendation that people fast uh the night nth and the 10th the Hadith of fasting the 11th as well is it's not authentic so there are three grades of fasting as Scholars say either you fast the full three days and fasting of muharam is highly recommended or you fast the 9th and the 10th or the 10th and the 11th or the third uh uh situation is to isolate the 10th by fasting and this is permissible without any problem in a from uh Saudi kindly elaborate on the covering of feet for woman in Salah or women pray only in the house it was said that if they are weing putting on full Abaya then the feet will be closed sorry covered uh they put isar to pray and it covers their ankle and a little bit of so is it okay or to be covered by socks or so like that I will answer your question inshallah from Saudi I have two question yes first one in congregational Salah when the IM say do we say I mean with him or after him okay that's the first one and the second one um during fasting this the mucus of the nose and the throat sometimes it ends up at the back of the throat so do we break our fast if we swallow it I could not I could not understand your question at all the the the mucus which is in the nose yes and the throat if we swallow it from from the nose if we breathe and then it comes up back of the throat if you swallow it do we break our fast okay SEC third question and third question question is um during Wu if he accidentally even if you're trying this if you accidentally take some water down our throat to the nose or to the mouth accidentally of course does this break up first okay I will answer your question inshallah thank you om abman from Saudi Alum she just now you explain about the shaal fasting like after Ramadan whatever we have missed first we have to complete that one correct uh then this before complete before finishing this shaal month like in August it will finish so can we put this uh can we keep this fasting as alternate days after completing this seven days in sha yeah in sh yes yes of course you can make it as as as you wish uh uh means alternate is no problem no problem at all no problem uh one more thing uh shik yesterday I asked you about the messages right I think I asked ask wrong question because uh uh I do like in WhatsApp we make a group right in that my husband number my brother number and my relative numbers are there so whatever Islam messages are there that I will send not chatting nothing nothing like this because my my husband and my brother they are to little bit lazy to send all these messages as one of my sister two days back they told that like we have grown up as a Muslim but not actually we are not following Islam so according to like that related messages I will send to them I will answer your question inshah uh one more one request sh after Ramadan when Ramadan complete um you please explain us the sah bukari Hadith book it is a humble request to you uh this is a little bit difficult this depends on the uh Channel itself if they have the uh ability to do this but I would love to do it I'm doing it in my Masjid in Arabic though but it's not in Arabic I'm doing sahkari with the grace of Allah yeah because I'm seeing your makah channel in that you are explaining but we we don't know the Arabic language this is the problem inshallah we will try our best inshallah okay sain from Somalia I apologize for taking so long um um Iman she says that a divorce or someone who is widowed what is the procedure and the etiquette of her for of divorce it's different toally than a widowed woman a divorce she should sit in her husband's house until she finishes the waiting period the and then if no reconciliation took place she can go to her parents uh uh house but for the woman in her a widow she has to stay and remain in her husband's house for 4 months and 10 days she can move around in the house freely she can eat and drink and live her normal life she must not leave the house unless it's for emergency or for a necessity and yeah going for shopping is not a necessity so she does not visiting a an an an a sick person uh or uh following uh giving condolences to someone who died this is not permissible for her she has to be confined to her house she's not entitled to put perfume or to wear flashy clothes or to Adorn her elf and wear beautiful things she has to remain in the household clothes in the sense that she would not do anything that would attract people to marrying her though she's not being in touch with others but and meaning naham yet nevertheless she should show her grief over the period of four months and 10 days for her husband uh Etc we have uh um Ahmed from Saudi how are you she I'm fine Z for asking um I want to ask three questions yes my first question is about traveling uh like um when I go to my home country uh um should I read the KAS Nam or should I read the full namas if I'm going for a week uh week or 10 days uh so what should I do I should read KAS namas or I should reach full namas and you're going to your home country meaning that home Pakistan I'm going to Pakistan for to visit my parents uh for for a short vacation for 10 days or 12 days so what should I do over there and eventually eventually Pakistan is where you're going to reside at the end of the contract inshallah okay the second question and my second question is is about the Dua which we did in with uh nowadays in with Nam with jamama is it from Sunnah okay and and my third uh question is about like uh we go in the Masjid uh near our house and the Imam um finishes the T very quickly we are not able to finish our um durud the the the big you know yes we not able to finish it and the IM said so what we should do we should finish it and or I will I will answer your question inah you're welc from Sudan listen to me from the phia Omar mute your television okay sir yes yeah now my question uh in case we are performing the SP prayers after reciting Al is it permissible to skip other SW like supplementing it with another Sur or a Sur is adding another Surah is just what any more questions no I have only that one okay I will answer your question inshallah okay Saudi Arabia she says that when the IM says should we say with him or after him this an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion that he and you should all say a mean at the same time because it would be a awkward for him to say and you're waiting anticipating him to say a mean he doesn't he doesn't believe that he should say it loudly so no after finishing you all have to say or should say aan and um's second question about the muscus and the swallowing of it as long as it did not come out swallowing it is okay but it's not healthy so you should try your level best to uh uh throw it out and she says by mistake if a a person performing woodoo he swallows some water does it affect his fasting the the the issue is mistake and we know that to break your fast there are three conditions must be fulfilled one of them is to be done intentionally so by mistake Allah Asel does not burden you with his grace Adam from bahin my question is about sister sh mhm I never F sha before okay so this mon inah I want to start because I don't know now I know I want to start fasting so how can I make the intention after the Ramadan after E I want to start the sh do you have any M days of Ramadan no I never no not anyx day okay then you you you start immediately by fasting any given day of shaal so maybe fast number three then number seven then number 10 depending on your comfort and six days of it does the job inshallah okay and then my second question is the uh prayer okay maybe I came to the mo late and then because I asked some IM he said if you come to the mo and then they finish the ISA prayer they doing the you can make near and follow them and after the ra you stand up and do the second Raa as is right okay yeah so if like I met them they have finished the first two and they are in the second two and then I follow them that means I've mixed two ra already so if I follow the IM you finish the is am I supposed to make the or is I cannot do any again finish I have to do I will I will answer your question question inshallah okay thank you very you're welcome Amber from Saudi uh I have two questions um regarding you know like um is it okay to make a man you know if if my prayer is accepted I will uh if my Dua is accepted I'll pray this many na like I will offer like 10 na prayers to make uh like for invocation yeah okay uh okay second another question is like can we say like the Saab for the deceased for my like deceased grandparents or something uh like for my for all my tahajud prayers the Saab will go to my uhu uh deceased relatives I will answer your question inshah can we do that inshallah okay thank you you're welcome a from Saudi he says what's the ruling on women covering their feet during uh Salah I will take mariam's or mam from emirat my name is Mariam um I have a question yes I was asking um I have a baby than one and I'm proceeding her she doesn't tast anything apart from food uh I times I can miss fasting because I'm not feeling well is it okay then I I Repent again after Ramadan you are pregnant no I'm not pregnant I have a baby okay breastfeeding oh breastfeeding and a baby who is less than a year okay yeah I will answer your question Mariam you're welcome and um A's question was about women covering their feet it is mandat it's an issue of dispute as usual but it is mandatory and this is the most authentic opinion for a woman to cover her feet whether to wear a long Abaya that reaches the floor and she covers her feet completely and it's okay it's permissible when she is in sujud that the soil of her feet appear there's no problem in that or better more to wear socks so either one it's okay but to leave the feet exposed no this does not uh uh make her prayer valid om ABD says about her question yesterday that she posts um things on WhatsApp so Islamic material and there's no chitchatting nobody responds to that she she has a group where she has her husband brothers and some of her cousins male cousins but she sends them things but they there is no chatting is this permissible I would not recommend it yeah to tell you the truth I would not feel easy for my wife to do such a thing uh I cannot say it's Haram but if your husband is okay with that and there is no communication then inallah there's no problem in that I don't know which one is first uh ban or blenda so okay blenda from the Emirates hello alum uh I would like to ask because I'm working in the hospital then one of our uh in charge died but she's a question okay then is it uh okay to uh to go in the church and uh uh be with them in the prayer just for support okay I would answer your question morning day and one more Shake yes uh my children are sent home to Philippines but uh my mother they are Christians then when they go to church my mother is very old but uh sometimes my mother asking my children to just be with her because sometimes she's feeling busy and she would faint in the church is it permissible to go to the church my children are Muslims okay I will answer the question inshallah only that sh thank you very much you're welcome I love your I love your program brazan from Australia how are you sh alhamdulillah alhamdulillah I have one question about Zak yes I understand that um the zakat should be paid only to the poor and needy okay and uh can I distribute it among like two three families or does it have to be just same place okay I will answer a question inshallah thank you very much you're welcome okay and said about sah alkari and uh uh um having a program on it this is up to Huda TV it's a very very big and long project I've started doing it in my Masjid twice a month a week and up till now alhamdulillah we finished onethird of it with the grace of Allah but during approximately five years so it it would take a lot of time uh Ahmed from Saud Arabia says that Ahmed she says she travels to Pakistan and for a week or 10 days can she perform prayer the answer is no because here in Saudi Arabia she is with her husband working and this is not their residency but they permanent residency but it's temporary when she goes to Pakistan she is eventually going to go there to settle down so this is her hometown so in this case she has to uh uh complete her prayers in Saudi and also in Pakistan this is different to someone who migrated to Canada for example so they're not going to go back to Pakistan uh uh at all except for holidays in this case yes when they go to Pakistan they shorten their prayer because they are not resident there they will not be resident there but in your case of Muhammad yes you have to complete she says is this part of the sunah the answer is yes the prophet taught it to alassan Ali Ali his uh grandson but he did not teach him the nine the whole nine yards he taught him a small Dua and what the imams are doing now and prolonging it to 10 15 sometimes half an hour of Dua breaking the people's shoulders and hands and the majority of people don't know what they're saying and they're making Dua for every Tom Di and Harry no this is not part of the Sunnah definitely and she says that if the Imam finishes the tah and concludes the the prayer with Salam and we did not get the chance to sayam mammad what to do you have the option to continue saying it until you finish it then you offer Salam or you it's okay to skip it because Scholars say it's mandatory some say it's uh uh permissible some say it is recommended and recommended in Sunnah this is the most authentic opinion but if you leave it your prayer is valid inah from Sudan says that reciting a Surah after f is it a or a Sunnah no it's a Sunnah whether it's in mandatory prayers or inv voluntary prayers if you only pray the fa the F your prayer is valid and uh uh you've missed the reward of following the sun of the Prophet Alat and Adam from bahin says that if I miss my Isa prayer and I come and I find the IM is praying two raas of you should join him with the intention of so when he finishes the two R and offers am you stand up and pray your third and fourth raak on your own even if they engage in another two Ras of once you conclude your prayer then join them in in what remains of their whether it's a or two or more Amar from Saudi Arabia she says what's the ruling on making a vow so if I say oh Allah if you answer my supplication I'm going to pray uh night prayers half an hour every single night till I die or I'm going to fast Mondays and Thursdays till I die what's a ruling on such a vow this is not recommended it is Mak not preferred and Allah does not want this from you because you're obliging yourself with with something that the prophet did not oblige it upon you so you are not doing something that is right but if you already committed yourself to doing this then you have to comply and fulfill uh what's the ruling on giving the reward of any good deeds I do so for example if I recite the Quran and I say that this ju is from my grandfather if I pray two I say the reward of this goes to my late grandmother this is not permissible and it is part of the Innovation because no one knows that Allah would accept his uh um Good Deeds or not we know that the things that you can give away is Charity giving Dua asking Allah for forgiveness Etc Mariam says that she is breastfeeding her child is less than a year old and she feels dizzy and tired can she skip fasting if you're afraid for yourself or for your child yes you can skip fasting and make it up afterwards inshallah blenda from the Emirates says that uh her coworker died and she was a Christian and she would like to give her condolences and attend the um funeral in in the church or in the graveyard that this permissible it is totally prohibited in Islam there's no way you can do this and it is completely unacceptable what about her mother she sent her children to her mother in the Philippines and she's old and she's tired and she needs them to accompany her to the church would this be permissible personally I do not uh think that this is permissible and uh uh she should not allow them to go with her to church maybe maybe and I have to check on this don't quote me on that maybe they are entitled to take her to the uh doors of the church but not definitely to enter with her or to witness the ceremony this is totally prohibited and under no circumstances they uh would go there we have time for a couple of minutes or three minutes so if we have uh callers we will take them uh bersan from Australia she said he says that regarding zakat if we have we know that it is due to poor and the needy but what about the amount that I have so if I have for example $1,000 do I have to give it to one family or can I break it to 10 families it is permissible for you to break it to 10 families but for you a it is a must that you know what is more beneficial for the uh the poor so if I break it to a 100 family giving $10 each it would not benefit any of them but if I give 500 and 500 to two families that would benefit uh uh two families rather than not uh uh benefiting uh none AA from the Emirates okay I have two questions yes uh one of them is um if I miss 4 to5 days can I can I F can I make it up you missed 45 days yeah can I make it up alternative days and then five sha and I will make it up in in sha insh you cannot make 45 days in shaal so you mean these are three four Ramadan that had passed already yeah yeah yeah yeah okay I will answer your question inshallah second question um this ay I hear it again and again and again can you just recommend um what should I do about it where do you hear it um sometimes on the radio in the car sometimes my mother's reciting Quran at home okay I will answer I hear it like any any time it it just comes to me again and again okay I will answer your question am afraid that we don't have time for your question my my friend so be gracious and kind enough to call me tomorrow and let me just answer aa's questions please UHA says that she missed 45 days of fasting this is a collective number of days uh of previous Ramadan probably five or six years so is this related to the sixth of shaal of this year the answer is no Ramadan this Ramadan we're fasting today is connected with six days of shaad the the previous 45 days these are to be made up later on you're you're sinful if you could have made them up and did not but you can yes if this Ramadan you missed five days only in shaal make up for the five days and then fast the six days of shaal you get the full reward of a whole year fasting the remaining 45 days you have to start uh uh breaking them up and and making them up her aah Allah has obliged and and and and registered and ordered us to fight in his cause in Jihad and this is hateful for a human being no one wants to die or to be uh hurt and maybe Allah you may he ha something and Allah makes good in it and you may like something and Allah puts bad things in it without your knowledge and Allah knows and you do not know so so she says I often hear this Ayah what to do listen to it this ay is one of the great ay of the Quran and it shows you the importance of being on the straight path and believing in Allah's Divine decree so even if I wanted something so bad and it did not happen I usually entertain Myself by saying hm maybe I love something and there's bad in it for me so alhamdulillah Allah did not make it happen and if something of a Calamity or a tribulation took place and and I hate it Allah is telling me you never know this may elevate your status in Paradise this may gives you this or that and what does not uh uh uh whatever does not kill you it will make you stronger so be grateful to Allah for whatever happens to you and Allah Asel would reward you immensely for that this is all the time we have until we meet next time on Saturday with the grace of Allah I Leave You lighting this day is so right as the first start we is tonight with family around a nice meal we're making do on I feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love whenever we think of Ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
