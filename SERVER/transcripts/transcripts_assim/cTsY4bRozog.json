  "title": "How to answer strange questions from children like 'Who made Allah'? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my seven-year-old son asked me yesterday who made allah he's well aware of allah he's seven years of age the prophet he also knows the prophets may allah be pleased may allah peace and blessing be upon them and he is studying the quran how do i answer such questions see these kids come up with strange questions the vast majority of us muslims don't know how to respond and usually our response is violent either by shutting the kid down and trying to reprimand him for what he had said when he doesn't know that this is wrong he's a kid he's a child so always be careful in how you treat your children if your four-year-old started using swear words and you make a fuzz out of it and then we're gonna put hot sauce uh uh in your mouth whenever you say such a thing and you spank him and you hit him and you do this and you do that you're not benefiting because it's gonna stick in his mind and he knows that this is something that i should be using at times of trouble but if you ignore him couple of times he'll move on and forget the word he wouldn't know what it means so for your child first of all you have to logic with him and use the sharia in logic we mean that you ask him what is the definition of a human being someone who's born lives eats and drinks and dies okay so what is the definition of god the main description of a god is that he is uncreated because if a god is created then he can't be god and this is exactly what or how we talk to the christians if you claim that jesus christ is the son of god and he's god and he was born then why not have a gazillion gods like the hindus there's nothing preventing it but these people fail to understand that a god creates and is not created because in the hadith the prophet says satan comes to you and says who created the rock who created the tree who created the mountain who created the heavens who created the earth and you say allah allah in answering then he says who created allah now here is the fork of the road anyone would know that you're either created or not if you're not created this can't be unless you are god everything else is created and this is why the prophet said in the end of the hadith if satan comes to you and whispers to you and says these things to you refrain and say i believe in allah refrain from contemplating and thinking about these things and all immediately say amen to bill i believe in allah azzawajal full stop and in another narration i seek refuge in allah from shaytan and this is what every muslim should do so the logical part he can understand it if you say that allah is not created because if he was created then who created him xyz then who created xyz abc and and it goes on and on no a god a god is not created is not created he's the first without a beginning there's no beginning to allah in the hadith there was a law and there was nothing with him meaning nothing existed except him subhanahu wa so i hope this answers your son's question"
