  "transcript": "the next question comes from a mother in relation to her son it says that my son is 12 and mukhelev he is berlich and he asked perform ertikaf alone at the masjid down the road however the vika that the scholars partaking at that mosque is totally against the sunnah should i allow him to do ertikaf there alone what does sheikh advise mindfully i advise if this young man has someone to accompany him and to guide him upon the sunnah that he should be allowed if he's going alone he is susceptible and prone to being deviated by the people there so he must not be allowed to go to messages of innovations at this early age they could manipulate him and try to have him follow their innovations and bad evil ways but if he has a an elder brother who's upon the sunnah or his father would accompany him or his uncle who's upon the sunnah would protect him would be with him all this time yes he has to be allowed and supported insha'allah"
