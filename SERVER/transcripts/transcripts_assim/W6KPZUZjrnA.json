  "transcript": "uh i wanted to ask about the permissibility or prohibition regarding giving salaam to a particular person when you enter into a gathering so specifically addressing a person is that what you're asking yeah okay there is a hadith by abdul rahman even abdullah you must hold may allah be pleased with him when a man came and said o ibn masrud assalamu alaikum so he's addressing with the salam this particular individual by name neglecting the others and he said that the prophet prohibited allah specifically giving salam to individuals specifically so when you go in you say assalamu alaykum to all and there's no problem in addressing that particular individual how are you doing my friend it's been a long time nice to see you but to go in where there are five or ten people and you say oh shikhasam salaam alaikum not to the congregation not to uh the individuals this is prohibited in islam"
