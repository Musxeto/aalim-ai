  "transcript": "Dr zakya if a person is fasting during the month of Ramadan and unfortunately he passes away he dies um person who takes charge of his Affairs after his death is that person obliged to make up the fast that he's missed during the month of Ramadan as far as a person when he dies once he dies then all his actions they cease to exist as Hadi of prophet M wasallam it's mentioned in s Muslim volume number three in the book of Hadith number 45 the Beloved Prophet said that once a person dies only thing that will continue amongst all his deeds is the recurring charity he has made or the knowledge that he has spread that he has used to benefit the people and the third is his son praying for him so besides these three things everything is seases so but natur when a person dies and if he had fasted maybe for 10 days of Ramadan it dies on the 10th day that doesn't mean that the balance 20 days somebody should make up for his fast once he dies then he doesn't have to offer Salah he doesn't have to fast everything seems to exist except the three things which I mentioned so the person who is in charge of his Affairs he need not worry at all once he dies everything sees to except three things which I mention"
