  "title": "Start with Islamic Faith or Islamic Fiqh",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Japan um I want to help I wanted \nto I want your needs um so I was trying to go   through your um lectures on your channel and \nI don't know where to start but should I start   with an Islamic faith or Islamic Fiqh and here you \nhave regardless fiqh you have two playlists here   um the one that you did two years ago when and the \none did eight years ago which is Buloogh Al Maram okay uh brother Abdullah is asking about seeking \nknowledge through going to YouTube channel my   YouTube channel where I have a number of playlists \nand he asks which one should I begin with   my own preference and recommendation is to begin \nwith the beautiful names of Allah azzawajal   this is extremely important because this \nis the most important form of knowledge   on Earth and the science gets its honor and \nplace and level according to what is being   studied and there is nothing more honorable \nthan Allah azzawajal so to study Allah's   beautiful names and Allah's beautiful attributes \nthat is the most important thing for you to do   then there is the playlist which is the three \nprinciple fundamentals and this is a classical   book of Imam Muhammed Ibn Abdulwahab and this \nalso deals with an essential part of our aqeedah   if you cover these two I believe that inshallah \nyou have started on the right track after that you   go to learning issues of fiqh that would help \nyou learn more about your prayer your fasting   your zakat your Hajj and also other forms of \ntransactions and as you correctly mentioned there   are two playlists one is the Islamic fiqh which \nis a contemporary book that has its ups and downs   but alhamdulillah with the grace of Allah I pray \nto Allah that I've made a good job in correcting   the mistakes and placing the right rules and \nverdicts according to the most authentic opinion   and it's not very long it's quite concise and I \ndo not elaborate a lot on it once you finish this   then you can go on to the more extended versions \nof Aqeedah for example there is the Islamic faith   and this is a contemporary book also that \nmay have few mistakes which I pointed out   alhamdulillah and I pray to Allah I was correct in \ndoing that so that what you get at the end result   would be the most authentic opinion according \nto your Aqeedahtu Ahl Al-Sunnah was Al-Jamaa'a   and also there is which was done nine years \nor ten years ago in Mumbai India and it is   a classical book taught in universities but \nit's a longer version based on the Hadith   so this is not a fiqh playlist based on \na particular madhab rather it's based on   the actual evidence the actual saying of the \nProphet (Peace and Blessings Upon him) where   we we elaborate on it and it's a workshop \nand Insha'Allah it would be quite uh helpful   and beneficial but it's quite long so I \nwould highly recommend you getting a pen   and a paper and listening to it and writing \nwhatever you don't understand and search for   it and look for it and then this is how you \nexpand your own knowledge insha Allah vastly foreign"
