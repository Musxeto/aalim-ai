مُّبِينًا بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم الحمد لله رب العالمين وأصلي وأسلم على المبعوث رحمة للعالمين سيد الأولين والآخرين نبينا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين أما بعد Dear brothers and sisters in Islam السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته Now the third or fourth tip on how to deal with people's mistakes and errors and sins stemmed from the way of the Prophet ﷺ is to adhere to the fact that people differ some people can be addressed with logic pure logic other people can be addressed through reminding them of Allah's power over them and Allah's grace and blessings and favors upon them and making them fearful of Allah's punishment and torment and what goes around comes around so some people can be addressed in such a fashion and that would probably be more useful than other means and this all depends on how the Prophet ﷺ dealt with different scenarios so reminding people to fear Allah was one of the Prophet's approach one of the Prophet's approaches with those who committed mistakes Jundu ibn Abdillah al-Bajali may Allah be pleased with him narrates that the Prophet ﷺ sent an expedition and when they came back victorious and telling the Prophet ﷺ about how they managed the battle and how they fought against the enemies and eventually how they won the Prophet was very happy especially when the one who was reporting that to him was Usama ibn Zayd and we've spoken about who Usama was may Allah be pleased with him and with his father Zayd ibn Haritha and how the Prophet ﷺ loved Zayd as a son where he was his adopted son before it was abrogated and how he loved Usama as his own grandson so when Usama was telling him the Prophet was very happy listening to him until he came to the part of the story the part of the battle where there was a strong courageous warrior among the enemies and he was fighting fiercely and killing the Muslims so Usama said I went to have a duel with him and to confront him and we exchanged blows and when the man felt that I was about to kill him and to beat him up he said la ilaha illallah la ilaha illallah is the declaration of faith it is the statement a person says to enter Islam and become a Muslim there is no God worthy of being worshipped other than Allah it's the basics of all things in life the basic element anyone must believe that there is no God worthy of being worshipped other than Allah whether you're a Jew or a Christian or a Hindu or a Buddhist or a Sikh or whatever all this universe was created by one everyone admits nobody says Jesus created the universe nobody says that Krishna created the universe or Buddha or whoever no they all acknowledge that there's only one creator one provider one sustainer one giver of life and the one who gives death as well there's only one who facilitates our affairs so there's no one worthy of being worshipped except him simple as that when the man said this statement Usama was still talking with pride and honour that I finished him off and I killed him here is when the events took another course the Prophet's salallahu alayhi wa sallam's face changed and he said to Usama you killed him after he declared la ilaha illallah Usama did not see the point said yeah he said it to protect himself from being killed that is beside the point the moment he said la ilaha illallah he became a Muslim so the Prophet kept on repeating it what will you do on the day of judgment with la ilaha illallah meaning that this word this statement would come and challenge you in front of Allah how did you kill this person this individual after he proclaimed la ilaha illallah to us logically this is a no-brainer the guy is a fierce enemy of Islam he killed lots of Muslims he's on the battlefield he's fighting against the Muslim army so he's a kafir nobody doubts it even his own siblings and blood relatives would confirm yep he's a kafir and he's going to fight you and if he's able to kill you he's going to kill you but he said this to our logic only to protect himself so logically he's still a kafir and I can kill him I can finish him off the Prophet kept on repeating alayhis salatu wasalam what will you do with la ilaha illallah if or when it comes to you on the day of judgment and he kept on repeating it until Usama realized his mistake and learned the lesson and wished that he did not accept Islam himself except on that day so that it would have erased that huge sin this way of the Prophet alayhis salatu wasalam of casting fear in Usama's heart because of what he had done is one of the ways and means of dealing with people and the Prophet did this alayhis salatu wasalam according to the people who came to him in the treaty of Al-Hudaybiyah when they went to perform Umrah and they were blocked by the idol worshippers by the people of Quraysh and this was unprecedented no one was ever blocked from going for Umrah and to visit the holy shrines so they kept on sending invoice to the Prophet alayhis salatu wasalam and messengers to mediate and try to find a solution and when one of them came the Prophet recognized him and he said to his companions such a person has love for Allah though he's an idol worshipper but he's a at the kind or the type of a person who loves to worship Allah and give charity and give sacrifice for the sake of Allah while associating others with Allah because he's an ignorant he's a mushrik so when the Prophet noticed this alayhis salatu wasalam he told them present the sacrifices we brought all the way from Medina so that he would notice them and figure it out that we're not here to fight we're just worshippers coming to do our ritual and going back no hidden agenda the moment a man saw these sacrifices the camels and the sheep he immediately went back to the leaders of Quraysh the idol worshippers and said oh people fear Allah this guy and those with him are coming to perform a ritual so instead of going there and trying to mediate a settlement and to try to send him off back again to Medina the Prophet succeeded by knowing what type of an individual he was in changing his position and winning him over to his side likewise sometimes it is wise for a da'ia to know how to speak to people sometimes people provoke you and try to make fun of you and instead of reminding them of Allah and casting fear in their hearts of Allah you know that they won't be afraid of Allah because they're mocking and making fun of their religion so you have to turn the tables on their heads and use a different strategy altogether but when the type of people even if they're indulged in drinking and and partying and doing haram things that's so obvious to us yet you can sense that they have this weakness they have this fear of Allah you can always knock on that door and cast fear in a diplomatic way that would benefit them and your call to Islam this was one of the means of the Prophet in correcting mistakes he could have lectured Usama and saying oh what you have done was wrong he's a Muslim until proven otherwise what you should have done was this and that and and that was a normal lesson but when the Prophet used this and repeatedly said what will you do with la ilaha illallah on the day of judgment judgment this terrified Usama may Allah be pleased with him and engraved the lesson in his heart so he would never ever attempt to kill anyone or harm anyone who claims to be a Muslim even if it goes against all odds and this is a lesson we should learn those khawarij those followers of ISIS or these terrorist groups who keep on terrorizing people and killing Muslims they're not real Muslims you get some Muslims preaching about religion about this and that and you can tell that you can tell that their rhetoric is not correct you can tell that they are not true Muslims by their behavior by the way they look however as long as they said la ilaha illallah we must refrain from killing them if those deviant sects and cults acknowledged to the sharia they would not have done these terrorist attacks by killing Muslims just because they believe that they're not Muslims out of their own whims and desires also part of reminding people of Allah's wrath and torment is to remind people of Allah's ability over them Abu Masood Al-Bidri may Allah be pleased with him said once I was in a state of anger because of something that my slave did a mistake so I kept on beating him up with a whip and I heard a sound from behind me saying listen Abu Masood due to the rage I was in I did not recognize the voice when the person approached me I discovered that it was the prophet himself alayhis salatu wasalam and he said listen Abu Masood listen Abu Masood so the whip fell from my hand I adhered to the prophet's call and the prophet said alayhis salatu wasalam to me listen Abu Masood Allah has more power over you than you have over this slave what a profound advice when you think you're strong and all powerful and mighty just because Allah made you stronger than others and you want to beat people up you want to beat your children you want to beat up your wife you want to beat up someone who is not from your country an immigrant a foreigner but you think but that because I'm a citizen I have more rights I can abuse him I can insult him well always always always remember that Allah Azza wa Jal has more power over you than you have over whomever you're trying to oppress or abuse so Abu Masood on the spot reacted to this reminder and said to the prophet alayhis salatu wasalam oh prophet of Allah I make you my witness he's free for the sake of Allah I don't want anything from him he's free and the prophet said to him let it be known Abu Masood had you not freed him you would have been burnt by hellfire listen to this beautiful lesson given by the prophet alayhis salatu wasalam and we could spend hours talking about this we could spend some time proving to the people that slavery is not something Islam brought to the scenes slavery was found in Judaism Christianity in all different nations and religions when Islam came however their sources of slavery was totally haram any type of abduction is a legal source of slavery you can kidnap people you can hijack people you can buy people from their parents the parents are poor you can buy children all legit someone who borrowed money from you cannot pay them back you can enslave him and his whole family and this was practiced and accepted we know what happened centuries ago when they came to west Africa the Europeans and took hundreds of thousands of Africans as slaves put them in ships and ship them to be sold and to work as slaves all of this is not permissible in Islam there is only one source of slavery in Islam and that is if there is a legitimate war between the Muslims and their enemies those captives those who would be abducted through war as POWs would be prisoners of wars of war and would be enslaved however this is not the end of the day we have etiquettes how to treat the slaves this is one of them you don't have the right to beat them up you have to feed them from what you eat clothe them from what you wear come on they are slaves they're like animals we sell them and buy them yes but they have dignity and you have to treat them well in Islam not only that expiations all over the place you have legitimate intimacy during the daytime of Ramadan with your spouse that's sinful because you're fasting well I did it free a slave you're driving and you killed someone by mistake an accident free a slave whoa you swear by Allah to do something and then decide not to do it I swear that I will go tomorrow to the gym tomorrow comes and I don't feel like going to the gym expiate how free a slave and so on so many things in Islam that if you do this expiate by freeing a slave what does this tell you we have only one source of getting slaves and that is jihad the holy war but we don't have any well this is the only source but in order to expiate so many sins you have to free a slave at the top of the list and this shows you that Islam encourages freeing the slaves not abolishing it or preventing it no this the source is there until the day of judgment it will never stop no matter what they do until jihad is stopped but this is part of Islam the beauty of it is that this is the only religion that channels freeing slaves that puts the policy and procedure of dealing and treating slaves as they're supposed to be and it is one of the means of for them to enter paradise in the hadith of mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her she says the prophet said I was amazed for seeing people in their shackles and chains being dragged into paradise scholars interpret this by saying that these people in shackles and chains are the slaves who were disbelievers and they were enslaved and put in chains and shackles however when they saw Islam from the inside from the household they accepted Islam and these chains and shackles were the reason to drag them into paradise unlike the millions of non-believers who will die as non-believers and end up for eternity in hell fire so this kind of approach casting fear of Allah in the people's hearts the sinner's hearts to remind them to get them back to Islam or to remind them of Allah's power over them or Allah's favours and blessing over them is one of the prophet's ways of correcting people's mistakes we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back"
