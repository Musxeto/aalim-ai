  "title": "Ruling on using animated emojis - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I'm sure there's a social media called Discord uh this is where like young people in Iraq we chat and um it allows you to create custom emojis on there um some of them are static and some of them are animated um there was a animated Emoji created by somebody and it looks uh kind of like a sad face and then um there's like two hands holding uh like a rope and then the Rope is tied into a knot and then like then they're not just put over the head of the Emoji and then the Emojis eyes change from being a regular eye to x's on the eyes and mouths like it died kind of like the Emoji committed suicide with the Rope so would it be Haram to use the emoji on the app first of all this is not recommended to move to use such animated emojis an emoji that is a yellow face with dots of an eye and a smile or a frown is okay it's not animated what you're talking about is a cartoon where you have a face then a rope and a knot and someone's being hanged and x's and and committing suicide and promoting okay I know that this person is not promoting suicide he's just saying that oh your comment killed me or it is so disappointing that as if I was to die or to commit suicide but still it is inappropriate a Muslim stays out of dubious things does not put himself In Harm's Way by just wanting to be cool and or sophisticated like everybody else and show that I know how to post these things have your own identity again stay away from such things and Allah Knows Best"
