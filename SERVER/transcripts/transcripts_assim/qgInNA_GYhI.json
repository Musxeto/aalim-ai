  "title": "If a person who left prayers intentionally did ghusl without saying shahadah 1st, is his ghusl valid",
  "transcript": "I want to ask that am I right in this case or is this OCD sh if a person leaves many prayers then he is cfir according to some Scholars so it means no good deed is accepted by a kafir so if a person leaves prayers deliberately because of major impurity and now he takes hul without reciting shahada is his hosel valid because he committed kufur and did not recite the shahada before taking a hosel is his valid his is valid his is valid and it's not up to you to decide whether he committed kufur or not because to label someone that he committed kufur there are conditions to be fulfilled and obstacles to be eliminated you just cannot come to one statement of the scholars and apply it to whomever you wish without looking at the circumstances this is not the way is done"
