  "title": "What are permissible reasons one can stay in Non-Muslim Countries? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so what are the reasons that may allow me to stay permanently or for a while if it is for a while then studies is on the top of the list muslims need professional muslims who studied abroad and brought the technology to our country two medicine i have a chronic illness and hospitals in my country are qualified not equipped to do this so i have to travel to a cafe country thirdly trade i am a merchant and i buy goods and i manufacture goods i'm a businessman so i need to travel all over the world to get new businesses new agencies to help build factories this is legitimate reason now sometimes your stay might be longer than usual so for example i get an offer sheikh hasan we need a head of the islamic center in tokyo japan and it's a very far place it's a catholic country but we need someone in your expertise to stay there at least for 10 years whoa 10 years a lot of time if my intention is to give dawah and to teach people there yeah i can i can go 10 20 30 years no problem because this is a legitimate reason a justifiable reason if someone says we we need you to go to spain and to live among them know the traditions and report this back to us so that we know how to address them ah you mean spying no no no no spying we have nothing to do with the government we just like to know how to approach these people for dawah because masha'allah they're very close to islam a lot of them are accepting islam in a rapid way we need you to learn spanish okay this is a legitimate reason now for someone who is a native of that country so someone says okay i am a european born raised and living in europe this is my country i'm a citizen all my family are living here so can i continue to live here i said okay let us look at how you are living there do you practice islam if he says yes alhamdulillah i am a muslim my wife is a muslim my children are muslim we go to the masjid no harassment my wife wears the niqab no harassment my children go to muslim schools and they study the quran and they practice their religion freely totally i would say there's no problem in you staying in your country living your life as a muslim giving dawah it might be even better for you to stay there because you will be giving doubt to others but if he says to me well no i can partially worship and practice islam so we are forced not to pray jumu'ah because our workplace does not allow us to leave and pray with the muslims i can manage through that i have to really do some work but i can manage giving you a fatwa on that okay what else my wife is not obliged not she is prohibited from wearing the nipple as in the case in france and other european countries they will fine her and she has to pay a fine of like 120 or 130 dollars every time the police catches her whoa this is weird why is that because they want to abandon any religious symbols is there hatred to religion that much what happens if she wears the bikini they have no problem with that even even if she goes topless no problem it's a free country but when it comes to religion it is in their genes that they hate islam and we've seen what they had done to algerians before and what they're trying to do now to the lebanese and to the mali uh i don't know how to make an adjective malians maybe i don't know and anyhow this is not our topic so okay what else they teach my children in school homosexuality and that it is normal and that we should accept it and every where they go on the streets billboards and signs and all calling to infidelity to fahisha pornography nudity everything is is filthy for a muslim and not only that in some scandinavian countries you cannot teach your children home you cannot give them homeschooling it's a crime they will come and take your children i was shocked i was with a somali couple speaking the other day doing counseling and they were telling me that we can't raise our children as we want i was with one of the brothers i think in uganda maybe um one of the brothers is scandinavian and he's a daddy i met i think in uganda or somewhere and he was telling me that his twelve-year-old child boy must go to the school public school i said oh well this is problematic is it not only that it's a mixed school so this is even more problematic this is not only that they have to by law take swim courses together i said what he said yes girls and boys must go to the swimming pool it's mandatory in the school now in this case the following step would be to work as a prostitute what else what is the remaining of the dean if my daughter 14 or 15 years old has to wear a bathing suit and swim with boys under the name of physical education and don't mention the lgbt movement and what they're teaching the boys at school in elementary school that gays are okay and uh uh to have parents both men is okay to have two fathers is okay to have two mothers is okay so if this is the case then migration is a must what are you waiting for the ayah is crystal clear i've read it to you and allah made it plain straight and simple the angels will take you straight to hell when they take your soul because they'll ask you what were you doing why didn't you travel wasn't allah's earth spacious enough for you to leave if you refused then this is what will happen unfortunately you"
