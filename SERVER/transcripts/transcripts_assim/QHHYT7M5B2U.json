  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] Malayala Manorama salat wa salam ala rasulina Han Kareem assalamu alaikum and welcome to another episode of life adornments we will be discussing child rearing with benefits the child and tribulations the struggles Allah subhanAllah Allah says no Quran al mal will be known Xena told Hiatt in dunya and he says Allah subhanAllah lesesne Quran that zu Ianelli nationality milanesa even been in the allah has beautified for men allow a woman and children so we are our joy to have children they bring joy in people's life there are sunshine in our lives however it is upon us to know what does the Quran say what is this one I say how do we do it in a way that is pleasing to us promote to Allah and it is in accordance with the Sunnah of the Prophet SAW Allah higher Salam to help us with these matters we have Shaykh awesome Luqman and I came here today with us our honored guest was a teacher at that Academy and a teacher at KIU and he has been a man and teacher for over 30 years bismillah Masha Allah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wa alaikum Salam orihime villaggio barakato thank you so much for joining us today Hakeem Olajuwon for having me so hundred that we would like to begin by discussing the Sun and of Shaving a child's head ok miss me I would handle all sorts of semi-auto so did I hear audio sorry oh man I tell you be Hoda now this is weird why would anyone shave the head of a newborn this is not logical a point of disclaimer we are Muslims we follow whatever our Creator tells us so for someone who is agnostic for an atheist for a nun Muslim you cannot logic some not all some of the instructions in Islam because this is not how it works you have to go to the root which is do you believe in the existence of one God the creator of all the first without the beginning the last without an end do you believe in that if it's disputable we can talk our way through it not anything else if you believe then we move on to step number two do you believe that such knowledge knowledgeable God such powerful such wise would create this perfection universe the perfect universe and leave it without any guidance there's not logical even Apple when they make a new iPhone they put a manual to it to how to use it so he says logical no he will definitely guide this you know so we talk about the Quran and how authentic it is and it is false proof and it is the perfect in the last revelation of Allah so then we talk about the Prophet I serve as a messenger once you believe then you become a Muslim we can talk afterwards and express your submission as a citizen of my government I cannot object to what my government says if they tell me you have to stop when a traffic write light is red I don't have the ability to argue it why not when it's yellow why not when it's purple why choose red no you have to comply now this sets the stage for non-muslims to understand where we're coming from instead of just Simon Says no everything has a logic to it so now when a child is born there are a number of etiquettes a lot of such etiquettes were proven medically such as the issue of technique which is taking a very small piece of date which is sweet and shooing it and then taking the chewed a bit and put it in the palate of the child of the newborn mouth so that it's the first thing the child tastes this amount of glucose has a lot of medical benefits now as Muslims who cares whether Monessen says that's good or not good we're Muslims we do whatever we are told to do without any questions asked having said that 99.9% of all of Islam rituals are scientifically proven maybe there is 0.1 0.5 1% that medicine did not reach the level to prove that as Muslims it doesn't make any difference because we submit our will to the Creator because we have the firm conviction of his existence of his wisdom of his power of his knowledge and we submit to him now going back to your question part of the etiquettes when a new child is born is what the Prophet taught us Ali his salatu wassalam that the hair the head of the newborn should be shaved on the seventh day of his birth a frequently asked question how to determine the seventh day well it's a rule of thumb if the child was born on a Saturday the seventh day would be a deer earlier so next Friday is the seventh day if he was born on a Tuesday then by default it is Monday is a Monday so people think that seventh day is Saturday it's a Saturday no so this is the seventh day shaving it has to be done discreetly in a nice way by someone who knows what he's doing without the possibility of harming the child so if you are afraid if you're not that confident if there is no one to do this skipping it is not sinful it's a recommended thing to do it is highly recommended islamically and also medically what was the words that the Prophet used on his salat ocean answers to instruct us to do this he says shave his head and he said Amir - and who'll ever remove the filth or the harmful thing from his head because when a newborn comes out there are lots of things attached to his scalp discharges and whatever from where he was so in order to let the scalp breathe and the hair to grow freely and healthy shaving it adds a lot of value to the baby born in the past before Islam the idol worshipers it was a tradition among the Arabs that they would soak a piece of cotton in blood and then they would smear the scalp after shaving with this blood whether this is sacrificed for the gods whether this is an Arab tradition Islam came to abolish this and the Prophet said that it was not instead to put perfume and other narrations its saffron on the shaved head and I don't personally know what are the medical benefits of this we need professionals to look into it and find out and whether they come up with with with with things that are positive or not regardless the hadith is authentic and doing it it's just part of the Sunnah yeah well speaking about traditions that came from pre-islamic era that flowed into Islam one of the practices were slaughtering so how do we reconcile this practice that was pre in pre Islam where they would at times slaughter and in the name of their gods and different things so when we come in Islam where we do slaughter but it's for the sake of Allah spirit are only of course part of the etiquettes of receiving a newborn is to offer sacrifice and slaughtering in Islam is a sacrifice that a person offers to Allah as ocean we don't have altars we don't have a special place to dedicate this in rather it is a form of expressing your gratitude to a logical in know celerity well new Sookie so my prayer and my sacrifice is for allah azza wajal and Allah Azza WA JAL stated that in a pinnacle cosas facade Lee Lee Rebecca 1/2 we have given you the river culture in Paradise so pray to your Lord and offer your sacrifice by a now which is a way of slaughtering but for add for big animals like camels and and cows so sacrificing is a form of expressing your gratitude to Allah Azza WA JAL when it comes to a newborn the Sunnah is to slaughter two sheep or two Rams or two goats on behalf of a baby boy and if you are blessed with a baby girl then you slaughter one sheep or one ram or one a goat regardless of the gender whether male or female this it doesn't make any difference okay the gods - for many people who can't afford that is it is there something that can be done in place of that in terms of giving sadaqa or feeding people things of this or does this fall in line with the okay ah no this is a ritual that has to be followed as given to us so if you are unable to sacrifice there's no substitute of fasting a given number of days or paying cash or feeding wheat or dates instead not only that this is a highly sooner so if you can't afford it there's no obligation on whatsoever upon you but the Prophet told the Salahi's salatu salams that every child is pawned now the word pawned not like in a pawn shop yeah or in others translated at ads translated as mortgages mortgage so no it means that your freedom your livelihood is connected to this our pika once it is slaughtered then you're set free so this is why scholars said that those whose parents did not offer this a paper they can offer it for themselves so now if my mom comes and says listen when you were young we didn't have money within offers opteka should I do it now as I'm a grown up man there's no problem babysitting says there's no problem the Imams of Islam the scholar says no problem of doing it but it is an obligation oh it's not an obligation is something of a recommendation come do that thank you for this explanation share viewers we're going to pause for a short break but we'll be right back to continue this episode of life adornments stay tuned until you come back assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullahi wa dhakkir - welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments and this portion of our segment we will continue discussing the slaughter that is done for the child when they are born the question that oftentimes come up is what should be done with the meat who should it should be distributed to should we eat all of it ourselves should we give it to our neighbors should we give it to our families or should we have a gathering where people can come and you know enjoy the meat in this way see there isn't anything prescribed as far as over here and up here by the way is a sacrifice that is slaughtered on the Eid of up how we have two days per year where Muslims celebrate middle footer which follows Ramadan the month of fasting and idul adha which is commemorating the season of pilgrimage of hatch which happens on the 12th month of the lunar or the Islamic calendar so on the 10th day of that month it is the 8th and the feast of Muslims worldwide and especially for those performing Hajj the Sunnah is to sacrifice a ram a sheep a cow a camel wherever you want from these types and the Sunnah is as scholars say - divided into three portions a portion that you give to the poor a portion that you give as a gift to your loved ones neighbors relatives and a portion a third that you eat from when it comes to RTR some scholars say that we should divide them or it in the same fashion others say no what is intended is to sacrifice and to make the blood gush and come out from this sacrifice this is what we're supposed to do whatever you do with the meat it's up to you so you want to divide into three thirds and do with it as you do out here that's good you want to make a meal the whole thing and invite loved ones and relatives and friends that's cool you want to keep it all in the fridge and consume it over the period of a month or two that's even permissible but of course whenever you give something for charity it is always a best thing to do so on the ass like that thing that's mentioned there is doing to camp our sheep or something like this if a person was to say I would like to have a camel or a cow in this particular number to swap out for this or if I had triplets and I wanted to have like a camel instead with these like my new details do they matter or does it well well actually this is an issue of dispute again and maybe to clarify this for the viewers in hatch each pilgrim is supposed to slaughter one sheep if his house is the mature or Quran those who did not go for pilgrimage they are also instructed to slaughter one sheep on behalf of the whole household you and your children and your parents who are living with you under your roof you you slaughter one sheep for everyone but there is always also another option where the prophet called Allison told us that each budino and Bethany refers to a camel or a cow would be equivalent to seven sheep so if seven people come and pay equal amount of money to slaughter one camel this suffices for them as seven people while they can only slaughter a sheep each so in hatch seven sheep equals a camel or a cow some jurors said hmm this is interesting so when I'm slaughtering a Activa for my newborn can I also share with others or if I have triplets like you've said and all of the three are boys so I have to slaughter six sheep can I slaughter one cow or one camel and I have a portion extra for the sake of Allah scholars say note said that this is not permissible you have to slaughter two sheep or two animals for a baby boy and one animal for a baby girl regardless of the nature so what would be best to slaughter two camels two cows or two sheep the answer would be just lauder two sheep but check the meat coming from two camels or two cows is humongous is is a lot compared to two sheep yes but the Sunnah is to slaughter in a kippah sheep so it's best to stick with that once the slaughter is done the meat is prepared what do we do in an event itself we call people to come and feed them should the Quran be what read for the newborn what is her sweets be given what are some other practices that should be done at the event itself all of this is not part of the Sunnah or an recitation gathering people to make duaa all of this is not part of the Sunnah of the feast the Akita itself the Sunnah is to shave the heads the the newborns hair or head and to collect the hair and to weigh it and give its weight in silver as charity this process might be a little bit difficult now to take something like 2 3 grams of hair to a jeweler's shop and ask him to weigh it and if you just pay like 50 reals or $10 as charity that would be much more than enough hamdulillah this is part of the rituals but what you do with the food itself it's up to you as I said you can your relatives and eat you can distribute it and if you distribute it some scholars say that when you slaughter a sheep you should not break the bones of it and they claim that this is sort of believing in Good Omens so I don't break the bone of the sheep so that Allah would not break the bones of the newborn when it's grown up but this is baseless why is it recommended to give the whole arm or the whole thigh as a whole without chopping it or breaking it they say because this is good for the poor if you chop it you'll give the poor a small amount but if you give the poor person the whole part which is one out of four a quarter of the slaughtered animal that would be much in his favor now you mentioned some time on the clarification when you said that is it it's not a part of the Sunnah for a Koran and want to be made does this mean that it shouldn't be done at all or is it just not part of this endure but not against it as well well it's not part of the Sunnah to recite the Quran or to have what they call Kewanee in some of the sub-continent the doora it's an issue of dispute some of the Salaf used to collect on the feast righteous people so that they eat from it and they make dua for him or instead he makes do and they say I mean and it is reported in some of the hadith and this is not a problem but it's not authentic from the the Sunnah of the Prophet himself the doing of the Prophet himself is not part of that and Allah knows best and closing the issue the matter of the Archaea are there any other things that should be done in terms of the ceremony so not nothing that I can think of if you can think come of of something maybe okay yeah not now I don't remember anything you're missing okay and I believe the next step would be then the circumcision okay the circumcision is mandatory for baby boys and it is highly recommended to be done on the seventh day because the child at this age would not feel the pain and it's easier to control and alhamdulillah this is a Sunnah if done later on or a little bit earlier this is no problem it must be done by professionals and not by amateurs or people who are not experienced because this is a very sensitive and serious issue it is mandatory upon men males boys to be circumcised so even if a person accepts Islam later on and he's a grown up man it is mandatory to perform circumcision is his Islam related to his circumcision or impacted meaning that if he doesn't circumcise then he's not a Muslim no this is only sinful if his fear is genuine and is really you know afraid of it we could say yeah okay try to cool down and find a way but we don't say that it is related to him being a Muslim or not it's just a a sin that he has to overcome and try to purify himself because it impacts also his purity after urinating it reduces his sexual pleasure if not circumcised in a relationship to someone who is among other benefits but among goal or above all is that this is part of a religion female circumcision is an issue of dispute and this point or this issue is a focal point to the enemies of Islam now they don't call it female circumcision they call it female genital mutilation FGM they highlight it to just express how they think Islam humilate swimmin subjugates women tortures women and this is totally bogus and baseless Islam does not have female genital mutilation Islam has female circumcision and it's not obligatory now you have to underline this and they have to come side-by-side it's not like male circumcision which is mandatory and obligatory female circumcision is not mandatory at all it is a Sunnah if you want to do it you can do it but with conditions the one who does it has to be a medical professional who knows how to perform it and not to exaggerate as this negatively impact the sexuality of a female when she grows up and deprives her from enjoying it so this is not mandatory at all in Arabia in so many places in Islamic countries no one practices it we don't practice it practice it at all because we don't have professionals to do it and we don't have the need to do it so why is it sooner share this is Sunnah maybe in some cultures it is required to reduce undesirable desires rather in most countries most regions there's no need for it so you cannot say that this is an Islamic aspect that Islam subjugate women that some torches one no it's not it's not mandatory it's not obligatory and once performed it has to be performed by professional medicals medical professionals and not by any Tom Dick or Harry because this is a serious thing now it is very difficult to find any so if someone leaves it there's no problem in that inshallah yeah so just for clarification Islam does not in any way shape or form support female genital mutilation definitely and I and and a circumcision is done in terms of the the girl that day is done with condition as well correct and it is not mandatory correct yeah I think this is a very pertinent information because many Islamic countries of Muslim countries practice it and they make it mandatory and they do exaggerate many times in a female generation these if I may correct and interrupt it's not many Muslim countries it's only done in one or two African countries and not part of Islam part of the African culture so it's not practiced in Indonesia where you have 250 million Muslims Malaysia in Arabia in India and Pakistan nobody does this is one point like seven billion don't do it maybe 50,000 or 100,000 a person does it and and this is not at all significant to the total population of the Muslims thank you for the clarification thank you for joining us we'd like to thank our Sheikh and I guess for giving us this crucial information talk on these topics and enlightenment until next time we thank you for viewing the show thank you for participating stay tuned for our next episode of life's adornments until next time I said am i alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music]"
