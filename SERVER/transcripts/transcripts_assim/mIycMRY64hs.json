  "transcript": "okay so my question is that there are many circles in our country you know Shia and ambali and uh Etc you know different image in different ways I had read actually a hadees in which the Bruce Will said that praise namas like you have seen me praying and I read below that uh I don't know how to tell you but they're very like they do in Masjid al-haram so please guide me how to pray Namaz incorrectly if you want to pray correctly according to the way that the prophet prayed that is there is a small book compiled by al-sheikh muhammadin and it's the description of the prophet's prayer there's a small booklet byz another booklet by Sheikh binary mean also on the same topic and if you're not satisfied with something that is in writing if you go to my YouTube channel there's an hour an hour long video that is about the description of the prophet's prayer how the prophet prayed and it's free and it's on YouTube alhamdulillah you can watch that and learn from the authentic Hadith and you can see and and visualize it and see it in front of you in video and I hope this answers your question"
