  "transcript": "so in my home country of pakistan there are many uh masjids in my area in which them and mr martin before giving the then says is the literal light of allah then would it be permissible to pray behind him without asking him about his akrita as it's possible that he believes islam is the light of allah or must i ask him what he believes before appearing behind them generally speaking relvies are not following the methodology and the update of allah and they have grave mistakes and some of these mistakes can take someone out of the fold of islam we don't say that they're out of the fold of islam those who say these things that make them out of the fault of islam and we clarify it to them and we show them leviticus from the quran and they insist in this case it's a different story but generally speaking would i pray in a brave masjid never why would i i'd rather pray in a normal masjid i'd pray in my hotel room rather than going to a place where i know they have grave mistakes one of them which you have mentioned that the prophet allah was not created from clay like everyone else he was created from the light of allah and this by itself is blasphemous to say such a thing now some of them may water it down and say no no we did not mean this we meant that and this and that but again this is something that was not said neither in the quran or in the sunnah and claiming such a heinous claim is unbelievable unspeakable and should be not slip so definitely do not pray there go somewhere else or or look for other muslims who follow the akida al-jamaa and pray with them you"
