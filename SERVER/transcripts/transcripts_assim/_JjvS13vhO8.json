  "title": "How to wisely advise a non practicing family who innovate or  do shirk? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "from the us she says my family are on some form of shirk innovation believing in superstitions and so hale's question is almost the same about an advice to the parents how to and the relatives who are doing wrong things how to deal with them first of all put yourself in their shoes the size is going to be much bigger but yeah hypothetically put yourself in their place meaning if you were to be advised by a minor a young son or a member of the family who is no one who has just grown up after being a child would you take their advice um positively and accept it people differ and this is why we in the beginning tend to be a bit aggressive i used to be like this i can hear people say oh sure you're still aggressive no i'm not i was way aggressive in the sense that when i started practicing practicing almost 40 years ago and everybody around me in the family in the neighborhood were not practicing at all if they prayed that's good but everything was totally westernized in my family and when i started practicing i started looking at things as the moral police as the religious police this is bad this is wrong put your seat belt on you don't have a driving license what are you doing what so all what i used to do is correct people and this is the worst type of dawah when you just sit and criticize put yourself in your house with your wife if you only criticize her cooking the way she cleans the way she irons the clothes the way she speaks or looks you're not a good person let alone that she would file for divorce yesterday this is not the way you have to encourage you have to make people love you so in the beginning it was very rough but couple of years later when one started to gain more knowledge to know and learn how the prophet used to behave alaihis was what is the meaning of the different verses of the quran describing the way of the prophet in dawah and how kind intolerant he was once you really fill yourself up with the sun of the prophet salam then you know how to prioritize when to speak and when to refrain when to compliment and when to criticize when to maybe live with them for a couple of months or more without talking about islam at all some people are so sensitive because of our wrongdoings the moment you say oh subhanallah they are offensive to us why you said subhanallah now you're going to lecture me now you're going to tell tell me that i'm i'm heading to hell i didn't say that i just said subhan allah they're sensitive because of my continuous way of trying to persuade them to do this or that now if i try to change by being me being kind being helpful do you want me to take you to to the mall okay come sis i'll take you to the mall oh my brother is taking me to the mall he never done such a thing i never speak to her about anything about islam for a couple of months showing them that i'm a different person making them love me against their will once they love me they trust me and they think of me the world then i try to slowly show them evidences from the quran and the sunnah and why do i emphasize on the quran because those who are in shirk or innovation or believe in superstitions usually if you just tell them well sheikh bin bad or the scholar or that scholar they are on their toes and in in they're like a cat that uh arc arches her back ready to attack why because the names you mentioned go totally against their beliefs and what their peers and scholars believe so don't do that learn where sheikh bin bazen bin athameen and the great scholars of islam took that knowledge from from the quran and whenever you speak to them this is what allah says so if they start biting you say allah says and one should not backbite others it's in the quran i didn't bring anything from me yeah we're not backbiting them we're telling the truth okay show them the hadith in the sahih the prophet said that backbiting is mentioning your brother with something that he hates which is in him which is true but he's not present so now you've cornered them and you don't do this on regular basis like 24 7 you select the times sometimes yeah i should do and speak sometimes i shouldn't people who do not pray on time or who commit shirk or who do heinous things you don't go to them and say excuse me you know that it's from the sunnah to trim your fingernails what is this fingernails come at the bottom of the list of your priorities focus on tahit focus on prayer focus on avoiding innovation but you have to do it tactically and allah knows best you"
