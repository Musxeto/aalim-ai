  "transcript": "so any religion when challenged to present their miracles they fail to do so we muslims believe in their miracles by the way because our religion confirms it but they don't believe in one another's miracles and they can't prove it themselves because they had not seen it themselves islam is different because we have the miracle with us and we show it to the whole world allah azzawajal chose to reveal the best of his books the quran through the best of his angels the archangel gibril to the best of his creation in the best of nights and there is the night of decree in one of the most beautiful months the month of ramadan in the most sacred land and there is mecca all of this allah azza has given to us the followers of muhammad ali the muslims so that this quran would be the ultimate revelation that abrogates everything that came before it and would succeed to remain till the end of time now quran is a book of miracles and it's something that is not so huge or big you have all seen the quran allah has made it easy to remember to ponder upon to study and it is easy it is full of miracles scientific achievements though the arabs when it was revealed to them might have not reached the level of knowledge and science to comprehend all of it but they accepted it and they embraced it they believed that it was one of a kind literally they believe it was one of a kind linguistically and on the literature level so eloquent so fluent and easy yet so profound and powerful they believed that and they were the people who were masters of the language"
