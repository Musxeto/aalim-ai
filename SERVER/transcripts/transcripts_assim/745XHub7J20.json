  "transcript": "Al Hadith number 72 this Hadith tells us and explains to us where an individual should stand when praying with another person in the Hadith of an Malik we learned that if they were two or more they should constitute a row but what about if it's an individual Hadith 73 Hadith of Abdullah Abbas tells us what to do who will read this for us inshallah narrated Abbas once I passed the night in the house of my aunt myuna the prophet stood for the night prayer and I joined him and stood on his left side but he drew me to his right by holding me by the head Al bukari okay okay then the Hadith is quite clear IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him spent the night purposely at the house of his aunt and he pretended to be asleep it's a longer virgin and the author took only the portion that is required but the longer version goes to say that he spent the night to watch how the prophet Alam used to pray night prayer and this shows you that a student of knowledge acquires knowledge through any means possible and does not wait until knowledge comes to him he goes in Pursuit for that knowledge and that is why Abbas may Allah be pleased with him he used to travel from Mecca to Medina to here and there following the companions of the Prophet Alat to learn from them and in one incident it was stated I'm not sure if the sahabi is zit or jab abdah I forgot but he went to his house and he was told that he was asleep so he took his cloak rolled it used it as a pillow and slept at the doorsteps of the house when it was time for ass the companion came out of his house and found Abdullah Abbas sleeping at his doorsteps so he said may Allah have mercy and forgiveness over you Abdullah Abbas wouldn't you have woken me up he said no we were instructed to do this with our Scholars now who's saying this the cousin of the Prophet Alat wasam one of the greatest Companions of the prophet and Scholars of Islam yet he was Junior to the other companions because they were all older than he was and that is why he was respectful to them and getting the knowledge one of the people of Medina says he says abdah Abbas is much smarter than me and his companions told him why he said when we were young in our teens he said to me don't you see that the companions of the Prophet Alam are so many why not go and learn from them and then I looked at him and said Abbas do you think that the people one day will need you and me why should we learn the companions are so many he says so he left me and 10 20 years later look what had happened IB Abbas is one of the greatest Scholars of Islam a great companion of the Prophet all the people go for him for fatwa and for knowledge and look at me I'm your regular guy so this shows you if you have a Target and the target is sincere for the sake of Allah when you're young when you're strong when you don't have anything to occupy your time or engage you with then you have potentials with the grace of Allah you will go places you'll become a scholar you'll become an Imam you will become a point of reference to people but if you don't if you neglect and say no I would like to focus on my studies and this and in that I would like to go and play football I would like to spend some time reading comic books or Harry Potter or whatever then you will find that the people have advanced and left you way ahead of you and it's very difficult for you to catch up and this what makes a person a potential scholar a potential leader and Imam and any normal human being there is a difference you can tell by the energy and the enthusiasm in acquiring knowledge in occupying his time or your time in something that is useful I Abbas look what he used to do when he was young spend the night instead of going to play football or have fun with the kids spend the night so that he can observe and he did not tell the prophet Alam he pretended to be asleep so he saw the prophet when he performed wo when he slept when he woke up in the middle of the night and he made wo again and he recited the last 10 ay of Surah Al to the arrest of the A and then he started to pray once he started to pray he jumped and stood to the left of the Prophet Alat wasam and the prophet corrected him by holding his head and bringing him to his right hand side and from this we learn where a man should stand next to another if they're praying in Jama the IM to the left and the mum to the right now should there be a gap between them should the Imam be a little bit forward some Scholars said yes but the most authentic opinion is that there is no evidence they should stand shoulder Tosh shoulder of course the Imam should be a little bit in line or a little bit ahead but never the M should be ahead of his IM and from this Hadith also we learn that the difference of Ni does not affect the prayer in case of the IM and the M how is that the prophet started the prayer as what as mid as an individual and then the middle of the prayer he changed it from Individual into congregation so this is permissible why do I say this because a lot of the Muslims get cold feet and they freeze when when they pray after for example and someone who did not pray come and stand next to them and tap them on the shoulder saying I'm praying with you you're my Imam or if three or four come behind him and they tap him lightly so that he would be their Imam a lot of the Muslims what do they do they freeze I'm how can I tell them that I'm praying Sunnah how you don't have to okay should I change my ni into but I've prayed okay initially I'm going to pray two should I change it and pray four don't change anything you praying two as continue praying and once you finish offer Salam and they will complete their prayer so so you can change your intention from Individual into an Imam you can also change your intention from an IM to a m a follower as we will get to know this inshallah and there is nothing wrong in that suppose the person the IM he breaks wind while he's offering Salah then one of the M can go ahead very good if the Imam nullifies his prayer or something happens to him the man who was praying behind him who was a follower a m now turns to be an IM also there is a case but we will come to know this later on if the Imam comes if they call for the prayer and a substitute leads the prayer the first raak and all of a sudden while they are were in the middle of the first raak the IM comes what does the Imam do he instructs the person leading the prayer to go and he leads the prayer and we will get to know this inshallah later on so in short you do not have to have the intention to be an Imam when you begin a prayer you can shift and you can pray according to what you need as long as you are praying with a ni and the M or the follow is praying with a different Nia this is okay what's not okay is for you to change your Nia from voluntary into f for example this is not uh permissible but what is the ruling on if I was praying two of and the people came to pray behind me who were late and could not pray came to pray with me m prayer should I raise my voice or keep it as it is now I'm leading but I'm praying my two Sunnah so what do you think those who say I must continue my prayer silently raise your hands 1 2 3 4 5 6 okay those who say that I may raise my voice as if I'm praying or raise your hands and they are the majority and they are the right ones to say let's give you a rule of thumb what is the ruling on raising the voice in loud prayers and keeping my voice down in silent prayers is it WAMU alaikum and welcome back we move on to a chapter that deals with IM this IM we're referring to is the leadership of the prayer and what are the rules and regulations governing this great form of worship and we know that the best of all imams is the prophet so how would we learn the rules of imama by observing his prayer and how the companions may Allah be pleased with them used to do with him and it was he the prophet who said it was the IM was only made so that people would follow him and he's the one who said pray as you have seen me pray so by combining these two hadiths we can get a hint inshallah of what to do Hadith number 74 yes brother narrated Abu hura the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam said isn't he who raises his head before the IM afraid that Allah May transform his head into that of a donkey or his figure face into that of a donkey alari in this Hadith we learned that part of praying behind an Imam is that you do not raise your head before him you do not act before him and we will get to get more and more details about this because Scholars say that the movements are four either you move ahead of your IM so just as he's saying Allah you're already on the floor and the guy is still upstairs what are he doing so this is completely prohibited because you are doing it in advance or you do it too late when the Imam goes for suud Allah abbar they wait and watch people all doing sujud and they're doing this nobody's watching them as the IM is about to raise his head they go and prostrate and this is completely forbidden as well the third way is to immediately do it with him step by step not before him and not after him so as he is going for the r you all go together and this also happens in concluding the prayer I've seen here a lot of the Muslims when the says they're all doing this with him as he goes to the left they all go to the left and the most authentic opinion is that after he finishes the second Tas you start to make your first tasim and that is why a lot of the Muslims when they offer Salam with the IM and they leave the Imam if he did a mistake and he wants to prostrate for sahu they have already stood up or continuing their prayer because they're hastening in doing this no you should take your time so following the IM exactly with him is Mak the first two is Haram the third one is Mak this is not recommended the fourth type is that you follow him meaning that you do not move until he reaches the following pillar so if he's in the standing position he says allahar you don't move until he is completely in the ru position then you move when he falls to prostrate you do not move until his forehead reaches the ground and then you bend your back and knees and fall to the ground and we will get more inshallah into this as we go on in this Hadith the prophet wasam is warning us that those who raise their heads from the Bowing position or from the suud position will be they might be and the threat is that their heads may turn into the heads of a donkey we know that this had not happened alhamdulillah however the scholars say that because it did not happen this does not mean it will not Allah is capable but we don't know when Allah chooses this and some Scholars say that those who raise their heads before their Imam their heads turned into the head of a donkey but metaphorically in the sense that those who do this are like donies and their stupidity and their idiot manner because they're doing something as if they're racing with the Imam and unfortunately a lot of the Muslims are like this racing the IM but will you ever be able if you are in your bus to reach the station before the bus no matter what you do if you go from the back of the bus to the front very quickly you'll still reach the station after the bus so likewise when you start a prayer will you ever be able to conclude it before the Imam take your time then take your time this is one of the ways of knowing how to feel you're not going anywhere until the concludes a prayer so take your time say sub and and consider it and contemplate in it don't say I did 20 mallah so what do three with with concentration better than 100 Islam focuses on quality not on quantity the Islam focuses on quality we want to have 1,000 good Muslims rather than having a million of carry on Muslims or drive through Muslims these are not proper Muslims we would like to have quality so the prophet is giving this threat sallallahu alaihi wasallam to make the people aware the issue of praying behind an Imam is based on discipline and it teaches the Muslims to be disciplined and whenever you find Muslims undisciplined you know that their Islam is is on shaky grounds we move on to Hadith 75 and 706 and these two hadiths are very important and essential but before that do we have any questions we have three questions shik this is regarding uh Hadith 72 on Baraka which you mentioned uh I have read that khed bin he had two hairs of the holy prophet s wasallam which he used to keep in his cap now what was was it for inspiration blessings or out of love for the prophet we've stated my brother that the prophet was the only one that was permissible for us to seek Baraka through him so by having his hair some of the companions had this and this was completely legitimate he himself on when he was prevented from offering so Allah instructed him to make from his by shaving his head and by slaughtering his Hadi and so he did and he instructed the companions to take parts of his hair not only that the mother of anas it was reported in authentic Hadith that the prophet slept in her house napped and he was sweating so she took a small bottle and collect Ed the sweat of the prophet in that bottle and the prophet woke up and said what are you doing and she said that we are putting it with our musk and with our perfume and it makes it the best of perfumes and the prophet and and did not elaborate so Scholars say that this is only for the prophet Alat and his traces look at these stories initially to know the status of the Prophet Alam in our hearts we do not worship him he's only human being but he is the top of the latter he's the best of all human beings sallallahu alhi wasallam he's a servant of Allah he's the chosen one and he is the only one that we are allowed to seek the blessing and favor of Allah when he was alive but after his death we have to prove that these hair belongs to him or this sword or this cloak or these slippers or whatever and this is not possible today so whatever you heard about the companions it was true inshallah second question in thei number 73 about when he said took him from his head and brought him to the side from the back or from the front yes this is a usual question that people ask and we do not have an explanation or a detail but most likely if it was from the front this is permissible because this is not him passing intentionally this is the prophet taking him to correct his position and this is inshallah permissible and there's nothing wrong in that I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program if you have any questions write them down inshallah we will try to devote more time for your questions next time so until then la"
