  "title": "The Prophet ‎ﷺ  admonishing his poet, Ka’b ibn al Malik assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "The army set off. Every day he would say, tomorrow I will go. I'll catch up with them in a while. And he kept on postponing it until it was too late. That was considered to be a sort of desertion, as if he deserted the army. So when the Prophet came back, alayhis salatu wasalam, he admonished him and said to him, why didn't you join us? Didn't you have a ride to accompany us? Did you have money enough? And he apologized by saying, I had no excuse, O Prophet of Allah. And you know what the story happened. The Prophet did not let it go. He admonished him."
