  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the US I have \nan interesting question sheik,   I wanted to ask like sometimes you want to \ngo next prayers with jamaa'a and the people   are praying and maybe they're already maybe at \nDhuhr and almost finishing so you have maybe to   make it with them and maybe feel like taking \nout air like farting or something like that   can you hold it and make the prayer with them \nor should you release air and then make wudu   again and you're fearing your gonna miss the \njamaa'a with the imaam so you did not join yet   yeah I did not join them yet but you \nknow I feel like taking out air and I   don't want to and and is this something that's \nhappening frequently or once in a blue moon   uhh it happens once in a blue moon but when \nit starts it can go the whole day okay I will   answer you so the issue is the Prophet (Peace \nand Blessings be Upon him) prohibited us form   attending the prayer when the food is served or \nwe are suppressing answering the call of nature   and why is that because the essence of salah \nis to contemplate to have submissiveness and   to concentrate on it so that you would \ntaste its sweetness and benefit from it   if you're agitated because you need to answer \nthe call of nature but you're suppressing it   or you're starving and the food is served and \nyou're praying while thinking of the food and   you can hear you're stomach making weird \nsounds this defies the purpose of salah so   the Prophet (Peace and Blessings be Upon \nhim) says no answer your call of nature   its gonna take a few minutes then attend the \nprayer if its gone no problem pray on your own   or with a second congregation likewise with \nthe food eat until you don't feel starved or   so eager to consume the food so your mind is \nfree from thinking about how tasty the food is   and pray and in your case if your suppressing \nthe urge to release gas or to release wind   if it is so overwhelming to the point where you \nfeel that if you pray its not gonna be a good   prayer you're gonna be agitated and so preoccupied \nwith it in this case we say no go release whatever   needs to be released and perform wudu and come and \npray whatever is still there remaining or make a   new jamaa'a or pray on your own because this is \nonce every blue moon however if you feel that   you can suppress it because its not something \nof urgency its something that's within control   and you can suppress it and still enjoy the \nprayer in this case we tell you do suppress it"
