  "transcript": "The Prophet said: in the name of Allah with whose \nname nothing is harmed on Earth   nor in the heavens and he is the \nAll-Seeing the all-knowing three times what does this that entail it entails that you \nare beginning your day and you are concluding   your night or evening in the name of Allah \nacknowledging that he is the protector that   nothing can harm you or harm anything else in the \nheavens or in the earth without his permission   and he's all hearing and he's all-knowing you say \nthat three times with conviction how would your   day be how do you think you're going to go about \nyour business with lots of confidence trusting   Allah azzawajal now some may say that okay I say \nthe Dua and I had a car accident and I felt sick   and this and that happened how could this be uh \npossible Scholars say that this is the dua it has   conditions and if the conditions were fulfilled \nthe dua would fit sometimes people say it   neglectively not paying attention or concentration \nto it sometimes people don't say it as in the case   of Aban Ibn Othman the narrator of this Hadith \nhe said that there was one day I forgot to say   it and I got half paralyzed so you never know when \nthe Dua would not be effective because there is a   possibility that you are not paying attention or \nconcentrating and this is where you will go wrong"
