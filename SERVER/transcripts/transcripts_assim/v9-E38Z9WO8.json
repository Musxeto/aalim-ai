  "transcript": "from tunisia what's the ruling on following weak hadiths it's an issue of dispute some scholars say that it is permissible to follow weak hadith providing it does not have to do anything with akida and it does not state things that are halal or haram and it talks about the virtues of voluntary deeds such as six raka's after maghrib between maghrib and aisha such as four raka's after isha equivalent to laylatul blah blah other scholars say allah azza pledged upon himself to protect the vikr which is the quran and having weak hadiths goes against this so as long as it's not authentic this is not part of the deen and i'm inclined to follow this opinion that allah has preserved the hadiths that are authentic so there is no need to come up with weak hadiths and say that okay we can add this part of the diker part of the prayers part of the voluntary deeds because there is no need for that and allah you"
