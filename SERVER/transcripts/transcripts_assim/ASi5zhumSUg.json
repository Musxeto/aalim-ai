  "transcript": "Adi Kunal from Nigeria Assalamu Alaikum Salam wa Rahmatullah My question is that if one organizes an event and if one segregates the halls for males and females and then after the event if there's still you know there's a limit to which one can control really between families and friends and if there is a sort of you know mix like a you know pre-mixing after the event you know just by segregating the halls you know taking pictures together and so on so is one free of them or whatever happens if one you know organizes the events such as when the halls are segregated but of course one can't you know there's a limit to which one can control after the event Akhi, I am not good in understanding the accents that are not clear but I think I may have understood your question next you usually speak in a very good accent and I can understand the question I don't know what's happening today you're speaking like from zero to sixty in four seconds so if you're asking about a mixed gathering or a wedding or a feast where you segregate men from women because you're the host and you manage to segregate them but after the event takes place they go and mix against your will without being able to prevent that or stop it and they start to take pictures with one and one another in a mixed environment are you sinful the answer is if you cannot stop it no you're not sinful you did your due diligence by segregating it by separating it by making it clear to them that it's haram what happened happened afterwards there is no sin on you as long as you had nothing to do with it"
