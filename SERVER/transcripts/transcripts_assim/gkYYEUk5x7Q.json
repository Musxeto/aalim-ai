  "transcript": "Aqsa says the pharmaceutical companies offer tours and other things if doctors prescribed their medication I want to ask is it permissible to take such offers if the company is good and their medicine also benefits the patients and what about the doctors that ask the companies for such offers for writing their medicine is it halal first of all we have to differentiate between doctors working for a clinic or a hospital and doctors who own the organization or the firm or the clinic or the hospital what's the difference there's a big difference now what the pharmaceutical companies is doing they are actually giving you a bribe I'm an orthopedic surgeon they come to me and they show me and give me a presentation of their medicine which they want me to promote but during the process they give me a ticket business class ticket for me my wife and my kids for a three days workshop in Sharm el-sheikh or in el hard AHA or in Dubai or anywhere so the the tickets are there the hotel has been paid for to me this is a dream holiday with my kids being paid for and I don't have to put a dime if I were not an orthopedic surgeon if I was an English teacher in high school would they have ever given me a single penny not at all then they are giving you this as a bribe for your position and this is totally prohibited you're getting paid for your job you can't take a single penny them not even a watch share not even a set of pens not a a and a PDA nothing if you were the owner of the clinic or the hospital then whatever they give you is not a bribe because there is no conflict of interest providing you fear allah azza wajal and not mandate their medicine to be circulated in your clinic if it's a good one and if it's the best one no problem but just because they did you this favor in return I would promote their products this is Haram so whatever the these pharmaceutical companies are given these are RIBA these are sorry bribes what about samples of medicine if these samples of medicine are free then there's no problem for you as a doctor to also give it freely to patients providing that it is actually worth giving out it's actually good as a medicine but to take such promotions a laptop a set of expensive pens for what this is a total bribe and the salesman for such pharmaceutical companies are also engaged in such a bribe the Prophet said allah√≠s a lot of Salaam land Allah who Russia will mortar she may allah azzawajal curse the one who gives the bribes and the one who receives it"
