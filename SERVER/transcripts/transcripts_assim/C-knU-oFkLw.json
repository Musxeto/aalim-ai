  "transcript": "so now I want to direct my next question to our respected shim uh dear dear shim Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is described as the most merciful the most loving 100 times in the Quran some might be struggling to understand this concept because mentioned just now it can be good it can be bad so they were asking they were questioning was saying that if Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is so merciful so loving but at the same time Allah punishes so they can't see the understanding of it so is it that when Allah become most merciful are not Allah cannot punish they couldn't see a contradictory position of Allah subhana tala how do we make it then clear about this first of all we have to believe even understand the beautiful names and attributes of Allah and without doing so you will fall into a lot of problems and confusion Allah is most merciful most compassionate most forgiven subhanahu the however he is also the most knowledgeable the wise and he owns this whole universe and he does what he pleases and what he wills and as mentioned in nobody dares to question or interrogate Allah While others are investigated interrogated and questioned so if you understand this concept and believe it you will have content in your heart you will never say why does Allah do this or that it's none of your business Allah owns the whole universe you have no right if I take 50 rings and I burn it nobody dares and say why do you do this I think your currency is waterproof uh fireproof I don't know I never tried it but maybe we should give it a shot if I do this this is my money I could do whatever I want with it and Allah has the highest of all examples now we know that Allah is knowledgeable and wise and just and fair so whatever he does you have to digest this and believe in it a young child and Allah has the highest of all examples goes to the doctor with his father the doctor says you have appendix we have to extract it the young child seven years of age looks at his father and the father says everything is going to be all right they take the child to prepare him for surgery they strip him out of his clothes they start to uh uh disinfect here disinfect the area and the the child looks at his father duh said it's okay everything is going to be fine they take him to the operating theater and he sees people with masks oxygen and and and anesthesia and the doctor gets his knife and starts sharpening it I don't know if it's or not but something close yeah you you get the point the the son's dad this is not good and the father says it's all right you have to trust your father's judgment because he knows more than you and Allah has the highest of all examples without night you can never appreciate sun light without illness you can never appreciate your health without feeling hungry you could never appreciate the taste of food and without calamities you could never appreciate the blessing of Iman huh how many calamities returned us back to Allah if not we would have gone astray and indulg in this dun and did everything left right and center but Allah returns us back to him sometimes an illness a sickness a disease an operation gets you back on track so many people come to me and say sh Allah blessed me with cancer so may Allah bless you alone why he said I was indulged in partying womanizing doing drugs but when I got the cancer I returned back to Allah and I saw the light so these calamities can be one of the greatest blessings of Allah I remember in 1990 when the Bosnian war was ongoing in Bosnia hasov I met few people from Bosnia and they said wall the war is one of the greatest blessings of Allah we returned back to Islam we were not Muslims so everything that Allah does w he does it with wisdom with knowledge and with complete fairness and for your own good all the tests and trials that our Prophet Muhammad Al went through they were all for his benefit and he was content he was happy with whatever was happening because he knows that he is in good hands and Allah Knows Best"
