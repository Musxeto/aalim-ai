  "transcript": "[Music] we know we have some Imam zakimama noi Imam IBN hajar who different with us in akeda but they were still Muslims because they were upon the correct definition of thorheed so how would we apply that situa like though that same situation right now with uh orlema today like uh from different uh movements it's good that you did not name anyone because I was almost getting my a gauge shotgun ready to shoot you but this is a common problem people come on social media or live TV and said sure so and so said so and so yeah come on what is this I have the the the the manner not to mention people's names like this this is not a place where we slander people this is a Circle of Knowledge yeah like let's say someone says so and so so I didn't have to take my eight gauge out um Scholars have clarified this and others said that these were not pure asharis they did not call for the attitude in many places of their books they have honored the ability but they fell in few mistakes out of their misunderstanding what we call Tech wheel so they misinterpreted by their own effort and knowledge thinking that this was the right thing to do which was done so the mistake was genuine there was no ill intent unlike when we have deviant sects who were 100 percent uh follow through with their deviancy and back it up and call people to it and fight others uh in defense of it that's a different issue to hold together this is why I said we have to differentiate between people who are full-fledged innovators and between those who do not intend to innovate but at the time this was their best and according to the knowledge they have that they have reached so we may pardon them for such a mistake and ask Allah for their forgiveness as in the case for example of some of the companions um uh who fell into the sin of drinking alcohol at the time of Roman and Omar asked them the companions ask him whether he believes in talks against his Halal or halam if he says this halal kill him for his apostasy if he says it's Haram and he gives you his justification simplify him because it's a sin so there's a difference between your conviction and belief and I hope this makes sense foreign"
