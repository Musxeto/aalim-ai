  "title": "When to say Rabbana wa lakal hamd - while rising or after standing up? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so sh I watched one of your videos which was about four years old and I was confused whether to say like in Salah we say after we stand up that was what I thought and when I watched one of your videos that was four years old it said you said that yes when we rise up then we see it but uh I saw another one of your videos which was a couple of months ago in it you said while we are rising then when we're in congregation so I'm confused which uh when should I say it what's the difference between the two uh when first is when I Rise up like completely when I'm fully fully standing then I say it or when I'm rising like while Rising okay first of all it is to be said while Rising now to rise from R to standing up is like a second and a half to say this is probably 3 seconds so inevitably while you're Rising you say you will be concluding half of it while in the standing position what is not recommended is to say it when you are fully erected and you say why these statements are known as the of movement a lot of people when they are in the standing position and they want to go to sujud imams especially they go ahead and make sujud and once they touch the ground they say allahar and this is wrong because they said allahar which is movement of of movement after they reached some of them no they do the opposite while they're standing they say allahar so that their voice would reach the microphone and then they go for r or for and this is problematic because the moment they say Allah everybody behind him would go for the ru or for the sujud so they would be ahead of the IM which which is very wrong this is not correct it is to be said while in between the positions while moving so likewise when the Imam says you rise and say maybe you rise you say and immediately you're you're standing up there's no problem in that and Allah Knows Best"
