  "transcript": "what is the ruling on wishing someone or Ramadan Mubarak when the ramzan starts and can we use the ramzan Karim this phrase please clarify it is part of the Customs among the Muslims to wish one another over these Seasons by saying Ramadan Mubarak I wish you a good Ramadan may Allah makes this Ramadan a blessed Ramadan and there is nothing wrong in that insha'allahu as for Ramadan Kareem some Scholars say that this is inappropriate because Ramadan is not generous in the sense that it has blessings and and good things to give for us it's Allah who is the one who gives these blessings and favors to us so it's inappropriate it's best to avoid it"
