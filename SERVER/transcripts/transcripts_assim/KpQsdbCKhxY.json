  "title": "Why can't we put Allah & Muhammad ﷺ beside each other, Using Allah & Muhammad ﷺ as WALL STICKERS",
  "transcript": "Osama from the U.S the Sheikh I I actually have a a couple of months back you posted uh with a response that uh Allah and Muhammad cannot be placed on a wall side by side you know you went into some strong points about elevating the the the level of prophet Muhammad with Allah I needed some clarification on that um so I've seen in my own Masjid actually with the tiles on the wall and if my memory serves me uh correct uh even in the Haram of course you have the Allah Clock Tower the big Allah but even if there's the on the sides of the Haram or many massages you have is Muhammad side by side so uh I asked my friend who was a student of knowledge he said it's not about the positioning that you have Allah on the left right or you know uh bottom top it's more about like people put you know the Kohl's in them over the thin and eichel Kursi uh as it's not permissible to put them as decoration pieces so my question is that I recently bought a wall sticker of Allah Muhammad and it can be reconfigured to put Allah on the top and Muhammad on the bottom so is it permissible for me to put that up provided that my intention is to remind me of Allah and you know increase my love for the prophet Salah salaam instead of you know my intention for having it as decoration as decoration it's a very basic sticker first of all what your student of knowledge friends said is a separate issue hanging verses of the Quran is not permissible because this is disrespecting the Quran claiming that the Haram does it does not give it any power or uh validity or justification or legitimacy because we take our religion not from what is happening in here or there we take our religion from the Quran and from the Sunnah not from sheikhs or professors or from the actions of others so this is a totally different story secondly it's not the positioning it's just having the name of Allah beside the name of Muhammad this is different than you when you write [Music] this is totally different than writing the shahada Allah totally different because this signifies and illustrates the difference but when you write Allah Muhammad any Layman would say oh they're equal so I trust Allah I trust Muhammad when the prophet heard a man say to him whatever Allah and you will he was petrified he was angered by this and he said did you do you make me an associate of Allah say whatever Allah wields alone don't put me inside such a sentence because this is disrespecting Allah only Allah Wills so the prophet Allah cannot come close to Allah because this would be a breach of tawheed those who don't know Allah would say no no it's okay Allah are you saying to me that Muhammad is equal to Allah the almighty Allah the creator of the heavens and of the Earth are you in are you saying this is totally any illogical unislamic that's why we glorify Allah we praise Allah the almighty to the extent that we do not allow anyone's name to be held next to his as if it's equal to him and this is the only problem that we have when we have Allah Muhammad who in his sound mind would say that no don't remember Prophet Muhammad don't love him don't respond no muslim would ever say this we've spent our entire lives following his Sunnah not only how we look or how we uh behave in every aspect of life when we go to bed when we wake up when we pray when we fast when we deal with our wives when we deal with our neighbors and our relatives and our loved ones with the colleagues with the disbelievers with the Sinners everything we do we mimic the prophets this doesn't go well with those who are making dinaros making money after pretending that they're righteous those who take positions in governments or authorities or those who associate themselves with wealthy people they need to know how to kiss boots or to lick boats and to kiss something else that's why they make an issue out of it and they say oh these wahhabis these people they hate the prophet Islam are you are you nuts we've spent our entire life teaching the people how to get closer to Allah to the best of our ability according to the Quran to the Sunnah how to love the prophet Allah how to adore and cherish his Sunnah and every single thing and you're accusing us of not loving the prophet Isa salaam come on get a life so to come back to your question Usama we need to know the value of tawheed to worship Allah azzawajal to glorify Allah alone who's the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam compared to Allah nothing and any Muslim would tell you this but we love the prophet Allah because Allah first of all told us to love him and because of his nature because of what he had done to us for us but never ever we would mix him up with the glory of Allah the almighty because this is a breach of tawheed and this is why we tell people buy study and learn the book of tawheed there's a book very nice small book called tawheed filled with verses of the Quran and Prophets teachings and it helps you glorify Allah and cements your tawheed in your heart foreign"
