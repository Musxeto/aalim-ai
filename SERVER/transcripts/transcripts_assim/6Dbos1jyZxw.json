  "transcript": "assalamu alaikum welcome to another episode of with the Prophet I'm Ali Coleman I will be your host for a discussion on the subject of neighbors we are continuing to be we're continuing to host our guests from Saudi Arabia Sheikh Azam al-hakim assalamualaikum and welcome Wadi Cinema Club okay thank you for being with us Sheikh on our subject of neighbors we're looking at as the title of the show indicates how we can continue to be with the Prophet in our lives looking at the Sunnah so we've been looking at family members and various members of society now we arrive at the subject of neighbors I'd like to start with some definitions and distinctions in the injeel you know I was raised in the Protestant church there's a one of the most famous of stories in the New Testament is about the Good Samaritan and this story is about how the high religious authorities avoided an injured man who had been beaten and robbed and left for dead on the side of the road and because of the high-ranking Jewish officials the high priests and the so on and so they didn't they were on their way to worship in the synagogue they didn't want to contaminate themselves so they crossed and moved away from this injured man and continued on their way but this other lowly person who had a low position in Jewish society among the Jews went to the man cared for him took him to an end paid money and tried to he tend to his rooms and he was a Samaritan an ethnic group of people so we call this the Good Samaritan prophet ISA peace be upon him use this as an example to say that the Samaritan was the good neighbor so the question is who is the neighbor the neighbor is the one who is any person around you but our definitions and distinctions here are a bit different is LOM makes a distinction between who is a neighbor a passerby as you were telling me earlier let's open up with the question the people that we ride on the Metro on the public bus that we walk with on the streets are they neighbors or is it only those that we physically live next to him Hamlin laughs ah ah ah ah why do you also have a young man today or there who I'm back the neighbor in Islam refers to the person who lives next to you okay and it can be interpreted in some cases as your spouse because indeed she lives next to you more than anyone else but when it comes in general terms a neighbor is a person who lives next to you what is the definition of a neighbor this is an issue of dispute some scholars said that a neighbor is anyone who prays Fechter in your message okay so this means that a gazillion people and others say it is 40 houses around you these are all your neighbors and some say there are seven doors next to your door mm-hmm so this narrows it a bit but still in essence a neighbor is someone who lives close by who has rights over you who you tend to meet every now and then when going out or coming in to your home and there are different types of neighbors in the Islamic view not everyone has the same status can you elaborate on that in a sense the scholars say that the neighbors are divided into three types one neighbor has three rights of you and he is the Muslim who is of your kinship and he is a neighbor so he has three rights the right of Islam the right of kinship and the right of being a neighbor the second type has to rights over you and he is the Muslim neighbor the right of Islam and the right of being a neighbor in the last category is the non-muslim neighbor and he has only one right over you and that is the right of being your neighbor and each are accorded a different meringue obviously you know three intersecting lines two intersecting lines and then one in terms of our duties and obligations does it does it vary depending on the type I understand that one of the reasons it's important to know who should who we should view as our neighbors because it governs our conduct accordingly there are certain rights and privileges that we should afford our neighbors we should be sensitive to to them and mindful of them when we're within our abode there's the subject of loud talking and arguing and loud music and parties into the night even for weddings and birthdays and things like this litter the parking spaces all these kinds of things it's a it's a it's a lot of contact a lot of overlaying contact so it's important for us to understand who our neighbors are is this the reason for the ranking it is not because all of the things you had mentioned you can categorize them under the title or the subheading of harm in your neighbor all right and this is a category of its own where the Prophet has Sam told us that he does not believe he does not believe he does not believe three times and the companion said may Allah's Duman destruction be upon him who is this who does not believe the Prophet said he who his neighbor is not safe from his harm so a neighbor who's harmful to his neighbor is not a believer so this is a category of its own when we talk about how the Prophet dealt with his neighbors rss/atom this is the negative part no we're talking about the positive part the goodness you can provide for them the care the love the gifts the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam told us that our neighbor have rights over us to the extent you know that Eman has 70 plus branches the highest to be la ilaha illallah the lowest is removing harmful things from people's way and bashfulness is a branch of him and this is a well-known hadith of the Prophet Isis M when he says 70 plus what are you talking about meaning that if you have 40 branches you're not a full-fledged believer you're a Muslim but you're not a full-fledged movement so you have to try to gather all of these in you in order to become a movement a person who has this Eman in him knows the rights of his neighbors now when you say be kind to your relatives do you mean I have to be kind to my cousin more or to my siblings more the siblings are closer I have to be kinder to them than to my cousins and I have to be kind to my cousins more than a further cousin likewise with the neighbors a neighbor who is of your kinship and a Muslim you have to give him more attention than just a normal muscling neighbor okay and the Muslim neighbor you should give him more attention and care than a non-muslim neighbor though he has rights as well but the rights of the Muslim neighbor is far more hmm okay great I have and just to touch back on the initial Court distinction that you made I asked you if passerby is considered a neighbor you said no yes neighbors deal with those who are physically living next to us and you gave us the criteria different views a bit of difference of opinion but the point is that if we see someone in the street it doesn't mean that we should be neglectful of them unmerciful unkind whatever but they're not our neighbor correctly all right what besides respecting them avoiding harm litter harming them in various ways what other types of things are we required or expected to visit them when they're ill what other kinds of gestures are we expect are expected of us first of all it is important to know that in our modern civilized societies if we can say that we tend to neglect our neighbors we are so busy in making money in our business in our working out and Ledger's and so on that we tend to not know those who are close to us you know so you get people living in an apartment building for tens of years not knowing their neighbours yeah so Islam tells us you have to check upon them check on them okay in the sense that do they need help mmm do they need assistant are they poor the Prophet said that in salatu salam the best of neighbors is the best to his neighbor and in another hadith he said that is awesome he will not believe in me the prophet of allah he will not believe in me who sleeps with a full stomach while his neighbor is hungry hmm so the so we are being encouraged the Prophet is peace be upon him is is telling us that we should get to know our neighbors we should know who they are and something about their circumstances so that we can if we need to be there for them to support them maybe they are living alone maybe the the they don't have children or you never know what the conditions may be some every now and then we read in the news that in Europe they've discovered an elderly dead on his a lazy chair after three weeks of his death yeah why they just found this bad odour of his corpse nobody checked on him neighbors never saw him in Viana I think was in Austria like three four years ago they've discovered this couple who had their daughter who's in her 20s or some someone they've kidnapped and kept for 19 years in a cage yeah yeah we hear about these stories and then where are the neighbors so this sort of a community or society is an accepted in Islam Islam tells us to check upon the widow upon the orphans upon the needy upon the physically challenged or have special needs it tells us to cater for them to care for them the Prophet that Islam when it came to neighbors it is astonishing he said gibreel came to me and told me that you have to take good care of your neighbor and he kept on repeating this the Prophet says until I thought that he is going to make him one of my heirs when I die he gets some of my wealth to that extent that Islam promotes the role of neighbors neighbors we're ready for a break thank you so much we'll be back to contain our conversation shortly Salam alaikum and welcome back to with a profit we're gonna continue with sheikh osama el Hakim on our subject of neighbors and how the Prophet peace be upon him interacted with his neighbors I'd like to ask you we before the break talked about the importance of not harming our neighbors whether our neighbors are Muslim or not kins folk or not chances are they're probably going to harm us in some way big or small what should be the appropriate reaction response I guess it depends on how we are harmed but I'd like for you to address that please well you cannot give a generic answer yes it's a case by case scenario you generally speaking Islam promotes tolerance so be tolerant be patient deal with people from your kind and tolerant nature rather than going down to their level and dealing with them harm is inevitable it might be accidental hmm it might be unintentional and it might be deliberate so if you can manage by just looking the others the other way yeah that is great if not you have all the right Islam to complain mm-hmm so if you go to the police if you go to the authorities this you're living in a society governed by law it's not a jungle that you're living in you cannot take your club and just mmm batter the house how we do it matters yes and in the hadith of the Prophet Arizona an example a man came to the prophet he saw some complaining from his neighbor mm-hmm and he's saying o prophet of Allah my neighbor is doing bad things to me the Prophet told him go and be patient the man came again prophet kept saying go and beat and try to endure him maybe he'll change in the third time when the the man came complaining from his neighbor the Prophet said that is awesome take all of your furniture out of your home and put it on the road so the guy says okay he went took his bedroom he took the sofas at the tables and put them outside of his home and he just waited there every time a Muslim passed by said hey bro what's wrong with you why do you have your furniture outside yeah he said my neighbor is harming me and abusing me and the Prophet told me to do this immediately the response of the Muslim is may Allah curse your neighbor and he goes away another one comes may Allah curse your neighbor may Allah curse your neighbor the neighbor came down running he said okay my friend get your furniture inside your home by Allah I will never harm you again if this causes me to be cursed by the Muslims who needs this I'm gonna right right bear with this so the instruction of the Prophet of SLAM tolerated but if it reaches a limit a level where you cannot live with it then you have all the right to take the necessary actions okay great I imagine that gift-giving might feature both in this regard as a as a one of the initial steps to try and resolve tensions but even also if someone newly arrives or you newly arrived gift-giving can be an important means to bridge gaps what about gift-giving to neighbors the prophet alayhi salatu salam encouraged this practice and subhanAllah I remember about I'm not gonna reveal my real age yeah about 45 to 4 seven years ago I remember my mom sending me on daily basis with food on a tray knocking doors of my neighbor's auntie so-and-so my mom says hi and this is a food that she desired it for you she cooked it and she and the following day her son would come with our tray and our dishes with different food doing the same and this was in the society all what we do is just give food away yeah and we had the best of bonding and relationship with our neighbors nowadays if someone knocks on the door you tell your children to turn off the lights so that when you look from the hole in the door they can't see if there's people in the house or not why is this intimidation why are you scared of your neighbors the Prophet said erase a lot of cinnamon - Oh Buddha Oh Buddha when you cook your meat put a lot of water in it so that the broth is a lot and you distribute the broth to your neighbors when you cook in such a society they will find the smell of food and some of them are hungry some of them would desire it so as a form of good gesture you do this not only that the Prophet said Ras salatu salam to the women folk he said that you should not despise even the legs of a sheep to give as a gift to your neighbor what would we do with a leg or the hoof of a sheep it's you can barely cook it there's no meat in it mhm so the Prophet said do not despise do not look down at it it's still a gift and people may make use of it so even that the Prophet Sam is encouraging don't look at brand names don't look at something that is expensive it's not the value of the gift it's just the thought yeah that that is there undoubtedly this is a very important part of having promoting good relations with neighbors and also inshaallah will give us a sense of happiness in crete the measure of happiness in our homes so we would like to begin to wind down we're approaching the end of the episode before we get there I want to make sure you address those issues that you think need to be dealt with you've talked to us about properly responding to being harmed we've identified who exactly our neighbors the different categories of neighbors the value of gift-giving other types of things that you'd like to draw a plan before we close I summarized it in a short paragraph but it is so profound and deep yet this is what the scholars say the rights of our neighbor upon his neighbor's lie in the following one that you begin salam when you see him don't wait for him to give you salaam you initiate the greeting and you visit him if he's sick you give him condolence if he has a calamity if someone near died you serve his family by making food for them at the time of mourning if their father died who served them make them food they have non stone - - there is a misery and you congratulate him in his weddings and you forgive his shortcomings do not peek or overlook from your ceiling to his through his windows and look at his hour you do not pour water or litter in front of his home and you should conceal whatever is exposed in front you and others cannot see you have to cover his mistakes you have to look after his house when he is travelling and care for his children you have to lower your gaze whenever his wife or daughters walk in front of you you have to be soft and kind when you talk with his children while guiding them and advising them to what is beneficial for them in their religion hmm I mean okay well we will have to close it there we were out of time for the episode thank you very much barakallahu fille come here and I pray to Allah that he makes you and me and all our viewers among those who are best to their neighbours I mean that ends our episode for today thank you for being with us we hope it was beneficial we would like to continue or close out for today until our next episode assalamu alaikum wa rahmatullah"
