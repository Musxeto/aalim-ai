  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum As you all know, we have to teach our children based on their generations, right? But then again, when we look at the generations today, I do not know how to teach my child. So how do we teach our children based on their generation when we see the downfall of the generation? Do you understand what I'm saying? I do understand what you're saying, but the easiest thing in this world is to put obstacles. When you put obstacles in front of you, you will never go anywhere. Number one, be optimistic. Number two, depend only on Allah, not on your strength, not on your knowledge. Number three, make a lot of dua. And number four, exert all what you can and Allah Azza Wa Jal will make all of your dreams true. And I guarantee you. Now, people differ from one environment and one country to the other. People in America would not be the same like people in Malaysia. People in Malaysia can't be the same as the people in Yemen. The different society, community, the masjid, the people, they're totally, totally different. You have to tailor make how you bring your child according to your environment. So, first of all, the worst thing ever invented in mankind is social media, iPad, smart phones, stupid phones and the likes. Because they are time consuming and shaitan is next to you. The moment you see the sheikh opening it and giving his back to the wall, know that he's watching something haram. Why? If I'm not watching something haram, I would be in front of you and everybody seeing. The moment you see your child doing this, acknowledge. So, you can't stop them, can you? Now, schools force you to let them do their homeworks and textbooks and everything on this. So, how can you monitor it? There are some softwares, but it's not necessarily going to work. Our children, they're so smart. Allahumma barik. My grandchild, four years of age, does this. And I don't know what's happening. She comes to me, four years of age. Grandpa, what's the pin number? What's the internet passcode? I only recently learned this. I'm a dinosaur, but these guys know how to do things. So, it's something that you have to work around. Some people, I used to do this with my kids. You have time to watch your iPhone or your social media between Maghrib and Isha, an hour and a half. That's it. After Isha, internet is unplugged. You don't have a network, 5G or 4G, depending on the Wi-Fi. That's it. It's done. So, they know. They limit themselves to this. In summer vacation, all the children have to revise 5 to 10 pages a day of memory. Because 12 of my girls memorize the Quran by heart. But after school, everything evaporates. If you don't force them, it will go. This is Quran. The Prophet said that it is easily forgotten. As easily as a camel that is untied would run away. So, you have to maintain it. If you don't memorize it and revise it over and over, it flows away. You have to make a good, righteous companionship for your children. If your children have best buddies in the street you don't know of, they'll teach them how to smoke, how to watch haram things, how to listen to haram things. But when you live in a compound, and everybody in this compound pray Fajr in the masjid with the jama'a. And they go to tahfeeq, they attend classes, etc. You at least hope that the children will be like their parents. So, I'm trying my level best to put my child in a good environment. School. It has to be an Islamic school, if you can afford it. And some schools are well-known to be real Islamic schools. Some schools are just Islamic like banks, by name. The Islamic school and they have music, they have ballet, they have free mixing. Duh! What Islamic school is this? Say, Sheikh, they are dancing ballet, but with the hijab. Thank you very much. No, you have to be selective. So, with these, and you know your environment, your circumstances. So, each one has to do their level best with the dua, with depending and relying on Allah, with thinking positively of Allah. And Allah, Azza wa Jal, will never ever turn you down. InshaAllah."
