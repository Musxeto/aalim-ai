  "title": "Is unworn gold zakatable? If a woman doesn't work, who should pay her zakat, can husband pay? Assim",
  "transcript": "so my first question is um i got married last year and uh my wife has uh gold so some of the girls she's wearing some of the gold she just put in the cupboard for maybe weddings during weddings so the question is when one year has passed since we got married that she she doesn't have a job or anything so that she give this gold in terms of zakah and how will she give it okay first of all it's an issue of dispute whether gold that is used must be zakatible or not and the most authentic opinion and this is the choice of sheikh membaz and ebenezemen and all of our scholars is that gold weather used or stored whether it's part of jewelry or in in gold bars or whatever it's all zakatable gold and silver and the evidences from the quran and sunnah backs it up secondly who's obliged to pay for the zakat the answer is the owner of the gold you as a husband are not obliged to pay for it because it's not yours but if you do it out of good will and being charitable and kind to your wife may allah reward you this is a rewardable charity so if your wife does not have money she doesn't work if she has gold that had reached the nisab which is 85 grams of 24 carat gold or more this means that she's rich and she's obliged to sell some of that gold to give zakat on it so even if she doesn't have cash she has gold sometimes i get weird questions a woman says i have gold that is almost half a kilo half a kilo she's almost a millionaire and she says i but i don't have cash so can i accept zakat of course not you are rich you have you're having a lot of money in this gold you have to sell some of it and allah azzawajal knows best hameem"
