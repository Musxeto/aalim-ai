  "transcript": "got a question from Sister samya um she wants to know about reading novels she says I like to read fiction fictional novels Harry Potter she's got down here uh some romantic novels um she says I'm also studying and and I read the Quran a lot but I feel guilty when I read these books am I allowed to read these kind of novels well the prophet Alat wasam told us that burden and sin is what eats your heart and you don't want people to look at it so as long as you feel bad about it then it is bad but generally speaking if a novel talks about Noble things and it has it does not have any sinful things in it it's permissible so if it's a war story that's talks about people fighting each other and about the humanitarian things in it and so on then it's okay but if it talks about things that are related into sin or things that may nfy our Islam or affect our belief then this is definitely unacceptable for example Harry Potter talks about a young magician well actually he's not a magician he's a sorcerer mhm and he goes to this college of of whatever black magic or white magic I don't know if they have colors anymore and he transforms people into animals and animals into people they give life to the dead and they deprive living from their life and and all of this as a Muslim we believe that this is blasphemy no one gives life to the death to the to the dead except Allah and when you look at this and you look at this uh these uh uh Mumble jumbo stuff and how kids are so into it and even adults they're buying the novels and the writer is one of the richest if sorry let me rephrase that she's the richest woman because of her novels MH and and and and and the kids are so hooked into it and they're following each and every page and each and every movie that goes down and and and they are connected so connected to it we know that this is a negative uh effect and impact as for uh a romance novels you tell me romance is between a man and a woman and if I were to read such novels it would put me in a state of dreaming and fantasy even if I'm married it would always come up and you know I would I wish my wife was like this girl the heroin she is so beautiful she's so kind she and then I start to hate my wife if my wife reads it she would think that I wish my husband was as handsome as strong as generous as this hero of this novel but he's not and she starts to hate me if a person is not married if he's a single or she's a single then the fantasy grows more and more and more and this is where sh where Satan comes he starts to whisper in people's ears to provoke them to encourage them to sin now this may be a 10% or 15% maybe it's in the doing and the making but you never know it's not it's it it doesn't have to be today or next week Satan has a longterm strategy he would wait for you a couple of years 5 years 10 years no problem but it all piles up until a person is ready and then he falls into sin and that is why reciting the Quran reciting the Hadith reading useful things things that benefits you in your life and on the the Hereafter this this puts you in a program that only beneficial things would help you and would fill up your time such novels would not do that"
