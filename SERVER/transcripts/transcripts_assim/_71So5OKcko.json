  "title": "Is my Income Halal if I leave work 15 mins Early if Someone is there to replace me?",
  "transcript": "hamza from bosnia shea i work in shifts with my colleagues and they sometimes arrive at work to take over my shift 15 minutes earlier before the end of my shift or before the start of their shift so is it allowed for me to leave the job 15 minutes earlier when this happens because we put our signatures there that we handed over the shift to our colleague it's also important to mention that the boss doesn't matter about this as long as there's somebody at duty in this work position it's like a 24 7 position so it cannot ever be empty okay hamza the issue is not halal and haram as it is an issue of policy and procedure when you leave 15 minutes before your working hours this means that you've worked for seven hours and 45 minutes this is 15 minutes less than what you're supposed to work if you're working eight hours shift now if the boss and the company they're fine with this and usually they're fine because when it's your shift you're gonna come 15 minutes earlier and you're gonna or maybe more and you're gonna hand they're gonna hand out to you their responsibilities and leave and you're gonna start work if this is the case then is the norm in the company there's no restrictions there's nothing wrong in that but if there is a signature or a fingerprint that times you in and out and in the records of the hr you've worked seven hours and 45 minutes 15 minutes late or less and they would deduct from your salary then you have to pay attention to that secondly if there is accountability so yes let's assume they came 15 minutes early not every shift starts 15 minutes early some of them they just come early so that they would avoid traffic and being late and then would like to chill for 15 minutes not indulging work immediately so there it would be responsibility on you if the work has lagged behind or a mistake took place it was in your shift but if none of this is existing and the norm of the company in the shift handing over uh routine is easy going then there's no problem in that and allah knows best you"
