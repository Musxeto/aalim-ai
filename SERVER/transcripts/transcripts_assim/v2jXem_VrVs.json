  "transcript": "Adrian from Serbia alayum alikum Salam is it permissible to attend music classes in school if they are mandatory well here we have to look into the situation if you are living in a cafir country and they are forcing you to go to these music uh classes and you have no other alternative you tried to fight it with all means and you had one of two choices either to go or we will kick you out of school which will lead you to not have an education beg on the streets not have work and your parents are not financially capable of supporting you to do your own business Etc in this case this is a necessity that you have to resent with your heart you have to fight to the best of your ability you have to skip as much as possible put headphones or whatever to minimize this evil to the best of your ability and I hope and I pray that you're not sinful after doing all of that and Allah Knows Best"
