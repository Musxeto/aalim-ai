  "title": "Oath Expiation (Kaffara) Food or Money? Assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Abul Abdul Rahman from Italy. Okay, the question is, the question is, to pay the expiation, can the person give money or he should buy food and give to the poor person? Expiation of oath or someone who could not fast? Expiation of oath. Okay, so the expiation of oath is to 1. Free a slave. 2. Feed 10 poor people from the medium food you eat usually or 3. Clothes 10 poor people. These are financial expiations, you have to pay money. You cannot go to the poor and say Akhi this is $5, buy yourself a meal. This doesn't suffice. You have to buy actual food and give it to the poor. Or go to the Imam of the Masjid or an organization you trust who have knowledge of the Sunnah and tell them this is $50 to feed 10 poor people. Buy them food. They say yes, we don't give money to the poor for expiations. So you authorize them, you give them the cash, they buy food. But you cannot give money to the poor and ask him to buy food. This is not permissible. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following 2 days or 3 days and by Allah's will, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
