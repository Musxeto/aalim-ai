  "title": "Is thanking OTHER than Allah SHIRK? (thanking others) assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "[Music] said the one who does not thank the people is not grateful to allah okay this hadith might confuse some see are divided or let's rephrase that the actions can be forms of worship and can be not forms of worship so asking is a form of worship when you ask allah but asking people is not a form of worship when the people can do something for you so if i ask you to help me in what you are able to help me come and help me carry this table and you are capable of doing it is this shirk no because it is within your ability but if i ask you to bring life to my dead son then this is not in your ability if i ask you to tell me what will happen in the future if they ask you to make rainfall all of this is shirk because you're asking other than allah over things that no one is capable of doing except allah now in this hadith the prophet is telling us about expressing your gratitude being thankful so one would be asking is it permissible to thank other than allah or is this shirk no it's not shirk on the contrary it's part of worshipping allah so allah azzawajal wants you to express your appreciation to your fellow muslim brother who has given you or who has done you a favor otherwise allah will be angry with you this hadith shows that the one who does not thank people is not grateful to allah what does this mean does this mean it can be either one either it refers to the person who does not show his gratitude to people such a person most likely will never thank allah azzawajal by nature a person who has this built in his nature not to thank people for doing him a favor usually the high percentage is such a person would not show his gratitude to allah would be always complaining and not thankful to allah azza wajal and the second interpretation would be that allah the almighty even if you thank him and show appreciation to him will not accept it from you unless you express your gratitude to others and this shows us that we do not live on an island we live in a community so we have to show our appreciation to others we have to show them that we do understand the effort and the lengths they had taken in order to do us a favor how do we thank people it's very easy express your feelings pay back by doing good things to them saying a good word the hadith the prophet says whoever does you a favor repay him as much as you can and if you cannot repay him then make dua for them until you feel this suffices make dua how easy is that very easy and the prophet said alaihis salah to wasallam whoever does you a favor and you say to him then he has exceeded in thanking and appreciating him the word is very little what does it mean may allah reward you with goodness this is dua so you give me a favor you do me a favor you help me change the tire thank you this is not any uh uh bringing satisfaction but when you say may allah reward you allahu akbar that i would expect my compensation to come from allah if you compensate me peanuts but when allah compensates me and rewards me this is beyond my imagination and this is why it is an old habit of mine that whenever someone does something to me i make dua for them and i say it without intending it ah this is not rewardable we're coming back to the same problem the issue of reward and intention the brothers have any confusion in that maybe i did not display it correctly maybe people have sensitivity towards it let me go back to my topic later on we will discuss it inshaallah so it's a habit that whenever someone does something to me i thank them by giving dua and i intend the dua but i don't pay attention to it but it has an overwhelming impact on them and when i consider what i say um that's nice i would love people to say this to me i say rahim allah have mercy on your parents and forgive you for anything and the people take a step back and say allah reward you for these beautiful words i don't pay attention to saying it and having this impact but believe me a word has a strong impact on people so showing your appreciation especially to the nearest and closest people to you has a profound impact"
