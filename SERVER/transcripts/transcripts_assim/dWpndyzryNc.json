  "transcript": "it is a big mistake and an innovation what many Muslims do after concluding salat when they raise their hands and make dua yeah that's if you do this once every blue moon no problem but if you do it after every 5/4 or not and make dua which the Prophet had never done as Sam nor his companions no those who follow them and not only that you make dua then you wash or wipe your face this is an innovation it's not at all permissible what is your intention when making drawn said I want a lot to respond to me I want a lot to answer me to give me what I asked him off well I have good news and the good news is that the Prophet said I'll use them after you finished allocation upon the Prophet during the salat you may choose and select whatever dry you want before sellout so the Prophet is telling you this is the time and the place for Durham and you say no no no I watched my father my forefathers they used to do do after sell em so I'm following suit well this is your problem my friend"
