  "transcript": "and and and countrymen are dealing in Islam it is totally different in Islam since the date of birth you are enslaved to your parents you are in debt to your parents until they die and if even after they die you're still indebted to them imagine the prophet saidat three will not enter Paradise one the one who boasts about his charity and Good Deeds to others meaning I give this brother financial help next week I say didn't I give you I know I didn't give you but yeah it's just an example don't hold me to it didn't I give you I lent him my car Didn't I lend you lend you my car didn't I do this for you and I keep on bragging and rubbing it this guy will not enter Jenna number two someone who is disobedient and impolite with his parent number three someone who's a drunkard who drinks intoxicants or does drugs or uses C and he is addicted to it no Jenna for you where to go well go to hell this is what you chose in this life now people among the Muslims are divided to three categories in how they deal with their parents so category number one is the premium one is the best these are those who do all what they can to respect obey please their parents they go out of the way to help them financially to make them smile to make them happy to make them comfortable they really literally go out of their way so this category they are rewarded by Allah Asel and they are true Muslims category number two are those who do not go out of their way rather they do what they're supposed to do nothing more and nothing less and such people though to us they're doing their obligations they seem to be fine but unfortunately they're not they are sinful and they will be punished for their shortcomings with their parents but I did what I am supposed to do yes but you did not do the extra Edge you don't you did not take the extra mile as they say and the third category are those who have combined leaving kindness and being dutiful two being rude disrespectful and sometimes even making them sad and depressed so it's a combination of both and such people are doomed in hell because they've committed one of the most heinous and major sins in Islam imagine it is one of the most heus and major sins in Islam to look at your mom's face and Shout at her to talk back to your father when he's advising you say don't judge me and this is something a lot of those in America always say and do whenever I have counseling sessions with them and I speak to them I tend to judge them they already paid money kalas they cannot refund it so and I say oh you do this you do this you do this and they're offended said you want to cry huh you want to say don't judge me I'm going to judge you I'm an old mid-aged not mid-aged old aged geizer grandfather grumpy I judge you and I judge your father as well what you're doing is wrong this culture from people coming from Canada and America don't judge me why don't judge you you do bad I judge you you do good I say mashallah you're good you have to be judged according to what you do and this is what's going to happen to you in your grave and on the day of judgment so the prophet said shall I not tell you about the most major sins ever everybody wants to know so the prophet said number one to associate others with Allah to do shik to do kufur this is the most major sin number two to be disrespectful and disobedient to your parents allahar he did not mention Z he did not mention doing drugs he did not mention stealing this is the second ranking major sin in Islam to be disrespectful disobedient undutiful to your parents who had spent all their lives their savings their efforts making you who you are and being beautiful to your parents is a natural thing by the way even animals are good in it animals do it to their parents so how is it not possible for you or human being not to be so it is going against your natural inclination natural f if you just anticipate the reward with Allah W everything difficult would be easy it is among the main reasons for entering jenah for erasing your sins to be dutiful to your parents respectful obedient a man came to Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and he was trembling out of fear this man committed real real bad sins and he did not know how to repent SOB Omar the brother-in-law of the Prophet Alam the companion of the Prophet Alam the son ofab one of the most knowledgeable companions said to the man do you have parents living He said I only have my mom he said are you afraid of Hellfire and want to be admitted to Jenna the man said of course I Omar said by Allah if you spoke to her softly and feed her food you will enter Paradise as long as you stay away from major sins if you speak to her softly how do we speak to our mothers how do we speak to our mothers Allah says in the Quran don't say o to them or say any harsh word and say kind things to them with respect o go and get the groceries from the car why do I always do it why doesn't Abdullah go and and take it once in his life go and do this go and do that and you say oh always me always me why this takes you to the widest Gates of of Hell Fire inshallah say a mean every okay so if o is punishable and we're prohibited to say it how and what would we say and classify those who raise their voices when they speak to their moms Ali once may Allah have mercy on his soul one of the great once he entered the home and he said allum his mom said he said how are you Mom she did not reply so he raised her voice because she was at the last room said how are you mother and he feared Allah and started to tremble he thought that he raised his voice over his mother he said set free two or three slaves for the sake of Allah asking Allah to forgive him did he raise his voice no he just wanted her to listen to hear raising the voice is when she talks to you and you raise your voice saying no I will not do this you don't have the right to do that and you scream in her face may Allah have mercy on his soul says if your parents ever got you angry never ever look them in the eyes with an an angry look because they will recognize that you're angry the moment you look them in the eyes and he says [Music] W those who look into their parents eyes do not respect them when your mother or father are addressing you how do you look to them straighten the eyes like this or you look down yes Mom yes Daddy I will inshallah with all respect I will do that or you look at them and there even if you say yes but you look them straight in the eye with a challenging look don't you think and they're stupid maybe they maybe because they got you but beside the point they're not they will understand by the way you're looking that you don't like what you hear and Allah would punish you for that Muhammad one of the Great whenever he was in the presence of his mother he would whisper when he speaks and people sitting in the same Gathering would think that maybe he's sick not knowing that he whispers so that his voice is not loud in the presence of his mother this is how our Sala used to respect their parents some of the Sala would not eat with his mother from the same dish because he would be afraid that there is something he likes he wants to grab but his mother already had looked to it and she desired it so he would always refrain from taking something until his mom eats from it Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him saw two men walking together and he asked the younger one who's this so the younger one said this is my father so he advised him he said if he is your father never call him by name I heard and I saw men calling their fathers abdah [Music] come he's your father do you call him abdah yeah this is his name are you stupid call him father and and respect him don't call him by his name so abuur says Don't Call Him by name and don't ever walk in front of him and never sit before him we see children coming with their parents to visit and the moment they enter the house the child throws himself on the sofa sitting and and lying down and his father is still standing up what are you doing I'm sitting wait for your father to sit wait for the host to sit wait for the guest to sit but at the same time W I've entered homes in Arabia I don't know about the culture here in Saudi and the children of the host of the house would not sit for 2 hours standing like Hawks like Brave lions giving you coffee giving you dates giving you tea the moment you finish he's on your head what do you do more coffee sir yeah sure and he's always there attentive and some homes I went all the boys are sitting on the sofa what's up and Snapchat and Instagram and the host the father he's the one who's serving and doing all the the the Dirty Work This is a culture this is Iman this is how we bring up our children and above all the mother has great responsibilities upon us a man comes to the prophet and he says who among all the people is worthy of my good companionship the prophet said your mom okay okay then what said um your mom okay then what um what's happening here then whom he said then your father so 75 % of your good companionship should be dedicated to your mother and 25 should be dedicated to your father nowadays it's flipped why because the father has the baseball bat you say no boom here goes strike one your mom is the weakest link she shouts she screams she cries and you don't listen because what would will she do nothing unless she's one of them you know strong mothers who will take her slippers and start beating the heck out of you now you're going to be afraid but generally speaking no mothers are the weakest link listen to what Allah says and we have enjoined on man to be dutiful and kind to his parents this is general advice his mother bears him with hardship and she brings him forth with hardship ship and the bearings of him and weaning of him is 30 months your mother spent the most beautiful days of her life caring for you 30 months nine of them you were eating her alive consuming her bones and blood and everything everything she has in her body and after that 2 years she's been suckling you and breastfeeding you from her own body and what is she paid back with this ingratitude this disrespect Al in says that may Allah be pleased with him during Hajj saw a man coming all the way from Yemen with his mom over his shoulders imagine her legs are dangling down he's carrying his mother on his shoulders on foot and then they they say we're athletic we go to the gym Jim my foot well if you do this for maybe 10 m you'll be on the ground gasping for air the man is carrying his mom going around the in and he's chanting poetry oh I am her ride and I take her on my back if the camels and the horses are scared I'm Never Scared she's on my back so do you think I have repaid my mother IB Omar said no you did not repay Your Mother by one of her contraction while you were in her belly one of the contractions of birth is not equivalent to what you're doing let alone the whole process a man comes to the prophet wanting to go for Jihad what is better better than Jihad every one of us wants to go and die in the cause of Allah so the prophet Alat wasam asked him do you have a mother he said yes so the so the prophet said go back to her the guy did not compute so he said I want to go for Jihad I want to go for Jihad he kept on repeating and then the prophet said to him twice go and be dutiful to your mom in the third time he said meaning what's wrong with you stick to her feet for Paradise is there in her trying to obey her and to please her this is the way to Paradise now Muslims are I don't know what day is it 21st of March what what is the the mother day something in March I think or in April it's not April full but some somewhere anyhow they leave the whole year like the westerners and on the Mother's Day they bring her a bouquet of flour maybe a bottle of uh uh perfume and they abuse her the rest of the year we Muslims never celebrate Mother's Day because the whole year Wall is our Mother's Day every day is a Mother's Day to us we serve them and we try our level best to honor them imagine honoring them even after after they die the prophet wasam met a man and this man asked the prophet my parents are dead is there anything I could do to be dutiful to my dead parents so the prophet saidat yes indeed offering Dua for them okay you count huh after their death offering Dua for them praying for forgiveness for them fulfilling their promises before they died they promised a cousin an uncle a neighbor that will do this and this you fulfill that promise honoring their friends so they're dead but I know that they love sheim so you come and honor me your parents love me I don't know we can make America great so you honor their friends by checking on them every month or two Uncle so and so um how are you I am the son of your friend late friend would you like any help do you need anything do you do this for the sake of Allah and after that for the sake of your uh uh parents five holding ties of kinship for you have no ties of kinship except through them how many of us after the death of our parents go and visit and connect to their uncles their aunts their cousins some of us don't even know our parents' cousins and we know them but your parents and they're your kinship you have to these are the things that remain through which you may honor them after their death com from Medina to meca he met a nomad a bedwin so he gave that nomad his mule he gave him his ride imagine if you have a so his companions Omar companions said who right what did he say he said this man's friend of Omar my father and I heard the prophet say our parents after their death on everything we have how would a Muslim honor his parents when they treat their parents they deserve to be treated like this reserve your seat in Hellfire my friend come on give me a break they're abusive my parents are evil you don't have to be respectful even if they're this evil yes how is it possible clear mathematician or a physicist and you say this is my smirk not his 1 + 1 equals how of my face Jeff pezos guides him to Islam and I pray to Allah that Allah guides him to Islam test because if your father your mom was a dream Mom that's a good father to have but imagine and if he every day takes your wife and children and and cleans a trash and cleans a car and he always tells the relatives and the friends this is my son he's the most he's the kindest he's the smartest Allah has blessed me with him and he makes your life heaven will you be rude to him so where is the test there's no test the test is when your mom is nagging and asking you to divorce your wife and every every day five times before Salah and after Salah like the test is when your father is milking you of your money give me money give me money give me money daddy you have money you have a house you have a car you have savings no no I want money you make uh this much amount every month give me half of your salary didn't you hear theith you and your wealth is for for your father bring it on now this is the test so here is where Allah is testing you and here is where you have to show your Iman and your patience and your love to Allah by being dutiful respectful and not by crossing any red lines now obeying them and I know we will get gazillion of questions about this topic so I will not yeah spoil it for you but I know a lot of you would ask okay what if my father orders me to divorce my wife what if my father wants to cash out all of my savings and want me to sell and do this when he's not in need this is not beautiful because this is crossing the red line but you compare everything that is being done to you with the Quran and Sunnah and or not but believe me the more you invest the tolerant the more you will see this with your own children when you become their age Allah will grant you children that will take care of you I pray to Allah alhamdulillah but uh I think I did a good job with my mom you still have a chance with the grace of Allah if you the gateway to J if you manage to protect it your mother opens the gates of success one Dua and one Dua from your father against you without you knowing it because the prophet said three du if he just says may Allah make you unsuccessful you're doomed so invest and invest wisely [Music] I think it's time for Q&A so whoever wants to ask a question"
