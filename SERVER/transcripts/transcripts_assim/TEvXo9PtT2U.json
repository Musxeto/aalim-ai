  "title": "Two trustworthy Scholars give opposite fatwas, whom should we follow? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "see circle thumb from India asks the frequently asked question what to do when scholars who all follow the manhaj of the Salaf differ which opinion should we follow is it try to weigh the majority so 15 people said it's okay and 12 said it's not a case so I'll follow the majority is it democracy or is it what I'm inclined to do so I feel more likely to take the 12 scholars opinion because this is what suits me how to do first of all you are either a scholar by yourself with you which you're not or a student of knowledge this means that you have a good command over the Arabic language you know also lafitte you know the fear of the Quran the hadith the FERC the NASA Holman Sioux etc all these things but you're not yet a scholar or number three you are a layman most likely you are the third category a layman in case of a layman a layman must do tallied it is a must and people would say all this goes against salafiyyah no it doesn't the way that people practice Salafi today is tallied because you get people who are none Arabs and we when you to ask them what are you following which school of thought he says I'm a Salafist and martial law good good for you when it comes to interpretation of the Quran or translation of the Quran what do you do because you don't know Arabic he said I follow so here international which means that you depend on the people who translated it what happens when you come to fit then I follow education of Sheryl albani so you are a layman doing taqlid for a little banning because you have zero knowledge and hadith what about in fact I follow scholar so-and-so in fact whatever he says I follow him so you are imitating him you're doing taqlid might as well do tackle it to abu hanifa automatic or to Shan Fierro to a madman humble they are more prominent stronger more trustworthy more accepted by the masses of the Muslims than your Sheikh so if you're a layman you have to pick one single scholar that you trust his knowledge his religious commitment and he's trustworthy and follow him whether he is an imam of the four schools of thought or one of the followers who follow but you cannot simply cherry-pick and sit back on your couch and say hmm I like this opinion it sounds okay but that opinion over the second issue from that second school of thought is stronger than that one how are you evaluating so you say but it looks better it sounds I have a gut feeling do you take such gut feeling when it comes to neuro surgery that you have to do in your spine and you said no I think I'm gonna follow this procedure or you give yourself up to the doctor and he does whatever he does because you trust him and you have zero knowledge in it so the way you're asking is wrong people nowadays they google it they go to Islam Q&A and they say so many see so many opinions and says ok I'll choose this one without knowing that what they're doing is totally wrong the the answer was giving to a specific question you cannot put this answer to your question because there might be a few differences that make the whole world different and therefore you have to be careful"
