  "transcript": "final question Jade says if someone eats something while having doubts that it might contain Haram but they aren't fully sure about it but that food actually contained Haram in this case since they had the food without being sure of it having Haram ingredients can this have an impact on their Dua see the norm is that everything on Earth is allegedly Halal until proven otherwise consume and eat whatever is on Earth pure Halal for you and by default things that we consume we can consume without checking and without cross-examining because this is a default Scholars make an exception when it comes to meat they say you have to know whether it was halal meat or not if according to the most likely to the best of your knowledge that it is halal then you have to consume it without checking as in the case if a Christian or a Jew invites me to a feast being a Christian or a Jew as mentioned in the Quran whatever they offer us of meat whether cows camels or sheep this is halal for us to consume so I don't have to check whether it was slaughtered or not because he's a Jew or a Christian and their food that they present to us is halal I have to just make sure it's not pork so to the best of my knowledge this is Hal I don't need to check likewise if I go to the supermarket I buy cakes I buy bread I bu the default it is halal until proven otherwise I don't have to reverse this it is Haram until proven otherwise no it is halal until proven otherwise I have no reason to check yes somebody called me from Norway a couple of minutes ago and said that the bread we buy from the baker I've asked with the Baker and they said yes sometimes we do use pork in the ingredients okay in this case you you asked you refrain from it or you have doubt you should check but generally speaking buying cakes buying things that are Halal on this player cross saw or whatever I don't have to check if my capuccino has pork milk in it or not the default is is halal until proven otherwise and Allah Knows Best"
