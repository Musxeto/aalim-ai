  "title": "Can we draw a human or animal without eyes? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so Abdul Alim is saying what is the ruling on drawing animals that have no eyes on a piece of paper well Abdul Alim we have to go to the hadith of the Prophet Ali Saleh salam to learn from them so we have a hadith from the Prophet SM which is very authentic when he said to mother Aisha the most severely punished people on the day of judgment and Hellfire are those who draw pictures of living creatures and he told her didn't you know that the owners of these pictures are the most severe on the day of judgment allah azza wajal says in the hood see hadith who is more sinful than those who create like my creation let them create a piece of barley let them create an ant and we were told that those who draw such pictures will be told on the day of judgment to give life to them and they won't so drawing such pictures of living animals of birds of fish of insects of humans is totally prohibited and having the face only without eyes would still make it prohibit it if you don't have the head and you just draw the body there's no difference of opinion that this is okay so the body without the head is permissible some scholars say that even if you have the head but no features that give it life no eyes no nose no mouth nothing just the head itself empty then this is also permissible and allah azzawajal knows best"
