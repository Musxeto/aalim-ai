  "transcript": "if a non-muslim who eats pork drinks alcohol okay one second let me get the question right if a non-muslim who eats pork drinks alcohol is it okay for a Muslim to eat from the same plate and Spoon and drink from the same bottle of glass at the time they haven't ate or drunk but they normally do in their daily life well the prophet told us not to eat and not to use the utensils of disbelievers and when they or when he was told that we find no other utensils to eat in the prophet instructed them to wash these utensils so if you are living in a room or in in a compound or your co-workers who live with you are non-muslims and you have to live with them you don't have any other way to uh uh you don't have any other place to be in then it is permissible for you to eat with them due to the necessity but you should not eat in the same plates or glasses they eat pork and or drink alcohol in you are not allowed to sit on the table where they drink alcohol or eat pork uh uh on you have to avoid them and I suggest that you have your own plate or at least eat in a paper plate uh and drink in paper cups just to avoid this and definitely it is not a wise thing to live among such people and you have to look for an Islamic Place uh Islamic environment to live with and Allah Knows Best"
