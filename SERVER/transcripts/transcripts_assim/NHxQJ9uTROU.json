  "title": "Understanding a Hadith on Diseases Not Being Contagious? (Quoting Qadiyani) | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "from bangladesh the hadith of there is no contagiousness use this to say that there is a prophet coming after the prophet so i'd like to understand the meaning of the hadith first of all are you nuts you are quoting what kadyanes say about an authentic hadith and how they use this to justify their kafir belief that there can be a prophet after the prophet are you a muslim come on label give me a break nobody quotes are like these are disbelievers they're not related to islam might as well quote what the jews and christians said about the quran you can do that it's the same thing so you definitely don't listen to them and you definitely don't answer them because when you when a dog barks you don't bark back you just walk away these are not a minority they do not represent point zero zero zero zero one of islam and they're not related to islam they have nothing to do with islam no prayer no fasting not even hajj allah knows where where they're doing it whether it's padian or to whatever so definitely this is unacceptable from you now going back to your question the hadith the prophet says that there is no uh um contagiousness i don't know if this is the noun or not i'm just making it up there's no contagiousness there's nothing that is contagious now people say then we don't have to wear face masks and we don't have to uh social distance etc because there is no no no no this is your understanding because you do not understand an ayah without reading the whole quran and the whole of the sunnah of the prophet salam in order to understand it it's a package deal it's not a retail shop you have to buy wholesale so when we get a hadith like this does it mean okay if someone has hiv i'll take blood transfer uh fair from him with with uh no problem of course not the prophet alaihistalato said run from the one with leprosy like you run from a lion so when you see a lion you don't stand in the face of the lion and greet it simply because you see its teeth thinking that it's smiling to you you run likewise the prophet says if you meet someone with literacy and it is contagious run the prophet himself said as if you heard of a village a town struck by the plague do not enter it this is known as quarantine and if the plague hits a city or a town you are in do not exit it and then you say that there is no contagiousness this is your understanding so okay give us a break what's the understanding of it the true understanding is that you do not attribute getting sick to a person or to the means that may have gotten you sick may have infected you why because allah azzawajal is the controller of everything so when you say after catching a flu for example i said oh yeah yeah my cousin came yesterday he had the flu i caught it up from he infected me when you say that you are claiming that he is the one who caused the illness and this is not the case he may have been the means of the illness infecting you but he's not the one who infected you and this is why we say there's no contagiousness and the prophet alaihis gave a logical answer to this when a man said after hearing this hadith the same hadith is it prophet of allah i have a herd of camel and one camel comes into my heart and may infect others so the prophet said to him logically who infected the first one so the one who k that came with the infection with leprosy with whatever disease it had and infected some of the herd who infected it originally where did it come from it was created by allah azzawajal the creator of everything in this universe so you don't say that this is what allah has preordained and i'll give you a second example and we have uh this is this was the last question so maybe we have a couple of callers or a few questions pending because we have like four minutes left i'll give you another example now in a household you find that a three or four members suffer from a very bad sore throat or the flu and two or three are healthy and they're mixing and nothing happened to them how is that possible in the same household you may find someone who was affected by corona virus covered 19 while his wife and children were not affected at all how is this possible this is what is meant by there is no contagion contagiousness it is from allah azzawajal who chooses that knows best you"
