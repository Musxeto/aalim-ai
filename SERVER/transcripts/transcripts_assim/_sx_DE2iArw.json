  "transcript": "The next question is about Islamic banking. The borrower wants a loan of 100 TD and the following steps are taken by the bank. Step 1. Bank will buy a commodity, for example steel, from a trader at a set price. Then the bank will give the borrower an option, either to take the steel in possession or sell it. Then the borrower pays the money, therefore will ask the bank to sell it. Finally, the bank will sell the commodity to a trader, meaning, after selling the commodity, give it to the borrower. No, the bank will agree to sell the commodity to the borrower at a higher price, which will be the bank's profit. Is this process called tawar? Is this process halal? This is a process of lending. Now, this statement by itself is bogus. No Islamic bank lends you money. Period. Well, this is a bold statement, Sheikh. No, it's not. It has hair on it. Please don't make a meme out of this. Wallahi, I just said it. Yani, anyhow. What do you mean, Sheikh? Akhi, Islamic banks don't lend. Because lending is an act of kindness. Take 10 KD, you return it 10 KD. This is lending. Islamic banks sells you a commodity. So they come to you and say, you say I need a 10 KD. He said, no, we don't lend you money. However, we have a commodity that we are willing to sell you with a profit. Because you can't buy it cash. So this bottle, I would sell for 1 KD. Cash. Someone comes and says, I don't have cash, Sheikh. I said it for you for 1.1. You pay it to me in a month's time. Riba? No. This is selling a commodity for money. Riba is when I give you a 1 KD, you return it 1.1. This is riba, money versus money. So Islamic banking, what they do to legitimize their transactions, they sell you something they possess. And this is called tawarruq. So they sell you a commodity. And you buy it. And you keep it in your store. Keep it in your basement. You give it as a gift. You sell it outside. This is up to you. It's none of my business. I sold you the commodity. What you do with it is your problem. Now, to have this transaction halal, the scholars like Ibn Baz and Ibn Uthaymeen say, number one, the bank must possess the commodity beforehand. What the Islamic banks do nowadays, you say to them, I need 100,000 KD. They don't have commodity this much. So they say, okay, we can sell you copper. Okay, do you possess the copper? Nope. But you sign these documents. Once you sign and commit, then we will go and buy it from international markets and sell it to you. This is haram. Why? Because they're selling what they do not possess. Okay, we're not going to sell it to you. Just give us 5,000 down payment. This is haram. Because committing by such signing or a down payment is still a commitment and selling what you do not possess. So what is the resolution? The resolution is that they have to have the commodity in their warehouses. A lot of Islamic banks do this. They have showrooms. They have cars. What's the hottest selling cars? GMC, Land Cruiser, Toyota Camry. They have a bundle. You come and buy. Market price is X. They put their margin. They know that you're going to buy it. They sell it to you. You possess it. You go to the market. You sell it maybe 5-10% lower than the market price. And this is beneficial for the whole community. So this is halal. Now, what the brother is saying, that the bank goes to you before possessing it. And he said, Listen, we found your commodity and it's XYZ. Are you willing to buy it? He says, Yes. Okay, they buy it for you. So they say. And then they come and tell you, Here is the commodity, which you don't usually see. They say, We sold you 10 tons of copper or steel. Here are the documents. He said, Good, nice. What should I do with them? He said, None of our business. Get your lorries, get your trucks and take it. He said, No, I want the money. He said, Okay, authorize us to sell it for you. For X amount of money, which is less. He said, Okay, I authorize you. Five minutes, the money is in your bank account. When did you get the merchandise? When did you possess it? Who did you sell it to? In five minutes, you get the money in your bank account. This is called tawarruq munazzam, organized tawarruq, where there are three parties. The steel or the copper is still in the warehouse of the original seller. So it was sold, bought by the customer, and resold once again to the same seller, with a margin. This is riba. Who are you fooling? Instead, just give him 100,000 and take it 105. Kharas, no need for this game. So this is haram. I hope this makes some sense."
