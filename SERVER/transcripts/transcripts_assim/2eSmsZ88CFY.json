  "title": "If a traveler passes by a masjid, should he pray Friday Prayer even if he already prayed Dhur?ï¿¼",
  "transcript": "Sa'd says, if one is traveling and prays Dhuhr on Jumu'ah, on a Friday, because they think there is no Masjid nearby, however, they then come across a Masjid, should they pray Jumu'ah despite having prayed Dhuhr? The answer is no. A traveler is not obliged to pray Friday, especially if he is on the road. So, if he had already prayed his Dhuhr prayer, two rak'ahs, and he came across a Masjid that they were praying Jumu'ah, he may skip that without any problem, Insha'Allahu Azza Wa Jal."
