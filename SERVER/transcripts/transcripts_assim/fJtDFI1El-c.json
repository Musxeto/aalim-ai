  "transcript": "issues of divorce cannot be solved by someone asked me to ask you to this this and it has to be with the muslim court or with the authorized islamic center or you should call someone personally the one who divorced so even when the wife speaks to me says my wife divorced me then he said this then he said his intention was that so what's the ruling he said i'm not going to give you any ruling let him talk to me because he's the one that whatever he says counts not you you're just relaying the story i have to take it from the horse's mouth he has to say it to me personally and only then we can judge whether this or not valid divorce or not this is marriage imagine me saying something based on what you've told me based on what you've heard from this sister and somewhere down the line there was a loophole there was a mistake something was missing a conditional divorce maybe or i don't know so i give you a verdict you go and give it to her she says okay alhamdulillah kiss and make up and they live together when they are divorced three times forever this is not possible so let the man of this woman give me a call inshallah we'll try to figure things out"
