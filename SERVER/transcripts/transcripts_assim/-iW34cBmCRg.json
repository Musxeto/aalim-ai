  "title": "My brother does black magic, if I fear he will harm me, is this Kufr as I am fearing other than Alla",
  "transcript": "Juwairia from France Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh we know that certain types of fears are part of hidden acts of worship and that if a person directs their fear towards other than Allah then it's Kufr so my question is if my brother is involved in black magic and I cannot sever ties with him is fear that he may harm me with sihr considered as Kufr Juwairia if your brother is known to be physically abusive and you fear that if you talk to him he's going to slap you on your face or stab you with a knife is this kind of fear shirk yes or no? Juwairia Are you with us or are you gone? Okay she's gone So as I said before multiple times the fear of others that is associated with revering them, worshipping them, fearing them in things that only Allah can do, this is shirk natural fear such as the fear of lions, of a black mamba, fire, drowning this is not shirk fearing someone who could harm you physically is not shirk but when I'm in the middle of the house and I fear a ruler or someone of great power though he is not able to see me or able to control me and I have this fear that is similar to the fear of Allah in the absence of that individual that is associated with revering him and glorifying him this is shirk and this is not found except with those who worship other than Allah for example a thief was caught red-handed stealing and they say to him you stole he said no I did not steal he said swear by Allah you did not steal he said wallahi I did not steal he said okay swear by Imam Hussain or by Tijani or Jilani one of the awliyas he believe in he said no I can't do that they will curse me I will be doomed for eternity not because it's shirk he's afraid of them literally afraid of them that is true shirk and Allah knows best you"
