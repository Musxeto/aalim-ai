  "transcript": "what is needed for you to do is to bring the community together and bringing the community together does not take place by sectorism by introducing oh i'm a salafi you're not a salafi so you are below me i'm better than you i follow the self i follow the prophet sallam you follow schools of thought you're this you're that this does not bring anyone closer to anyone okay then you're not salafi i never go around hanging a tag on my chest saying awesome a selfie i'm a muslim yeah yeah yeah we know you're a muslim we're all muslims but what kind of a muslim are you why would you not want to know i'm a muslim no no we have sunni shiri okay i'm a sunni what kind of a sunni i am from oh also uh some ashari's consider themselves why would i need to explain and boast about it everywhere i'm a muslim you're a muslim if you see something wrong correct me if i see something wrong on you i will tell you that this is not according to the sunnah your belief is not according to akida allah says in the quran so the prophet saws says so-and-so but without carrying a flag and saying a masala because such labeling would probably cause more harm than benefit especially in the west the moment anyone hears the word salafi they label them as wahhabis extremists terrorists maybe an isis wannabe which is not very healthy so even sheikh me allah had mercy on soul says don't say about yourself that i'm a seller because this is a form of sectarianism is as if you're taking a party this is a salafi and this one is and this one is table and this one is this everybody is happy with the label what are you i'm from alaska who are they there anyone who follows the quran the sunnah with the understanding of the righteous three generations that the prophet praised herself but no salafi no atheri no such a thing this brings the people together and don't blame others don't point fingers oh you do this you do that you do this you do that nobody likes criticism try to gather the muslims try to bring them together try to educate them try to care for the muslim community and to help one another and to uplift the ignorance about religion and to abandon politics because this is what divides people turkish don't like egyptians egyptians don't like saudis saudis don't like yemenis what is this this segregates us separates us all of us are muslims you say you're closer to me than my own brother because you believe in allah azza and you're committed to islam you"
