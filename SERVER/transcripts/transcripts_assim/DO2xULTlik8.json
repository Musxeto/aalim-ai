  "transcript": "Nazli from Azerbaijan Nazli Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh a person believes in a judgment date that Allah will gather all people and etc but um what worries him is that sometimes when he thinks about it he's surprised and seems to say to himself how can it be and etc what can you say about that this is shaitan messing up with his head a real believer doesn't have such whispers and if he has it he shrugs his shoulder and brush it off and move on he moves on these whispers are from shaitan it is part of the six pillars of iman to believe in allah to believe in the day of judgment to believe in the angels to believe in the messengers to believe in the holy books and scriptures and to believe in al-qadr the divine decree whether good or bad these are six pillars of iman if one of them is not intact and fulfilled a person is a full-fledged kafir he will go to hell for eternity so these whisper that jump and attack you these are from shaitan if you don't speak about them and you don't act upon them meaning that you block them and you try to ignore them they will not harm you at all"
