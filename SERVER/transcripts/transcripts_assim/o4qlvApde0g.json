  "title": "How to trust a husband or wife if they are materialistic & nagging? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "This is not related at all. Trust is an issue of infidelity, cheating, and materialistic thing has nothing to do with trust. I want to become rich, I want my wife to become rich, I want to build a bigger house, so I don't see the relationship between the two. If you're saying that, it's not trust. Maybe let's use another word. My spouse is more interested in materialistic things while I am interested in spiritual things and reaching Allah Azza Wa Jal. No, you have to be balanced. You have to remember. Seek in what Allah has given you but don't forget your portion of dunya. So have a balance. The Prophet was not always praying and fasting. He used to play with his wives. He used to race with mother Aisha. Race on foot. He raced with her twice. The first time she won. He did not forget. He waited a few years until she gained weight. And then he said, okay, let's race. She said, I forgot. And when I raced him, he won. He laughed. He said, this for that one. So the Prophet used to enjoy life, used to play with his wives. You can't expect, and this is a big problem with people who get committed to Islam. All of a sudden, all of my life, you're my friend, you're my relative, you're my brother, you're my spouse. You've always been the one I know. All of a sudden, you started getting closer to Allah. You started learning religion. You started practicing. Now the gap is much bigger between you and I. What do you do? You keep on poking me. You're not doing this. You're not praying on time. You're not wearing the hijab. You're not a good Muslim. Allah will put you in hell. And the gap is getting bigger and bigger. I'm not getting closer to you. I'm getting further away from you. It's your mistake. Instead, I have so many youngsters finding hidayah, and their parents are against their hidayah. Because, oh, move the pictures, move the idols. This is haram. Don't do this, don't do that. You're a punk. How old are you? You just came from the egg, and now you want to preach? This is not the right way of doing it. They have to respect you. They have to love you. They have to know that you want the goodness for them, not to be Simon says, do this, do that. You're not speaking to them with arrogance from an ivory tower. Rather, I love you, I would like you to be guided. If you do this, you will win your wife's heart. But whenever the gap is much bigger, and you're failing to close up the gap, you will never find peace or happiness, unless you try to change your strategy."
