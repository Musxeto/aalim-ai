  "transcript": "and aan says that he suffers from a low level of IM though the 10 days of the hij and before he was feeling extremely well and after fasting the nine days of the and doing the uh things as usual though he continues to go to the Masjid for prayer he continues to read the Quran he feels a lot of doubts and bad thoughts evil thoughts coming into his mind he's scared that he's becoming a hypocrite what can he do to get rid of these doubts and the feeling of hypocrisy first of all you have to think like a criminal in order to fight crime you don't have to be a criminal but you have to think like one so if I were to think like Satan and I would like to get you off your comfort zone and into my world of doubts and suspicion and hypocrisy what would be the best thing to do to cast these doubts at Hassan Al basri and it's also reported that Abdullah said that may Allah be pleased with him that hypocrisy no one fears it except a Believer and no one is in Safeguard from hypocrisy except a true hypocrite so if I feel that no I'm not feeling any feelings of hypocrisy I'm mallah in strength of my IM then this is a sign that I am in the wrong path so this is a good sign that you are still a Believer and you believe in Allah Asel and you have a lot of IM in your heart secondly you have to analyze what had been introduced into your life after the 10 days of because there is a a probability there's a possibility that after doing good deeds and a lot of them Shan comes to us and says listen you've done something that gives you credit to loosen up a bit and maybe do lesser Good Deeds for like 3 4 weeks so he gives you the feeling of content and being happy of what you're doing to the extent that you let your guard down and this is when he attacks you so what I would advise you is that you offer Ria on yourself without any hesitation or fear don't get thoughts in your mind that I have Jin I'm possessed with Jin I have black magic I have Envy I have evil eye all of this put them aside offer R to yourself to restore your IM and to Cast Away any of these doubts and at the same time try to analyze what came up so if you have new company bad friends then get rid of them if you were all the time with your good friends practicing Muslims and now you a little bit away from them go back to them again so that you can get the ball rolling again and you get the system restored but don't allow the shatan to come and play with you in this fashion"
