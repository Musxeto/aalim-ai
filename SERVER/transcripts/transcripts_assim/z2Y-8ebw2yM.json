  "title": "Can we pray in front of a Mirror? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "says is it permissible to pray in front of the mirror now in order to say that it is permissible or prohibited we need evidence so the permissibility is the default meaning that whatever we do is permissible so is it permissible for me to pray in front of the couch yes is it permissible to pray in front of the rear tire of my vehicle yeah it is permissible to pray in front of the fan or the a/c yeah sure is it permissible to pray in front of a mirror answer is yes but you have to lower your gaze and look at the place of prostration so that you are not distracted but if you're gonna pray like this and look at yourself and do this and do this and while praying because you're looking at yourself in the mirror this is not recommended and it would distract you but if a person prays in front of the mirror looking down as if there is no mirror there's nothing wrong in that and whoever says it's strong he has to provide us with evidence from the Quran or from the Sunnah otherwise this is not applicable"
