  "transcript": "a brother sent us a question saying that is it authentic to read a hundred thousand and twenty five times over 125 thousand times al al Karim Allah Allah illa anta subhanaka inni kuntu mina Valley mean for any calamities or for our brothers and sisters in Syria we got this message to read it 10 times and forward it to others so that the chain is not broken first of all this ayah in Surat al anbiya where prophet Jonah Yunus when he was in the belly of the whale said this dua and the Prophet said Alice awesome that anyone who is afflicted by calamity and he says this Allah will relieve him in sha Allah and also he recommended that we make this or recite this ayah whenever we want to make dua so if I'd like a lot to pay off my debts I would say at the end of it like Atlanta subhanaka inni kuntu mayavadi me but to put a limit to it such as ten times or to associate it with reciting at one hundred and twenty five thousand times and sending it to the ten people who would send it by in turn to other ten people and this is a hundred etc all of this is an innovation there is nothing in Islam to repeat anything 125 thousand times not even 125 times so this is an innovation and if you want to help our brothers in Syria you don't do this by messaging and circulating such innovations we help them by in the last third of the night you praise Allah so shall you express your inability and helplessness you we have nothing to do except draw some people may have something a bit extra by influencing their representative in the parliament or in their government by providing humanitarian aids maybe something a little bit more it depends on each individual's ability but what we see is that the Muslims are not doing anything and dua is one of the strongest weapons we have yet is not sufficient we have to do something more other than doing it was reported that the invaders came to invade the country and all the scholars I think it was Napoleon coming to invade Egypt a couple of centuries ago and all the scholars went to the message started reading so he had Buhari what is this going to do for you if you don't know how to fight if you do not defend yourselves you're gonna be slaughtered like sheep and if you don't help your brothers after they're through with them they're gonna come to you to finish the plot they have plotted it years and years ago so you you do not help them by spreading such innovations every Friday people say let's circulate this message offering salutation to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam let us reach 10 million let us reach a hundred million then what what are you doing this is clear innovation neither the prophet has not recommended this nor his companions that had never done such a thing so what you're doing is actually engaging people in something that is not part of the Sunnah on the contrary it goes against the Sunnah and this is not permissible"
