  "title": "Should Urine affected Carpet, Mattress etc be wiped with Wet Cloth 3 times or washed - Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister said from an Islamic website I've learned that a yeren affected kilt or mattress should be wiped with wet cloth three times for purification my question is why three times isn't one sufficient what you have read is wrong this is not the right way of doing it wherever there is a spot of contaminated with urine we have to pour submerge this spot with water then dry it off then if the urine is gone and has no traces this is sufficient otherwise we have to pour more water whether it's a carpet whether it is a mattress or any something anything like that the Delisle is that when a man from the Bedouin nomads came to the messages and he urinated in it the prophet has told them to wait until he is through and then he ordered them to pour a bucket of water on that urine he didn't order them to dig it out he didn't order them just to put some sand on it no pouring water submerging it in water which would mix with it and then dissolve it as urine would be sufficient so what you've heard is wrong"
