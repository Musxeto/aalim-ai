  "transcript": "foreign and welcome to our fourth uh lesson for of the islamic faith um we are at chapter number three so this chapter begins with a statement and this is one of the most important statements in the life of a muslim a true believer the statement says it is allah's right to be the only one offered all types of worship full stop it is allah's right to be the only one offered or all types of worship so here the author is telling us that allah has rights and this is something that is shared by all we all have rights our spouses have rights our children have rights our colleagues have rights neighbors relatives parents our work our country humanity every thing has rights yet allah the almighty has rights over us and these rights are unlike any other right you see a lot of the people don't know what allah is a lot of the people don't understand who allah is and this is why they failed to worship him as he's supposed to be worshipped simple as that but before we go into details let us go into what is allah's right so the author says it is allah's right to be the only one offered all types of worship did you get this from well allah says your allah your god is the one god there is no deity but he the lord of the grace the ever merciful what does that mean it means that as long as there is no other deity with him then we must not worship any other than him and the clear evidence is found in the quran so many verses not only that the famous hadith of muad where reported in the sahih he was riding behind the prophet allah on a mule and then the prophet asked him a question and he said do you know what allah's right upon his servants is and the rights of his servants upon him upon all of his servants is to worship him and not to associate any other with him this hadith clearly indicates that this is a right of allah azzawajal and to make it a little bit imaginable for you rights are either granted or imposed so my father's right upon me is to obey him to be dutiful to him to respect him all the time and try to make him happy this right is imposed upon me by allah azzawajal so i have to do this but it's also partially granted because i have deep appreciation and gratitude to my father when it comes to allah and allah has the highest example right is dictated by the fact that he created us so it is both imposed and granted to perfection meaning that even if allah did not order us to worship him alone we would have done this through our init futra nature and this is the nature that allah has created all humanity upon that is the fit of allah this is how allah created mankind to only feel inclined to worship him alone and no one else with him yet they've been deviated through the environment through how their parents brought them up through the devil's many things so allah's right the ultimate right that we worship him and not offer any type of worship to other than him and as stated earlier this is a natural thing meaning if you were to put a child on an island unattended by humans leaving him to grow up without any interaction with anyone he would grow up to acknowledge the existence of allah the oneness of allah and he would worship allah how this is something that he does not know he doesn't speak any language but this is the fitra the nature that allah created man with now having said that that this is allah's right we all acknowledge that allah did not create the jinn and the humans except to worship him so they know and they have the mission and vision statement and they understand that very well why then do people not do that why do they associate others with allah there are many reasons and we will come to study some of them in following chapters inshaallah but what we need to carefully learn and study is that the biggest problem we have nowadays is not whether a woman has to cover her face or not it's not whether music listening to music is halam or not it is not whether the food we eat is halal or all of these things are minor things yes they are of importance in islam but they are not the most important issue the most important issue is to acknowledge and recognize our creator subhanahu ta'ala our lord this is the biggest problem when i sit with people and they complain why does allah do this to me what i have done to him why does he hate me sometimes i feel he wants to get even with him you hear muslims complaining about allah like this and it shows you that they're far away from islam this doubt they have in their heart means that they don't have certainty of iman that the testimony of faith is not accurate and they're not sincere in saying it and this is the biggest problem they do not value allah and appreciate him as much as he deserves to be appreciated this is why when people lack the knowledge of allah azzawajal when people lack the apida you get problems and this is why some of the westerners thought and said if muhammad ali was alive today he would have solved the problems of the humanity while drinking a cup of tea i think bernard show said this why would he say such a thing because if you have the knowledge of allah about allah who allah is if you recognize how tiny and small and insignificant you are to allah azzawajal this makes you worship allah the fullest fills your heart with appreciation and love to allah azzawajal where it cannot accommodate your heart cannot accommodate worshipping anyone else it is allah's right to be the only one offered all types of worship what do we mean by worship or worship is a terminology that everything that allah azza wajal loves whether it is part of the heart actions or of our rhetoric or our physical actions from the things that allah loves whether they are apparent or hidden anything that allah loves falls under the terminology of or the umbrella of al-ibaad so whatever allah loves and is pleased with it's called a bad and this is why when people talk about alibaba and we will find and we find that there are people who devote their ibata to other than allah azza and what kind of ibaadas are we talking about well there is for example actions of belief and we will come to talk about shirk later on inshallah but if you associate others with allah if you offer any forms of worship to other than allah azzawajal then you will be committing ship and shirk can be in your heart because if you be if you remember we defined iman as a belief of the heart saying of the tongue and action of the limbs of the body so breach of a man can be in the heart in things that you believe so if you believe that there is someone who can create other than allah you are if you believe someone can be possessing anything in this universe other than allah which is total possession not partial partial possession is i own this mobile this is partial no i'm talking about total possession with everything in it the ingredients the creation the maintaining of it the facilitation of it total control over this universe if you believe other than allah can't do this this is kufur this is shirk so those who believe that the prophet ali has the ability to control the universe now after his death in that he knows the unseen and that he knows it and sees everything as if he sees the palm of his hand this is sick they're associating the prophet hassam with allah and this is why you find some places in the messenger they have allah in a circle and next to it a circle in the same size saying muhammad things that people don't pay attention to takes them out of the fold of islam because they don't have to hate because they're attributing forms of worship that can only be attributed to allah to other than allah also as we said in previous lessons whoever believes that other than allah has the right to legislate to say what is haram this is ship to believe that someone has the ability to know the unseen to know the future oh i went to a and he told me that tomorrow is going to be a bad day so i'm not going to work shirk immediately he exited the fall of islam beliefs are so diverse and many all those who believe other than the belief of the prophet islam and his companions will be one of the 72 sects which are all in hell shirk associating others with allah can be in things we say whether we call the dead seek their help ask them to benefit us or to protect us from harm's way calling the jinn calling the angels or angels of allah guide me show me the way all of this is you're not allowed to call any what you do not see except allah the almighty as wajal um mocking the religion making fun of islam insulting the quran saying bad things about the hadith or about rulings that are firmly part of islam all of this is ship takes a person out of the fold of islam and it also can be in your actions when you prostrate to a statue to a buddha or to pray someone other than allah or you sacrifice for the people in the grave or you go around the graves calling the dead asking them to do this or to do that all of these are part of major shirk so the issue of ribada all types of worship is an important issue it is more important than any other issue so it's more important than growing the beef it's more important than the ruling whether to pray in the message or not the ruling of niqab the ruling of is there zakat on women's jewelry or not the issue of clearing purifying your ibadah your worship to be only for the sake of allah azza is the most important issue on earth because this is what makes it and breaks or breaks it if you manage to purify your toeheat your haphida and to worship only allah azzawajal you'll go straight to jannah to paradise whoever is the last statement he says he will enter jannah so it is quite important to acknowledge this fact allah says your allah is the one god there is no deity but him the lord of grace the the the ever merciful type it is his rights of hannah that no one else should be associated with him in any act of worship whether mental verbal or physical and we've covered all these three areas allah says in the quran worship allah alone and do not associate any partners with him so having this out of the way how grave is because if you look around you will find a lot of the muslims committing ship by the way allah says that the vast majority of them do not believe except while they are in the state of shirk the vast majority you go to muslim countries with a majority of muslims and you go to countries without giving them names you guys could think of a dozen you go to their messages and the messages are full masha'allah everybody's praying excellent but when you come to look into their apida which we are studying today you find them worshipping peers going to dargas going to graveyards and offering sacrifice to the dead mawlana so and so i'm slaughtering this for your sake this is they like candles on their graves they write what they want in pieces of paper and submitting it to them when the daughter is not getting married they go to a sorcerer if the son is proposing to a woman they don't want they go to a sorcerer to put a spell on him so that he would not continue liking her ship all of these things take people out of the fold of islam when they lose something they go to a fortune teller to tell them who stole it from them or who did this to them all of these things muslims are doing big time and by doing it they won't become muslim anymore so the gravity and the seriousness of shirk is the most important thing remember in the three principle fundamentals the first question you'll be asked in your grave who's your lord if you were associating others with allah like i've just mentioned you won't be able to answer this question you won't be able to say allah because you're not purely and sincerely worshipping him alone do you think that the jews and the christians would be able to answer this question in their graves no because they did not live by it so associating partners with allah obliterates every good action a human being does everything yes every single every single good deed you've done come on man people i know who had died they were good muslims they were kind they were generous they built like 10 mosques and did so many good things never harmed a fly yes it's true that they used to worship peers and they used to go to the graveyards and worship the graves and call the dead for help but they had so many good things to do well allah azzawajal addresses the prophethood imagine the pro allah is addressing the prophet by saying it has been revealed to you o muhammad and to those before you that is the messengers and prophets that if you ever associate partners with allah all your works shall certainly come to nothing and you shall you shall certainly be among the lost whoa this is addressed to the prophet muhammad these are allah's words to the prophet and they certainly apply to everyone else so when you are proud that we have 1.7 or 2.0 billion muslims worldwide look again are they truly practicing muslims or not are they purely muslims are associating others with allah and you'll be you'll be shocked if you go to places in the far east or even in africa people are wearing certain types of stones because it gives them power it protects them from evil this is ship yet people do it every single day now having said that is there any hope for people who have already fell into this major sin which is shirk well allah does not forgive the association of partners with him unless one genuinely repents ah so there is hope yep there is hope allah says in the quran what translates to for certainty allah does not forgive that partners are associated with him he forgives any lesser sin to whomever he wills in allah and allah also says those who disbelieve and bar others from the path of allah and in the end die and believers shall not be granted forgiveness by allah azzawajal okay so what does that mean it means that shirk is unforgiven if you die before repenting but if you have committed any type any kind of sin whether it's cover ship adultery consumer intoxications intoxications murder stealing anything if you repent allah azzawajal will forgive you how is that see the first ayah allah says for certainty allah does not forgive the part that partners are associated with him he forgives any lesser sin to whomever he wills and this is known as whenever we commit sins and we die if we die and we have committed shirk and did not repent from it allah doesn't forgive it throw him to hell directly no questions asked but if a person committed sins all sins other than shirk or kuffar then this is under the divine will and this is why allah says he forgives any lesser sin to whomever he wills so what counts is whether you've repented before your death or not and how to to to to repent before death there are conditions so scholars say that among the conditions of repentance is one that it is sincerely for the sake of allah you're not repenting because the doctor told you that if you don't quit smoking you're gonna die in couple of months so you say okay i repent to allah no or actually you say i quit smoking why did you quit smoking because the doctor told me to so would you be considered among the those who repented answers no because your intention is not to please allah so the first condition is that it is done for the sake of allah secondly you have to have remorse why did you quit smoking for the fear of allah okay this sincerity number one are you regretful darn no i love smoking and i enjoyed every moment of it and believe me i feel that i want to smoke over and over and i have no regrets no remorse your repentance is not accepted i don't smoke anymore yes but you don't have the remorse the prophet said allah regret is repentance this is the biggest pillar of repentance that you have remorse thirdly they say that you have to quit immediately so yes i am remorseful i'm repenting for the sake of allah but i'll do that after i finish my pack of cigarettes no your repentance is not accepted you have to repent immediately by quitting the sin on the spot and not delaying it number four to intend firmly in your heart not to go back again so i quit smoking i'm remorseful i don't have cigarettes anymore but i intend that when i go next january to xyz country i love to sit by the lake drink cappuccino and smoke a cigarette the britch the brits said i'd smoke a that would be dangerous in america different meaning so the repent is not valid fifthly the fifth condition of repentance that allah accepts is that it happens at a time where it is valid because there is a time where it is not valid where it is not accepted it's too late so what are these times one time is individual and the second time is global so the individual time relates to each one of us if you fail to repent until your soul is exiting your throat you're on your dying bed and the soul is being extracted then allah does not accept your repentance this same thing happened with pharaoh when he was drowning and he saw death coming he said o i believe in the lord that the sons of israel believe in allah did not accept this it's too late as for the global time this is for the whole world is when the sun rises from the west every day the sun rises from the east but when the day comes where instead of rising from the east it's going to rise from the west this is when allah does not accept anyone to repent even if they're alive it's too late so it is important that people repent before they actually die okay but i don't know when to die this is the biggest problem why do you think we practice islam we stay away from haram we refuse to shake hands with women or to mix with them or to have fun men love this why do we not do these things why don't we flirt with women maybe have a glass or two of booze have a good time smoke a joint or to watch some movies listen to music and then just before death we will repent and do well and amend our ways the reason is that we don't know when death is gonna come and the sorest and biggest loser of all are those who indulge in sins thinking that they're having a good time until death comes and knocks on their doors and then they would say oops um can i have a day to repent no okay what about an hour no then give me five minutes i'll just go and pray a couple of rakahs too late this is the scariest moment of all it makes your limbs cold you feel the shiver down your spine it's like when you've been playing all week thinking that the final exam is on sunday and thursday morning they tell you your exam is in 10 minutes time you have to catch up i didn't study tough luck you have to go and attend i don't know anything well you should have i didn't know it's going to be today i was hoping that is a sunday as scheduled well you didn't look at your schedule well it's on thursday and it's at nine o'clock and now it's 7 30. rush to the school before your band but what will i do the same feeling what multiplied by a thousand or a million is when the angel of death knocks on your door okay can i give back some of the money that i took unlawfully no can i pay off some of the debts that i told the people that i didn't take anything from them no can i seek forgiveness from my parents from my neighbors who i have wronged from my spouse whom i've cheated so many times too late then you have no other alternative but to go back to your lord immediately yesterday not now and amend everything that needs to be fixed because you never know when you will die i'm healthy i'm strong i'm as strong as a bull i'm fit i'm an athlete so many people die without knowing when or how so many people die while they're praying so many people die while they're flipping channels watching porn or haram so many people die sinning so many people die in their sleep one of my cousins my own close cousins he was in his late 50s fit healthy went to bed at night woke up great fajr said to his wife i don't feel good i'm gonna sleep till 10 o'clock i'm not going to work today and he never woke up he went to sleep she came the whole time to wake him up he was dead he's gone so you never know when death is gonna come but definitely you need to seek allah's forgiveness whoever dies the author says an unbeliever will be in fire allah says whoever of you renounces his faith and dies an unbeliever his works shall come to nothing in this world and in the world to come such people are destined for help wherein they shall abide and this indicates clearly that people are one of two believer or non-believer muslim or non-muslim so whoever dies a non-muslim even if he was claiming to be a muslim but he was committing shirk or kuffur he would abide for help for ever he would not be admitted out he would never be allowed out he's a disbeliever forever allah says those who reject the faith and thy unbelievers shall incur the curse of allah the angels and all mankind so there is no escape there is no way out except through accepting islam believing in islam this is the only way of salvation whether you like it or not you have the quran you have the sunna you have the akhida look into it do your due diligence if you want to have eternal happiness after your death if you don't give a damn then enjoy your life you've got like 10 20 50 years to live but then you have to face the consequences which believe me are not in your favor so take a look again and watch out before you fail to wake up from the last sleep an unbeliever may bring benefit to people during his life now many muslims argue how is it possible that tom or john or david are in hell for eternity because they're disbelievers they've done so much good to humanity i know this disbeliever who helped me for 20 years muslims did not help me as much as he did and now you're telling me he's a disbeliever i can't ask allah for forgiveness for him that he's going to hell for eternity this doesn't make any sense well watch out my friend because this is what allah has stated to us if a person is beneficial to us even if he's not muslim well a believer or a disbeliever may bring benefit to people during his life which is something allah enables him to do as he brings about all types of benefit to his creation so this tom or john or david who did lots of good things for you it's not him who did it for your sake or for the sake of allah rather it is part of allah's risk allah's provision allah's gifts to you that he made him serve you and benefit you like the rest of his creation allah makes the sun the moon the winds the clouds etc yield their benefit which is greater to mankind so now you're doubting why tom john or david will be ending up in hell because of their belief though they had done so much to humanity the author is telling you this is part of allah's plan allah has made the sun the moon the earth the trees of the the water the lakes cease all to benefit humanity in far where ways greater than what that individual that disbeliever had done yet this doesn't mean anything to disbelieve is to reject allah and this is what he had done he benefited you so what the sun benefits you as well it's all by allah's orders but the sun prostrates to allah and worships him while this disbeliever rejects allah the almighty and he doesn't reject nature and nature doesn't reject allah and allah's punishment of an unbeliever is not for his good deeds that he had done for you rather it is for denying allah's rights which is to solely worship him and sincerely not for denying the rights of nature and this is a crystal clear statement to those who sometimes fall in the mistake of denying things or trying to understand things with their logic failing to understand that logic has no place here we are mere servants of allah azzawajal we didn't create ourselves we were not created out of vacuum allah is the creator allah is a provider allah is the giver of life and taker of life allah is the one who facilitates things for us so we have to obey him submit our will to him and to not associate others others with him um i think we will stop here and take some of the questions pending nas says if i have lied to a person and now i am feeling ashamed to ask forgiveness to the person can i ask directly to allah to forgive instead of asking to that person kindly reply first of all the sins are divided into two types since between you and allah and sins between you and the people the sins that are solely between you and allah are in allah's hands you can ask him for forgiveness and he will forgive you such as smoking such as watching haram things or listening to haram things this is between you and allah there is no third party the sins between you and others these are their rights that you violated the prophet said o people whoever has wronged a person he must seek forgiveness from him in this life before the day of judgment for the day of judgment there won't be any dirham or dinar there won't be any currencies dollars etc there will be only good deeds and bad deeds so in another hadith the prophet said allah to his companions do you know who is the one who's bankrupt the stone broke person they said the man who doesn't have money he said no rather he is the person who comes on the day of judgment with prayer fasting and charity good deeds yet he beaten that person he had struck that person shed the blood of that person he had insulted that person back bitten this person so consume the money and the wealth unlawfully from that person on the day of judgment he will give from his good deeds to compensate his sins which he wronged all of these people and if he runs out of si out of good deeds then he will take from their sins put and added to his records of sins and then thrown into hellfire this means that you have to control yourself it's not sufficient to justify what you do by saying i'm an impulsive person i have rage fits i'm sorry but i had to swear or take his money or do something and lie and cheat and this won't help you you have to pay it for that now should i go and tell him that i lied to him it depends on the outcome if your lie resulted in harm coming his way or him being deprived of his rights or delay in his life like he lost a raise a bonus because of your lie or he was imprisoned and in order to get out of prison you have to come forward then you have to do this but if there is doubt or there is imminent danger coming your way and the harm caused by you coming forward is far greater than the good which is going to result from it this case ask a lot of forgiveness except express remorse repent and try to do a lot of good deeds maybe maybe you'll get lucky maybe allah will forgive you i don't but this is a really serious issue you don't shoot and then ask questions it would have been much safer for you just to refrain don't talk don't lie don't cheat don't do anything that you will regret later on that's safest of all but now unfortunately it's too late so you have to uh think it over and they'll make it easy uh leila hayat says is hell fire eternal or will will it ever cease to exist after some billions of years or more the vast majority of muslims almost all of them agree that hellfire and paradise are for eternity and they will never ever cease ever so it's not a million year it's not a billion year it's not a gazillion year it's infinity that has no ending because allah azza gave it to that with his grace as nothing is eternal except him subhana wa or those that whom he gives eternity to so laila yes hellfire is eternal and would never cease as for some of the quotes that people attribute to ibn kayem and his sheikh in tamiya that they say that it will come to an end one day this is not authentic and they themselves have stated otherwise later on nas no shad says can you tell me how to repent if we take false swear on the quran the false swear whether it is on the quran or simply saying wallahi is one of two either it is something you want to exonerate yourself from that took place in the past or it is something you want to force yourself to do or to prevent yourself or others from doing in the future so for example someone comes to me and says you took my pen i said no i didn't he says yes you took my pen i said wallahi i did not take your pen so this is to save myself from an incident that took place in the past well i didn't go to that restaurant wallahi i didn't speak to your brother these are oaths taking in the pa about things in the past you do not expect this so if you're truthful you have no problem if you are um almost certain that you're telling the truth there's no problem give me ten dollars well i don't have a dime in my pocket because i thought that when i paid the grocery man yesterday i gave him i cleaned my wallet i had no nothing in it then i took my wallet off and i found a hundred dollar in it what is this then my mom said i saw your wallet empty so i put a hundred dollars i didn't know about this so when i took an oath i'm not sinful because i based it on what i remember but if i were telling a lie if i did take the pen and i swore that i didn't take it still there's no expiation why because this is known as the yamin the oath that dips the person who said it in hell fire it is so major among the sins that there's no explanation for it it's too big the only way to be purified is in hellfire so this is serious now if you talk if you took a an oath or you swore on the quran about something in the future and by the way placing your hand on the quran like so many muslims do to emphasize their oath is an innovation this is not from the sun this is disrespecting the quran so you simply say allah you never put your hand even at court in in the disbelieving countries they put their hands on the bible that's their religion is okay because they're kafirs disbelievers who cares but for us muslims we don't do this we don't put our hands on uh the quran and humiliate it in such a fashion so what happens if i swear to do something or not to do something in the future or i swear that you do something or you don't do something in the future now this is an oath that if you break you have to expiate and this oath is not binding because the prophet says that whenever i take an oath and then i see something better than that oath so i say wallahi i will not drink coffee and then i see something that is better when a friend invites me to a cup of coffee and i'd like to attend his invitation and accept his invitation the prophet says as soon i would expiate my oath and do what is better tomorrow i'm not going to my brother's house he because he made me angry yesterday i get a call that your brother is cooking um fish and chips the one you love just said wow okay xp8 and go and eat with your brother this is better than severing kinship and not attending so if a person does this willingly no problem experience if he forces himself not to do something and then he fails and breaks his oath he has to expiate and the expiation is done by one of three you have the choice either that as mentioned in swarath you feed 10 people poor people of the average meal you consume so some rice some chicken some meat an average good meal once to two to ten different poor people or clothe them so you give them a shirt a trousers and sandals and if it's custom of your country to wear something on your head then you give them this toppy or whatever to 10 poor people or free a slave and we don't have slaves anymore so these are the three things if you're unable to do any of them due to financial reasons you don't have money then you may resort to fasting three days and not the other way around so many rich people take an oath and when they break it they fast three days it's not valid you still have to expect by feeding or clothing 10 poor people so this is what you should do and with this we come to the conclusion of our session of today until we meet you next monday
