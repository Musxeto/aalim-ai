  "title": "Will we still be questioned by 2 angels in grave if we recite Surah Mulk before bed? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay i want you to know about the surah moon and as we know that when a person is placed in the grave then the two angels come to ask the question but as we read that uh we will resize to remove every night he will not be questioned and the great but my question is so if there are no questions at all so what happens after their they are putting their way uh brother muhammad to my recollection the hadith states that whoever recites surat al-mulk every night he would not be tormented in the grave not he would not be questioned the questioning is happening is going to happen and this is not related to suratul mulk suratul milk only refers to not being tormented and not being tormented providing that there are no other obstacles that would block this uh surah from saving you from such torment so i think this uh clarifies the doubt the questioning by the two angels in the grave are is inevitable it's going to happen whether you recite surat al-mukh or you do not"
