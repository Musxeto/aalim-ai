  "transcript": "Harith from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. My question is Sheikh, I live in a non-Arab country. Here usually on Monday to Saturday, almost in every Masjid at Duhur time, there is no proper Imam. So they choose, so the respective Masjid choose an elder person to lead us in the prayer. But the problem is he makes some mistakes in the Magharij. He mispronounces some letters in Fatiha. Instead of saying Ha, he says Ha. And I doubt he might pronounce Iyyaka Na'budu. Iyyaka Na'budu. Is my prayer valid behind him? Are you praying Asr and Dhuhr behind him? Dhuhr is silent. So it doesn't concern you whether he knows how to pronounce the Magharij or not. Because this is applicable only in loud prayers. So if you were to tell me I pray behind an Imam in the prayers of Fajr, Maghrib or Isha. And he makes mistakes in pronouncing the letters of Al-Fatiha. So he says Allazina An'amta Alayhim. He doesn't say Allazina. I would say to you, yes, the prayer is invalid. But if it's a silent prayer like Dhuhr and Asr, you don't hear any mistakes. And hence his prayer is 100% valid for himself and for you as well. And Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days. And bithnillah azawajal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bithnillah."
