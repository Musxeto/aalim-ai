  "transcript": "says a person if a person sometimes feels lazy or feel like have to do recommended voluntary prayers etc like it or not whether he likes it or not to earn rewards as it misses tranquility sometimes is it a sign of hypocrisy if i understand your question correctly you're saying that if i pray anticipating the reward but i don't like it so i'm doing it because i'm forced to doing it in anticipation of the reward and i i lack tranquility in it different to a person who loves it and he does it out of conviction and he loves allah etc am i sinful is it a sign of hypocrisy nothing is no it's a sign of weakness of iman because we know that the hadith of the prophet has said that the jannah is surrounded by hateful things and hellfire is surrounded by desires so these hateful things people by nature find them difficult to wake up early in the morning after only a couple hours of sleep and to walk to the masjid when it's cold or when it's too hot and may you may not find the taste and the beauty of that but this is not a sign of hypocrisy because you're doing it for the sake of allah"
