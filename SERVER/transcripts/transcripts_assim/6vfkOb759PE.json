  "transcript": "click my question is as we know that one of the recipients of zakatmani is those who work for Allah's cause since whatever you are doing is for Allah's cause can we give money to your faithful accounts first of all ah azzawajal mentioned eight categories in verse number 60 chapter number nine so these eight categories begin with the poor and the needy and ends with Allah the eighth category has been interpreted differently by Scholars so some of them say is in all means of the cause of Allah whether it's dawah whether it's building messages because it's invisible and orphanages Etc and this is not authentic because like the second group of Scholars who said no this is not a valid interpretation because in this case the eighth category would include all the seventh prior to it so the poor the needy those who are working on collecting zakat those whose hearts are inclined to um Islam the slaves or those who are in captivity those who are indebted uh and so on all fall under the category of visible and this is not logical why then put it at the end just make them seven so the most authentic opinion is directed only to the Jihad to the fighting in the cause of Allah so this is the most authentic interpretation of it and hence of course you cannot give zakat to donate or donate zakat to the counseling sessions that I conduct because this is not part of the sakat uh venues and Allah Knows Best"
