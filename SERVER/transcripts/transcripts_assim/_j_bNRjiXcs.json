  "title": "Ruling of Honor Killing in Islam - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "honor killing there is no honor in it none whatsoever what he over people acknowledge as honor killing found in some countries in the Middle East like Jordan maybe Egypt maybe Algiers I don't know India subcontinent all of this has nothing to relate to Islam killing is killing so if a person kills his daughter because she had an affair with someone and this is fornication this is murder though she is sinful and she had committed a major sin and she should be punished according to the Islamic law but this does not give the right to Tom Dick or Harry it does not give the right to her father or her brother to kill her and take the law into their own hands and sometimes the Islamic punishment the Islamic prescribed punishment for such a sin is flogging a hundred lashes not killing and not for anyone to accuse either by confession if she confesses or by presenting for male witnesses to graphically describe what they had seen otherwise this is not fornication and it's not punishable in Islam by flogging so there's no honor in it and whoever does it must be executed in Islam a life for a life and this is crystal clear in Islam so this he does not relate to Islam and it's not found except in a handful of places where ignorance prevails and this is the general trend now in the Muslim world you want to attack Islam you want to undermine the infrastructure of Islam you don't have to invade them you don't have to send your troops to them dry all the sources of authentic Islam so spread whatever is deviant and corrupt under the flag of Islam and anything that goes with the Quran and the Sunnah with the understanding of the self of the righteous predecessors of the favored generations the three favorite favorite generations in Islam anything that supports it block it and this causes ignorant and when you have ignorant you have chaos and each one shoots from the hip so the man that says Oh fornication is Haram she disgraced my family my name my reputation I will kill her any Muslim any Imam any judge any scholar any student of knowledge would have told him that by killing her you will end up in hell and you will be executed as well but they have managed to undermine the infrastructure of true pure Islam by spreading the deviant cults and sects making them prominent making them louder than anyone else and this is the result may allah azza wajal have mercy on us"
