  "title": "Can a muslim inherit or take from the gift or Will of a non muslim? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "as my non-muslim grandmother included me in her will I know that a Muslim cannot inherit from a non-muslim but the money and the land she wrote a will giving it to me after her death so does that make it Helen also it should be noted that what she gave me was money from investment account that probably is RIBA based and she also gave me the land which was sold and I received some of the money etc so the issue is what's the ruling on a Muslim inheriting a kafir the Prophet said that Islam the Muslim does not inherit a kafir and a kafir does not inherit the Muslim because inheritance is a strong bond and connection that Islam wants to separate Muslims from the non-muslims even if they are next if gain even if they are your parents or your offspring however it is the consensus of scholars that a Muslim can write a will well actually a non-muslim can include in his will a Muslim and also the majority of scholars say that a Muslim can also include in his will a nun mostly because when you write a will this is like a gift so what's your ruling on me giving my cafard brother and my sibling part are giving him a gift this is completely permissible as in the case of for example Omar may Allah be pleased with him he sent a piece of cloth made of silk to his brother who was a disbeliever in Mecca asma bint ABI bakr also requested the prophet as to be kind to and this is one of the narrations to her relatives etc it is beyond doubt that it is permissible to give and to receive gifts from a disbeliever and a will is like so however scholars limited this will to be in equivalent to what we are allowed to write in our wills that is one-third of whatever you leave behind so if your mother sister wrote to you the whole thing the whole nine yards then the majority of scholars say that this is not allowed you can only take one-third and if the remaining of the heirs for example if you have other siblings if you have grandparents of your mother's side if you have someone who would inherit in Islam your mother if they were all Muslims including your mother if there are people are such airs they have to give you permission to take the whole thing otherwise you can only take 1/3 there is an opinion of scholars of some scholars saying that in the case of a nun Muslim if he dies and all of his will all of his inheritance all of his money would go to the kafir government in this case if he writes the will to his relative who's Muslim then the Muslim may take the whole thing and inshallah if this is the case if the character would benefit from the remaining two-thirds and it goes to the government you're more entitled to take it as a will but not as an inheritance and Allah so gel knows best"
