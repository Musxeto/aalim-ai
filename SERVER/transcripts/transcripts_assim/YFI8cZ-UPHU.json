  "transcript": "my question is that is there anything that the jinns pray after midnight in the middle or center of masses that night and if people go for praying tahajud and pray in the center of the masjid the jinn can kill or harm them people here are afraid and don't go to mercy that night for this reason can you please okay will it answer that is there anything like this i will do that inshallah shemshat from india says we have this conviction that after isha after midnight the jinn come into the masjid and they pray in the middle of the masjid so whoever comes before fajr or after midnight and prays in the middle of the masjid they will kill him and they will attack him and possess him so people are afraid is this any uh has any authenticity is it true the answer is totally bogus totally fabricated and this is what the jinn want the jinn wants us to fear them because we are told that the jinn fear the humans but when the humans express their fear from the jinn the jinn become courageous and they start to manipulate and abuse and intimidate the humans there is nothing none whatsoever in islam about the jinn coming to the masjid or harming anyone in the masjid they are unable to harm anyone in the house of allah azzawajal let alone someone who who's coming to pray they cannot harm you and they cannot do anything wrong to you and allah"
