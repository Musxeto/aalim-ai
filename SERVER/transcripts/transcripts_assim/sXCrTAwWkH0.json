  "title": "Prayed 1 Rakat of Isha Before Midnight, valid & Asking for fatwa based on a view of another Madhab",
  "transcript": "uh ahmed from the uk i have a quite um lengthy question i'll try and um basically there's a person who intended to praise shirt but then he decided to eat first before praying so while he ate his mom told him to go shopping so he went shopping and then after that he had to for mediocre purposes he had to go to a bar for sterilizing fluid um why he came out so he and he intended to pray at the end of his time if that makes sense like just before it was about to end midnight so while he came out of the bath he found out there was only a few minutes left for aisha um so he rushed and he tried to pray but when he concluded his prayer he found out there was that he he concluded the prayer after the time of asia ended by a couple of seconds maybe like 30 seconds or more um and he wants to take the safest view and i think you you have a view but he wants a view uh mila forgive me if i'm wrong but he wants the view that if you miss one if if you miss one prayer um i think there's a view that says you become a careful if you miss if you deliberately miss one prayer you become a carefree i think you take a different view but can you give me the opinion regarding that if that makes sense from the uk he's got a long tail and at the end of his tale he says that if a person managed to pray risha prayer and after he finished isha prayer he found that the time of risha was up 30 seconds or so ago first of all ahmed i don't answer according to what people believe so you don't come to me and say i'm a hanafi and according to the hanafi madhhab one two three so what do you think according to the hanafi madhhab akhi ask a hanafi scholar when you come to me and say i follow the opinion that says skipping one salah intentionally makes you a kafir so what's the ruling ask someone who believes that i don't believe that skipping one single prayer makes you a kafir this is not true so when you ask me okay yeah but answer me i'm not gonna do that you have to go and ask someone who believes that or ask me about what i believe and i believe that if a person according to the sunnah and this is the problem with people who do not follow the sunnah or do do not read the sunnah the prophet told the salazar that whoever manages to pray one rakah of asir before sunset then his prayer is valid meaning that after finishing muraka when he stood to pray the second rakah son was already has already set so he finished the second the third the fourth raka while the sun was already down in its maghrib time his prayer is valid so if this brother finished the four raka's of isha and managed to do that 40 or 50 seconds after midnight which means that the first second and third raka were done before midnight definitely his prayer is valid"
