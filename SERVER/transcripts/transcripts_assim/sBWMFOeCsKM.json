  "transcript": "okay i think the camera is done today is what it's upside down today oh it should be um yeah vertical like this yeah it's always been like that oh really ah i think so it's always been uh landscape not uh portrait what up to you i have no problem with your helmet ready when you are okay um yes inshallah [Music] and we begin today with the third fundamental with al-assad that imam al-mujed muhammad took us and walked us through and these are the questions of the grave who is your lord what is your religion and we have discussed this now he's going to begin with the third uh principle or the third fundamental principle and that is the knowledge of your prophet who is this man who was sent to us nam knowledge of your prophet muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam he is muhammad the son of abdullah the son of abdullah bin hashem hashem was from the tribe of quraish and quraish was from the arabs and the arabs are from the offspring of the prophet ismail son of the prophet ibrahim may allah said pay blessings and peace upon him and let's let's let's explain a little bit what we have read so it is part of your religion it is a fundamental principle of your religion to know who you prophet is and this knowledge everybody who said yeah i know who my prophet is my prophet is muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam well this knowledge some scholars like me allah have mercy on his soul and i depend a lot on his writings because he's one of the best contemporary scholars of our times may allah have mercy on his soul so in his explanation of um they say that there is no volume is there any volume no sir one of the comments just said there is no volume do we have volume yes we do yes we do okay okay then they should check their own speakers so knowledge about the prophet alice islam includes five things number one to know his lineage one would say okay why would i have to know about his lineage knowledge about his lineage gives you an insight of how important the prophet is among his tribe and this was a well-known fact that the messengers the prophets are selected to be the elite of their people yes he wasn't the richest but indeed he was one of the most honorable among his people and his name was muhammad his father's name was abdullah and his grandfather's name was abdul muttalib so his name is muhammad and we mentioned this earlier that hashem had a brother by the name of al-muttalib so he asked his brother al-muttalib to go and fetch his son who was born in medina and his name was atik he that is hashem married in medina and his wife gave birth to a boy and they named him atik and he stayed there until he was 14 or 15 years of age then hashem asked his brother al-muttalib to go and fetch his son when al muttalib went there stayed there for a few weeks gave compensation to the family of the child's mother or the boy's mother and her family and they felt secure to send their kid with them to be with his father and to be reunited with him when al-muttalib took his nephew and came into mecca the people of mecca who know one another so with him this young boy and they could not relate him to anyone they knew so they said they thought that he must be a slave of al-muttalib so he said oh they said oh this is the slave of abdul of of and he tried to convince them that this is my nephew his name is but the name got attached to him so our prophet's grandfather was abdul muttalib and there is no god that the idol worshipers used to worship by the name of almuttali brother it is the name of his uncle and abdullah is the son of hashem hashem is from the prestigious tribe of quraish and quraish is a tribe from the arabs who relate to and who are the descendants of two great messengers of allah ismail the son of ibrahim so we know that ibrahim had two sons isma'il and his hap isaac or his half peace be upon him is the father of all the sons of israel so all the jews and their messengers descend from islam while the arabs have the messenger and prophet muhammed who is the descendant of ismail so peace and blessing be upon them all so first you have to know his lineage secondly you have to know his age and we will come to speak about this insha allah we all know that he had lived for 63 years and the first 40 years he was not a prophet or a messenger he was a normal person when he reached 40 we know that he became a prophet and a messenger so where was he born we all know that he was born in mecca and he migrated to medina when he was 53 years of age and died in medina 10 years later thirdly we have to know as part of our knowledge about our prophet eyes we have to know about his message that he had lived which was for 23 years so the first 13 years of his life let me rephrase that the first 13 years of his message were in mecca where he called the people to islam after 13 years allah ordered him to migrate to medina where he lived there for 10 years so 10 13 this is 23 years of age so what did these 23 years constitute of well as scholars say the prophet alaihis salaam was made a prophet when allah revealed to him recite in the name of your lord who created created man from clinging substance by this he became a prophet and later on allah revealed to him another set of verses which read so allah is ordering him by saying oh you who covers himself with god with a garment arise and warn and your lord glorify and your clothing purify and uncleanliness avoid and do not confer favor to acquire more but for your lord be patient and we will come to discuss these verses in a while insha'allah the question that may arise is what's the difference between a prophet and a messenger so why do you say that he became a prophet when allah said recite in the name of your lord and he became a messenger by you oh you who covers himself with the garment what's the difference between a prophet and a messenger scholars say that a prophet is someone whom allah azzawajal gives wahi or reveals to or speaks to but does not order him to convey a new message and you legislation and you shari allah so this is a prophet there are hundreds of prophets who are not messengers they are righteous people selected elite but allah does not give them a new religion rather they rule and preach the religion of the previous messenger so many prophets of the sons of israel were there but they all followed the sharia of musa peace be upon him not a new sharia while a messenger is someone who's revealed to with a scripture within you sharia law with a new religion with a set of rulings and commands that are not similar or are not the same as the messenger before him so this is the difference between a prophet and a messenger and by this we know that every messenger must be a prophet but not every prophet is a messenger so every messenger who has received a new revelation a new law and is calling people to his new religion he must be a prophet by default but it's not the other way around so you would have prophets who are not messengers and who are following the religion of the previous messenger before them and um okay i think um this is number um four yeah and the fifth aspect of knowing your messenger is what was he sent with so what did allah azzawajal send him i can know my prophet's name his lineage where he was born where he migrated i can know uh how long he was a prophet how long he was a messenger how long he had spent in mecca and in medina but the core of all of this the most important thing of all of this is that i have to know what his message was so what was his message what what did allah send him with of course allah sent him to preach people to heed and to warn them from shirk and to show them allah's sharia and to order them to implement it by doing what allah azzawajal has ordered them to do and to refrain and stay away from what allah has prohibited them from doing them from doing so allah had sent the prophet allah to take the people out of darkness into the light and this light that we muslims live in is the greatest blessing of allah azzawajal which would lead us inevitably and eventually with the grace of allah to al-jannah okay now he lived for 63 years 40 of which was prior to his prophethood and 23 of which he is spent as a prophet messenger he became a prophet due to allah saying read and a messenger due to the saying of allah yeah or you wrapped in garment his homeland was mecca and he later migrated to medina all of this is of course all of this of course is part of the four uh categories we mentioned which is part of knowing the prophet salam the fifth category which is yes nam his homeland was mecca and he later migrated to medina and allah sent him to one against sheikh and to cultivate pure pure monarchism the proof for this is allah saying all you are wrapped in garment rise and warn and magnify your lord and purify your garment and abandon idols and do not give away something in order to have more and be patient for the sake of your lord the meaning of rise and warn of course of course these these verses are in the beginning of surat al-mudifer and the sheikh gives one interpretation to it by saying yes now the meaning of rise on one is one against shirk and called to taheed and now this is this is an instruction to the prophet alison you know after he saw jibril and he was he became a prophet he went home asking his wife khadija to warm him up with some blanket because he was shivering out of fear and after few days when it was time for him and he was capable physically and mentally to accept the message allah gave him the instruction to become a messenger by ya all you who are covered with your garment com founder rise up and warn warn of what this is what allah azzawajal says to warn the people not to associate others with allah which is known as shirk association anything with allah in worship or in lordship or in his beautiful names and attributes this is called shirk and we went through tahit and spoke about it so he warns people not to fall into shirk and he orders them to implement tahiti in their lives okay now an abandoned idols now i don't know what verses before what is it and your lord glorify yes and your lord glorify akbar allah is greater than what than anything that can cross your mind whatever you think is great allah is greater so allah azzawajal's greatness is in all aspects whether it is in actual size or in power or in status or in subduing everything that is below him as the wajal allah subhanahu wa ta'ala is the greatest of all and once you manage to glorify allah to magnify allah to say allahu akbar and to have this in your heart you will be a true servant of allah and this word unfortunately allahu akbar we usually hear it when they make fun of islam when they claim that the jihadists only say allahu akbar before they blow up people and this is ridiculing and discrediting this beautiful phrase one of the greatest phrases of vikr is allahu akbar we hear it about a hundred times per day and night imagine the adhan and the iqamah almost maybe 70 times a hundred times the muadvin says allahu akbar he says it six times per event this is 30. he says it maybe uh four times per ikama this is 20. this is 50 times only by the thin repeating allahu akbar in our salat we have 17 rakah and each rakah has it one two three four five six almost so six by 17 this is like 102 if you give or take and we're not calculating the sunnah prayers so we say allahu akbar so many times after the third prayer we say 33 times multiplies by 5 this is 115 no 165 i'm bad in math also we say 34 times before we go to bed so when allah says and magnify your lord it's not only saying allahu akbar it is what's in your heart and how you feel about allah azzawajal some scholars say when you raise your hands in the beginning imagine that all of your worries all of your fears all of your debts and concerns are carried by your hand and you toss them behind your back and saying allahu akbar so now you are praying to allah azzawajal wholeheartedly so to glorify to magnify allah to say is to magnify him with tawheed and then he says which translates to and purify your garments which means the tone this is one interpretation clean your garment this is obvious in black and white and atoms understand that purify your garment is to clean your garments some scholars according to the narration of tabirin who interpreted the quran they said with means that your heart you should purify from sick from grudges from hatred from any ill feelings and intent and this is one of the interpretation it can be understand understood this way and it can be understood in the literal way which is to purify your clothes because we cannot uh um pray without having pure clothes and some say this is regarding your heart some say this is regarding your deeds so you have to purify your deeds from shirk and so on are the idols and abandoning them is to declare that you have nothing to do with them other tafseer says is impurities so all najasa we have to be away from whether it's najasa that is physical i can see i can touch i can wash off or it's sentimental something that is not physical if you read surat chapter 9 allah says in it verily the idol worshipers are najas are impure and this is not physical because when i shake my hands with an idol worshipper or a christian or a jew i don't have to wash my hands this is spiritual impurity due to their associating others with allah subhanahu wa yes an abandon means to leave them and free yourself from them and those who worship them okay he reminded he remained doing this for 10 years calling the people to tawheed and after 10 years he was ascended up to the heaven where the fight okay first of all he remained on this for 10 years so from the age of 40 until the age of 50. all what he did in mecca was to purify people's artida from ship so we find that in these ten years there were no legislative commands no zakat no fasting no prayer nothing dealing with gold is haram for men halal for women women have to cover uh men have to do this no there was nothing all what the prophet used to call them for 10 years in mecca was about to hate about iman to believe in allah and his scriptures and his prophets and messengers and the angels to emphasize the fact of the day of judgment and the belief in the decree all of this the prophet devoted all of his time to call people to and to explain it to them so for 10 years he kept on calling people to taheed on in the 10th year allah azzawajal ascended him in the miraculous night journey to the seventh heaven and this journey the most authentic opinion that it took place once physically and spiritually but it reoccurred many times spiritually afterwards so the prophet sallam was taken to see heaven and hell was ascended to the heavens many times spiritually through a vision through a dream but only once that this miraculous night journey took place physically and spiritually with his soul this took place once only and scholars say that this took place after the death of two of his greatest supporters his uncle and khadijah his beloved wife so as a way of showing the prophet assalam and consoling him allah granted him this marvelous and magnificent journey the majority of scholars say that this journey took place in the company of jibril peace be upon him on a animal known as and this animal is not from this world it is something that is smaller than a horse bigger than a mule and it's step is faster than light so when whatever it looks to its hoofs reaches there to the end of his sight so if if this animal could see like god knows how far this is where his step is going to be the majority of scholars say that the prophet salaam first went to jerusalem baital maktas and he prayed there leading the prophets and messengers whom allah has gathered for him to lead in prayer then he descended to the heavens some scholars say that this was the other way around and that he descended to the heavens from mecca then on the way back he went past passing by jerusalem or al bayton makdis where he met the messengers and prophets and led them in prayer then he went back to mecca and this narration the latter one which was not chosen by the majority seems to be the most authentic due to the fact that when the prophet hashem was descended to the sixth heaven to the seventh heaven each level each heaven he was met by a messenger or a prophet so he met yusuf he meted he met musa he met haroon he met ibrahim and each one when being introduced acts as if he does not know him so who's this this is muhammad and has he been sent yet he said yes and if they met him earlier in jerusalem in beitel magdes where he led them in prayer they should have they should have recognized them so this is what supports the story that says that it was the other way around which was not mecca jerusalem jerusalem the seventh heaven and backwards no it was mecca the seventh heaven seventh heaven jerusalem jerusalem back to mecca knows best so we know that he met all these messengers and so these marvelous things that he had told us about when he uh took that magnificent journey which everyone said that this can't be and all the idol worshipers started making fun and so an opportunity to cast doubt in the muslims minds about this impossible task and the first one they've tried their tricks with was abu bakr so they went to him and said didn't you hear what your friend said he said that last night while we were asleep he took a journey to jerusalem which we usually take a month and so one way to reach then he was ascended to the seventh heaven and then came back in the same night so abu bakr immediately without any questioning said i believe him and the idol worshipers were shocked and they said you believe him in having such a journey which we cannot make even in a month time he goes in couple of hours and comes back says yes i believe that he receives revelation from allah from the seventh heaven and you expect me not to believe that he can go in such a journey and come back in the same night definitely i believe him since that day abu bakr was known by the name of the one who believes so this is what had happened and they tested the prophet alaihis salatu as some of the narrations state that when the prophet was adamant and insisting on his story and they knew that he had never visited jerusalem in his life before so they challenged him and they said to him okay as we are all travelers we've been there describe al-masjid al-aqsa to us describe al-aqsa mosque so the prophet sallam did not know what to do because he can barely remember it and allah raised al-aqsa masjid as if he can see it and he started to describe to them each and every gate and window and the colors and the entrances and the idol worshipers were shocked and not only that he said that on my way back i saw a caravan that the people of quresh dispatched couple of months ago for their trade in syria and it was on its way back and the first camel leading this caravan its color was so and so and they should be arriving within two to three weeks and he gave them a specific date on that date the people of mecca went out to see if the caravan is going to come or not into this surprise an amazement they saw the caravan coming in with the same camel leading the caravan as the prophet had described anyhow this is something that is not within the scope of our work because we're talking about this information each and every muslim should know each and every muslim must have the knowledge about the biography of the prophet the incidents that took place his battles his ins and outs so that he would be able to answer the question in the grave correctly and the last phrase now so he prayed in mata for three years and thereafter he was ordered to make the hijra migration to medina okay we will stop here inshallah so he prayed alaihis was where we know that in the magnificent journey this beautiful night journey allah mandated prayers upon him and his followers so if someone asks you what is the origin of the five daily prayers we offer every single day you tell them with confidence that this was given directly not through a mediator usually revelations are given through jibril verses of the quran are revealed through jibril usually but when it came to or when it comes to the the five daily prayers this was given directly from allah to the prophet hassan when he was in the seventh heaven the thing is that it was given originally as 50. so when he came down to the sixth heaven he was met by musa peace be upon him and i love this man i love musa may allah peace and blessing be upon him this generous and magnificent and strong messenger of allah ask the prophet as a son what did he give you so the prophet said he mandated 50 prayers per day and night upon me and my ummah look at the mercy of this magnificent messenger he said no go back to your lord i have been handling the sons of israel the jews and i know that your people will not tolerate this go and ask him for some clemency from for some mercy and reduction so he went and allah dropped five so he kept on coming and meeting musa and moses saying no no ask for more and allah dropping five and another five another until the 50 became five daily prayers musa said no go back to your lord and ask him for more reduction your people will not tolerate this the prophet here said allah i am ashamed i can't i'm too shy to go again and ask allah azza so allah revealed the almighty that i have prescribed them as 50. now it is only five yet you will be awarded as if you have prayed fifty five daily imagine if we were to pray 50 times a day meaning that every 27 minutes or every 28 minutes we have to stand up and pray nobody will do this believe me all of us will become kafir allah gave us this mercy of his five daily prayers that won't exceed an hour in total yet till date people are saying can we have 20 or 40 percent discount like you can drop fajr and asar this is too difficult man yeah if i pray the hurt that's more than enough subhanallah from 50 to 5 and this is allah's grace upon us so the prophet prayed the five daily prayers in mecca the last three years and he used to pray them in twos when he migrated to medina the twos became four except for fajr and maghrib and this was the prayer of a resident person but when you travel it goes back to being to as it was initially mandated so i think we will stop here inshaallah and we will take your questions in the remaining time being the first question is yeah can i make a dua saying and allah and the likes of it no problem inshallah institute to ask any anything from allah azzawajal that is appropriate and accepted nam the next question in islam ali completes what time should should it be in between with her if observing it at the last part of the night and dracula uh i did not get your question can you ask it again please i think the person is asking uh if they are doing their with the prayer just before superhero is it possible to do it at that particular time and do the sahaja yogis the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said in an authentic hadith which translates to night prayer is performed in twos two raka's you offered salam then two raka's you offer salam so if you are afraid of the break of dawn you have to conclude with one rakah which means that the break of dawn is the time that the the time limit where it ends the moment the mu evan says meaning that this is the break of dawn and you cannot pray with her anymore and you should not pray anything afterwards because not pray prayers time has ended now next question is did the prophet mary khadija at the age of 40 please muhammad whenever we need we we utter the name of the prophet we have to offer salutation yes the majority of scholars say that the prophet's age are sam was 25 years when he married khadija and that she was 40 years of age now some scholars challenge this and say no she was 28 others say no she was 30 plus and this we do not have a confirmed piece of knowledge that we can rely on and hence we always follow what the majority of scholars of of sira say which is that the prophet's isa married khadija when she was 40 years of age this is what the majority of scholars say and there isn't any big issue that requires us arguing about it whether she was 40 whether she was 30 whether she was 28 what does it what difference does it make so people just want to say no he didn't marry a woman that it was 15 years of age older than him i i don't see any problem in that and i don't see any need to make an issue out of it as long as the majority of scholars of seerah had stated that and allah knows best whom i grew up with my uncle then things went easy were not easy so i was using his name instead of my father's name do i have to change the name now that i am grown and now that it's not good for one to use the name of another except his father it is one of the major sins in islam to be attributed to one who is not your father so anyone who is called after his uncle or another tribe or another name of a man who is not his father he is cursed by allah azzawajal and this is a major sin so the answer is yes you have to immediately change your name in your documents and what people know you and recognize you by and to use your father's name and your family name then why don't we recite aloud in some salat and recite aloud in the sun because this is how the prophet recited it was and he's the one who said to us pray as you have seen me pray we haven't seen the prophet praying islam but the companions who described his prayer told us that he used to pray silently in the four raka's of the four raka's of assa the last raka of maghrib and the last two raka's of isha and when the tabi'in asked the companions how did you know that the prophet isam used to recite quran in the silent prayers like it's silent so how would you know that he used to recite the quran they said that we used to see his beard trembling from behind him so we know that the prophet islam had a big large thick beard so if he was moving his jaws while speaking this would cause his beard to tremble and people could see that it is shaking which means that he is reciting something now uh sheikh please what is the ruling on wearing a pajama that has a cartoon growing on it to pray night prayers but it covers the pyjamas with the hijab is it permissible or rather it's my prayer valid the prayer is valid because it's covered by your hijab by your abbaya however once you finish the prayer and you take it off these drawings these pictures will surely prevent the angels from entering your house the prophet said that the angels do not enter a house that has a drawing a statue or a dog so if the angels of mercy do not enter such a house by default all the devils and satans would be surrounding you as there is no one to defend you so the prayer is valid without a doubt but you should be more careful and obedient to allah by taking out these uh clothes or pajamas or whatever has such drawings on it to be safe and allah knows rest i found money on the ground and i don't know the owner and i searched for the owner but i didn't get the owner so what will i do next this is known in islamic [Music] and it means that something that you pick up from the ground and scholars say that it is either something of value or something that is without any value so for example if i find a pencil or a cheap pen that you buy from a grocery shop five for uh for example for a hundred niera maybe i don't know um if you find one on the ground lying down nobody attending it it's not in a drawer it's not on a desk in a school it's on the ground it's strong and you pick it up and leave there's no problem in that if you find a ten year i don't think you have 10 nier that's to go 100 naira maybe 100 niera on the ground and people usually when dropping such a note bill would not care to go and look for it because it's so negligible it's nothing so if you find it you can pick it up and take it but if you find something that is of of value if you find a hundred dollars bill 100 dollars built or you find an expensive pen that costs a lot or you find a watch that's valuable or you find a wallet or a bag of money a sack of money scholars say no this is something that you have to bring the attention of people that you found something of value so if i find a watch i would take this watch take the description of it keep it safe and then go to the areas around where i found it so i found it in the street i go to the masjid i go to the supermarket i go to a mall and i go maybe to a police station nearby and i say to them listen guys my name is assam hakeem my phone number is so and so i found something of value and they say oh what is it is it a wallet is it money is it a watch is it i found something of value and i have the description of it anyone who comes looking for something of value please give them my mobile number so i get calls i lost my rolex sorry i can't help you okay i lost my um wallet what was the wallet's color this is a color uh it was made of tiger skin sorry so i have the description of it and for a full year i announced it if no one comes in to collect it and describe it correctly i can keep it and have it but if someone comes and claims it yes i have to give it to him the vast majority of people see a wallet on the ground and they look around nobody's attending it has answered my calls he takes the wallet tosses the id cards and the visa cards away and takes the money that's inside this is stealing this is haram money for you if you were to lose your wallet would you like someone to do the same with it or would you like him to look for your number and call you and give it back so be careful and may allah grant us i mean is it true but if i deliberately delay my prayer i do not have to do them again this is accurate when you delay your prayer until the time is over so i wake up at fajr fajr is 4 30 i wake up at 5 o'clock sun rises at 6 00. and i delay i sit read them emails finish a novel do this do that until it is six o'clock and the sun rises and i said okay let me pray now no you cannot pray your prayer is invalid because you did not pray it on time likewise someone sitting in the office working on the emails and uh doing meetings someone says okay it's time it says um yeah i know i know we have still three hours to go the whole time i said we have an hour and a half okay so her time uh we have half an hour and i have this important meeting tell you what after i finish the meeting i'm gonna pray so he's aware of the time and while he's in the meeting they hear that he says guys excuse me i have to go and pray motherhood continue your meeting don't pray because your prayer is invalid it's not going to be accepted because prayers are time bound you deliberately neglect your prayer until the time is over your prayer is invalid if you forget it truly forget it for example yesterday i had asked zad so i finished ask zad exactly at risha time i drove home i went to see my mother for an hour because usually i sit with my mom between maghrib and aisha every single day but whenever i have asked zad on tv i have to compensate her after asia i finished about nine plus 9 30 maybe went to my home and i found my daughters sitting with my wife talking about you know things about religion so i participated and gave them my insight and we had a fun quality time which usually i have once every six years i don't support my kids a lot unfortunately because i'm too busy and i'm too lazy so while we i was talking it became maybe 11 15 and the time of russia ends at 11 40 according to uh our times in jinda so my wife said okay i love the way you talk in in a friendly way not in the way you you think and and and the girls are having fun but i think if we continue we're going to miss sesha and i said oh oh i forgot myself i didn't pray subhanallah so this is forgetfulness even if we continued talking and it became twelve o'clock or one o'clock and the delay of isha was due to forgetfulness or to sleep these are two justify uh legitimate reasons to make up for the prayer but if you do leave it deliberately you cannot make it up and allah knows best allah foreign"
