  "title": "How long should the khutbah be? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the Prophet said Ali is a lot of Salaam when a man makes his prayer long and his hapa short he demonstrates his good understanding so this means that it is part of your knowledge and felt this is not intended for itself rather it means that a person should have the hood back concise and to the point when you ask Muslims who attend these hour-long hood was after they come out of the Masjid how was hot but they say wow man this man is an orator he can speak endlessly his foot was so eloquent fluent masha'Allah yeah what was it about said I don't know he spoke about everything from the beginning of time to the the day of judgement I can't remember anything he's big loaf of bread but there's no beef in it so this is problematic it's not how people are impressed by how eloquent and fluent you are it is the benefit so I'd rather that your speech is 10 minutes 15 minutes at most but the people come out almost remembering every word of it and they come out with a theme and they come out with points to be followed rather than giving them a lecture type football that they come out not remembering 10 percent of it and this is why a lot of the youth tend to stay away from messages as - he makes me fall asleep he speaks for an hour I can there for an hour I don't understand these same so it's best to follow the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam"
