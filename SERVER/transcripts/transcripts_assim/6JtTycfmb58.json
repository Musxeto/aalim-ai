  "transcript": "number two how do we stop sinning this is an issue that depends entirely on the amount of Eman in your heart so this again needs a lecture but in a nutshell first of all learn more about the beautiful names and attributes of Allah soldier learn more about toe heat we are doing hamd Allah every Friday and Saturday a live session on Halawa tell a soul which is in Acadia which shows you opens your eyes to who Allah is what is Islam what is who is the Prophet eyes are Salaam this strengthens Eman in your heart thirdly you have to surround yourself with righteous practicing Muslims twenty-four seven hours 24 hours seven days a week always be with the Muslims in the Masjid or in the Islamic Center engage yourself with robada with the congregation this weakens the desire for sins and finally add as many as you can to your schedule reciting the Quran making dhikr and individual forms of worship night prayer fasting Mondays and Thursdays and the white days engaging in watching beneficial lectures because this uplifts your Eman and reduces your desire to sin and Allah knows best"
