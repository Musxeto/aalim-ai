  "transcript": "muhammad from pakistan uh my question is regarding playing quran in the car while driving sometimes i go with my mom and we turn on sure khaf in the car and but she asked me questions when while it is reciting and i hesitate because i think maybe it is sinful to talk during recitation ahmed from pakistan says sometimes i listen to the quran while i'm driving with my mom and she may ask me a question or two and i'm hesitant to reply feeling that i would be disrespecting the quran no simple yes and no answers or a short sentence does not disrespect the quran which you've been listened to the whole time so if you're listening to the whole surat cafe and she says oh look this is a new building when did it start and you said five months ago and you move on you did not disrespect the quran but if you start to engage in an argument or a conversation that would totally distract you from listening to the quran and the quran would be playing as if it's background music no this is disrespectful turn it off and speak with your mom until you are over with"
