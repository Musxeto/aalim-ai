  "title": "People of subcontinent following Madhab, Ancestors, Peers, Mawlanas instead of Quran & Sunnah- Assim",
  "transcript": "now in the subcontinent they don't have any for ladies in the message this is wrong and this is part of them unfortunately not following the Sunnah so many wrong practices in the subcontinent people there in majority do not follow the Quran and the Sunnah they'd rather follow their peers their scholars their leaders who themselves may not have sufficient knowledge of the Quran decision but they follow what they had learned from their ancestors from their forefathers so their religion their conviction is based on imitation not on conviction and belief and this is very dangerous on the day of judgement Allah Azza WA JAL would not ask you about the al-qaeda or about the belief or what so-and-so scholar or leader or peer used to follow Allah Azza WA JAL would ask you as an individual what was your response to the prophet alaihi wasalam y ou may you an ID him fire kurumada algebra to moon more saline Allah Allah would call them out on the day of judgement and ask them what have you responded and answered the prophets so you cannot say well imam have been humble said so-and-so Imam Shafi said so-and-so abu hanifa said so-and-so if you are presented with the verse from the Quran and you can read that it's in black and white or you presented with an authentic Sunnah of the Prophet a sermon Buhari in Muslim intermittent açaí yet you reject it and say no no no I follow my mother have a fee if you are a layman and can't differentiate between a verse and a hadith yes you go ahead and follow your mother but if you're an intellectual person an indicated person you can do your own research and you are assisted to do so by a scholar or a student of knowledge who has no hidden agenda rather than to show you the right path then the is definitely unacceptable so we would urge and call the people and the Muslims all over the world special in the subcontinent where they have strong conviction and belief they love Allah so Jill the Muslims in India and Bangladesh and Pakistan I am so astonished with their commitment to Islam with their love for this Deen I see them in my messages here in in in the local areas when they come out of the messages they see someone begging never you ever you would find anyone passing by without putting a rial or something similar to that in the hand of this beggar though he is a beggar we know most likely he's a professional beggar but out of their love and compassion they do this how they observe the sunnah prayers that is almost similar to follow and this is one of the wrong misconceptions but still we praise them for that for it when people come and say share we pray 17 records for Isha said wow this is a lot actually is only four records yesterday we spray this before in this after and then the Scheffer and the water and and these put a lot of prayers into one but they pray it religiously they are committed to it so there are so many things that are good about them but when you don't have commitment to Quran and Sunnah when you don't have full adherence to the Quran and Sunnah this is when Shaitaan comes and he distorts Islam he manipulates people unfortunately and this is why the vast majority there are warned of a lil hadith of the salafiyyah over hello Chanel Jamar they say don't follow these they hate the Prophet SM they hate the met haves in the school of thoughts and the mess lakhs all of this is blatant lies none of it is correct but this is pulling the carpet from underneath there thus their scholars and their peers and their leaders who are making money out of the masses when they see that their congregation are following the Quran and the Sunnah this means that they are going to get away from their grip and their control and this is something they don't want or like and this is why they warn and they tarnish the reputation of those who follow the Quran and Sunnah and this is wrong"
