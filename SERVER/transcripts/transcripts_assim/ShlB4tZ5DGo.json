  "title": "Gas incontinence: How many times to renew Wudu after passing wind during Wudu?assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Qul Hathihi Sabeeli Adu'u Ila Allah Sami from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. So I know that for someone who has gas incontinence they may hold Wudu for every Adhan. But my question is, when can I take the dispensation of someone with gas incontinence? Like if I make my Wudu and I'm certain that I broke it, and I make a second one, and then again I'm certain, do I make a third one? For how many Wudus do I say I have gas incontinence? So if a person is doubtful whether he has gas incontinence or not, he's one of two. Again, either he's a person that knows through previous experiences that once it pops, it never stops. So it keeps on going on, on very close intervals. That would not be logical for him to make Wudu. In this case make one Wudu and pray, even if you break your Wudu. Because you know from experience that it's not going to stop. Or you know from experience that this would take 15 to 20 minutes or half an hour, because of something you ate, because of your habits, I don't know how or why, but you know that it's going to continue for half an hour, and then it stops for another half an hour or an hour. If you know this, then it's prohibited for you to pray during this first half an hour. You have to wait. And until it stops, then you make your Wudu and pray fresh, without having any problem. What if I'm in between? I'm hesitant, I'm not sure. In this case, I would think that delaying your prayer until almost the end of time, when you feel that it's not going to stop and the time is going to expire, in this case you make Wudu and pray without a problem, and Allah knows best. That's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it, inshallah, within the following two days or three days. And by Allah's will, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, by Allah's will."
