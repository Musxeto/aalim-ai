  "title": "Committed lot of sins & repented but feel ashamed to make dua to Allah for anything assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "alhamdulillah yes my question is um what is what advice would you give to a person who thinks that he has done some things in the past and he has repented but then he he wants to ask Allah for a need and he keeps on asking Dua but then um he's convinced it will be answered because Allah says I will respond to the call of the for the supplicant but then he still worries that his sins might block his needs like he's feeling ashamed to ask those needs from Allah due to his sins and scared that it won't be answered so can you clarify this though this is from shaytan yes we know that Allah has pledged to answer the call and the supplication the Dua of a person and any person making Dua must have certainty in his heart that Allah will answer him and he has to have positivity thinking of Allah azzawajal now having said that we have to acknowledge that answering your Dua might be in giving you what you want or deflecting harm that is equal to what you're asking for or by storing it for you on the day of judgment when you come to meet your lord so this is being answered oh Allah grant me a million Kuwaiti Dinar and I've been calling for Allah azzawajal for the past 40 years and nothing happened I'm still positive because if I don't get it in this life I know that Allah has deflected many harm that was predestined to happen equivalent to that amount but I don't know it people might have been killed I might have run people by car accidents fires so many things or Allah is storing it for me when I meet him on the day of judgment now having said that you make Dua and you have to be positive and certain that allowed answer it but at the same time thinking negatively of Allah that oh he will not accept my repentance oh Allah is still going to have my old sins haunt me though I've repented and I felt remorse and I moved on this is thinking negatively of Allah so you have to rectify this immediately"
