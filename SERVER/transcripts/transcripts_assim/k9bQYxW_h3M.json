  "transcript": "oh [Music] Lord alhamdulillah and my back the day of arafah the ninth of the 12th month of the lunar or the Islamic calendar a great day a day which is one of the best days of the whole entire year of um the prophet said in Italian the best of supplications is the supplication on the day of arafah of course this is for the pilgrims and the best which I and the prophets before me have said is this statement by the way had been with us throughout the whole book many many times in in many many places none has the right to be worshiped except Allah alone without any partner to him belongs all praise and sovereignty and he is over all things omnipotent so this is the best Dua not in Islam it's even the best Dua that the prophets before the prophet Allah used to say may Allah have peace and blessing upon them all now in arafah we stay from the daytime until the sun sets then the Pilgrims go to musdelifa what do they do and say over there the following chapter is at the sacred site Haram may Allah be pleased with him said the prophet Allah wrote is his camel the prophet's camera one of the fastest and the best in Arabia until he reached Haram and he then faced the Qibla supplicated to Allah and exalted him or exalted his greatness and Oneness he stood until the sun Shone but left before it Rose when is this you remember after Sunset the Pilgrims go to muzdalifa is part of the Sacred shrine while arafah is part of the Halal shrines so once you enter muzdalifa you've entered the Haram area now the whole of muzdalifa is considered to be this is a specific name but the specific name which the prophet went to as we have just described after praying Fajr prayer so the moment the dawn breaks the prophet prays Fajr then he rode his camel and he went to the area known as though Muslim the whole thing is called but specifically this spot where the Masjid in muzdalifa is so this is a spot where the Sunnah if you want to follow the Sunnah to go to and to make Dua until light is almost shining but there's the sun did not rise yet fully so this is part of the Sunnah after you finish you go straight to Mina what to do in Mina when you go to Minna you throw the pebbles in what is known as jamaratula for those who did not go on the day of Eid now it's the day of Aid the sun has almost risen and we go to jamaratilla and we throw it with seven Pebbles and we say with each pebble foreign Etc the following days 11 11 12th and 13th we throw each one of the three jamarat with these seven Pebbles there is an authentic Hadith that these jamarat initially are the places where Satan came to seduce to provoke to intimidate whatever Ibrahim peace be upon him and Ibrahim through these stones at him until his legs went into the ground when he moved a little bit further he came back again in the same thing happened so this is to remember Allah azzawajal by doing so and the sunnis after you throw the small jamarat you take a side and make Dua then you throw the second jamarat seven times and you face the Qibla and you make Dua when you throw the last Jamara Jamara you do not make Dua afterwards then we move on to another chapter which teaches us what to say when you see something that amazes you or Delights you the prophet Allah as in Hadith number 240 he used to say whenever he's amazed of something or is delighted of something Allah so when something happens if someone asks you a question that is shocking or amazing or it shows that he did not understand your astonishment should be translated into praising a glorifying Allah by saying subhanallah glorifies Allah or how perfect Allah is also sometimes you may see something that really draws your attention or makes you happy when you hear about the victory of the Muslims over their enemies and you say Allahu Akbar Allah is the greatest everything is related and connected to worshiping Allah the Almighty [Music]"
