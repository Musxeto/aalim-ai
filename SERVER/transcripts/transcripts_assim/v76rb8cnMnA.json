  "transcript": "what's the significance of prayer mats people say we must respect the prayer rugs and that we must not pray unless we place the prayer rug this is a common misconception among a lot of the muslims and they give value to things that have no value in islam so if you go back to the quran and to the sunnah you would never find any mentioning of a specific prayer mat to be used by individuals for example the prophet said alaihis salatu in the well-known hadith that allah has favored me with five features that none of the prophets before me had had them and he mentioned among it or these features that allah has made the whole earth a place for prayer and a means of purification so a muslim whenever prayer is due he can pray on any surface whether it's sand pebbles concrete a carpet tiles if he marble if he's in an airport anywhere in the market anywhere because this is pure unless proven otherwise yes there's dust there is dirt but it's still pure and acceptable to pray few centuries ago maybe people started developing due to their ignorance of religion this tendency to be more roman than the romans to be more enthusiastic towards things that they think are related to islam when they're not so they started developing things and to make it part of the rituals of prayer some of them were a kufi for prayers and i've been to syria turkey to the bosnia herzegovina and you see the muslims there they would throw you a kufi if you uh don't have anything on your head and you ask what is this no this is for prayer after the salah they throw you prayer beats i don't know maybe they should have introduced frisbees that would have been more fun what is this what where are they getting these things jesus keep on throwing things in the masjid this is not part of islam but it is who developed these things in their minds that now it is a ritual and among these rituals the prayer mat so people consider prayer math to be sacred oh it's this is what i pray on every single day and it has the picture of makkah medina some of them think that it has some sort of being sacred because of the pictures and not only that after you finish prayer you have to fold it never ever leave the prayer mat open why say because shaytan will come and pray who said that shaytan is going to pray who says that if i leave the must-have open shaytan is gonna pray or gonna read it do you think that he wants to learn do you think that he wants allah's forgiveness he could have asked and allah would have forgiven him but he doesn't want this and he doesn't need that so all of this is a bunch of baloneys it's nothing it is totally not related to islam a prayer mat is a piece of rug you can prey on it if the earth or the the ground or the floor is impure and you can wipe your car with it without any problem who made it sacred who gave it this importance in islam no one so who are you to blame me if i use it to do or to for anything it's a piece of cloth it has nothing no wait in islam so i hope this clarifies things more and"
