  "transcript": "from the u.s says which one of the kunut is more authentic the more the most authentic one is the note of al-hasan even allah be pleased with the man with his father who was the grandson of the prophet salaam came to the prophet when he was a child of seven years of age or so and asked him to teach him what to say of witter seven year old child so the prophet ordered him or taught him to say allahu mahdini female hadith to the rest of the well-known short dua and this is to be recited after rising from the rakura so this is the most authentic dua that a person should observe now some narrations state that the companions used to do another dua where the hanafi school of thought usually follows and some say that this is authentic some say that this is not some say that this is only authentic to um may allah be pleased with him but not to the prophet so to be safe rather than sorry stick with the one that the prophet did teach his grandson which is definitely the best and the place of it is after rising from the rakur to recite this al-fatiha then a short surah for example then say allahu akbar then make the dua this was not reported to my knowledge from the prophet it might have been reported from other sources but not from the authentic hadith that the prophet made dua before the rukur the most authentic is that he used to do it after rising up from the record alano's best you"
