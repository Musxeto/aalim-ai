  "transcript": "So, we go to your direct phone calls and we have Yunus from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam. So, there is in my family a really old Moroccan woman. Most likely she never went to school. She may be an alphabet. And she's like over 90. And I called her and she was so happy that she said something which goes like, it is as if you greeted Allah. I think it's... So, it's very likely that she said this and I'm only that precise because I don't want to accuse her of saying something wrong. So, if it was something trivial, I would have said, yes, she said it. Now, the thing is, should I now call her and say... Can you say it in Arabic? Yunus, what did she say in Arabic? It was in Moroccan dialect. I'm not good at it. In Darija? What, what? She said it in Darija? Yes, correct. So... Just say it to me in Darija. I may understand it. I say it wrong. Maybe it goes like, Okay, okay. This is metaphorical. And she did not intend anything bad of it. We sometimes here say something, We say sometimes, what does the Prophet has to do with it? The Prophet is not here. So, sometimes people say things unintentionally. There is no need to call her and to tell her that. But, inshallah, and she would not be sinful for saying something of the sort. And Allah knows best. And Allah knows best. And Allah knows best. And Allah knows best. And Allah knows best. And Allah knows best. And Allah knows best. And Allah knows best."
