  "transcript": "from bangladesh my question is my father works in a river-based bank so is his money halal for me or what to do with his wealth after his death uh i'm confused about it okay so you you killed your father already or not yet uh sorry you killed your father already you want to inherit him from now or you're thinking for the future um from bangladesh he says my father works in an interest-based bank so what should i do with his income and if he were to die what would i do with the wealth he leaves behind first of all do your level best in utmost kindness respect while being dutiful and while being diplomatic to explain to your father that working in an interest-based bank is totally prohibited and the income is haram and that he will be held accountable for that on the day of judgment there are many many fatwas and it is easy to convince them alhamdulillah i know tens if not hundreds of bankers who quit banking after listening to this secondly if he refuses the money he brings home is halal for you your siblings your mom there's no problem in eating from it consuming it using it because earning it is haram for him once he earns it then he dispatches it somewhere else those who take it would be halal for them and the sin remains on him so there's no problem in that for you inshaallah finally if he dies whatever he leaves behind is halal for you to inherit and the sin would only be on him alone may allah guide his heart to the right path you"
