  "transcript": "[Music] it's a beautiful day in abuja nigeria i'm honored and privileged to be among you addressing you but my lecture might be a little bit confusing because the title was confusing for me and i was thinking what is this so i had to improvise as usual and i hope that you will benefit from what you hear i will not say something new i believe that all of you know what i am about to say but it is a reminder it is something that insha allah would help you increase your iman in allah azzawajal says in the quran and what translates to and we have sent down to you the book the quran as clarification for all things and as a guidance and mercy and good tidings for the muslims the book as a clarification for for all things now this confuses a lot of the muslims because they say if i read the quran i will not find an answer to mathematical problems it will not tell me about equations in physics or things in geology yes we understand that there are signs in the quran hints but it says a clarification for all things so can i find in it how to manufacture a pvc pipe the answer is no then what or how do we understand this ayah all scholars agree that the quran includes or has in it an answer to everything related to religion related to sharia related to islam this is the ultimate book that allah has revealed to tell us the information we need to know about our existence about how things happened and where we're going where we come came from and what will be happening to us all what you need to know about islam is found in the quran but allah told us what benefits us what adds value to us and the things that do not matter allah does not speak about for example ibrahim peace be upon him once was trying to prove to his people who worshipped the stars that they are not gods so he saw a planet this is my god he saw the moon this is my god he saw the sun this is bigger this is my god but when they all set he said no my god is allah the planet that ibrahim saw which planet was it was it venus jupiter mars neptune no one knows why doesn't anyone know because allah did not tell us do we have to go out of our way to try and identify and spend half an hour discussing which planet it was definitely not when miriam was born all the priests and dignitaries of her people pledged to provide and sponsor her to take her under their wing and they disputed so allah tells us in the quran that they drew the lots but these pens these straws allah did not tell us were they made of straw were they made of wood were they made of metal the people and the youth of the cave we all recite the surah on friday they had a dog what was this dog a german shepherd a duberman a chihuahua allah knows what type of dog did allah tell us i will ask you on the day of judgment what type of dog was it never therefore these questions do not come up because allah did not address them and hence we should not ask them at the time of the prophet alaihis wasalam people used to ask him questions and he would answer he would clarify the situations in the different issues that cross people's minds because he was sent a mercy to mankind and religion has been completed so as allah mentioned in surah tillman chapter number 5 verse number 3 today i have completed your religion so the religion is complete there is no one can come and say uh listen we would like to add this issue or clarify this khalas the deen is finished is complete until the day of judgment and the prophet is the seal of prophethood so nowadays you don't have the right to come and ask about things that have been completed in religion you do not have the right to innovate i think i will invent a new prayer where i put my right hand on my left hand on the forehead this is more for sure people do this no i will do this in some countries when you pray after salam all the people put their hands on their heads as if they're going to fly what are you doing he said no no this is where where and they suppress themselves from maybe flying with the angels i don't know what are you doing this is an innovation he said no no no everything you people say innovation innovation innovation no there are things that we can make up and invent why not i'll tell you why not at the time of the prophet the companions used to do things some of them the prophet would give them a thumbs up it's okay so one of the companions is praying surah after fatiha and then says every single his companion said what are you doing this is not from the sunnah either recite one surah or recite but not both of them he said well i'm the imam you like it alhamdulillah you don't like it choose someone else they complain to the prophet the prophet says it's okay leave him allah loves him because he loves this surah we know that this is okay if you do it today no problem but it is not sunnah because the prophet didn't do it islam it is permissible now muhammad comes from yemen the moment he comes through the prophet he prostrates makes sujud and the prophet said no muhad this is shirk not permissible i know that in some cultures they do this and i've seen this so many people come and shake hands with me they do this this is haram this can only be done to allah azzawajal can only be done to allah show your respect by your actions not by forms of worship only applicable to allah it is not permissible if someone is sitting and a dignitary a shaykh comes we stand up why are you standing up we stand up only for allah ah we stand up out of respect sheikh no this is not halal this is haram because it makes me arrogant when i come and everybody stands up yes you didn't stand up oh you are at a danger this is not right okay what about the lecture beautiful introduction it has nothing to do with the lecture true true i'm just stalling for time they told me i have to speak for 50 minutes so i have to fill it up with something so people are listening until now they're not asleep alhamdulillah that's good for drawing their attention so going into the lecture the time before time and i don't know what's the lecture title is it's confusing for me or before time or time what was there before i don't know anyhow there is a beautiful hadith and in this hadith there are so many benefits we can obtain but we don't have enough time okay try your best sheikh i'll i'll do that don't rush me i'm too old i can't do it so fast he says that the people of yemen came to the prophet alaihis salatu accepting islam and the prophet praised them complimented them and said to them that i give you the glad tidings of allah's forgiveness so they said okay prophet of allah we accept it but we have a question how did this thing begin look at this question the arabs speak few words but to the point how did this thing begin life universe earth heavens so many things around us beyond our understanding how did it all begin now the prophet is the one authorized to answer so he did not tell them you should not ask such questions fear allah because he's the one who gives answers so he says to them there was nothing but allah and his throne was over the water and he wrote everything in the book and created the heavens and the earth full stop now this hadith tells you about the origin of everything all humans animals insects birds living creatures everything in this universe acknowledge that there is only one allah one god they call him god though god is not allah's name we do not usually as muslims use god but we say it because maybe non-muslims would listen and they say what is allah so everything acknowledges the existence of allah azzawajal and this is the challenge that allah gives to atheists when you see an atheist he would say there's no god okay fair enough let's look at you allah says in the quran or were they created by nothing or were they the creation of themselves you are one of two either vacuum created you you were nothing and boom you exist or you created yourself which one is it any atheist would say hmm vacuum cannot create so no vacuum cannot create and i did not create myself so i'm in a dilemma now what is the answer it is allah azzawajal who created us this hadith tells you there was nothing but allah in another another authentic narration there was nothing before allah in another narration there was nothing with allah so the only thing that is independent the only thing that can exist by itself is allah the almighty you no matter how strong you are how wealthy how powerful you are nothing without allah you cannot even breathe without his permission your breath is not in your control whoever can control his breath raise your hands please one nobody yes and this brother who raised his hand if you can control your breath hold your breath for five minutes and we have the animation corner office next door they will take the rest no one can control his breath because this is a gift from allah azzawajal no one can control your blood in your veins because this is from allah the almighty and if you read the quran you will find that allah tells us in surah al hadeed he is the first and the last so allah is the first without a beginning and he is the last without an end and allah tells us that his throne was on water so in the beginning there was nothing but allah allah does not need the throne we need a chair to sit on allah azzawajal is self-sufficient allah is independent allah does not need the throne to rise on or to be high allah is high by nature subhana this is one of his beautiful attributes that he doesn't need creation to be high over and to be upon so what came first the throne the pen the book the water it's an issue of dispute among scholars in the beginning there was only allah then they say allah created water and on the water allah created his throne and then allah created the pen and told the pen to write and that was 50 000 years before creating the universe and then allah azzawajal created the heavens and the earth this is what we know about allah subhanahu wa and creating the beginning of creation of the things that we were told about and the throne is something that is beyond imagination the prophet allah that the throne is being carried by angels and allah tells us in the quran those angels who carry the throne and those around it exalt allah with praise of their lord and believe in him so does allah need the throne no of course not does allah need angels to carry the throne definitely not but this is only to show his servants his majesty his power subhanna so when you stand in prayer you know who you're praying for the prophet tells us i was permitted to speak and describe one of the angels that carried the throne of allah azzawajal between the earloop and their shoulder and his shoulder a journey of 700 years now imagine how long would it take you to go around earth the e-loop to the shoulder is a journey of 700 years how big is this angel allah does not need his throne subhanallah and here we come to a fork of the road here we come to a choice between iman and kufur should we believe blindly in what we are told about things of the unseen things that we do not actually see or should we reject and disbelieve in it the biggest mistake a muslim does is when he measures things of the unseen things of the rabe with his own logic and intellect with the measurements of dunya and there he rejects what it is authentic but his mind cannot incubate it i've heard this so many times muslims coming and saying how is it possible that every day the sun goes before it sets or at setting time to prostrate to the arch until allah tells us go and rise again how is it logical the sun keeps on setting and rising and setting and i don't believe in this how many times do we hear people say how is it possible that allah ascends to the lower heaven when it is the last third of the night and he says is there anyone seeking forgiveness so i would forgive him is anyone making dua so what i would respond to him how this is not logical how is it possible for us to believe that a person in his grave is being made to sit and he is questioned and he is tormented in his grave when we open the grave and we don't see any marks of torture or burning or any of that how do you expect me to believe that on the glorious night journey israel when the prophet went with jibril he passed by the grave of musa and he found him there praying then he went to jerusalem and led all the messengers including musa in prayer then he ascended to the sixth sixth heaven and he saw moosa there how is this possible how do you expect us to believe allah praised us believers that we believe in the unseen and we believe in things that we're told without seeing it and this is why when we come to things of the unseen it is like when malik ibn anas the great imam of medina was asked how does allah rise over and upon the arsh this is i can't understand this so he said to him we know that he rose over it but we do not know how believing in it is obligatory and asking about it is biddah these things of the unseen allah did not tell us how they happen but we have to believe in them now if we have people of physics and mathematics they will tell you that in our life we depend on three dimensions the width the length and the depth or the height these are the three dimensions that we can sense and feel around us and since we are born we know only these three dimensions there is however a fourth dimension which is related to time and this is something we cannot actually measure they have equations and they have theories and they have relativity theory and this and and so many people talk about but all theories but we believe that it exists and to make this a little bit clearer when we sleep we go into fourth dimension seventh eighth ninth so many different dimensions other than the three dimensions we know and this is understood when you wake up and you say i've been to so many different places i've seen the past and some of us may see the future and it happens as he's seen it what kind of dimension is this this is something that we cannot explain but we believe that it exists these new dimensions that we sometimes find in our sleep there are many more in the afterlife and this is why death is the only thing that will liberate us from the three dimensions and we will introduce us to new dimensions as allah says it will be said you were certainly in unmindfulness of this and we have removed from you your cover so your sight this day is sharp this is when you die your sight of seeing things your ability of seeing things will become clear and sharp this is why when we mention the companions of allah may allah the companions of the prophet may allah be pleased with them we love them because they had the perfect iman unlike us our iman is on shaky grounds they believed and they never asked these questions how is it possible that the sun goes and prostrates to allah they did not ask this how is it possible that this happens or that happened they believe because they have conviction that whatever is mentioned in the quran or is in the sunnah is from allah the almighty likewise the belief in writing the destiny of people the prophet says and he wrote everything in the book everything we do is written in the preserved tablet and i get so many questions from all over the world saying sheikh is my spouse predestined and this is usually from people who did not get married so they're thinking okay should i change a suitor who's proposing or not and it comes from people who are already married and stuck well what can i do is he pre-destined i have to live with him unfortunately what can i do or can i change my destiny we do not know what our destiny is and this is why we have to believe in that allah azzawajal had written everything that is going to happen 50 000 years before it before allah created the heavens and the earth so this iman is one of the pillars of iman it's the sixth pillar of iman without it you're not a muslim how does it add value to me it gives you content it gives you happiness it gives you peace of mind even if i drive and i have an accident i will not be in a state of rage i will come out and say alhamdulillah allah predestined this alhamdulillah nobody was harmed the metal is metal we will fix it insha allah alhamdulillah for everything if my son dies allah predestined it is it in my hands no allah made this my destiny i accept it i embraced it and i'm ungrateful to allah and there are four pillars in the belief of destiny there is a pillar of writing so everything is written your provision when you were going to die your spouses your children everything that's going to happen imagine everything that is going to happen is written even a piece of grain or sand that flows from one place to the other due to the wind and when one leaf out of the trillion leaves on earth falls down in a spiral movement it is also written where exactly it's going to fall where it starts to fall and when it's going to land everything is written down in this preserved tablet and this is done by allah's knowledge so the second pillar is one writing two knowledge allah knows what was in the past what's happening today what is going to happen in the future what is not going to happen in the future how would it be if it were to happen allah's knowledge is not like yours and mine and you make the biggest mistake in your life when you compare allah azzawajal to yourself the third is intention the divine will is the third pillar of your belief in destiny so allah azzawajal willed it what do you mean sheikh allah willed everything that's happening on the earth good deeds and bad deeds because those who do bad deeds cannot say allah did not will it i i defied allah's will i'm doing something that allah doesn't want allah wants this is legislative will allah will make it happen this is universal will when allah tells you do good things this is religious and legislative will allah wants everyone to believe and to become a mu'min this is legislative some will some won't those who will then they have fulfilled both types of divine will legislative and universal but those who don't and i hope the sisters don't feel bad about this because when i say good and bad they say why are you saying bad to us no no it's just metaphorical so when people do not comply and do not believe they're fulfilled the universal will but not the religious and legislative will and this is a topic that needs more explanation but not now and the fourth pillar is creation allah has created us and everything we do so your actions are creation of allah no one in this universe is a creator but him so it's either the creator or the creation so one says yeah but i can create i can bring some wood some metal some uh nails and make a statue i can make a car i am a creator you are simply assembling you are forming but you are not creating out of mere nothing this is creation when you have nothing and you make something allah created the materials can you create materials no so this is one of the ways of talking back to atheist when they say we can create we say okay go ahead create wood for me from nothing they can't now having said that having taken you to this journey of knowing how things all began and that allah was there and there was nothing with him before him and subhanahu wa'ta'ala is independent from all of his creation and he does not need any of it then why were we created allah says in the quran i have not created the jinn and the mankind except to worship me but what is meant by worshipping me some people have the misconception to believe that worshipping allah azzawajal is to go into one masjid sit there 24 hours seven days a week and do it thicker and this is not worshipping because you need someone to feed you you need someone to take care of your children and family you need someone to take care of the community so what's your role in that i'm worshiping allah azza no you're not you are a beggar we call it in arabic you wait in the masjid for people to put their hands in their pockets and give you money and you say alhamdulillah you have this one thousand long prayer beat one thousand isn't this a little bit too much yeah i'm making too much dicker who are you counting it for are you counting it for allah allah knows everything he will not miss one count are you telling yourself about it then you're crazy you don't know what you're doing this is showing off subhanallah subhanallah you don't need to count do it without any numbers but when you do it like this you're showing off that listen look at me i have these 1000 prayer long beads and this is for making vikram a righteous person what is worship then how can we worship allah akhi in order to know and understand what worship means it is a word that includes everything that allah loves anything that allah loves and is pleased with both of words rhetoric and deeds both open and hidden this is considered to be ibadah by this definition when you go with your spouse take her out for dinner intending to please allah this is a form of worship when you drink a cup of coffee or tea when it's 1 or 2 a.m so that you become stronger to pray to hajjud drinking coffee or tea is a form of ibadah when you are kind to someone who's lost and you guide them for the sake of allah this is a form of ibaadah so being positive in your community is a form of ibadah helping others is a form of not only limited to prayer fasting and giving zakat which is or which are one of the pillars of islam but rather expand this a little bit further so worshiping allah azzawajal is the purpose of creation agree agree but unfortunately or fortunately depending how you look at it your form of worship your ibaadah will not be accepted except with tawheed is the most important knowledge in science on earth to heed is to know allah azzawajal and this was mentioned in the hadith of the prophet nowadays i come from saudi arabia you know that and whenever the people see saudis like me they will say wahhabi wahhabi what do you mean by wahhabi i thought in the beginning that is what you eat with sushi fish you know you dip it in it and they say no no that wasabi so wasabi were having different sex who knows what is wahabi people who do not want tawheed call anyone who follows the sunnah as wahabi what is wahhabism there is nothing on earth called wahhabism i come from saudi arabia no scholar no student of knowledge no imam would say we don't have anything like this so what is wahhabism there's nothing who is calling us as wahhabis those who follow deviant sects and cults who do not want the sunnah so they tarnish your reputation so that you do not follow the sunnah when you say to hate i met once or i saw once a clip for a quote unquote darii who was making fun of tahit and he says where is tawheed in the quran show me where tawheed is in the quran subhanallah is everything mentioned in the quran don't you believe in the sunnah show me in the quran at the jail is the jail mentioned in the quran and yet by consensus of all muslims he's coming we believe in him and if you don't believe in him you are not from allah so in the sunnah the prophet said to muad you will be meeting people of the book let the first thing you call them to is the heed this is the prophet he's telling muad ask them to do tawheed so to hide is from the essence of our religion it's not from wahhabi it's from your own religion your ignorance is what's causing you to be blinded by the truth so go back to the quran and sunnah don't listen to me don't not listen to him don't look at him so go to the quran and the sunnah and learn your religion what is tawheed tawhid is knowing allah azzawajal and there are three types of tahit the head of lordship the head of worship and the heat of beautiful names and attributes okay this is confusing sheikh i'm beginning to feel sleepy no problem i still have time so what is the head of ship what is lordship is to worship allah azzawajal and to believe in his oneness by his own deeds what do you mean by his own deeds i acknowledge that allah is the creator anyone can create other than allah no then without hate is good allah is the provider allah is the sustainer allah is the giver of life allah is the taker of life it is who facilitates everything if you believe in allah azzawajal through his actions then you have to heed a ruby checked and by the way all idol worshippers believe in that you will never find someone 10 minutes okay in arabic it's 15 because the zero so i don't know if it's in arabic or in english anyhow the topic is not even halfway but i will comply inshallah so if you go to idol worshipers they're they're worshiping their idols huh and you tell them does your idol bring the rain so no can your idol create no can you idle provide for me a paycheck or does things through me or heal my my sick said no nothing so then he's not allah azza he's not worthy of being worshiped so the vast majority of people inhabitants of earth they believe in the tawheed of lordship so we move on to the second type of tahit which is the head of worship in arabic and this is the opposite in direction acknowledging that allah azzawajal is the lord of all through his actions is acknowledging that allah is only worthy of being worshipped through our actions so all types of my worship must be devoted to allah azzawajal allah says and allah decreed that you should not worship other than him and allah says and worship allah do not associate others with him so this is one of the most important types of tahit why because the dispute between the messengers of allah and the people took place here when they went to the idol worshipers and they told them that allah sends the reign allah facilitates things allah gives life they said we could not agree more we believe you amen but when they told them that okay if you believe in lordship now you have to believe in worship so you must not sacrifice other than to allah you must not pray prostrate bow other than to allah you must not seek refuge in other than allah you must not have hope in other than allah the idol worshipers said whoops no we stop here and why is that they say because we worship and pray to our idols so we cannot only devote forms of worship to allah the almighty alone we cannot do that here is the fork of the road and here is where they went astray whoever believes in to heed of lordship yet rejects to limit to heed of worship to allah he's not a muslim and we find that the vast majority of people and muslims are making shirk in this type of tawheed the third type of tawheed is the tawheed of beautiful names and attributes of allah and this we have so many sects and cults in islam all of them went astray when it came to believing in allah's beautiful names and attributes so to believe in allah's beautiful name and attributes you have to believe only in what allah described himself and what the prophet alaihissalatusam described his lord with how is that allah says in the quran there is nothing like unto him and he is the hearing in the scene anything that crosses your mind you have to put a limit to it because it's not true allah is nothing like him at all and to believe in allah azzawajal and beautiful names and attributes without any distortion without any misinterpretation without denying the reality and without asking how is this how is this attribute of allah azzawajal now all of this leads us to the beginning when there was allah and nothing with him nothing before him and nothing like into unto him you have to believe in this so that your mind is conditioned not to go astray you have to to have the conviction that allah is unlike any of what we know people come and say i have bad thoughts about allah azzawajal suppress it don't believe in it don't think that allah needs any of his creation allah says and say o muhammad praise to allah who has not taken a son and has had not uh and had no partner in his dominion and has no need for a protector out of weakness and glorify him with great glorification this is only to allah azzawajal he does not need anyone now the vast majority of muslims are in great danger the vast majority of muslims commit shirk and this is mentioned in the quran allah says and most of them believe not in allah except while they associate others with him the vast majority of people associate others with allah sheikh we don't prostrate to idols we don't believe in idols we believe in allah yes but in your actions in your heart you have a lot of shirk how is that possible allah azzawajal threatened and warned his beloved prophet muhammad he gave him a warning in the quran and he said and it was already revealed to you and to those before you that if you should associate anything with allah your work would surely become worthless and you would surely be among the losers the gravity and seriousness of shirk is beyond thought yet the vast muslims fall into it how many muslims and i just give examples how many muslims when they build a house would slaughter a sheep and take the blood and put the stains on the doorsteps or on the foundations of the house in arabia there are many when you ask them what are you doing this blood is najis said yes but we're seeking barakah baraka of who this is a sacrifice for jinn how many of the muslims may do acts that expresses their dependence on other than allah azzawajal when you are in trouble do you first go to the doctor or make dua and make rookia the vast majority when your child falls sick immediately to emergency room and after he prescribes the medication and the lab tests and the x-rays then after you go back home let me do rookia no it should be the other way around my dependence on allah azza is to make rookie and immediately take him to the emergency ward so many things when my heart is connected to my boss for my paycheck or is my heart connected to allah azza which means that i will never cross red lines to please my boss so that he would not cut off my paycheck so many things in life that we do yet it indicates that our iman our dependence is not fully on allah the almighty i know that i might i may have lost you but to recapture once people ask you what was the lecture about you i don't know it's just blabbling all the time to recap in the beginning before time there was allah azza and nothing with him and by the way time is a creation it wasn't there in the beginning and it's not going to be there at the end it's only in this period in the beginning there was no time and in the end when allah admits you and me insha allah to jannah there will be no time it will be for eternity and this is something we cannot comprehend we know everything has an end being in jannah has no end it will be for eternity but this eternity is not original it is dependent on allah azzawajal allah's eternity is original this is one of his attributes subhanahu ta'ala that has no end our eternity is bound to allah's will and it stems from his grace muhammad [Music]"
