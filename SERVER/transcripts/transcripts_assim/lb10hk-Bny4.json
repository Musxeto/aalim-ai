  "transcript": "[Music] so how should we congratulate each other on Ramadan some people say that to congratulate one another because of Ramadan is wrong and that it's it's an innovation why would you say such a thing they say because in order to say something is permissible or not we have to have the origin of it in the Quran and in the Sunnah and this is a valid argument I cannot come and say every single Friday sending text messages Gemara mubarak a' meaning that this is a blessed Juma why isn't it blessed yes it is blessed but did the Prophet ever erase off son do this answer's no the Companions yes is no wasn't it blessed at their time yes yes so if they had the reason to do it yet they did not do it this means that it is not legitimate and this is why a lot of the scholars classified as bidam okay then why don't we cascade this to Ramadan Ramadan is different in Ramadan the Prophet himself used to address the Ummah by saying that there has come to you a blessed moba a blessed month of Ramadan and Allah has mandated upon you that you fasted where the gates of heaven are opened the gates of hell are closed etc so the Prophet himself used to congratulate the Ummah and the seller for themselves used to congratulate one another by congratulating themselves of this coming of this great season where people do a lot of good deeds so congratulating one another by making duaa by saying shahada mubarak ramadan mubarak blessed is the month of ramadan may allah azza wa jal make praying and fasting upon us easy may Allah make us get as close as possible to him in it or anything in the sky's the limit of nice words nice Torah would be highly recommended and permissible [Applause]"
