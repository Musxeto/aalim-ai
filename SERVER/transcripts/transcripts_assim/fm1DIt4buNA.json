  "transcript": "sent us an email saying that can I fast every 13th of the Islamic calendar I cannot fast 14th and 15th uh also as I'm working and it's hard for me first of all the ruling of fasting what is known as the white days these are the 13 14 and the 15th of every lunar month which is the Islamic calendar the ruling of fasting these three days is a highly recommended Sunnah Abu may Allah be pleased with him said that the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam advised me to do three things I will never leave to offer two ra of D to fast three days of every month in another narration he stated that they are the 13th 14th and the 15th and to offer Witter before I go to bed so it is a highly recommended Sunnah and the scholars say that whoever fasts 3 Days Every lunar month this would be equivalent to fasting the whole year because Allah tells us that one good deed is equivalent to 10 so three days of every month is equivalent to 30 days which means that if you do this every single month then you have fasted the whole year and Allah would reward you for that now fasting or singling one day of these three days due to difficulty whether uh to illness or fatigue or work or for any other reason this is permissible but not necessarily that you fast the 13th or the 14th or the 15th you can fast any day of the month as long as is not prohibited for you to single out so if someone fasts the second day of the month or the 29th day of the month this is all the same and and there is no preference in that inshallah"
