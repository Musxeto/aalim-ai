  "transcript": "we have jewel Ally John brother my question is about a grown up son living in the household but he does not pray what is the ruling in Islam about continuing to let this son living in the house in spite of him not observing the Salah well I think this is an issue of contemplation because a question like this you don't have a one size that fits all so it's not by default anyone who does not pray kick him out anyone who does not pray Strutt start flogging him anyone who does not pray do this or do that it all revolves around Alma swaha what is the pros and cons so some boys reprimanding them by not speaking to them for three days would do miracles some if you take their Wi-Fi and their internet connection and their mobiles would make them masha'Allah one of the four Imams of deed maybe the fifth some kids if you take their allowance or if you take their car keys it's all yours it's not all in your names so it depends from one person to the other some just simple communication we have a deficiency in the way we treat our own children and I'm talking about myself we always use commands you do this do that why didn't you do this when I'm angry the first thing I ask my children when I'm shouting at them did you pray why am I asking them about prayer if I'm reprimanding them about the homework or if Ram if I am shouting to at them because they're fighting with one another because prayer comes now as a form of punishment this is how the children feel it and think and this is mine stick so I have to look into the roots of the problem and the solution differs from people living in Pakistan where if a man reprimands his son by beating him up is totally legit and if he calls the cops they're gonna come and join the father beating him up as well and it differs from the people in the states and if you just shout at your son your neighbors would call nine-one-one and they'll take custody of your child so it differs from one situation to the other you have to be impartial you have to be objective look at the situation of your son judge it as an objective person not as a parent okay what should I do what are the consequences of my action if I take step one what will happen if I take step two step three and then you have to press the Hara and pray to Allah and make duaa to guide him and choose what is best add to this shouldna you know living in the West if if you explain your child is going to go into the non-muslim environment there is no worse it's gonna be worse maybe drugs maybe prostitution so his chance to come back is really not there Oh"
