  "transcript": "Muhammad from Bahrain Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah How are you doing Sheikh? I'm doing great Alhamdulillah. How can I help you today? Actually I have a question. I have a harm OCD and I've been trying my best to overcome it. But I wanted a few motivational words from you so that I can overcome it quickly. JazakAllah Sheikh What is it about? A harm OCD A what? Harm OCD What is harm OCD? I don't understand. Like I feel I have this OCD that I want to cause trouble and harm to other people. I want to hurt them. Okay. The Prophet Alayhis Salatu Wassalam said in an authentic hadith المسلم من سلم المسلمون من لسانه و يده A real Muslim is the one who other Muslims are safe from his harm whether verbally or via actions. Now this hadith indicates that those who harm others are not real Muslims. And this is indicated in another hadith. When the Prophet said Alayhis Salatu Wassalam do you know who is a person who is broke? They said someone who doesn't have money. He said no. A broke person is a person who comes on the day of judgment with prayers, fasting, charity, good deeds. But he cursed this one, slandered this one, back bit this one, hit this one, shed the blood of this one. So he will come on the day of judgment with loads of sins and he will compensate those with his good deeds. If his good deeds ran out before his sins are paid off, then he will take from their sins and accumulate it upon himself and then he would be thrown in hell. So no matter how hard and severe your OCD is, the moment you remember that any type of abuse whether verbal or physical that you inflict upon others, payback will be in your grave and after that it will be in hellfire. Not only that, you should always deter yourself from doing so because one day you will meet someone who is far harmful than you but he doesn't look it. So you think that you can harm this individual, he's a little bit small, he's not bulky, he's not full of muscles. Not knowing that he is the world champion in MMA and he would inflict real real harm to you. And imagine if you were to hit someone and Allah Azza wa Jal decrees that you become blind on that spot or you become paralyzed on that spot or he dies on that spot and you have to be executed to pay for your crime. How would that feel? So all of these should help you overcome your OCD. May Allah make that easy for us."
