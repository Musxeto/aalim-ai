  "transcript": "bilal's confusion about shortening the hair from one side more than the other we said so many times that shortening the hair is permissible what is not permissible is al-khazar and al-khazar as explained is to shave part of the head and leave part of it like what some wrestlers do mr t or whatever all of those kind of haircuts is prohibited in islam and we also say that what the marines do in some countries where they really almost shave the sides of the head and leaving the top as a form of showing their strength etc that this is also haram if not because it's kaza sometimes they make it number one with the machine with a trimmer not zero with with a razor but number one but the rest is much uh longer if not because it's imitating the disbelievers so what you're asking about bill ali shallah is no problem at all"
