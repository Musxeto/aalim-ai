  "title": "Name our children Angel Names   Boy or Girl",
  "transcript": "Fatima says, can we name our children with angel names such as Jibreel, etc.? Using the names of prophets and angels is permissible according to the most authentic opinion. Some scholars did not like calling or using the names of prophets and messengers. And this was refuted by the Prophet himself ï·º calling his youngest son Ibrahim. So calling or using the names of messengers and prophets is totally permissible. Sa'd ibn Abi Waqas was known as Abu Ishaq and the Prophet used to call him Aba Ishaq. As for the names of angels, the most authentic opinion is that this is permissible. Whether it's Jibreel, Jibraeel, Mikael, Mikal, or Israfeel. Providing one does not use such names with females. So it can be only used with male children because we know that the idol worshippers and the disbelievers as mentioned in the Qur'an used to describe angels to be females and the daughters of Allah and the likes. May Allah be exalted from all of this nonsense. So it is not permissible to call a female Jibreel or Israfeel or Mikael or to call her an angel like Malak or Malak. All of these are not permissible."
