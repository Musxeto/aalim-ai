  "transcript": "foreign died a few years ago he had almost 40 children and his inheritance they decided because there are so many children that they were going to keep it the way it is when Trump out to make some money to take care of the little children he left four wives as well but my question is um like three of my brothers are one of them um is having financial trouble actually three of and uh they always borrow money from the bank would read back uh he had three wives and so many children he doesn't know how to manage money uh family members have tried to help him out but things are not getting any better uh same thing with the other brother he had six children things are not really he doesn't know how to manage money because when my father was alive he used to build them out when they borrow money um and the other project who doesn't know how to manage money can I eat them sucker money because right now we have uh money that we want to use for we sold our house so we have a lot of money to do soccer this year so can I give them their money to help them out or because of the investors they're not eligible for soccer first of all in order to give zakat money we have to ensure that the recipient falls under one of the eight categories mentioned in verse 60 chapter 9 Surah to Toba the first two of these eight categories are alphokara which is the poor and the needy the poor who are flat stone broke so if they have lunch they may not have dinner if they have dinner they may not have breakfast so they really broke the poor are people who are a bitter a little bit better off they have food they have a shelter but they don't have what sustained sustains a decent level of living so they need a car to go from point A to B to commute for their work and the car is broke and they don't have money to fix it they're not poor but they need financial assistance they have food they have a house but they don't have money to pay the medical bills or the electricity bill or to take the children to school and these are Necessities but it's not like someone who's poor and is dying so they are legible for zakat so if your brother falls under these two categories and he can be classified as poor how do we know that he's poor he doesn't have enough money to carry him on to the end of the month where he receives his paycheck so he receives maybe five thousand dollars a month but he has a big family a lot of uh uh rent to pay and a lot of bills so by the 15th of the month he's flat so he's asking people for loans and to borrow not that he's squandering money left right and Center rather he is in need he deserves to begin from zakat the second issue is that you are not obliged to provide for him so if I have a son no it's my duty to provide for him I can't give him from zakat even if he's broke if I have a have a father or a mother in this case it's my obligation but in your case you're not going to inherit him he's not going to inherit you you can't give him from zakat without any problem in shalom"
