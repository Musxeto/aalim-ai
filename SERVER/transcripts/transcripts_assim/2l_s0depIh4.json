  "title": "Will everyone experience the Squeezing of the Grave? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Malad from the us says can you tell us about the squeeze of the grave yes this is authentic every soul that dies must suffer the squeeze of the grave and the difference of opinion would be our prophet and messenger included or not and the most authentic opinion is by default no they're not but everyone else including great companions such as maja damageable whom the hadith came to tell us about the squeeze that he got and then it was really relieved so this squeeze is not a punishment it is a sort of a hardship that a believer gets and then he is relieved from it"
