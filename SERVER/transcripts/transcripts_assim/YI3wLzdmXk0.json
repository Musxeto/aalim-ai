  "transcript": "[Music] what of those who have 24 hours sunlight or darkness how do they determine prayer times so [Music] asking about people in finland maybe or in the arctic or in the north pole where they have sunlight for maybe five six months and total darkness for five six months so how would they pray first of all prayer time is determined by the position of the son so if there is a distinction during the day between day and night in this case one must follow the prayer times according to the son and we went through that in saying when to determine the break of dawn how to determine the lahore how to determine the asa how to determine sunset uh a margherita and then after the twilight the red twilight it disappears this is the time of asia the second possibility was which is very rare and and by the way number one is regarding areas where there can be distinguished times between day and night so even if we go to north of england or to some of the scandinavian countries where they have daytime reaching 20 or 21 hours and night time reaching four maybe three maybe a little bit less hours a day this is still applicable they have to fast the whole day time they have to pray according to the sun the problem is as amino abdul rahman said is when we have countries that do not see the sun for so long how could they determine when it is fajird if there is no break of dawn and there is no sunset or the opposite when it's all day long the sun rotates over the 24 hours and never sets so how can they pray this is a current situation that was not known to those before us so the the scholars had to dig in the evidences in the quran the sunnah and they found the hadith in a muslim where the prophet was telling us about the jail or the antichrist and how he will come at the end of time and he will roam the whole earth and he will stay for 40 days one day of these 40 days is as long as a whole year so the sun takes a full year to rise become in the middle of the sky and to set a full year 365 days and one day is equivalent to a month and a one day is equivalent to a week so these are three days minus 40 we have 37 days so the length of the jail staying actually on earth is one year two months two weeks and what else and 37 days yeah that's it one year two months and two weeks two months and a half how did we calculate this 40 days one is a year one is a month one is a week so 37 days take the seven days that makes it a week so we have a month 30 days and we have a month these are two months and we have a week and another week these are two weeks so one year two months and a half this is how long the job would stay on earth the companions left all of this information because this is something that will happen in the future and they will stand up for him or to him and fight him if he were to come out but this doesn't concern us at the moment the companions were more concerned about salat so they asked the prophet isaiah o prophet of allah the day which is equivalent to a year do we pray the prayer of a day meaning only five prayers so the prophet said answer them by saying no you have to estimate meaning a day that requires a full year for the sun to rise and set you have to estimate it so with watches it's very easy to estimate we have ams and pms so we have to pray during the day time five during the period of 24 hours five prayers the following 24 hours five prayers so the prayer of 360 or 365 days is going to be prayed during that long day okay what does this have to do with this question of amino abdullah well the scholar said that from this hadith we understand that when day time is three months in a row without a single hour of night we as muslims have to estimate the prayer times and how is this done some scholars said that you have to apply the prayer times of mecca which is very far and it is far-fetched because there is no resemblance between makkah and these countries or these regions the second opinion which is the strongest and this is the choice of sheikh bin baz the permanent committee of ifta and a number of councils is that these countries these regions must look to the closest adjacent regions to them that have a distinction between day and night so for example in the scandinavian countries when they have daytime constantly if we go a little bit south and find find that for example birmingham or scotland of the uk are the closest countries to them that have day and night then so be it they should follow their prayer times so if they pray at let's say 11 and well actually at maybe one or two assar at five or six married at 9 30 in russia at 12 and federer at three then they should follow these timings though they cannot see the traces by following the sun either because it does not set or because it does not appear and this is the most authentic opinion and allah azza knows best"
