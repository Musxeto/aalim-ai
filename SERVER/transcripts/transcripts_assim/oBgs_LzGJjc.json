  "title": "Can I alternate between saying Rabbighfirli & Saying Allahummaghfirli warhamni wahdini warzuqni",
  "transcript": "Neela from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaikumussalam So Sheikh, I was praying my Zuhur prayer. In the first two rakah I said Rabbik Fidli between two prostrations and in the last two rakah I said Allahumma Fidli Wa Rahamnidistua. Is this okay Sheikh? This is totally, this is totally 100% fine. You can alternate no matter what time, how many times and in the same prayer as well, there's no problem in that at all."
