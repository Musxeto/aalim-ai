  "title": "Are Issues of Takfeer for laymen? (Not calling a polytheist a Kafir- Nullifiers of Islam) assim al",
  "transcript": "Sheikh my question is that I am totally depressed and lost my strength about this issue that I have read a book Nullifiers of Islam and the third nullifier that not considering polytheist makes you a Kafir so Sheikh I for example like see a Muslim so called namely Muslim on the TV and he has some idols in his house or he is married to a Hindu wife or I see someone join politician like in a Kafir country namely Muslim and I see someone like Barelvi Imam to Sheikh so Sheikh the issue of Takfeer what to do in this because if I refrain these comes to my mind like the third nullifier and if I make Takfeer the Hadith comes that if you call a Kafir brother if you call a brother Kafir either he is or it will come back to you so what to do Akhi these these ten nullifiers of Islam are they Quran or Sunnah or they are Ijtihad from scholars? Ijtihad from scholars so how would you justify taking them as sacred as Quran and making your life so miserable like it is at the moment doesn't make any sense so it's an honored scholar who spent his life studying Islam comes up with these ten nullifiers and he puts it in a book hoping that scholars and students of knowledge would know it and understand it and explain it you as a layman cannot come in pick and choose what you want it's like a professor in medicine putting an article in a medical journal stating some of the procedures how to how to cure spinal injuries or the spinal cord procedure surgeries and you read this and you want to implement it you're not qualified and this is the biggest problem that lots and lots of the youngsters are facing when they don't acquire knowledge properly so instead of walking a 20-step ladder from step 1 till step 20 they jump to step 7 and 8 they bypass these beginning steps which means that there is a huge possibility of them falling and breaking their necks you don't know Arabic you don't memorize the Quran you don't know the tafsir of the Quran if you memorize it all you don't know proper books of aqeedah you don't know the sunnah you don't know fiqh yet you come to an article or a booklet you read here and there and you totally destroy your life and confuse yourself and the funny part is that satan is well done you're doing a good job you're pleasing satan satan is happy the bad news is Allah is angry with you why Shaykh I'm trying to please Allah not by what you're doing because you're not qualified if you're pleasing Allah look at your prayer are you finding the sweetness of your prayer no Shaykh I'm not even praying on time sometimes I skip prayer because I'm so depressed and I leave prayer for three four days oh mashallah so you're getting out of the fold of Islam don't read such articles unless you're supervised by a mentor a Shaykh who would sit with you and explain each one of you of them to you takfir is not for me and you and look what shaytan is making you do oh this Bollywood actor he has over 200 movies he's married to a Hindu and he has idol in his home and he says I don't care if my children become Muslim or Hindu so I should give him takfir but I'm hesitant because he might be a Muslim brother how could I give him takfir did Allah send us to label people all around us so he's a kafir he's a hypocrite he's a munafiq he's a fasiq he's um well I don't know I'm I still have to make up my mind what is this this has nothing to do with Islam look in the mirror and be concerned of yourself takfir has conditions to be fulfilled and obstacles to be eliminated and it's not for you and me it's for the scholars for the judges for the rulers Muslim rulers to give their verdict on such an individual after interrogating them not to shoot from the hip so I hope this answers your question and removes your confusion"
