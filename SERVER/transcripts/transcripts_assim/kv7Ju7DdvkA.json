  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu The question is how can I ensure that my guarantees are accepted? You can't. Next question. Akhi, there is no guarantees. Imagine if I do something and I get an SMS, Mabrook, your Umrah is valid. Now you have credit to sin for another couple of years. Okay, let's watch the Avengers number five. It doesn't work this way. You have to balance will accept my repentance. And when I do a good deed, I'm hopeful that Allah will raise my status in Jannah and would grant me something good in this dunya. This is the balance that we have to have as mentioned in the Quran. But we don't have any guarantee that Allah has accepted what we've done or that Allah have doomed us to hellfire. We are having this imbalance between fear and hope in Allah and Allah knows best."
