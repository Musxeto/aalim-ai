  "transcript": "there is a service where people can get their groceries delivered early or sometimes even at a cheaper rate this service also gives you access to movie channels which I will not use can I get this service in order to get items delivered early so this for the purpose of not advertising this service is an app where you can buy things online and they deliver it to you whether it's groceries whether it is accessories whatever you name it they have it now they have a extra service where you pay money so like you pay them two or three maybe four dollars a month which they say that now you qualify for our Elite member which means that we can deliver you instead of five days we will deliver you the following day maybe in the same day and we will not charge you for certain products that are part of our Elite services and they also have this movie and series uh service which is of course all Haram but we're not interested in the Haram aspect we're interested in getting our groceries or our items that we buy online on time and free of charge so is this four dollars that I pay a month something permissible a great deal of Scholars say that this is not permissible why they say because this is like gambling and people say why is it gambling if I buy a lottery ticket I may lose the dollar that I bought it which is most likely or I may get a chance one in a million to hit the jackpot yeah this is gambling this is my sir this is totally prohibited but when I pay four dollars and I frequently make 6 or 10 or 20 orders a month and I get a good price fast delivery excellent handling this is a service I'm paying for so the majority of Scholars say no this is gambling there are a group of Scholars or there is a group of Scholars that say that this is a service fee which you are getting in in return a service so if the company themselves are offering and there is no burden or extra cost on you which translates in Arabic to mahram so it's not winning all or losing all as in gambling as in insurance for example losing all my premium or winning all getting way way more than what I paid for no this is a service you're paying for and you're getting in return what you have paid for they say that this is permissible and there is nothing wrong in that and I'm inclined to this opinion and Allah azzawajal knows best fine"
