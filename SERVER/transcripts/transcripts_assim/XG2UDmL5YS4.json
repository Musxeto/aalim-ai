  "transcript": "for someone who what he commits adultery okay there needs to be four Witnesses but it's wouldn't it would it not be Haram to look at someone committing adultery and so how could there be four witnesses that so does that does that mean it has to be done in public for there to be a punishment for it okay adultery can only be proved by the witness of by the testimony of four male Muslim Witnesses being present at the time of adultery and this has never been recorded in the history of Islam to my knowledge because no one is going to be quote unquote excuse my friends shagging a woman and then all of a sudden having four Witnesses watching and his doing his business as usual this is not heard of and was not never founded and probably this is why Islam conceals such a sin to prevent people from slandering so you cannot just accuse a man for being in a room with a aaham woman you cannot accuse them of committing adultery because you have to have four Witnesses seeing the actual act which is not possible so if a person was doing it in broad daylight on the street and for passer by see this they're not going to go and wait and like like take selfies they've saw it it's a a single glance of a second or two that's sufficient so there is no sin on them because this was not uh premeditated it's it happened and they saw it so there's no sin and the reason for witnessing it is to prove that such a major sin had taken place and they would testify for it so this is justifiable and Allah best"
