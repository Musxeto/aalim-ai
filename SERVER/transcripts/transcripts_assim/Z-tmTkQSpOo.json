  "transcript": "abdah from Bangladesh some Scholars say that uh a traveler shouldn't shorten his prayers if he intends to stay for more than 4 days but if he intends to stay for less than four days should he shorten his prayers follow this opinion there is no difference of opinion that if he were to stay less than 4 days he may shorten and combine there's no difference as you've stated the difference of opinion is if he intends to stay for more and the most authentic opinion is that even if he intends to say for more than 4 days as long as he's still labeled as a traveler then he can shorten and combine until he becomes a resident or settled in the new location even for a month or two as long as he feels settled then he should pray complete"
