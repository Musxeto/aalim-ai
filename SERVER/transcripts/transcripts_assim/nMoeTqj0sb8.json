  "transcript": "in today's era when we speak to other faiths each religion come comes up to us and says we have a messenger and our messenger had Miracles what do you have has your messenger ever got the Earth flooded with water the Muslims say no has your messenger ever been thrown into fire and nothing happened to him has your messenger ever had the sea split and he and his followers crossed over has your messenger ever cured the leper the deaf and gave life to the dead has he ever had a staff that could turn into a big snake eating all the staffs of the sorcerers and as Muslims we say no our messenger had not have all of these things but with all due respect can I see some of your Miracles nowadays and they say no it happened in the past so what proof do you have to show me in this time and era I want to see something with my own eyes I want to touch something that is tangible I want to see a miracle in front of my eyes so they say what do you have as Muslims and we say we have the Quran the miracle that was given to Prophet Muhammad that challenges Humanity not only that but also the Jin to reproduce one chapter like it and the challenge still exists till today Allah gave the superpowers of the whole world to produce one chapter and they cannot Allah asael sent the best of his all Angels Angel gibel peace be upon him with the best of his books the Quran to reveal it to the best of his messenger Muhammad sallallah alaih wasallam on the best night of the year the night of Al in the best piece of Earth which is Al Haram he gave this book for us to believe in to recite to contemplate to seek our healing and our cure of illnesses in it this book that each and every one of us has abrogates all previous religions dominates all laws of the humans the Quran is the ultimate message of of Allah Asel for all times for all nations until the end of time until the day of judgment the Quran is a mercy from Allah it is a source of healing Allah says and we send down from the Quran that which is a healing and a mercy to those who believe is the Quran a mercy and healing only to those who believe it is also a mercy and healing for those who do not believe do you believe that Quran can cure your illnesses mental and also physical whether you're a Muslim or a non-muslim it can cure you in the sah Abu may Allah be pleased with him he said we were in an expedition and we ran out of food so we saw a tribe of disbelievers idol worshippers so we went to them and ask them for hospitality and this is the trend of Arabs whenever you see strangers you give them food but they rejected it and did not give us any food so we were stranded we were outside the tribes homes with no food and all of a sudden one of them came to us and said our trib's leader has been stung by a snake or a scorpion and he is on his dying bed does anyone of you know how to cure such illnesses one of them stood up and said I can but we requested food and you deprived us I will not cure him unless you give us something so they agreed on a number of sheep so the man went and the tribe's leader was lying down poisoned about to die Abu may Allah be pleased with him said so the man started to recite Al and to spit on the trib's leader dry spitting so he [Music] says this is dry spitting but it's a little bit loud because of the microphones we don't have this one has cotton this doesn't so anyhow and he kept on repeating it and dry spitting five six times and the man is on his feet nothing is wrong with him so they gave him the Sheep now the companions fell in a dilemma they said we don't know can we take the sheep or not we've done something that is new so they refrained from touching it until they reached the prophet Alat wasam and they told him what they had done and the prophet sallallah alaihi Ali wasallam said and how do you know that it is R by Allah it is R give me my share which is the fifth of the bounties and distribute the rest on you this authentic Hadith proves that the fa the greatest Surah in the Quran is a and not only to the Believers but also to the disbelievers the Quran is a source of peace but we [Applause] fail to obtain this peace from it why because we have abandoned the Quran the vast majority of Muslims do not deal with the Quran as a source of healing as a source of guidance as a source of of Peace the salaf their interaction with the Quran was different than ours alt together the companions may Allah be pleased with them when Allah revealed the ayat where Allah says and whether you disclose what is in your own selves or conceal it Allah will call you to account for it the companions came to the prophet the last two ay three ay ofah Bak they came and they said oh prophet of Allah we were ordered to do Jihad no problem to fast to pray to give zakat no problem but this Ayah that states if we think of something and conceal it Allah will hold us to account we cannot control our thoughts I see a brother I want to smash his face I cannot stop myself from wanting to do this but I do not act upon it and I do not say it Allah will still hold me accountable for that I cannot control my thoughts so the prophet Alam was angered by this and he said do you want to say like the people of the book before you said we hear and we disobey say we hear and we obey so immediately their interaction with this Ayah they fell on their knees and they said oh Allah we hear and we obey so Allah asael revealed the last Ayah ofah Al Bak Allah burdens not a person Beyond his scope he gets rewarded for that good which he has earned and he is punished for that evil which he has earned so whatever goes in your mind Allah forgives it the fantasies you think of Allah forgives it as long as you do not act upon them and as long as you do not speak to anyone about them the interaction of the companions with the Quran was not like ours we compete with one another especially in Ramadan after three or four days we start calling our friends relatives and loved ones huh how many ju have you finished you finished 10 alhamdulillah I finished 15 you finished 15 I finished the whole Quran I'm better than you you're better than me this is what we look for in Ramadan competing with one another in quantity not in quality and this is why if you look at your lifestyle you'll find that it goes completely against the Quran I mas may Allah be pleased with him says whenever you hear in the Quran oh you who believe then give it your ear listen to it attentively because it is something good that Allah is ordering you to do or something evil that Allah is telling you to stay away from the companions used to read the Quran with love with compassion with belief and submission they used to read the Quran because they knew it is from Allah Allah spoke the Quran it is Allah's speech it is Allah's attribute so they loved it see sometimes we would like to spend a lot of time with our loved ones and when it is time to leave we get heartburn we get stomach staches because I'm going to depart and to leave the one I love but when we read the Quran do we have the same feeling the vast majority of the Muslims when they open the Quran they start to yawn and want to go to bed who who gets this feeling when he reads the Quran raise your hands Liars okay now okay now now yeah I know I get so many questions about this issue why because we don't have the proper connection to the Quran so how did the companions have the connection with the Quran there was a companion by the name of Abdullah so both of them were great companions Abdullah was newly wed to a proper woman for from qur two weeks or so after the wedding went to his daughter-in-law to check on his son so he says my daughter how is my son with you and that woman being a noble woman like most of our women haha she did not nag she did not complain she did not he did not buy me a new car he doesn't take me places he doesn't call he doesn't send me roses no she did not do that because she was a proper muslima she said to her father-in-law Abdullah is the best of men he fasts all day and he prays tud all night now to you and I I would say masallah he's a righteous man but one of the smartest Arabs ever he understood the embedded message and what was the message the guy does not have any interest in women if he fasts all day long and he prays all night long he doesn't have any time for any Hanky Panky so he took the message immediately went to the prophet Alat wasam and complained oh prophet of Allah my son Abdullah does this and that and this is Haram the way he treats his wife so the prophet said summon him bring him so Abdullah came and the prophet said Abdullah how often do you fast and how much Quran do you read per night and listen to the answer of this young man he says oh prophet of Allah I fast every single day of the year I fast and I break in the M tomorrow I'm fasting the day after I'm fasting the whole year I'm fasting I never break my fast any day not even to go to the gym no the brothers and sisters why don't you fast Mondays and Thursdays oh I have work so you know I have to drink coffee and I have to drink tea if I don't then I'm I'm unable to work Subhan Allah people used to go to Jihad fasting so the Prophet said regarding fasting don't do that fast only three days every month he says I can fast more he says fast 10 days of every month he says I can do more he says fast every alternate Day meaning 15 days a month he says I can't do more he said no there is nothing more this is the best type of fasting the fasting of who th would peace be upon him what about Quran and this is is our punchline he said I recite the Quran once every night he finishes the Quran from cover to cover every night in night prayer yeah he he spends like seven hours reciting the Quran every single night when afan may Allah be pleased with him the third calf just before he was assassinated his wife said to those who came to assassinate him he was about 83 years of age an old man he she said to him whether you kill him or not it doesn't matter he used to finish the Quran in one ra every night in an authentic narration he went for Hajj and you know how tired people are in Hajj and he went to mecah in the nights of min to pray and after praying he stood behind the Mak and said and the man watching and narrating he said I just wanted to see when he will finish Salat he prayed one ra just until before fer and he finished the whole Quran in it one RIT this is how the companion used to relate the prophet said to Abdullah read it once the Quran in a month a lot of us misread this Hadith and they said yes the prophet said read it once every year you ask people when was the last time you finished the Quran he said uh I think four years ago why he said every year I try to finish it in Ramadan I finish only like 20 pages but then I get you know occupied in work and going shopping forid and and I forgot you you go to people's houses you see a copy of the Quran in a nice place you open it you see flies coming out of it you said lots of dust coming what is this and mashaallah you enter people's cars you find in the glove compartments a copy of the Quran what is this for protection in their flight kit Pilots what is this for protection people are using Quran as a protection it's cheaper than insurance policy is this what the Quran was revealed to the prophet said to Abdullah once a month he said I can do more he said once every 20 days he said I can do more he said once every 10 days he said I can do more he said once every week and you will not understand it more than that in another narration once every 3 days then the Prophet said to himat stating the importance of balance in our lives this Hadith from the prophet inkari and Muslim is the golden rule that each and everyone should Implement in his life to summarize it it is balance if you manage to balance your life you're the happiest man on Earth your lord Allah has rights over you don't skip Salat don't delay paying zakat don't be neglectful of remembering Allah because Allah has rights over you you have to continuously fulfill Allah's rights so you have to worship Allah properly and your guest has rights over you which means that the social affairs with your relatives with your cousins with your friends with your visitors you have to balance your time not spend it all with them but at the same same time not neglect them your wife your family has rights over you so you have to give quality time to your wife when was the last time you sent an SMS to your wife two hours ago telling her to to make the food ready not that when was the last time you sent I love you um last week but then she said why are you getting married be serious come on you have to have the love between you and your wife quality time take her for dinner buy her roses do something as other things you have to have the balance and your body has rights over you I see Brothers mashallah with big bellies what is this well this is food my wife is a good cook mashallah and what's the biggest problem is she I don't know how my toes look I keep on looking I can't see them I don't recognize them this is a problem a Muslim is a strong person fit why do Muslims have imbalances either you find a brother working 18 hours a day just to make ends meet or he is 24 hours in the Masjid with long beads of t saying Subhan Allah Subhan Allah it doesn't work he's waiting for people to give him sodak or he is mashallah uh uh Mr Olympia he's in the gym eight hours a day he is working out he is a marathon runner but he neglects his duties his jum his prayers his family his guests or he's on the social media being social and he neglects you have to have the balance Quran gives you this balance so even if you occupy yourself and time with the Quran the prophet saysat no can do you have to balance it so that you live a balanced life the companions loved the Quran and their love was astonishing in one of the battles the prop Prophet Alat wasam had to spend the night on his way to Medina so they camped and as usual the prophet appointed two of his companions to watch over the Army because everybody is asleep so they were two of the companions Abad Bish and Amar may Allah be pleased with them all soash said I'll take take the first shift and you sleep and in the middle of the night I'll go to sleep and you wake up agreed agreed so everybody was asleep it was dark it was night and they did not have what's up to occupy their times with so what did Abad dobar he started to pray now he's guarding the Army but at the same time praying and he started started to recite one of the suras that he loves not knowing that there was a spy of the disbelievers looking and anticipating the right moment when everybody was asleep and he saw this guard he said okay if I kill this guard I can attack the Army and maybe assassinate the prophet Alat wasam so he took an arrow like Robin Hood bang hit Abad in the stomach Abad did not move that guy look at his arrows look at his night vision goggles everything is fine he took another arrow and he shot it he took a third arrow and he shot it all in Abad while he was praying Abad then felt that he might be compromised so he continued and completed his quickly and woke Amar when Amar saw the these three arrows in Abad and he was bleeding he said Subhan Allah why didn't you wake me up from the first Arrow you got hit with he said by Allah I was reciting a beautiful Surah had I not feared I would die wall I would have continued it even if my spirit and soul departed my life but I was afraid if I die the whole Army would be affected by it a Surah does this to you what kind of love to the Quran they had I remember few months ago few years ago like the his recitation masallah fills the heart with peace I was in my Masjid in fer time next to my home and the Imam was reciting beautifully you know F 4:00 everything is quiet the the weather is nice the air condition is beautiful everybody was mallah and we're listening to the Quran not doing this this is for the Jews we don't do this some brothers do this when they recite Quran some do this no this is wrong you recite the Quran it's in your heart so we were reciting and You Don't Close Your Eyes I'm closing the eyes because of the the the lights don't get technical so we were listening to the Quran and all of a sudden people started jumping in the Masid a small kitten came in and started touching their legs in between so you know so and people were jumping hitting the ceiling hitting the chandeliers people running and fleeing because of a kitten Abad Bish is hit three arrows and he doesn't move because of his love to the Quran do we love the Quran like this we have issues so the companions used to recite the Quran with love to learn from it the companions used to say we learn only 10 ayat 10 verses we memorize them we understand them we Implement them in our lives then we move on to the other or to the following 10 verses of the Quran IB Omar may Allah be pleased with him memorized and learned memorizing it you can do it in a couple of weeks but he memorized and implemented and learned Surah Al Bak in 4 years and Hua may Allah be pleased with him tells us that he once made the mistake of praying next to the prophet Alam night prayer it wasn't a mistake but in our standards today it was a big mistake so the prophet Alam started praying night prayer he started praying with so he said okay 100 ay and he will make and the prophet continued and finished it in the first ra they said now he makes the prophet started witha and he continued until he finished it then he started with Surah Al Iman and he completed it until he finished it almost five one says you made a mistake it is no no no no this is not the way the prophet recited alak then then and from this we learn that you if you switch the order of the suras it's okay the prophet did it so H said W I almost did something sinful what was that he said I almost sat down I was too tired one ra and the prophet s wasallam did not recite like we recite he says he does not he did not recite an Ayah of Mercy except he would say and say oh Allah have mercy on me and he did not come to an Ayah of punishment except he would seek refuge in Allah from Allah's punishment and peace comes only from the Quran for those who read it for that purpose what do you mean we have problems we have people stabbing us from the back we have anxiety issues we have Ang anger and rage issues where and how can we find peace in the Quran you can find all the answers for your problems in the Quran whether it the these are financial problems whether they are social problems whether they are physical issues you will find your answer in the Quran if you read it seeking peace in it how I'll give you an example do you know is the issue when mother AA may Allah be pleased with her was accused of committing adultery the Hypocrites slandered mother Aisha now among those who slandered mother AA were three Companions of the Prophet Alat wasam and the the rest were Hypocrites who were very careful not to be vocal very careful not to allow people to be witnessing against them so they used to speak Ambiguously three Companions of the Prophet Alat wasam and great companions fell in the Trap of shaan and did this mistake who were they Malik the poet of the Prophet Alat and excuse me excuse me let me rephrase that hbit the poet of the Prophet Alat H the cousin and the sister-in-law of the prophet and thirdly who is the cousin of Abu Bakr now was the cousin of Abu Bakr and he was among the people of ass he had nothing he used to sleep and live in the Masjid because he had nothing Abu Bakr being who he was he used to give him weekly allowance he's my cousin I'm rich he's among the first who migrated from meca to Medina so I give him allowance when M slandered mother AA Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him swore by Allah that I will not give him a penny from now on do you blame him he's my cousin and he's slandering my own daughter who is the wife of the Prophet do you blame me for not giving him allowance no so imagine the mental state Abu Bakr was in the agony that he went through for a whole month when his own blood and flesh a the Beloved wife of the Prophet wasam was slandered by my own cousin and then Allah revealed verses of the Quran the prophet came to Abu Bakr and said Abu Bakr didn't you hear what Allah revealed in your Affair Allah says and let not those among you who are blessed with Graces and wealth let them not swear not to give any sort of help to their Kinsmen the poor and those who left their homes for Allah's cause let them pardon and forgive do you not love Allah should forgive you so the prophet read this to Abu Bakr and when Abu Bakr heard this question don't you want Allah to forgive you he says by Allah I want Allah to Pardon Me and to forgive me oh prophet of Allah be my witness that I will continue to provide for M my cousin until I die this is the Quran heals our problems and illnesses that dwells in our chests we all have problems do we turn to the Quran for a solution or to go or do we go to a shrink or do we go to a fortune teller or do we go to someone to write us or as they call it here comes what defines us as real Muslims now a proper Muslim has a portion of the Quran he does not play with every single night he has to complete this portion the average Muslim recites one ju every month no every week no every night yes so that in every month he would finish the Quran so in 11 months of the year he finishes the Quran 11 times in Ramadan he puts the fifth gear and he exceeds the speed limit no Radars alhamdulillah and he recites it six seven maybe eight times in Ramadan now if you have this connection with the Quran I guarantee you in two to three months you would almost be able to memorize the Quran when you hear an Ayah you relate to it because you've read it so many times that it is becoming natural so many times you hear it in the radio you feel that you can complete it because you have a connection with the Quran your status in Paradise depends on how often you use to read the Quran recite and Elevate because the last level you will reach is the last Ayah you used to read as in the Hadith The Best of You The Prophet says is the one who learns the Quran and teaches it so how do we deal with the Quran in our contemporary times unfortunately the vast Ma majority of Muslims they have abandoned the Quran I remember few years ago I was talking to an atheist who was a local who was a friend of my brothers so he's an elderly man he's in his 60s and every time he meets me something in me is like a magnet to cause trouble I'm not a troublemaker I'm a peaceful man I I try to be so every time he meets me he starts to debate about Islam about Shar why is this why is that and I try to explain to him I try to my best to be diplomatic to show him the beauty of Islam once he was so agitated and angry he said yeah a you guys meaning us the the guys with the beard the religious police this is what they how they look at us so he said you you always hold people accountable to the to what's in their hearts only Allah knows what is in my heart Allah says in the [Music] Quran and I said to him wow which Surah is this he said I don't know I don't memorize the Quran but Allah says verily Deeds are judged by intention and I said to him this is not an Ayah this is a Hadith he said W oh I always thought that was an Ayah I said Subhan Allah you come and debate with me about women's hijab about the the the legislative system of Islam about this and that and you don't even know how to differentiate between an a andth this is the problem with the vast majority of Muslims they have abandoned the Quran I can ask any individual to come up and I give him the Quran and read one page of it how many mistakes would they make in one page read reading reading not memorizing not reading by heart just read it it's in it's written they'll make gazillion mistakes and I'm not talking about the non-arabs I'm talking about the locals I'm talking about the Arabs if you ask him to recite to you aat he will make mistakes why because we do not have a connection with the Quran but if you tell him to sing a song I Will Do that with honor I know all the songs I know all the movies I know all the poems you want me to recite the Quran Kam Kam now the Allah says in the Quran and the messenger has said oh my Lord indeed my people have taken this Quran as a thing abandoned the prophet is complaining that his people sallallahu alaihi wasallam have aband abon the Quran have we abandoned the Quran there are five types of abandoning the Quran and they just show showed me that there was five minutes left usually they show 15 then they show 10 no five minutes where is the balance where ya what piece are we getting from this nothing anyhow no problem allahim allahim so what types of abandoning the Quran number one to abandon listening to it this is the worst type there are people once you play the Quran it turn it off Subhan Allah why do you have Jin in you what is it what's preventing you say no no no I don't want to listen to Quran turn it off turn it off there are people who have hatred to even listening to the Quran so this is number one they never listen to the Quran I know people who listen to the Quran 24/7 but even this is wrong you get people speaking in a restaurant and the Quran is playing who's listening to it nobody so why are you playing it maybe somebody would listen Subhan Allah this is wrong if you want to listen to it play it if no one is listening and you're talking or you're occupying in some work without paying attention to it turn it off the second type of abandoning the Quran are those who listen to it but they do not implement it in their lives so what's Halal in it they do not do what's Haram in it they fall into it so what they do they do they use Quran for Baraka so they play the Quran sometimes times you call offices and companies and the operator puts you on hold and then the Quran is being played and when someone picks the phone the Ayah is interrupted this was not meant to be Quran was not meant to be a form of a ringing tone some people in the in their mobiles you are in the praying in the Masjid and you hear a sudes mashallah and other one is why in let the step aside and we have M this is not permissible to have your ringtone as the Quran it is prohibited because you're insulting the Quran by doing so the third type of abandoning the Quran those who listen to it those who know what is halal and what is Haram but they refuse to make the Quran a a source of of legislation so they do not go to the Quran as an arbitrator to to to solve their problems and to judge their issues their disputes so you tell okay and and this happens a lot a sister comes and says to me I want to seek divorce from my husband so what are my rights financially I tell her your rights are you get the na until your is over which is three monthly cycles and then you're on your own she said this is not enough why she says I live in Europe and in Europe whenever I'm divorced I'm entitled to have half of his property o you want to have half of his wealth she says yes but the Quran says otherwise he said I respect the Quran but I respect my Financial rights as well I'm gonna take half of what he owns so many people when it comes to Baraka they seek it from the Quran they put it in and they put it in their wallets some of them put ayat and wear it in their necks some of them hang the verses of the Quran in the masjids in their homes as a decoration and this is all Haram of Haram maybe it's inappropriate no no it's Haram Allah did not reveal the Quran to be hung as decoration and Allah revealed the Quran to judge any dispute that happens between you and others and if you refuse and turn to man-made laws you are a full-fledged hypocrite because you give your back to the Quran and the fourth type of abandoning the Quran is those who re listen to it it they implement it they legislate it in their law and Shar but they do not contemplate on it time out who cares I'm going to continue until they turn off the microphone and turn off the lights what are they going to do try to pull me off peace have peace Quran is peace let's be peaceful so the fourth type is that you actually contemplate we read the aat quickly but we have to wait and contemplate at every and each Ayah when Allah talks about the those who play in weighing the scales and he says these a if you recite them with your heart you will become terrified don't they think those who sin those who play with the scales those who play with the scales I don't know what's wrong with this mic when they play with their scales so you buy from them a kilo he gives you 990 and when he buys from you a kilo he adds a kilo and 10 gram more Allah says those who do such a thing don't they believe that will be they will be resurrected to a day of greatness a day when they shall stand in front of Allah the Lord of all if you read these ayas with your heart you will not sin you will not cheat you will not deceive anyone and fifthly and finally abandoning the Quran by not seeking healing from it as you've heard in Quran is a form of healing whenever you have illnesses you recite the r Quran and you blow in your hands and you wipe the area that is affected and you will be cured with a say and with the uh Grace of Allah asael also your depression your rage attacks your an anxiety attacks your OCD all of this is cured through the Quran if you have belief in it and this would not make you among those who have abandoned it Quran is a source of peace but it is far greater than that if we only succeed in reading it implementing it in our lives and holding to it as Allah wants may Allah makes make me and you among those who memorize the Quran by heart and make me and you among those who implement it in their lives and make me and you among those who learn it and teach it to other m"
