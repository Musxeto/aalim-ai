  "title": "Should we not do raful yadain based on the hadith of Ibn Masood? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "said should i not demonstrate the prayer of the messenger of allah sallallahu for you thereafter he performed the prayer and did not raise his hands except in the initial techbeer reported by tirmili is this authentic should we not do rafale please clarify whether this is authentic or not this is beside the point let's assume it's authentic so should we raise our hands in takbir when going to rukur and sami allah muhammad when we rise from raku or not a lot of the scholars well actually the vast majority of scholars say that this is a confirmed sunnah and some of the scholars said that there are more than 30 companions of the prophet hassan who described him raising his hands and the most famous one of of course is abdullah may allah be pleased with him so raising the hands is not an issue to make it something of seriousness when going to raku and rising from record because there are s overwhelming amount of companions who reported it so what do we do with the hadith with mr root if you must hold me all of the pleaser with him is a person a single person single companion and beside that there is a law or rule in the fundamentals of where they say that the one who affirms something is given precedent over the one who denies something so if we have two witnesses and one of them says i didn't see the accused kill anyone i didn't see him and the other witness says i saw the accused kill so and so who is the victim what would the judge say one says i didn't see not seeing does not mean it didn't happen you simply didn't see it maybe you were absent-minded maybe you were asleep you were not present but the person who saw it is affirming a fact and this is what should be followed so if even may allah be pleased with him said i saw the prophet raise his hands as son before rukur and after rising from rukur while ibn masroot says i will explain to you how the prophet prayed and he only raised his hand in the initial tech beer that doesn't mean that the prophet did not raise his hands in raku on rising from raku it means that either wilma did not see him or even mr odd did not think that this was an important thing in salat so he was describing only the pillars and not the voluntary acts or the recommended acts either way we have more than 30 companions reporting it so we do it we have the vast majority of schools of thought approving it and saying that it's a sunnah so we do it and allah knows best you"
