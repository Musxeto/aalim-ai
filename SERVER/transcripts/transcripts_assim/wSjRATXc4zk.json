  "transcript": "may Allah reward you enormously and you as well uh shik my relatives are going to marry their daughter to my college mate while uh I was in college they're inquiring about him he was alcoholic during his college days but now I don't know about him am I obliged to tell about him that he was alcoholic during college days or leave it am I obled to tell that basically speaking if a person used to commit sins and these sins were between him and Allah he did not commit them in public and he was most likely remorseful scared of them but he's human being he was weak and he fell into these sins while trying to conceal them it is not permissible for you to disclose them at all so if you know till date that he still drinks you're obliged to tell your your relatives that this person is not good for your daughter they said why he say you say to them because he does a number of sins that I'm not at Liberty to disclose to you and if he were to propose to my sister I would not accept her if they insist tell them this is what I have you like it alhamdulillah you don't like it Go and ask someone else I warned you but if you don't know whether he had stopped or not and it's been like 10 years since College days people change in 10 years so the least you could do is say I don't know anything of him he was a good person he was like any other chap of us in the uni we used to do a lot of sins nowadays I cannot tell so you have to ask someone who has fresh information about him and Allah Knows Best"
