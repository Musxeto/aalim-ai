  "title": "Must a person expiate every time he breaks an oath (same oath) #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is if somebody makes an oath to Allah that he will pray two raas every time he does a sin but now the rakas are too much because he did the sin too much does he have to exp every time he does that sin or is one expiation of no it is only one experation for the oath that he took upon himself or The Vow that he put upon himself to break that vow or oath forever and he has to repent and ask Allah for forgiveness because he he initially has to abandon this sin without prayers or sodak or any compensation from his side doing so or failing actually to do so is sinful by itself to add insult to injury and to break an oath over that that is also sinful but yes he only does this once and he's not uh bound to his uh more and Allah Knows Best"
