  "transcript": "sh I wanted to ask regarding moving to a non-muslim country I've moved to a non-muslim country for studies and wanting to stay there after graduation because of uh following but not limited to factors uh there is significant amount of uh premixing in my family and friends and Gathering that I can't deny to when I'm with them uh former friends circle is not practicing and uh enjoys premixing I know I felt increase in Iman when I'm in this non-muslim country uh I just wanted to have advice from you uh if it's a good way to do it or should I move back because I don't want to uh tarnish my relationship with my family I can tarnish my relationship with the friends but it's family that I'm worried about thank you every one of us is being tested on this Earth and no one lives a life without trials and tribulations and tests from Allah no one so your test is in standing firm abiding by Shar laws and trying your level best to give dawa to your family and to your friends running away is not a solution and definitely living in a non-muslim country is not a solution even if you feel temporarily that your Iman is increasing nevertheless according to Shar you're sinful because the prophet wasam ordered the Muslims not to live among the disbelievers so if you go there to study this is a legitimate reason if you stay behind for a specific period of time to work and gain more experience or to make money this is again a legitimate reason but to settle there and to acquire their citizenship this is not permissible for a Muslim who lives in a Muslim country so you have to do your level best to finish and to get whatever experience you need and collect money and save money as much as you uh require and go back to your country where you can get married and settle down if you face problems with free mixing with the relatives you have to draw the line you cannot force them to drag you to do sin or to compromise your religion imagine what would have what would the prophet had done done what would the prophet have done when faced with such situation because this is exactly what happened he called his tribe his family his loved ones his relatives to Islam and they shunned him and they rejected his dawa he did not concave upon himself and retreated rather he confronted them and he kept doing dawa for 13 years despite the harassment the physical and mental abuse the torturing of his companions until Allah allowed him to migrate to Medina and we know the story how the story goes from there so you have to put yourself in his shoes and go back and give dawa and be patient and tolerant but hold your grounds and stand firm on your beliefs Bad Company bad friends you can ditch them you don't need them you can make new practicing righteous friends make them hang out with you uh be surrounded by them 24 hours 7 days a week and then inshallah things would go to the best"
