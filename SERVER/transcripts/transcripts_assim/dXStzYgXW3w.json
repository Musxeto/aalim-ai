  "transcript": "the prophet is highlighting a very important issue that we tend to neglect and that is the power of Dua we always put Dua at the bottom of the list of our priorities so if my child is sick what do I do take him to the doctor buy medication try to measure his temperature every 5 to 10 minutes do all the necessary means to get him cured and healed and at the end of the day I may try for I may try for Dua maybe it works but when at the end of the list the prophet was never like that first things comes first the first thing on theist is what Dua and if you want to know whether you're close to Allah or far away from Allah look at how you deal with Allah if you're constantly making Dua I have an appointment at 10:00 and the traffic jam in koala lumur is horrific it's really bad and I'm going to be late for my Dua what do I do I call the brother I try to check the different routes I do this no no the first thing I Do Ya Allah Ya Allah make it easy Ya Allah make the road open for me I have Dua when I'm in debt I make Dua when I am going to meet families and relatives and give them da before I go I make Dua that Allah expand their hearts and that they accept my Dua before I go to a sports match I pray to Allah that he breaks his leg my opponent so that I can beat him easily and then he becomes sick I visit him and I give him da and I give him so I get two birds with one stone yeah you get my point so Dua is essential in our lives but we are so far away from Islam yes I have a long beard and I am wearing Maxi th it's above the ankles and I have a big miswak in my pocket but is this Islam the way of the Prophet is Islam"
