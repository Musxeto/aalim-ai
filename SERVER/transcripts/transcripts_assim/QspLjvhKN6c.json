  "title": "How long is a day in the sight of Allah: 1000 or 50,000 (Day of Judgement) Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "bangladesh he says i have a confusion where there is mentioned in the quran in three locations once in suratul allah describes that the length of the day of judgment the day of judgment is 50 000 years and in two other places in the quran allah says that a day at the side of allah is equivalent to a thousand years of what we know so he says i know there's no confusion and no contradiction in the quran so what to do with these two days first of all there is never a contradiction in the quran and the authentic sunnah this is not possible because all is from allah azzawajal and if it were from any other than allah you would have found contradictions and a lot of it so this point you have to get it out of the way there is no possible contradiction in the quran or between the quran and the authentic sunnah so where does the contradiction come it comes from your own whims and desires from your own intellect from your own visual deception or understanding when you see a pen in a glass of water and you look at it and you see it as if it's broken and it's not so it's your eyes fooling you it's your ears fooling you it's your understanding fooling you secondly you have to understand that your belief in quran compels you to take it and understand it and believe in it unconditionally and this is what the companions did may allah be pleased with them a man came to even he is the cousin of the prophet okay what else he's the one whom the prophet prayed for and say oh allah teach him the understanding of the quran grant him in the religion and grant him understanding and the interpretation of the quran so he was by far one of the greatest scholars of the companions a man came to him and asked him allah mentioned that a day is equivalent to a thousand at the side of allah from among the the years you count a day is equivalent to a thousand years one day is equivalent to a thousand years so ibn abbas asked the man what about the verse where allah says that a day is equivalent to 50 000. now the guy came to ask about the one day equals one thousand even abbas brought up another area where a day is equivalent to fifty thousand so the man said hey i'm asking you that's why i'm here ibn abbas himself said these are two days that allah mentioned in his quran and allah knows about them he was so afraid of talking about the quran without knowledge and he is who he is the cousin of the prophet and one of the greatest scholars of all the companions which shows you that when it comes to the quran one has to refrain from casting doubts or talking without knowledge but if you go to the books of tafsir you will find that a lot of scholars talked about this and they said you understand the quran from the hadith and the hadith explains to us that the 50 000 years is referring to the day of judgment so the length of the day of judgment is as 50 000 years of our counting though at the side of allah it's a single day everything is done and finished but if we as humans were to count it in our times it would have taken 50 000 years to end and the rest of the two verses talking about one day is equivalent to a thousand which is a day where allah azzawajal takes care of the affairs of the universe where the allah's commands descend from the heavens to the earth and then goes back again and we were told in a hadith that the distance between the heavens and the earth is a journey of a 500 years in our calculations so 500 years going down 500 years going up this is a thousand but at the side of allah it's a day it's just nothing it is so fast and quick it is just a period of time so the days at the side of allah azzawajal to us differ from the day of judgment 50 000 years to the other days which are business as usual and this is equivalent to a thousand years and allah knows best it's happened"
