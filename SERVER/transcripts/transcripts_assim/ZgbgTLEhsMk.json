  "title": "Ruling against 'Hunting Animals For Fun' in Islam.",
  "transcript": "Ahmed Ahmed had sent us two questions the first one he says regarding killing animals for sport for example some people hunt lions etc for pure pleasure or some people will hunt fish without eating it is this killing Haram and is it a minor or a major sin first of all Islam is the Deen of compassion and mercy and in Islam if you look at the general teachings and rulings of it you find that it does not allow Muslims to kill without a legitimate reason even if it were for animals let alone for humans of course the Prophet tells us Allah Allah's was salaam that a woman was admitted into hell because she kept a kitten kept a cat and locked it up so that it would not eat from the insects of the earth nor she fed it so she let the kitten until it died out of starvation the Prophet said ilysm Allah admitted this woman to help because of such and an action also the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam cursed those who take a living creature as a target for a shooting practice so the Prophet cursed those who do this and this is a major sin but scholars agree and this is the consensus that whenever the killing is justifiable so if you want to kill in order to eat from such an animal you want to fish to eat such a fish this is all permissible this is all Hallett now the difference of opinion arises if the killing is just the fun of it not to protect yourself from harm's way or from an aggressor animal just for the fun of it and they have different opinions some say that it is not recommended and some say it is prohibited and this is the most authentic opinion of all scholars and this is the choice of al half of the bill Hodja may Allah have mercy on his soul where he said that this is totally prohibited such waste such pleasure out of inflicting pain and agony to animals for no legitimate reason this defies the general rulings and teachings of Islam and also it makes a person who does this fall under the curse of allah azzawajal i'm at second question"
