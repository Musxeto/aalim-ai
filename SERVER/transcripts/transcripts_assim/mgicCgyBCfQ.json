  "title": "Does spending in charity multiply rewards on Laylatul Qadr? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "fatima says is this true about laylatul we can't multiply its true value is only known by allah we just have to believe it's better than 1000 months the blessings and virtues of the night and work hard to gain the reward like the reward of fasting the month of ramadan is only known by allah the answer is yes the issue of multiplication is not found in the sunnah or in the quran allah mentioned in the quran that it is a night better than a thousand months he did not say multiplied or more than a thousand months it's better so what's being circulated that you should give money on that night or some of them reserve a number of dollars or reals or dirhams so every night he gives that to the poor hoping to be multiplied by 83 years all of this is not from the sunnah and it's not authentic"
