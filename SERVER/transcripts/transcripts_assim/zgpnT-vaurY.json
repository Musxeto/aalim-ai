  "title": "Is it authentic to pray 2 Rakat After the Sunnah of Maghrib & 4 Rakat before the Fard of Isha",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from India my question \nis that we know that we have uh the   Rawatib Sunnah prayers which are 12 \nand we also know that there are like   two non-rawatib after the rawatib of dhur \nand 4 non-rawaatib before the fard of Asr like are these prayers authentic and should we \npray them there are different opinions of Scholars   in regards of the four raqqa before Asia there are \nhadiths about the companions making it as if you   have offered night prayer through which through uh \nfor example but none of these hadiths are strong   enough to be attributed to the prophet Allah so \nit's an issue of disputes some would say yeah this   is okay some would say nope as long as something \nas big and important as this is not highly   authentic and not attributed to the prophet -Peace \nand Blessing upon him- I'd rather refrain from it   so it's an issue of dispute if someone decides \nto do it based on the many uh hadiths attributed   to the companions whether authentic or half \nauthentic or weak this is their call no problem   let them do whatever they want it's a voluntary \nact of worship and if people are inclined to not   do it as I myself am then we should not have an \nissue of dispute and fight one another over it now   praying to rakas after marriage you said this is \na confirmed Sunnah because it's one of the rawatip   12 rakas maybe between Maghrib Azan and Karma also \nthis is a confirmed Sunnah for all prayers as the   prophet said between every two Advance meaning \nthere are two rakaas there are two rakaas there   turakas from for whomever wishes so this is part \nof the uh Sunnah but it is it part of the 12 no   so if one does it there's no \nproblem in that insha Allah as well"
