  "transcript": "and welcome to this 12th episode of the islamic faith and today we begin chapter number five and this chapter deals about what iman is and how we believe in it what is our conviction about iman and this terminology is known when translated as faith and it is the opposite of disbelief so when you have eman on the opposite you have usually kuffer and we spoke we've spoken about the types of coffer in the last four lessons so we don't need to repeat that again inshaallah however the author says taken together words action and belief constitute faith so this is the definition of faith according to ahlu sunnati with jamaa it is the conviction of the heart sometimes they translate it into the mind but the islamic terminology is the heart and i'm not going to go into the issue of what is the center of decision-making is it the heart or is it the brain or is it the brain following whatever the hearts dictates as the place that controls everything all what we find in the quran is talking about the hearts and not the brain not the mind so it refers to the conscience it refers to the actual heart that beats and it it has certain powers that allah has placed in it that is beyond our comprehension and this is why emphasized that this is immorsal that this is a flesh the prophet says islam there is immorsal in a man's body once it is good the whole body is good one is what is corrupted the whole body is corrupted this is the heart so this is not our topic our topic is the definition of iman so the definition of iman is the conviction of the heart the words that we say and the actions that we actually do with our limbs and body this is taken together words action and belief constitute faith and the author gives an example unlike the other examples that we know of three in one no we are talking about the islamic concept these three three are so related the conviction the words the actions you do that if one of them is not present entirely it nullifies iman exactly as this sheikh gave an example with maghrib prayer he says prayer consists of three rakah and if one is not included the prayer is not by the same token if any of the three elements words actions and belief is lacking the condition is not called faith so this is where a lot of the different sects emerged because of their misunderstanding of this concept and we will get to this later on inshallah by or when we at least have a good clear idea about the concept of iman the sheikh goes on to to say the truth of these three constituents words action and belief which when one is missing faith is missing this is a unique aspect of the religion advocated by the prophet so you won't find this concept anywhere in other religions because they have not gone that deep into what religion is and all previous and coming religions talk superficially not to the core so what is meant by belief is not merely to love what is good for all people and to be free of hatred this is something that most people would prefer even though they may not believe in the creator so this is something that we have to make clear lots of the people think that when we talk about islam iman that these are good general genetic things and this what causes them to sometimes complain john is a good person tom is an excellent uh neighbor they are full of good things they do a lot of good things for us they're kind they're generous etc why would they go to hell if they don't simply believe in islam simply because this is what islam is about it's not what people like or prefer it is according to what allah azzawajal has ordained prescribed and commanded us to do and what is meant by belief iman it's not merely to love what is good for all people and to breathe and to be free from hatred this is something that most people would prefer even though they may not believe in the creator of allah azza there are common beliefs and common good that all humans share whether muslims or non-muslims so everybody regardless of their faith and religion acknowledge that truth honesty bravery generosity kindness are things to be shared by all humans these are beautiful attribution characteristics that we all must have regardless of your school of thought of your religion of your sect of your cult of your ethnicity it has nothing to do with that this is the common good that we all share but when we come specifically to iman to believe in this case this is something that is more specific more defined what is meant by belief in this context is what the mind says and does that's what all humans share what the mind here we are referring to is not the human mind the rule that the true and real belief is what the heart is told by allah azzawajal by muhammad ali our prophet and by the sharia to have the conviction of so what the mind the heart should say is that it believes there is no deity other than allah and that muhammad alaihis is allah's messenger and that what the prophet muhammad ali told us from his lord is the truth this is what the conviction should be this is what our hearts should say and when you come to the actions of the heart because the hearts where the conviction is have a saying and also have an action the body has actions the tongue has sayings so when it comes to the saying of the heart then it has to be stating that there is no deity where they are being worshipped other than allah and that the prophet muhammad ali is his messenger and all what we were told by the prophet is absolutely true this is what your heart conviction should be based on and this is what your heart should say all the time now having said that there are actions of the heart so what are the actions of the heart uh okay here we go the mind's action meaning the heart's action is the love of god the love of allah the love of the prophet i saw salaam the love of islam it also includes loving what allah and his messenger allah and to be sincere in one's worship of allah so a lot of the people don't know this and this is where a lot of confusion arises the heart itself has its own fields of belief and conviction and it has things to say and things to do so it's not all prayer and fasting this is done by the body you have tawakkul dependence on allah fear of allah hope in allah refuge in seeking refuge in allah azza all of these are actions of the heart and you have the heart filled with the belief in allah azzawajal the ability of allah azzawajal to change things to transform things to provide for you this is the belief and conviction of the heart which rarely people focus on and this is why the prophet had placed a lot of emphasis on the purity of the heart that once your heart is pure and healthy then the whole body would be pure and healthy and this is what ibrahim said as allah tells us in the quran that no child or wealth would benefit a person on the day of judgment except those who come with a pure healthy heart so it is extremely important to work on your heart to work on your sincerity to work on your intention because this is only between you and allah no one knows what's in your heart that is why the hypocrites as we spoke about before are the worst of the disbelievers because they pretend to be muslims and no one knows what's what goes into their hearts and hence we treat them as muslims but they are fooling the people thinking that they are also fooling allah and allah is the one who is fooling them so we have to work a lot on our hearts in order to um be saved now the where did i go the word the words constitute of faith is not limited to what is generally accepted as good words so now we're talking about rhetoric things that we say so the sheikh says the words constituent of faith is not limited to what is generally accepted as good words such as telling the truth so anywhere you go in the world if you see a buddhist or an atheist or a hindu and they're just saying the truth telling the truth they're speaking kindly to one's parents they're greeting people showing the way to anyone who is lost etc these are matters that everyone loves including disbelievers who deny allah's existence so does this fall under the category of iman when it comes to rhetoric and the actions of the tongue the answer is no what is meant by the words are those words that are special to the message of our prophet is the most important of these are the declaration of allah's oneness and that the prophet is his messenger and the glorification of god which is known as thicker so what we say with our tongues counts as part of iman and if we refrain from saying it willingly though do we have the conviction of the heart the saying and action of the heart though we seem to be praying like everybody else if we willingly on and intentionally refrain from saying the word then we are not believers we don't have faith and this is why it is a must that a person announces his islam through verbally and loudly declaring the shahada if a man comes to a an islamic center and says hi i'm a muslim and the head of the islamic center says oh masha'allah what were you before he said i was a christian i was a jew i was an atheist but now i'm a muslim so the imam says to him so do you believe that there's no god except allah where they're being worshiped and that muhammad is his prophet and messenger and servant he says yep i believe he's not a muslim yet he has to say the words so if we say to him say ashadu allah i said it yesterday why would i say it again i pray with you i believe in the quran i believe in allah i believe in everything he says okay say it so no i don't have to say it i've said it yesterday and i always say it in my salah this guy is not a muslim why because he failed in saying what the shahada is announced by his islam is declared by so [Music] and also when we come to actions we find people doing a lot of humanitarian humanitarian humanitarian work in africa and burma and somalia and all these places that they need humanitarian works but they're not muslims sometimes you go to the depths of jungles of africa and you find missionaries 20 years 30 years spending there teaching the people how to take care of themselves how to document their languages they're not muslims they've done great deeds for humanity for these people they've documented their language which was never written before they've helped them medically etc all of this is good however according to islam this is not the specific deeds that islam requires the book says nor is the action constituent limited to general good actions such as dutifulness to one's parents harmful objects from people's way feeding the poor and the needy supporting those suffering injustice being hospitable to one's guests and so on again people love such love such actions regardless of whatever or whether they are believers or not what is meant in iman when we say that we have to have our actions verifying our beliefs and what we say it says what is meant here is the sort of action that the prophet was particularly outlined such as prayer zakat fasting pilgrimage these are actions related to islam if you pick and choose actions that are generally accepted by all and refuse to do the things that you were commanded to do in islam your iman is not valid and this is why we have to look into what time okay we have to look into what constitutes a man now before we go on most of you may ask what is iman and what is islam and why are you talking to us about iman when we don't actually figure out the difference between them okay do you guys know the hadith of jibril when he came to the prophet he asked him about islam and the prophet told him that islam is made of five pillars then he asked he asked him about iman and the prophet alaihis salaam said to him that iman is composed of six pillars then he asked him about yahsen and then he asked him about the signs of the day of judgment this is a well-known hadith and one of the most studied hadiths in islam so what is a different difference between islam and iman first of all these words have similarities and they share some or a lot of the meanings together it's like when we say when we say poor and needy when we use such a terminology alone it incubates and includes the other so whenever we say islam we are also referring to iman and whenever we talk in a subject and say and this is iman this means it includes islam when they come together they have each a specific meaning so when we talk about al-masakim the needy this this includes the poor as well and we when we talk about al-fuqarah alone this includes al-masakin as well but when we say al-fukhara when each one has a separate specific meaning to it so how do we understand this allah azza says in the quran is talking about what had happened to the people of luther the angels say we were sent to people who commit sodomy and homosexuality so we were ordered to extract whoever believers were there we did not find except a household of muslims so the rest of the tribe or the village were all non-muslims yet those who were found the household who were muslims among them is the wife of luth peace be upon him and she was a disbeliever she betrayed him through this belief not through sexual intercourse she betrayed him by disbelieving by guiding her people to guests whenever they came so that they would commit their evil act this is why she pretended to be muslims and this is why the angels said and we could not find except a muslim household they're all believers except to his wife and this is why they call them muslims in what appears to people so again what is the difference between islam and iman islam deals with what appears to people external things such as the shahada saying prayer fasting giving zakat and hajj while iman deals with the hidden things such as the belief and conviction of allah azzawajal the day of judgment the books the messengers the angels the pre-destiny whether good or bad all of these are hidden nobody knows about them except allah so this when they are combined islam talks about the external apparent acts while eman talks about your conviction and your belief some people may give the wrong impression when they say islam is first then you get higher you become iman and then you become etc it's not such grades because any person as a muslim if he does not have the characteristics and the belief of iman he's not a muslim yet what is meant by it is that this is the first stage that a person needs to go through in order to be accepted as a muslim in this life so what refrains us from considering him a non-muslim is that he declared the shahada is that he prays what goes in his heart is between him and allah azza and this is why it is not the stages that we're talking about it's the actions whether they're external or internal and this is why some scholars may say that every min is a muslim every person who has iman is by default a muslim but not the other way around not every muslim is a mukmin and by that we mean a perfect movement but by default any muslim must be even partially because if someone says that he's a muslim but he's not a mean in the sense that he doesn't have any iman what do you mean by he doesn't have an iman do you mean that he doesn't have the belief in allah in the hereafter in the angels the books the messengers he's a kafir anyone who does not believe in any of these six articles of islam of iman he's not but when we say that every muslim is not necessarily a mu a believer meaning that there are 60 plus or 70 plus branches of iman whoever accomplishes that accomplishes them all he's a mean and whoever has some and failed in achieving others he's a muslim with partial iman so this is important to understand so that people would not fail in understanding that islam is external things that people see and we judge people and we deal with them according to their islam not according to their iman because we don't know what they have in their hearts an iman depends on the things of a person's conviction going moving on the sheikh says good actions that all divine messages and human nature have outlined such as the love what such as to love what is good for all people speaking the truth dutifulness to parents feeding the poor removing harmful objects from people's way etc increase faith when they are offered for the sake of allah okay increase and this is a very important uh issue in the creed of allah that iman increases and decreases however the absence of such good deeds does not negate faith in the same way as practicing them does not mean that the person doing them is a believer so with this understanding that iman is 60 or 70 plus branches we believe that if we're truthful which is one of the branches of a man and we are honest and we fulfill our promises we believe that these are all good attributes and signs that a person might be however not necessarily those who do these good deeds are mu min because iman is a terminology that is defined by the sharia by the quran and the sunnah so a disbeliever a kafir a hindu a buddhist a christian might be truthful honest brave generous kind loving caring can we say that he's a min definitely not because the essence of iman which is the conviction and the belief in allah azzawajal and in the prophet this is all not existing and hence we do not consider that person to be a believer but the opposite is also true meaning that if a person who's a muslim lacks such characteristics so he may lie he may cheat he may deceive he may be a coward he may not be generous which is not that easy to find among muslims whose religion dictates that they do all of these things but you may find some black sheep in the family this does not mean that such a person is not a believer the sheikh goes on to say all they prove is that the one who does them enjoys an upright nature the nature that allah equipped people with remains the same close to accepting the truth and this is why those who have these characteristics in them usually are very close to accepting islam because they're close to nature allah says in the quran set your face steadily towards the truth or the true faith turning away from all that is false in accordance with the natural disposition which allah has installed into man nothing can change allah's creation so all of this is something that proves to us that this is what iman is about it is doing these good things for the sake of allah so the other denominations when they do good things they don't do it sincerely for the sake of allah they do it for the sake of their god their beliefs which the essence of iman is not there enhanced it is not accepted i think we will stop here inshaallah and we will continue next monday and now it is time to take some of your questions so the question number one zed says is it sunnah to raise hands so high and make dua by the sheikh or on the member or after the lecture i wish you come back to uganda again well i i hope inshallah that allah would fulfill your wish soon let this crisis we are all going through pass safely and we can travel and hopefully i can come back to kambala to uh enteby airport and and visit the beautiful people of uganda where i had a very good time there alhamdulillah now raising the hands can be sunnah and can be innovation generally speaking raising the hands in dua is highly recommended the prophet says when a man or a person or a woman raise when they raise their hands allah is bashful to return them empty-handed because allah is bashful and allah is generous so generally speaking i'm in the middle of the night i didn't make the hajju i am in between i am in my home and it's raining it's sporting outside i am at the last third of the night i am a traveler and i want to make dua no problem raise your hands and make a dua this is more likely to get your door answered so this is sunnah highly recommended there is a time when such raising of the hand becomes ebitda an innovation i can't understand this trick how can it be an innovation when the prophet tells us that allah is bashful and he does not want to return our hands empty-handed because there are places where you are not supposed to raise your hands for example what's the ruling on offering salutation to the prophet hallelujah when you say allah musa muhammad you would say whoa that's good it's a good deed so how would you think if i every time going into the toilet to answer the call of nature i say bismillah allah musa when i come back out of it i say of allah you would say that no this is not appropriate this is something that is not according to the sunnah what you're doing is something that is an innovation likewise when you say that i'd like to raise my hands and offer dua at a time that was not prescribed by the prophet alaihis for example all the companions say that the prophet al-islam never raised his hands during the of friday except in one incident and that is when he was asking for rain other than that without whatever dua he made he never raised his hands so if the if the imam raises his hands while on the member on the pulpit and makes dura we say you are doing something wrong this is an innovation likewise every single followed prayer after people conclude it we say them raise their hands making dua excuse me what are you doing they say we're making dua and raising our hands so we say to them was it ever reported in the quran or in the sunnah the authentic sunnah that the prophet jesus and his companions used to take this as a habit after every false prayer they said no so what are you guys doing then either you know more than the prophet islam or you're innovating so likewise when we come to different situations and people raise their hands if this is a habit and related to ibadah that was not done by the prophet sam we say that this is innovation but if it's a general thing for example i am giving a dars and at the end of the dars i make dua random not something that's a habitual act it's it's random so after i concluded is there anything wrong in that no this is okay let's assume that we had dinner at a person's house and as a random act not every single time we have dinner someone has to make dua no no it's a very random act i raise my hands say oh allah provide for the one who had honored us with this dinner and give them provision and pay their debts off etc and people say i mean no problem but to fix this protocol to be done in with terms of uh ibadah that was never reported by the prophet saw his companions that this would be wrong and the love be pleased with him and with his father gave us a lesson when he where actually when once a man sneezed in his presence and he said alhamdulillah did was let this pass may allah repeats with him he said and i say allah is but this is not the way the prophet had taught us the prophet told us whenever you sneeze you praise allah meaning say alhamdulillah full stop and this is an important aspect in islam that a lot of the muslims neglect due to the ignorance about the rulings of sharia so nowadays if you talk to someone and say to him this is not from the sunnah please don't do this oh you hate the prophet islam that's why you don't want us to offer salutation you hate us when we make dua and raise our hands that's why you don't want us to subhan allah i'm only telling you what the prophet used to do now either you know more than the prophet or you're actually innovating as long as the prophet had never done such a thing then what you are doing is definitely an innovation didn't allah say in chapter 5 and this ayah we always repeat it over and over and over again because it is extremely important in knowing what to take and what to leave allah says in verse number three surah al maidah chapter five today i have completed your religion and i completed my favor upon you to islam and i accepted islam to be your religion so now you tell me raising the hands after every fake prayer was it part of the religion when this ayah was revealed to the prophet if yes then please show me the evidence if not then you must refrain and allah azza knows best the second question is from brother fahad says is a person sinful for not giving dawah as i know it is mandatory to give dawah to the non-muslims what about if a person does not have enough knowledge first of all a lot of the muslims believe or have this conviction that dawah means or is equivalent to giving lectures and sermons and attending or presenting conferences and this is not true at all yes this is maybe five percent of dawah but the vast majority of dawah 95 is done differently now if you look at the people of the southeast asia indonesia for example quarter of a billion muslims 250 million muslims if you look at malaysia if you look at singapore if you look at other places not a single soldier conquered or went into these countries yet they have accepted islam what do you mean by muslim merchants traders who went there once the natives saw how truthful honest and kind they were they accepted that and embraced the religion they were giving to subhanallah when you have da'wah done through your actions through your kindness through your honesty this benefits people more than a thousand lecture in a lecture we can speak and talk and talk and talk endlessly but this is not walking the talk walking the talk is when you get the people actually seeing how truthful honest how punctual how kind how generous you are this is the excellent way of making dawah dawah can be done through writing through a gift through co-existing dawah can be done through a gentle kind word to your colleagues at work or in school so it is not just simply presenting a lecture no this is a small part of dawa now it is important that you don't speak and you don't indulge in conversations or arguments about islam when you don't have knowledge it's not that you're riding the tide just because you're a muslim and they're asking you questions you have to come up with an answer no this is wrong if you have knowledge yes go ahead and address it or coat a scholar but don't shoot from the hip don't make yourself a bridge over hellfire where pop people cross over it by walking on your back you don't know simply say i don't know let me check let me verify let me ask and i'll come up with an answer so i hope that one is not as scary as many people think and they try to avoid rather be proud of your islam this is a form of da'wah there are thousands of leaflets distributed for free for you to go and give them away with a smile let the people reach for themselves oh soul center the one you see my uh uh poster behind me and the one i used to have the mug before the kids took the mug thinking that i had a drink in it um this one this usual center www.osuolcenter.com this has hundreds if not thousands of materials that you can print on your computer on your printer and give away two colleagues to neighbors all talk about different topics in islam that would be an eye-opener to people so you don't have to be a rocket scientist to be able to understand and to do what is needed to be done in sha'allah [Music] afrina says in the last class of islamic you said those who hate islam inside but don't show it it's the worst kind of blasphemy so my question is if i get these sort of people in my relatives or around me is it permissible for me to have contact with these people or i must leave them we said that hypocrisy is something that you cannot pinpoint because a hypocrite believes and hates islam and the muslims yet shows everyone around him that he is a muslim and he loves and cares about islam and this is why the prophet hassan never killed any one of them because they acted like muslims so how could how could he do something like that to someone who's claiming to be a muslim that wasn't possible however we said that one of the ways of fighting the hypocrites is to expose them expose their actions so if i have a relative or a colleague and i'm accusing him of hypocrisy this is a very dangerous thing how can i accuse him of something that i don't have evidence of that can't stand in a court of law so do i know what's his inside his heart no sheikh but he always does things that no one does except hypocrites again you can't label people like that you remember the hadith of islam said may allah be pleased with him and with his father when he was in jihad at war in a ba on the battlefield fighting someone who killed so many muslims at the battlefield and they had a duel and when the disbeliever felt that he's about to lose and to be killed he said usama killed him when the prophet heard this the prophet was outraged he said you killed him after he said we are on the battlefield and we are at war and the guy just killed so many muslims he didn't have the time to sit and reflect and say to himself oh yeah yeah yeah islam is the right religion i think it's the right time for me to accept islam he just wanted to save his himself the prophet said did you open his heart to know that this was his intention what are you going to do on the day of judgment with allah and he kept repeating it so again i speak to you afrina who tell told you that these are hypocrites and they are out of the fold of islam as long as they did not say something that incriminates them big time you have to treat them as muslims do you have to contact them you have to mix with them no if they're bad muslims or they're bad influence to your iman you simply can just [Music] keep your distance maybe give them salam whatever you see them but this is it you don't have to go further than that rania says to perform sunnah fajr is it before the adhan of fajr or after or during the akama this is a question that that a lot of the muslims ask and i'll give you a rule of thumb whenever the sunnah of a particular prayer is mentioned this means that it has to be at the time of that prayer so when we say fajr prayer this means that fajr prayer has a beginning of time where the adhan is called and an end of time when the sun starts to rise and you cannot pray it correctly the time is out then you're sinful so when we say fajr sunnah this means that it has to be after the attack because if i pray it before that and this is part of midnight it's it has nothing to do with fajr likewise it has to be from till the end in between these two times and i hope this answers your question says question number one i know free mixing is not allowed in islam but what about on the school bus where sometimes males sit next to a female just for a short period of time and they don't talk to each other this is not permissible if you have another option for example i go into a school bus there's so many seats empty but i see this beautiful chick sitting next to the window i go sit next sit next to her this is totally scenario number two i enter a bus the whole place is fully packed except two seats one next to a girl one next to a man i must sit next to a man scenario number three i enter a school bus fully booked except one seat next to a girl and i see another two seaters with a boy and a girl if the there is a supervisor who can speak to the girl to ask her to move then this is okay otherwise yeah it is permissible for you to sit and keep your distance and try not to communicate none whatsoever uh with that female and allah sojourn knows best second question from latifah when everyone high school students rush to get onto the bus sometimes male skin touch the female will it be or will i be sinful for that well if you try your level best to avoid and it happens without your consent and without your intention though you are trying your level best to stay away there is no sin on you inshallah and the last third question is can i download a workout app that is from the same gender that people who are not properly dressed is no so if you're talking about a work out for a woman who's not properly dressed or wearing her swimsuits one piece maybe or leggings or something like that with other three four women this is not permissible for you to watch because this is aura and you have to avoid that and allah azza knows best so with this we come to the conclusion of today's episode until we meet you next monday i leave"
