  "title": "Feeling lost, how can I fill the emptiness in my heart? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the emptiness of the heart is you that to the fact you did not fill it up with the right thing the heart is like this glass you fill it to the top with water I cannot add anything else because it will overflow but if it's half full you can put something that would mix with it a lot of us do five times prayer not because we love prayer because we are accustomed to it our parents pray we pray and this is why a lot of us when they travel they don't drink a lot of the Saudis I speak about Saudis Arabs when they travel to Europe they do Jamaica first three days after three days they do Jammer at the end of the night in three minutes I was finished after five days no Salat at all after they come two three weeks they go and make Umbra and then they start praying their prayer is not from the heart it's Customs it's because everybody is praying and this is very big problem if the prayer is not initiated from the heart and you're praying for the sake of Allah azzawajal then you have this emptiness in your heart how to fill it up number one with the Quran with the knowledge about Islam with good companions most likely the sister who's asking this question has no muslim sisters associated with her and this is what I always find in my counseling session when people say I have anxiety I have this as I say do you have Muslim friends I said no I always in my room alone this is why the prophet said yeah the wolf eats from the Sheep the one that goes astray when the Sheep are together the wolf stays away until one of the sheep says I'm fed up I want to go for a smoke then she goes then the wolf attacks so when you with the friends with the Muslims you're United Muslim United they told me I have to make an endorsement so when you are with the Muslims you become strong but when you're alone this is when shaytan comes uh open Tick Tock Open YouTube watch this I don't I don't have anything so don't ever be alone fill your heart with Heaven Quran with zikr of Allah azzawajal with knowing who Allah is imagine how many years did the prophet send in Mecca doing much there was no Salat except in the last couple of years there was no zakah there was no fasting there was no umrah there was no Hajj there was no divorce marriage uh rebar transactions nothing what was he doing 13 years in Makkah he was teaching people Iman who Allah is what is the day of judgment what are the Angels what are the prophets what are the scriptures what is and this is what you have to fill your heart with if you want to get real proper Iman"
