  "title": "Muslims need one another - Friday Khutbah Nairobi (Kenya) ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª #Assim #khutbah #quran assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Allah the almighty has created man in nature by the man being weak we cannot stand alone and we need one another as individuals we need others to collaborate and to cooperate with us that's why we need other to plow the Earth to saw the seeds to harvest the crops we need people to manufacture the machines and to make products to Market them we need others to buy them so we do need one another because life does not go on without such cooperation we cannot stand alone and this is in worldly matters however if even in religion even when it comes to Shar the same concept is applied we need one another to implement the Shar and to enforce this religion even the prophets and Messengers peace and blessing of Allah be upon them needed the support of their loyal companions Allah asael says and how many a prophet fought in battle and with him fought many religious Scholars and companions but they never lost Assurance due to what Afflicted them in the cause of Allah nor did they weaken or submit and Allah loves the steadfast say a mean may Allah Asel make me and you among those who are steadfast so the prophets and The Messengers needed their loyal companions to spreaded and to defeat shik and likewise Muslims need one another in their worldly Affairs as well as in their Islamic Affairs and that is why cooperation and collaboration among the Muslims is a very important issue it was mandated and obligated Upon Us by Allah and our Affairs could never go and progress could never go forward nor progress without such cooperation when we have one word when we have one stand when we have solidarity this is the only time when our enemies would fear us and look around you does the enemy fear the Muslims La no by Allah we're so distracted disunited we're so conflicted among one another even in the misid you would find worshippers fighting with one another where is the unity Where is the solidar ity where is the cooperation Allah says in the Quran and cooperate in righteousness and piety but do not cooperate in sin and aggression may Allah have mercy on his soul says in his about this Ayah this is an address to the Believers that each individual must cooperate with one another on righteousness which is everything that Allah ordered you to do and on tawa which is piety and that is to stay away from everything that Allah prohibited you from approaching or doing and we when we want to list righteousness and piety when we want to list it we find that the list is almost endless so as an example cooperating on Jihad if the Muslims collaborated and cooperated and joined forces on Jihad none of our territory would be occupied none of our Muslim brothers and sisters anywhere in the world would be oppressed but it's unfortunate when the Muslims themselves assist the disbelievers in oppressing our Muslim brothers and sisters we need cooperation in stopping the aggression in avenging those who are oppressed in returning the rights to their lawful owners we need cooperation to reconcile between the fighting factions to teach the ignorant and to provide authentic knowledge we need to cooperate in helping the destitute the poor the needy the relatives the orphans the widows those who are in need we need to cooperate among ourselves to pay the debts of those who are in debt and among that even giving gifts lending things that are not needed by you to others so that they could use it a among the forms of collaboration and cooperation is to answer the invitation when invited is to give food to those who are hungry is to give to those who are fasting is to follow a deceased Muslim to his grave and to offer the funeral prayers is to assist someone who's in need to get married financially is to give and advice to whomever is seeking it from you and in short to collaborate and cooperate upon righteousness and piety includes everything that Allah Asel loves and wants you to do whether it is part of his own rights or part of the rights of other humans this bond between the Muslims if it existed this gives them power this gives them Authority and it throws the fear in the hearts of their enemies and this is what the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam based the majority of his da in Medina upon so when the migrants of Medina came and they met the people the locals of Medina the ansar the migrants were poor they left their wealth their families everything they owned and came fleeing the lands of kufur with their own Iman and religion to compensate them the prophet Alat wasam enforced cooperation upon righteousness and piety among the Muslims so he allocated each muhajir immigrant to one of the ansar of the locals of Medina and he not only did that he made them brothers in Islam to the extent that if one of them were to Die the other would inherit him so ABD may Allah be pleased with him one of the 10 heavenbound who came poor had nothing was allocated to S may Allah be pleased with him and the moment the prophet said he's your brother take care of him went to ABD Rahman and said ABD Rahman the people of Medina know that I'm the richest among them all and I have two wives that are righteous and kind because the prophet may do my brother half of my wealth is yours and I will divorce one of my wives of course after Consulting her and after she is out of the you can marry her what kind of humans are these what kind of a man is he I would understand if he would to share a th000 10,000 of his wealth but to show such transparency and say half of what I have is yours this is crazy what's more crazy is that ABD rman insteading who who hates freebies I'm on instead he said may Allah put bar in your wealth and in your family just show me where the market is that's it he did not take anything what kind of Pride this man had an Iman he would not even cross the line though it was willingly given to him this compassion this collaboration this Brotherhood is what took them all over the world to spread Islam and this is how Islam was spread from east to west Not By The Sword only it was spread by the sword by the word and by this compassion and mercy and love the prophet Alat wasam says the Believers in their Mutual kindness compassion and sympathy are just like one body when one of the limbs suffers the whole body responds to it with lack of sleep and fever cooperation and collaboration and unity among the Muslims is a clear form of Mercy Mercy that Allah bestows upon them whenever you see a community a society that has this in them then acknowledge that Allah Asel loves them and puts Mercy in their hearts and whenever there is Discord disunity fighting then this is a sign of Allah's torment and Punishment upon them the prophet sallu alai wasallam says Allah the compassionate one has Mercy mer on those who are merciful if you show Mercy to those who are on the earth he who is in the heaven will show Mercy to you this Mercy has different shades and forms but it all revolves around cooperation in righteousness and piety so if a sick man if someone who's ill and you visit them and you give them words of encouragement and treatment this is Mercy if you find someone who's hungry and starving and you give them food you've shown them Mercy if you see someone who's been captive whether unlawfully or lawfully whether in thatb or for any other reason and you intercede and you help financially to set him free you have expressed and showed him mercy and likewise if you go to an orphanage or you meet an orphan and you just wipe over their head this is a kind and and a gesture of Mercy that Allah Asel would definitely have mercy upon you and this is why the prophet saysat in a beautiful Hadith showing and highlighting the beauty of cooperation upon piety and uh uh righteousness the prophet saysat wasam the most beloved of people to Allah is the one who brings most benefit to people and the most beloved of Deeds to Allah is making a Muslim happy or relieving him of hardship or paying off his debt or warding off hunger from him the prophet goes on to sayat for me to go with my Muslim brother to meet his needs is dearer to me than observing in this mosque the mosque of Medina for a whole month to go with your brother and help him in achieving his needs is more beloved to the prophet than to do seclusion and in his own mid in Medina for a whole month so this is the most beloved person to Allah he's the person whom Allah assigned him to help people achieve their needs he helps people by his advice by his knowledge by his finan financial assistance by his authority and by his reputation by interceding when this is needed does this only for the sake of Allah not asking for praise or compliment from anyone and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam stated that to execute and to fulfill my brother's desire is dearer to myself than to stay in my Masid in in seclusion for a whole month and the prophet walked the talk his whole life is a manifestation of this helping people even the young girl who had mental issues as the Hadith says comes to him and says I have something to talk to you about set an appointment for me and he sets an appointment for her and she comes she holds his hand and he walks with her in the streets of Medina listening to her problem young girl who is mentally challenged yet the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam finds the time to listen to her may Allah be pleased with him the nephew ofad may Allah be pleased with her says any day I wake up in the morning and I don't see people asking me to help them outside my door I feel that this is a Calamity from Allah and a punishment Subhan Allah he sees that when no one is asking asking him for help financially or physically no one is standing outside his door waiting for him to come out and say please I need this I need this help I need to borrow I need you to help me and speak to my landlord if he doesn't see anyone asking of him he says this is a Calamity and a punishment from Allah that I seek the reward from Allah oh Servants of Allah brothers and sisters among us there are people who are well known they are celebrities because everyone talk about them in their Gatherings that individual mallah he always help people he always give without asking he always assist when people need assistance and they keep on praising and appreciating and uh showing their gratitude to such people because they know they spend their health wealth to help others and cooperate with them on righteousness and piety and if they could not help the least they could do is give you a good smile and give you a good Dua therefore try your level best de brother and sister try your level best to leave a good Mark to leave a fingerprint to leave a good Legacy what is your legacy when you die tomorrow what will people remember you of because these people are the witnesses of Allah on Earth imagine when one of us dies if people say may Allah have mercy on him he was a righteous person he was a good man he used to give in charity he used to teach the ignorant he used to help us this testimony would be accepted by Allah and if one of us was cursed by the people may Allah curse him he always caused problems and FNA among the Muslims he always blocked good things from reaching others he always caused enmity and Malice in the Muslims Hearts Allah would accept their curse and would curse that individual so do your level best to cooperate and to collaborate with the Muslims upon righteousness and virtue and upon piety so that Allah asael May may have mercy upon us all for"
