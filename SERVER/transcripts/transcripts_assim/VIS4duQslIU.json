  "transcript": "uh can we raise our hands when making duas that are reported from Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam such as the answer is no because when the prophet told us what to say in these forms of Dua such as he did not tell us to raise our hands and he did not raise his hands himself and therefore whatever is prescrib described of thear of the morning and the evening and at night time we say it as it is without raising the hands but if the time is a time of answering Dua such as between and or when the Imam sits between the twas and you raise your hand and make Dua there's nothing prescribed here you can do that without a problem and Allah Knows Best"
