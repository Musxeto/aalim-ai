  "title": "Visiting Amusement Park With Kids haram? I have been told Islam is not that extreme | AssimAlHakeem",
  "transcript": "shahira says as far as I understand we should not take our kids to places such as amusement parks talking about mutant partying in the West there are sins such as mixed gathering music etc but I have been told Islam is not that extreme I have explained that it's not my ruling and we need to obey Allah Allah commands so can can you please provide some references from the Quran the Sunnah so that I can explain it to them first of all when people say Islam is not that extreme what is the measuring stick then I can say mmm Islam is not extreme hmm this is not permissible oh this is Haddad what is the measuring stick that I can use in order to come with such a conclusion because if I go to a strip club god forbid and I say okay this is Haram the people would say come on Islam is not that strict Islam prohibits fornication but this is not this is just watching if I sit on a table where people are drinking be a Haram beard whiskey etc and I said I can't join you come on Islam is not a strict that's strict as long as you're not drinking it's okay so what is the measuring stick how can I know whether this is halal or Haram whether this is extreme or not it's definitely by going back to the Quran the Sunnah what is there in amusement parks free mixing well I may differ with that because there is similar free mixing in malls in supermarkets everywhere this is not free mixing when you see other women in the street this is not free mixing so being in a park and there are women and men all around you is okay I'm not doing anything Haram I'm not chit-chatting or socializing I'm on my own in amusement parks you have a lot of music you have a lot of Haram practices you have gambling when you shoot something if you miss you lose what you have paid if you strike you get a prize that is ten or fifteen times more than what you had paid this is gambling though it's a game it's fun you get a doll you get a teddy bear but it is gambling and this is haram the music is everywhere and when children go on rides like a horse like Bambi and an elephant or a tiger and it goes round and they play and etc these are idols these are not toys these are idols and they're there to stay and they're being respected and you're paying money to take a ride in it so this is not permissible among other things so for a Muslim it is unfortunately and I'm telling you this and the vast majority of Muslims are not paying attention to it and again the pressure is high for us to change our religion to change our convictions and everybody's against you the children the grandchildren the relatives this is too extreme come on let's go and have fun the children want to have fun but what about the music come on nobody's listening to it what about some nudity it's summer everybody's wearing shorts and revealing clothes no nobody's looking don't look look why would I put myself in harm's way and in the middle of hell so that people would be happy and have a good time no this is totally wrong and Haram and we should remain steadfast abiding by our religion tightly so that we would not have any problem insha'Allah"
