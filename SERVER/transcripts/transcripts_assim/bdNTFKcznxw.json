  "transcript": "Ayesha says how to know if we are being tested or being punished by Allah when we are faced with calamities this is a good question however we cannot know so I became sick I got an illness there is a disease I lost my money I lost my job I lost my investment how would I know if this is a test from Allah to elevate my status in Jannah or it is a punishment that allah azza wajal is punishing me for sins that I have committed you cannot know nevertheless they are interlinked so if I'm a righteous person and allow social tests me with an illness this means that Allah would erase my sins if I'm patient and not complaining and elevate my status in Jannah and the other way is also true if I'm a sinful person and Allah tests me with a calamity with an illness or with poverty or loss of job and I become humble and patient I do not complain I do not object to Allah's ruling but on the contrary I acknowledge my sins then this would erase my sins and elevate my posture and position in Jannah insha Allah therefore one can tell by the circumstances if a calamity befalls upon a kafir definitely this is not to elevate his status in Jannah he's a kafir he's a disbeliever this is a punishment if it falls upon an openly sinner Muslim he's sinful he's openly committing sin this is a punishment we know that for granted if it falls upon a person who's righteous and he is praying five times a day etcetera doing all that not the whole nine yards yet he is being tested with calamity this is a test when does it become a punishment if he starts to complain and he is impatient and he's objecting to Allah's rulings in decree though before the calamity he was a person of prayer fasting charity and righteousness in this case it becomes obvious that this is not a test this is a punishment"
