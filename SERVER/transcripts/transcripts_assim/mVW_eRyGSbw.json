  "transcript": "Jenna says Allah always accepts my duaa and I am very much thankful to him he always accepts all my Dora's very quickly is it something I should be worrying about the answer is yes if so there's a condition if you are not abiding by the hijab if you are not observing your salat carefully and on time if you're not totally dutiful and obedient to your parents if you do not watch haram listen to her arm if you don't do these things and Allah answers your dua quickly this means that you're a good person and this is a gift from Allah but when you are not abiding by the hijab not being dutiful to your parents watching how I'm listening to Haram not observing prayers and time and yet when you make dua Allah answers you this is what is known in Islam as Ystad ROG in a figure of speech this is like pulling your legs so that you think that you are okay and you're doing well and then on the day of judgement you will see yourself thrown in hell so you should be worried only if you are not a true servant of Allah who's practicing who is caring and loving to Islam and to the Muslims"
