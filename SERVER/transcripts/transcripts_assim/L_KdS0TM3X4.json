  "transcript": "Ismail from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum. Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh, I was saying that I had some debts on me so I couldn't find the person. So I decided to donate to a charity. What happened is that there was two options. One was my uncle and one was the organization. The uncle, I don't know if he was actually in miskeen or poor. My parents were telling me to do it. I was like, it's doubtful. So I donated to the organization. But I gave it to my father and trusted him to do it. And he did it online. But I'm having big doubts now because I don't know if he contacted the right person. And I checked the person in this. So should I ignore the doubts or should I investigate and give my charity debts again or the charity again? As long as your father is trustworthy and you gave him the money and authorized him to give it to a charity organization and you don't have any proof to prove otherwise, then you should trust your father and move on."
