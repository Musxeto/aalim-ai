  "transcript": "Fuad from Bangladesh Assalamu 'Alaykum wa\nRahmatullahi wa Barakatuhu, Sheikh my question is what's the ruling on\ndrawing the pictures of bacteria and virus? [Sheikh] What's the ruling on what? [Fuad] What's the ruling on drawing the pictures\nof bacteria and virus? [Sheikh] Ok, I will answer you in Sha Allah,\nFuad from Bangladesh, he says can we draw bacteria and germs and the likes and human\ncells and the things like that? there is no problem in that, because what's\nprohibited for us to draw are things such as human form, animals, birds, fish, living\nthings. Bacteria are so negligible that we don't see\nthem, especially for those who are forced to draw them due to their exams, their studies\nlike medical doctors and the likes, and those who study biology."
