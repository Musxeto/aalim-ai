  "transcript": "They're based on either gharar, riba, or zulm. These are the three reasons, main reasons, that any transaction would be haram. What do we mean by riba? Interest. We don't have to go into this. Gharar, meaning that there is a margin of error, of confusion. So if I tell you, this is Christian Dior by the way, very expensive. I sell you what's in my wallet for five rupees. How many would say, I'll buy? Everybody. Now, is this permissible in Islam? No. Because I can open it and there is nothing in it. And I can open it and there is a hundred thousand rupees in it. This is haram, this is gharar. Likewise, if I have a cow, and I'm in a country other than India, where I can sell cows. You can sell cows here? Okay, alhamdulillah. So I have a cow, and the cow is pregnant. And I tell you, I'll sell you what's in that cow's womb for a hundred rupees. Permissible? No. Why? You don't know if it's a twin, if it's alive, if it's healthy. You don't know what the outcome. And even if I'm happy with a hundred rupees, once it gives birth to a healthy little cow, how would I feel? Devastated. Because if I waited, I could have sold it for a hundred thousand maybe, or less or more."
