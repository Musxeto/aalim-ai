  "transcript": "my question is about interest okay you know in the in the uk sometimes when you save every month they add 0.1 or 0.2 interest okay i wanna understand and if it's not good what's your advice please okay what is interest interest is money or a benefit given over a loan this is called in arabic the prophet al-islam in a hadith but it's a general rule most likely any type of loan that draws interest or benefit it's reba so by this definition when i put my money as a deposit in the bank and they give me point one percent or point zero percent well point zero is nothing point zero two percent whatever negligible how negligible it is this percentage is totally prohibited in haram why because i'm keeping my hundred k pounds if i had 100k pound i wouldn't be here but i'm putting it in the bank and the bank is giving me interest it's not a safe deposit box that i'm putting it in i'm giving it to the bank and the bank is lending it is uh doing things with it so the bank is using it it's a loan and that's why if the bank was burnt down to the ground they don't have the uh um the chance to ask for forgiveness and say sorry we were keeping your money in and we've lost it so i say okay it's okay it was a deposit no they'll return every penny of it because it was a loan therefore it is prohibited for you to charge this what to do with the interest take it keep your 100k in the bank take the interest and give it to poor uh and needy muslims as a form of cleansing your wealth not as a form of getting closer to allah this is number one what about if i borrow from the bank well definitely this is totally prohibited because the bank requires you to pay them two five six seven percent annually over this debt whether it is for building a house and mortgage whether it's for business whatever they give you and demand and interest this is totally prohibited and allah azzawajal knows best"
