  "transcript": "foreign so what happens on Fridays I tend to have my son with me because um I work from home and my wife goes to work on Fridays and um I've taken him to um Juma a few times and he was very very as you can imagine it's under two years or so it was very very he was crying and disturbing all the worship I wish I felt very very uncomfortable for the fact that I was disturbing other worshipers I had to step out and and yeah asked about break in the courtyard because the German they must get Freedom filled up and we pray in the courtyard so what I tend to do most of the time most of most Fridays is to drive to the Masjid park next to the market and because we pray no court yet as well and they broadcast the um Simon I mean the YouTuber on Fridays on YouTube as well so I tend to sit down in a car at least with my son listen to the um to the Imam and when it's time for Salah I step in the courtyard and I play with the JAMA so my question is is that okay for me to do or it's best for me to to pray at home to pray for him no of course praying as you have been doing is far greater than praying in your home yes you're not being rewarded as those who attend Friday earlier and they sacrifice a camel a cow a sheep a chicken or an egg depending on how early they come before the Imam starts his hotel so if you come and sit in the car until the Salat is established and then you join the Salat you have prayed Friday but your reward has been diminished then reduced to the bare minimum now if there is no other alternative maybe inshallah you will be getting some reward but if there's another alternative like taking the child to one of his grandparents like a grandmother your mother or her mother and keep the child for a couple of hours with them until you finish the Salat or instruct and order your wife to sit home because this is where she belongs verse 33. Surah 33 Allah says remain in your homes this is where a woman should be taking care of her child or children taking care of her home and not to be a breadwinner this is the duty entirely and totally of the man and I've been getting so many complaints of women being forced by their quote unquote so-called men to work and they say that we don't feel that this is natural working is not our duty we don't want to mix with men we don't want to work eight to nine hours a day we'd like to sit home take care of our children prepare ourselves for our husbands prepare a good meal clean the house this is what feels natural but some gold diggers want their wives to work contribute in paying the rent the bills the mortgage may be Haram mortgage the car and insist that they're not doing enough and I tell women you're not married to real men he may look like a male but he's not a real man you need a real man who is your rock who protects you who provides for you who does not ask a penny of you such people are not men they're male I don't know if they're full males or not even this is something you may decide not me but definitely the amount of complaints I'm getting indicates that there is something wrong with so-called men who expect their women to chip in the expenses these are not real men and when they come and not contribute in the house and the cleaning and taking care of the kids not show their appreciation and emotional support to their women definitely these are gold diggers you have to run"
