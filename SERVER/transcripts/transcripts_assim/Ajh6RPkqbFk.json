  "transcript": "Adrian from Serbia. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So will nail a cracking and nose picking break the fast and is it haram? Jazak Allah Khair. If you don't consume any of your nails or whatever you pick from your nose, if you don't eat it, it has nothing to do with your fasting. And instead of giving you a fish every day, rather it's best for you to learn how to fish. The things that nullify your fasting are a handful. The things that nullify your wudu are a handful. If you know them, anything else does not fall into breaking your fast or your wudu or your islam or your ibadah. So in order to learn, you have to go back to the basics and go to the chapter that deals with fasting. I have so many clips on the things that nullify your fasting. Count them, there are seven or six in number. Once you master them, khalas, you don't need to come to me again."
