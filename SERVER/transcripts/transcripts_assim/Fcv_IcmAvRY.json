  "transcript": "Yusuf from the Emirates. Is the first part of Tashahud a pillar and is the second part a mandatory act? The first part of Tashahud which I think you're referring to is the Tashahud we say in the first sitting of Maghreb or a four rak'ah prayer known as Tashahudul Awwal. This is mandatory. If you leave it because you forgot after the second Sajdah, you said Allahu Akbar and stood for the third rak'ah and then you dope slapped your head and said, whoa, what have I done? I should have sat down to do my Tashahud. Khalas, you cannot go back because you're already standing for the third rak'ah. What to do? You compensate this by two Sujud of Sahoo before Salam. This is mandatory. Wajib. As for the second Tashahud which is the sitting, the second sitting of Maghreb or the sitting on the fourth rak'ah in Dhuhr, Asr and Isha, this is the last Tashahud. The Tashahud here is a pillar. You forget it, your prayer is invalid. End of story. It's not something you can afford to skip. You forgot it, oh by mistake, Shaykh, I didn't know. You have to repeat the whole prayer all over again and Allah knows best."
