  "transcript": "Abu Abdur Rahman from Italy. I know that Zaghrabi students should be given at the end of Ramadan. Now, if I see somebody at this moment of Ramadan who is severely in need of Zaghrabi students, or in need of food, can I give me and my family Zaghrabi students? No, you cannot give someone who is in need at the moment your Zakatul Fitr. Because, as you've clearly stated, it is only permissible to give Zakatul Fitr one or two days before the end of Ramadan. One or two days, according to what Abdullah ibn Umar, may Allah be pleased with him and with his father, said. So, more than that is not permissible according to the most authentic opinion of scholars. However, now, if I send my money to a brother in Yemen or in Syria, and say to them, Akhi, this is my Zakatul Fitr, only give it on the 29th or the 30th of Ramadan, this is valid. Because I trust that they will not give it to the poor until it's due time, and this is permissible. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website, and you will find counseling sessions, and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So, come to me, and let's speak about it, insha'Allah, within the following two days or three days. And, bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
