  "transcript": "so fatima says while doing would if the needed if the need of watching an extra part which is not one of the organs of voodoo arises can we wash it between the world if it's going to take a couple of seconds no problem yeah any for example i washed my face then I'm washing my arms then I noticed that on my shoulder there's some dirt so I just wash it and I continue a couple of seconds no problem but if I require something more maybe acetone or not a varnish nail varnish remover or washing it with soap etc no this would invalidate water because the sequence was interrupted"
