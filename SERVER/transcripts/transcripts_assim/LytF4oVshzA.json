  "transcript": "this question is quite common a woman in her menstruation and she gets clean from her menstruation at 10:00 in the morning so after fer she's still having her Menses but at 10:00 in the morning she becomes pure and she sees her Purity and she asks now I'm going to goel should I abstain should I refrain should I stop eating and drinking until M though this day is not counted for me or is it okay for me to eat and drink the answer is it's a disputable issue among Scholars but the most authentic opinion is that she is allowed to continue to eat and drink because when fer was due when Dawn broke she was not among those who were entitled or who were obliged to fast and therefore she doesn't have to continue the day fasting and Allah knows it of course uh having said that it is recommended that she uh respect the people's um feelings some people may get annoyed when people um eat in front of them and if this is the case then it is recommended that you don't do this in front of people and Allah Knows Best"
