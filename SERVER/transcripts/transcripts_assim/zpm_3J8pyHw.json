  "transcript": "Hayyan from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Sheikh I want to ask that am I right in this case or is this OCD? Sheikh if a person leaves many prayers then he is Kafir according to some scholars. So it means no good deed is accepted by a Kafir. So if a person leaves prayers deliberately because of major impurity and now he takes ghusl without reciting Shahada, is his ghusl valid? Because he committed Kufr and did not recite the Shahada before taking ghusl. Is his ghusl valid? His ghusl is valid and it's not up to you to decide whether he committed Kufr or not. Because to label someone that he committed Kufr, there are conditions to be fulfilled and obstacles to be eliminated. You just cannot come to one statement of the scholars and apply it to whomever you wish without looking at the circumstances. This is not the way, it's done."
