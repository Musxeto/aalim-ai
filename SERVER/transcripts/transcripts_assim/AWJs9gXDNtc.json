  "transcript": "her fourth question is regarding our our is the area of the body which others are not allowed to look at there is our for the masses there is our for my moms and there is no our between the spouses so the man and wife can see each other without no restrictions at all but when it comes to Muharram a man must not watch his sister or his mother or his aunt wearing inappropriate clothes that reveals more than it covers and the scholars say that the area that is usually allowed for a woman to expose in front of male moms is like her arms from here from the biceps not over part of her neck and the upper chest and not her cleavage maybe some of her neck from behind in some of the back but not the full back and up to the chin of her legs so below the knee by 4 or 8 fingers width so these are okay for a woman to show an expose in front of her Muhammad's brother father uncle son in front of women it's almost the same but to come out with tight clothes that reveal her curves and bone structure or to come out with transparent clothes that show her skin or some times her underwears this is totally inappropriate because Shaitaan is there and people nowadays do not control their gaze do not lower their gaze so they look you end up by having a ten year old child telling her that whoa this girl is beautiful this woman is beautiful her she's well shaped she's healthy she's fit and he's ten years old so you cannot expand this an allow Shaitaan to penetrate our homes in such a fashion for a woman to go to a swimming pool definitely it's out of the question wearing swimming costumes or swimming suits whether one piece or two pieces this is totally prohibited because the thighs the curves the everything is the whole nine yards is is totally out of order so does this mean a woman does not swim no she can swim but she has to wear something that covers her thighs and and and back and buttocks and properly cover her upper body as well a wide t-shirt etc and the bikini they have nowadays which is a little bit infamous may and may not depending on how tight it is but generally speaking it does the job but it covers more than she's supposed to cover she she doesn't have to cover her arms if she's going in a segregated swimming pool that is totally for females so a woman has to preserve her chastity and be careful when going to such places and Allah knows best"
