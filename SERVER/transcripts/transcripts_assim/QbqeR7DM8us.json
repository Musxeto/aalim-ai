  "transcript": "Tani from the u.s says we're a bunch of women \nwho meet once a week to study verses of the quran   books of knowledge etc some of the scholars say \nthat this is not permissible because we don't have   knowledge and hence this is dangerous; no this is \ntotally bogus you're not giving fatwas you're not reinventing the wheel rather you're \nreading a verse of the quran and the   tafseer of it or a hadith and the explanation of \nscholars so you're not shooting from the web from   from the hip you're not doing something from your \nown whims and desires rather you're reading what   the scholar said this is totally permissible \nand no without any problem in sha allah."
