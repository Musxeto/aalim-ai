  "transcript": "um she says a person repeatedly sins and does not feel remorseful and whenever he wants to ask allah for forgiveness he is not easy with that why simply because this is shaytan messing up with his head shaytaan is messing up with your head al-hasan al-basri was once sitting and his students came and said to him o abu muhammad we have a problem we sin and we repent and we sin and we repent again and we sin and we are ashamed of allah from how many times we had sinned he said to them for allah subhanallah this is all what shaytan wants from you seriously all what shaytaan wants from you is to be ashamed and refrain from repenting he said but rather than that whenever you sin repent because allah's beautiful name is attawab the one who frequently repents upon people who seeks his forgiveness so whenever you feel ashamed you don't run away from allah you run to allah and keep on repenting and asking for forgiveness"
