  "title": "Can we watch Cricket Football that have Cheerleaders Music, Awrah of players exposed Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says is it permissible to watch sports like Cricket football Etc where there is music and cheerleaders first of all the default is that it is not permissible to watch anything that includes Haram so in essence football Cricket basketball volleyball squash tennis all these sports are in essence Halal to practice if there is no Haram in it involved watching football if it includes listening to music or cheerleaders which I don't know where that could be because usually cheerleaders are associated with other sports such as basketball Etc hypothetically speaking if there were or any other Haram activities then watching football becomes Haram if someone says I will not listen to music there is no music in football there's only players running after a ball full of air and fighting over it so there is nothing Haram and such music or cheerleaders yes but is their exposure of aurat like the exposure of thighs the answer is most of the players cover their whole thigh with these leggings or with these warm-up suits or whatever and then they wear their shorts on top of that so usually it's not exposed if this is the case and if it is once every blue moon there is no problem in watching it inshallah Cricket there's no problem in watching it because they're decently dressed I don't know I haven't seen any of these matches but usually I don't think there is uh any uh Haram activities such as music or cheerleaders or their likes but is the time of a Muslim that cheap to be wasted on such things you know the steps of shaytan are one by one so he's pulling your legs so you spend 10 minutes watching a clip a couple of weeks later it's half an hour a couple of weeks later it's the full match cricket matches take what four hours five hours I don't know and it becomes an obsession I've heard people spending three four hours till before Fajr and missing Fajr prayer because of the U.S open or tennis tournament and it's even worse when grown-up men watch women playing sports and talking casually about it oh this player is better than that player or this Tunisian Arab woman was almost going to win in Wimbledon you're talking as if it's okay there's nothing Haram where is Islam in all of this is Allah pleased with what you're doing and talking about openly definitely this is all part of the steps of shaytan that we are so indulged in we don't pay any attention so we go back to the basics ideally as a Muslim I do not encourage you to watch football or Cricket or whatever go and practice it go and play be a sportsman be an athlete be someone who's active sitting on your backside watching for two three hours people playing sports and exerting effort and after you finish and eating popcorn and soft drinks you go and have a shower because you sweat a lot this is not logical and it's inappropriate for a Muslim this time if it was dedicated to reading the Quran to prayer to learning your religion in six months time you would have been in my seat giving fat to us um"
