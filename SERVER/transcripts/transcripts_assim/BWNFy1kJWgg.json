  "transcript": "the chapter that deals with the appearing of white hair of the Prophet asked an Malik may Allah be pleased with him did the prophet Alat wasam die his hair anas replied he did not get to that meaning the white hair the grayish hair did not reach that amount where he would have to dye it rather that the prophet Alat wasam um did not get to that for he was gr only in the hair covering his temples this is the area that reached the gray stage in the prophet's ha but Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him he dyed his hair with h and a herbal mixture called Al what is h h is also a form of Plantation a form of plant that when used gives a red color to your hair and beard and so many people they call them H artist would use it to Adorn women's Hands by tattooing them tempor arily that usually stays for a week or two maybe a little bit more so this when used on your hair gives it a reddish uh color Alam is a herbal mixture or a plantation that is ranging between black and red so when you mix the two together it gives this light black brownish and reddish which resembles normal hair and would not not look so distinctive so Anna says that the prophet did not dye his hair period Abu Bakr did and we will get to know from the following hadiths that this is not that accurate the second Hadith and may Allah be pleased with him said that he counted on the head of the Prophet Alat wasam and his beard he counted only 14 white hairs now jab samur may Allah be pleased with him when asked about the gray hair of the Prophet Alat wasam he said when he oiled his head no grayness was visible and when he did not apply oil some was visible so now it depends on what the prophet sallallah alh wasallam applied on his hair whether he used oil to calm his hair and beard then because of this oil the white strands got a bit darker so you would not see any such gray hair abdah Omar may Allah be pleased with him says that the prophet's gray hair were about 20 white hairs 14 in a narration of anas Abdullah says there were about 20b Abbas said Abu Bakr said alai wasallam to the prophet Abu Bak may Allah be pleas with him said to the prophet Alat wasam oh messenger of Allah you have great meaning we can see gray hair on your head the prophet said I have been made gray haired by the Surah of hood the Calamity of Al and theah of and theah of and theah of why is that Scholars say because such suras they include a lot of description of the day of judgment the torment of the previous Nations before us and when the prophet Sall alaihi wasallam read these suras he got affected by it he was frightened by the mentioning of what will happen on the day of judgment and this caused him to have such gray hair sallallahu alaihi wasallam Abu says the companions of the Prophet Alat wasam said to him oh messenger of Allah we notice that you have turned gray and he said the Surah of Hud and its sisters have caused me to turn gray so it's the same uh concept and fact proving that the prophet Sall wasallam got uh this grayish hair now Abu Ram uh uh says that he came to the prophet Alat with a son of his and the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam said to him when he showed him his son he said to him this is Allah's prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam he was wearing two green garments and he has hair that is topped with greyness and its greyness is reddish so the son is describing the prophet Alat wasam that his father showed him to him so he said that he was wearing these two green garments and his hair had gray in it but this grayish hair was reddish what would that be from well Scholars said that this is due to the prophet using dye on his hair which was denied by anas and he said no the prophet never died yet the other hadiths confirm that as we will see later on inshallah and finally sakb har says that ja Sam was asked was there any greatness of the Prophet Alat was there any greatness of the head of Allah sallallahu alai wasallam and he replied there was no greatness on the head of the Prophet Alat except some hairs in the part of his hair when he applied oil and oil uh made them visible as was mentioned earlier"
