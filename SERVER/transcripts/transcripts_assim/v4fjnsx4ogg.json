  "title": "The conditions for shortening the prayer while traveling - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he just want some clarification what are the conditions okay of somebody shortening a prayer on a journey so but he's asking more what warrants a person to shorten the prayer because many people say you allowed to shorten a prayer for journey for certain mileage he writes down here but he says is it actually mileage or did you actually a journey any kind of journey the authentic opinion of scholars is that if you are traveling you may take what traveling permits you to take and do such as breaking the fast and shortening the prayer and joining the prayers but this depends on traveling so if a person travels 150 kilometers every day one way and goes back 150 kilometers again then this is considered to be travelling but if he commutes daily this distance to go to his work this is not considered to be travelling because when someone calls him at the house they would not say well he traveled to so and so they would say he went to work he's going to come back at six o'clock so it's not the distance it is the name of the journey itself is it for fun or is it for travelling is it for work or is it for traveling as for the period again some scholars say four days some say eleven some say 19 some make it indefinitely and the most closest opinion to all inshallah that would join all of this is that if you travel and you don't know when you're coming back or you know when you're coming back you coming back after a year or two but you need the first two weeks three weeks two months to settle down until you get an apartment and then this city you have traveled to becomes as if it's your own city you're accustomed to the prayer times and and and and accustomed to go into the message and you know the locations and you don't consider yourself to be traveling then inshallah at that time you may pray the full prayers"
