  "title": "Can we buy a house on Islamic financing due to necessity if late fee is given to charity in USA?",
  "transcript": "Abu Muhammad maybe from the U.S? yes sir, sir I'm calling from \nthe U.S and my question is   it Halal to buy a house through the Islamic \nFinance through here in the United States   and is [ ] through the independent Sharia \nthe board they approve it, my question is   they taken a late fee of fifty dollars \nand this $50 go through [ ] to the Zakat.   Now my question is, my situation is, I have \nfour kids before and I live in apartments. Now   I have six kids and they're trying to take me out \nbecause we're not allowed to live with six kids   in the apartments. And I have another situation. \nMy daughter, she's autistic, she's autism and now   she's getting worse. And she scream and yell and \nthey call the cops and they keep sending me papers   warning and they want me to leave. And I try \neverywhere to rent, nobody can rent me with six   kids and me and my wife, that's eight people. And \nI try so hard. The only solution I have is to buy   a house through the Islamic finance here in United \nStates before I can live, me and my family and my   autistic kids in peace. If you can tell me if this \nis halal or haram because we're trying so hard and   we knock everybody door and we ask everybody to \nhelp us. No one help us except we find the way of   the Islamic finance, they can help us. Okay, Akhi \nAbu Muhammad, I sympathize with your situation.   Nevertheless, you know that when a person gives \nan Islamic verdict, he tries his level best not   to make himself a bridge over hellfire where \npeople would cross over to safety while he   himself burns in hell. That wouldn't be logical. \nSo I wouldn't try my best to make things easy   and soft for you just because I sympathize \nwith you. It's a very long topic that needs   thorough discussion, but we don't have the time to \ndo that on a live program. So I'll give you hints.   Not every Islamic institution, whether in Saudi \nArabia or in Kuwait or in America or Europe,   are Islamic. And not every Shariah board is \nto be trusted. We have to look into their   details and policies and procedures in order \nto know whether this is in accordance to Islam   or not. The issue of late payment fee, the most \nauthentic opinion is that this is riba. Whether   they give it to zakat sources or give it to the \npoor or give it to a third party, still it is   a profit occurring on a loan. \nHaving said that, in your case,   if you, as you claim, are always threatened to \nbe vacated from your apartment and you won't find   any other place to take you in with your six kids, \nwhich is highly doubtful to my own understanding,   but let's presume you're telling the truth. \nThis is something between you and Allah.   If this is the case and you are stuck between \na rock and a hard place and there's no other   alternative except to go to these so-called \nIslamic financing companies and they have   approved fatwas on their transactions from \na trusted Sharia board that is independent,   that is not taking yearly bonuses and it's not \non their payroll and they're known for their   knowledge and for their piety and that fear Allah \nAzza Wajal. If this is all correct and valid,   and the only exception is the late payment fee, do \nyour level best not to be late and always pay on   time so that you can avoid this and In Sha Allah \nyou can go ahead with it and Allah knows best."
