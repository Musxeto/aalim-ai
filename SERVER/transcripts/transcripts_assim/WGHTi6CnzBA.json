  "title": "Am I accountable if someone utters words of kufr? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "so um the brother's question is clear if a kafir says a word of kufur well if a muslim says a word of kufur will i be held accountable for it the answer is no if you can rectify it with diplomacy and there is benefit from that you should a kafir is a kafir so if he says jesus christ or holy than a swear word which is inappropriate of being holy so if you try to rectify it that would be illogical because the guy is a full-fledged kafir so you should not focus on small things and leave the big things this is already kufur in his side you're not held accountable for it for that if a muslim says for example jesus christ i remember once i was in spain with a brother who was a born muslim but was brought up in england and in a catholic uh school unfortunately like many muslims and one of our colleagues fell on the ground so the brother he was a teenager a young boy said bismillah i said what are you doing he said what so what is this i said i don't know i see them do it and i do it subhan allah so in his case this is not kufur on my side because i didn't do it i didn't endorse it i did not approve of it so there is no cover on your side insha allah"
