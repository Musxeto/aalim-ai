  "title": "Remove & dispose interest amount from Halal bank account? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh Asmat says I have a bank account in India that earns interest and a bank account in Saudi Arabia that does not can I deduct money from the Saudi account that is equivalent to the interest amount in the Indian bank and give it to Muslim charity in Saudi Arabia or must it be removed from the interest from the Indian Bank the answer is no alhamdulillah the money itself belongs to you whether here or in India and as it is normal for the banks in India to forcefully give you interest over your deposits this interest is Haram so whether you take it physically from the Indian Banks or take what is equivalent to it from any other source of income of yours whether from a bank or from your savings under the mattress or whatever there's no problem in that because what counts is that you took the Haram amount equivalent to it and cleansed your wealth from it and this is what counts and Allah Knows Best"
