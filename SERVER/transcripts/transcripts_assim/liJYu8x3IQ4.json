  "transcript": "nasheem from philippines he says what's the ruling on a practice that a lot of the muslims in his country and elsewhere do where in weddings they tend to take photos of the bride of women they take video uh clips they shoot the whole thing with their adornment with their makeup with the beauty with the dancing and they have background music so there's music being played this is an islamic this is totally prohibited in islam any man with an ounce of jealousy would not allow his daughter sister or wife to be filmed they would not want me to look at them as beautiful as they are in a wedding night this is against human nature men who walk next to their women when they're fully dressed in um revealing clothes putting makeups false eyelashes wearing their hair in a certain way and they walk like a peacock proud of their misses and people are looking at her for free enjoying what they see and maybe taking pictures of her and they don't have any remorse such people are not men when you don't have this jealousy in you you're not a proper muslim let alone a man no man would allow this and you'll be shocked about how many so-called males exist in the world if you go to beaches and you see women in their bikinis what is this and their men are fine with that they are fine because they don't have any shame they don't have any uh um shyness in their heart they're dead inside and this is why if her ex-boyfriend comes and hugs her and kisses her in front of him so yeah we're civilized it's okay it's a free country and if he takes her for dinner just to recap on old time's sake it's okay who knows maybe he gets lucky muslims are not like this muslims have honor have dignity because of their islam not because they are muslims by ethnicity because their religion teaches them to be men of pride women of bashfulness and shyness and this is why they are the best in societies when it comes to family relationships when it comes to kinship when it comes to respect etc and may allah rectify the affairs of all human beings"
