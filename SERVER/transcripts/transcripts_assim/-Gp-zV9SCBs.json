  "title": "There is no compulsion in religion, so why are is there punishment for apostasy?",
  "transcript": "Islam says no compulsion in Islam well is in religion why killing those who leave Islam okay that's a very logical question now is killing others justifiable this depends on where you're coming from if you're a Muslim you said yes this is a prescribed punishment if you're a Christian or a Jew you know that this is an eye for an eye a life for a life etc so yeah this is part of the divine religions now we come to no compulsion religion no compulsion in religion means that there is no hardship in religion Allah did not order us to do something that is beyond our ability Allah did not order us to fly or to walk on the water all that religion is easy for all human beings worldwide to practice and implement this is what is meant by let gravity there is no compulsion in religion there is no hardship in religion as for a penalty when a person rapes your sister tortures her and kills her if there is no compulsion in religion would you advocate for the death penalty or not definitely you say yes those who go around and sell our children drugs and make them addicted to meth to crack to marijuana these are people who spoil and corrupt the earth would you advocate in killing them because putting them in jail or finding them would only encourage them to engage more answer is yes in religion as a Muslim Allah is the one who tells us to do or not to do so for you guys in the West freedom of speech is honored in Islam it is honored as well but without with boundaries when you come and say that it's part of my freedom of speech to slander your mother to say trash about your sister and daughter we say hey wait you will be flogged 80 lashes because this is not acceptable and not permissible in Islam so in Islam it is not up to you to embrace Islam and then a pasta sighs because we have rules and regulations you don't want to accept Islam from the beginning don't remain in your religion but to come and accept Islam and then leave Islam this is a crime that is the cardinal sin this is something that has to be punishable in Islam to protect Islam and the Muslims and throughout time they are a negligible percentage less than a percentage even those who reject Islam with the grace of Allah look at the Muslims the only country that may consider implementing execution for apostasy can be Saudi Arabia and Iran may be may be and this is Allah alum how it is implemented yet the fastest growing religion in the world is Islam what does this tell you people in Indonesia they can uh pasta sighs whenever they want no one would tell them that this is wrong or will put you in jail you change your religion to Christianity whatever no problem in that so this should not be something that deters you from think thinking of the whole big picture it's like someone saying I hate violence and I hate cutting people up so I'll not be a surgeon because I don't like blood look at the bigger picture helping people saving people's life etc and likewise in Islam this is what we have to do and I'm afraid that this brings us to the end of today's session"
