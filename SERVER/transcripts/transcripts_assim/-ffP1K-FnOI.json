  "transcript": "sandip y I am from India Hyderabad I'm a professional YouTuber and motorcyclist so my question is Hinduism has given to this world uh yoga for the fitness and ayura uh to cure some diseases and Vedas for the knowledge and I want to know what Islam or Quran gave to this world H uh vas for the knowledge V for knowledge Islam is Hindu yes uh maybe 1 2% 1 2% the programming towards righteousness medical benefits benefits glory be to Allah psychologist glory be to Allah we are submitting our will to God [Laughter] there is excess of blood flowing into the [Laughter] face sinuses

chemistry who's the father of chemistry chemistry father father founder of [Applause] chemistry chemistry father alcohol alcohol alcohol ofni alcohol yes evil spirits smallx dis comp modern medicine can you speak in English I know little I asked did you hear my talk yesterday on the Quran Global necessity did you hear it no okay so in that I've described how Quran is a must for the whole world Quran a science [Music] sence my normally scientifically actually he is not fluent with Udu to okay if you read the V it's mentioned in the v that the sun take circles around the earth I'm asking a question yeah no Earth is rotating around the Sun sorry the Earth is rotating around the Sun correct but your V says the opposite your V is saying that the sun is rotating revolving around the earth that means there a scientific error What do the Quran says Quran has got 6,326 verses out of which more than a thousand verses speak about science I've given a lecture Quran and modern science okay I'll go through that you should see it yes so if you heard that talk you'll see the guidance that the Quran has given in science in technology about how a human being should lead his life it is far V also has got I'm not saying we doesn't have but if you compare an apple to an Apple there's a word of a difference between the knowledge of the Quran and knowledge of fa I'm not telling you that V doesn't have fath has got some scientific facts V has got beautiful guidance but if you compare for example if you read a book of standard two and if you read a book of PhD both are correct but isn't the difference in guidance yes or no sorry H when you read a book of standard two and a book of PhD yeah both are correct but the difference of knowledge is chalk and cheese correct yes similarly even V has got good points I'm not saying no but the points in the Quran are far superior so almighty God Allah subhana ta'ala says in chapter number 13 verse number 38 and in every age we sent a revelation almighty God sent a book in every age by name only four are mentioned in the Quran Torah Zab in and the Quran Torah was given to Moses peace be upon him zabor was given to David peace be upon him injil was given to Jesus peace be upon him and Quran to the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him but besides this there were many other books name is not mentioned maybe maybe V also was the book of of God I'm not saying for sure maybe we don't know but all the books that came before the Quran they were meant for a particular time period and for a particular group of people so because they were meant for a particular time period and only for a particular group of people almighty God did not think it fit to preserve it but because the Quran is the last and final Revelation it was not sent only for the Muslims or the Arabs it was sent for the whole of humanity and almighty God preserved it and almighty God revealed the last edition of his Revelation when he knew that human beings were fit to accept it that's the reason as I told earlier the true concept of God is even in VI worship one God Don't Make Idol don't make a due to passage of times many things have been altered have got corrupted according to Swami vianda you heard of Swami vianda yes he said the present way there's only a small fraction available so all the Revelation before the Quran they have not been preserved but the last and final Revelation has been preserved all the messengers that came before Prophet Muhammad 25 are mentioned by name Adam Noah Moses Jesus Muhammad peace be upon them all but our beloved Prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam said there were 124,000 Messengers sent on the face of the Earth maybe Ram was a messenger of God maybe Krishna was a messenger I don't know but even if they were messengers of God they were only meant for those people and for that time because the message was time bound since Prophet Muhammad peace be upon him was the last and final Messenger as Quran says in chapter number 33 verse number 40 that Muhammad is not peace be upon Him Father of any of your sons but he's the messenger of Allah and the seed of the prophets and Allah is all knowing all white because he was the last and final messenger he was not sent only for the Muslims or the Arabs Allah says in the Quran Surah Amia chapter number 21 verse number 107 that we have sent thee not but as a mercy to all the world as a mercy to the whole of humanity as a mercy to all the creatures so Prophet Muhammad was not sent only for the Muslims or for the Arabs or for the pakistanis he was sent for the whole world for all the human beings it is the duty of us Muslims to convey the message to the non-muslims with love and hikma with wisdom if we do not do that we are to blame it's the duty of every Muslim that he conveys the message brother I love you thank you I love you too very good we may differ but I love you that the reason if you read if you hear my talks on concept of God in major world religion even the vaa and the Bible and the Quran says the same so to understand God you have to read the scriptures not follow someone who gets benefit from preaching the religion but many of times the people who preach for their own benefit let me twist and I've given a talk on similarities between Islam and Hinduism and if you do analysis and a study of the way and Quran and let us agree to follow what is common what is different we'll discuss tomorrow correct at least what is common between V and Quran let us follow today correct what is different we'll discuss tomorrow V says I quoted chapter number 32 verse number three of that God there is no image there is no statue there is no photograph there is no painting there is no port P it's clearly mentioned Brahma of Hinduism there is only one God not a second one not at all not at all not in the leement is the same thing what he mention in the Quran if you read the Hindu scriptures your scripture says that the antim Rishi the final messenger of God would be Prophet Muhammad there are so many Prophecies of Prophet Muhammad in the Hindu scriptures in the bhavisha purana in the Veda there's a purana called as Ki purana if you read Ki purana chapter number two verse number 5 7 11 15 it says that the antim Rishi his father's name will be Vishnu Yas Vishnu means god Yas means servant servant of God if you translate in Arabic it's Abdullah the name of the father of the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad was Abdullah it says that the mother's name will be sumati sumati in Sanskrit means Serenity peace in Arabic Amina the name of the last and final messenger Prophet Muhammad was Amina further it says that this last prophet would have four close Companions and we know prophet Muhammad peace be upon him at four companions the four K Rashid Abu Bakr umarz Usman Ali may Allah be peace with them all he will be born in the city of Peace of Makkah he'll be born in a tribe of the chief of that City and Prophet Muhammad was born in Makkah in the tribe of qures and the prophecy continues very long so when your book clearly says there's one God don't make images don't make Idols it says worship the last and final messenger Prophet so why don't we follow do you believe there's one God brother yes do you believe that God has got Idols can you make an idol of God there is no Idol for God very good so you believe there's one God and you believe that idol worship is wrong correct it's not wrong but I don't believe this is the perfect uh correct if you cannot make an idol of God then idol worship is also wrong now how can you make how can you limit God into an idol if the idol Falls it breaks correct if the idol Falls it breaks yes so can God break no so you do agree idol worship is wrong uh I don't agree but very good you don't agree no very good do you agree that Prophet Muhammad is the last and final messenger of God no I need to do research and and everything then I will I need to do research and everything so my request to you brother is because I love you that you should hear my video cassette on Prophet Muhammad in the Hindu scripture yes and here my talk similarities between Islam and Hinduism and inshallah I pray to Allah to give you guidance if you read the translation of the Quran that's my second request if you read the translation of the Quran in English the language you understand best you'll find the difference of chalk and cheese and I pray to almighty God to give you guidance inshallah thank Youk thank you very much thank you"
