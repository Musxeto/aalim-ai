  "title": "Why are you unwilling to forgive those who backbit you Sheikh? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Zaki from the UK. Zaki. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. So you used to say that you would forgive people whenever they said bad things about you. But recently you said that you wouldn't forgive them anymore. Okay. So what was the change? It's my right, is it not? Why is it eating people so bad? That they keep on insisting, Sheikh forgive us we back bit you, we slandered you, we said bad things in your back. In the past I used to forgive. Now I had a change of heart. It seems that people are utilizing this. And misusing it. So lots of the boys go around and say bad things about scholars. And they back bite and they enjoy their gatherings saying bad things about them. And then they feel remorseful and they come say, Sheikh forgive us. And the Sheikh as usual, I forgive everybody who did this. And they keep on doing this. No. If this is my right not to forgive, then this is my right. Why would I be prosecuted for that and taken to court? And I did not say persecuted. Persecuted is to be punished and tortured and tormented for your religious beliefs or for anything else worldly. Prosecuted is to be taken to court. And this is what I usually mean. Why would I be prosecuted for not wavering my right and say you're forgiven? You back bite me, you gotta pay for that. And Allah make it easy for all of us."
