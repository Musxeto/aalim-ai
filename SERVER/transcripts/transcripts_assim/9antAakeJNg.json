  "transcript": "Muhammad from the Philippines, \nHe says he doesn't find the zelf and the enthusiasm to pray and he \ndoesn't know what is causing this. Well akhi,   this is one of the ways of shaytan to \nblock you and prevent you from praying,   this feeling comes with time, you cannot go to \nthe gym, workout for like a couple of months   and then say I don't have Arnold Schwarzenegger's \nbiceps. Yeah Arnold Schwarzenegger took like 15   years to reach where he reached so you need time, \nyou need devotion, you need this push in you to   benefit and get the best of your prayer Anas \nibn Malik the companion of the Prophet ﷺ   had his best student and companion by the \nname of Thabit Al-Bunani if i recall correctly   and Thabit said about himself he's a tabi'i, \nhe said 'I struggled with prayer for 20 years'   What does that mean? It means that he's been \npraying for 20 years finding the same problem   you're finding Muhammad. (I'm not feeling it \nI'm not getting this connection it feels that   I'm doing the rituals as a robot I'm not getting \nthe benefits of it) he says 'But after 20 years of   struggling I started to enjoy it for the following \n20 years this is when you reach your peak   and it becomes in your system so it takes \ntime. What adds value to it, #1 to understand   the meaning of the things you're saying in salat \nwhen you say subhana rabbi Allah when you sami   Allahu liman hamida rabbana wa lakal hamd, What \ndoes that mean? When you recite the Fatiha what   does it mean this conversation Alhamdulillahi \nRabbil ‘aalameen, Allah says my servant has   praised Me there's a conversation between you \nand Allah so all of this adds a lot of value   when you know the beautiful names and attributes \nof Allah you get more khushu and contemplation   and submissiveness in your salat because of \nthat then it will come gradually bi'ithnillah"
