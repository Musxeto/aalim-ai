  "transcript": "thank you very much you're welcome okay before we go to the questions we have one final question from um uh um and she's saying that I know that we should not sleep on stomach but can we put our little children to sleep on the stomachs the prohibition from sleeping on the stomach is reported in a number of hadiths in Abu da and elsewhere where the Prophet said that this is the way that the people of Hell lie on the stomach in Fire and also in another Hadith that the prophet saw a lying on his stomach and he kicked him wake woke him up saying that this is a way of lying that Allah abhor Allah hates it so it depends on the scholars who looked in it IM alkari may Allah have mercy on his soul said that these hadiths are weak other Scholars such as Ahmed Shak and IM albani may Allah have mercy on their souls said that this is Hassan which is authentic so it is best and safer to be uh away from such uh a form of lying on uh when sleeping that is to lie on your stomach as for the children yes it is recommended at sometimes when they have gases and it's beneficial however a lot of the studies proved that a lot of fatalities and deaths among infants at at their early age takes place when take place when they are lying on their stomachs so they suffocate unfortunately Allah preserve all of our children and uh the Muslim children as well and it is also scientifically proven that when you sleep on your right hand side the food is digested 60 or 70 times uh 70% faster and better than when you lie on your left hand side so if it is for a short period of time for the gases and in that you look and uh and and take care of them and watch them carefully I hope insh it is halal but to have it as a habit and to keep it all the time no this is not uh recommended at all now moving on"
