  "transcript": "um abdullah from norway says there is an imam that exposes celebrities from somalia on social media now if the imam is doing this to warn the community from deviant and evil people this is permissible if i know that there is an xyz celebrity who is a blatant liar he is committing shirk he's calling people to innovation he's pretending to be a scholar or a daddy or a person of knowledge but he's teaching against quran and sunnah and i see the youth in the community are drawn into him not knowing his evil acts in this case i have to weigh the pros and cons if i see that in order to save the community or the masses or the people from such a deviant person if i see that the only way is to expose him not as a personal vendetta i'm not envious i'm not holding a grudge personally against this person rather i am simply warning them if i see you attempting to drink poison and i know that this is poisonous would i say hmm no it's not my business let bygones be bygones go to hell what i care would i be sinful of course i have to warn you and if you insist and attempt to drink it i have to stop you even by force because this is my duty as a brother in islam so if this imam is doing this then he's doing the right thing if not if this imam is doing it for political reasons he supports the shabab and the politician or the celebrity he is attacking is not he is doing something for a personal grudge against that celebrity he's envious that celebrity has more followers than him then he does in this case we have to be careful and by the way i've been having so many calls from uh sisters from norway and from denmark complaining about imams doing wrong things some of them are soothsayers some of them claim to know the future some of them cross all boundaries and sit with non-mahrams without any uh people being around being in seclusion with them an imam sitting with a foreign woman a rivert taking her in his car and going to places and this is not an imam and this may indicate that watch out from those who work as imams to do get the citizenship they would serve the disbelievers aims because their arabs or their refugees but they're appointed as an imam when they have no knowledge in islam when they are only there for financial gains not every person leading the prayer is to be trusted unless he's proven to be a righteous practicing brother who has knowledge and who walks the talk"
