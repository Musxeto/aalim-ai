  "title": "People doing nikah in masjid saying its sunnah & has barakah, true? (in haram mecca? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says these days it has become a trend that everyone is performing the nikah in the Masjid and they say it is a Sunnah is it true the answer is in order for us to label it as a Sunnah we have to have evidences that the prophet Allah did this or recommended this or approved it so if we look in the different and various Hadith we have in front of us we don't find any authentic Hadith stating such a thing and the biggest evidence is that all the prophets marriages did not take place in the Masjid also all of his companions marriages did not take place in the Masjid never ever we heard that the prophet Islam was in someone's house and this he said to them let's go to the Masjid to conduct the marriage contract so this means that marrying in the Masjid is a permissible Act not that it is part of the Sunnah and that you will be rewarded for it it's a permissible Act however if people wanted to upgrade this act and make it Sunnah or means of barakah and blessings of Allah then this falls under the category of innovation and this is similar to what a lot of the Muslims used to do in the past when they used to come from overseas and head to the Haram in Mecca to conduct their marriage contract some of them residing in Jeddah they say we have our marriage contract in Haram next week you're invited what's the reason said OS for Baraka it's a blessed marriage is this is that it is totally bogus and an innovation"
