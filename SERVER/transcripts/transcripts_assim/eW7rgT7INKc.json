  "title": "Assisting in sin when it comes to kids wearing Images on clothes or bedsheets? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Anas from Canada Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Can you hear me well? If I answered your Salam, I believe I do and I can. Yeah, so essentially it's regarding like kind of products with images of living things. So sometimes my kind of parents request me to put like bed sheets for my little sister in her bed which has like maybe drawings of Mickey, Minnie Mouse or sometimes to give her like milk with in the cup that has like cartoonic characters or sometimes even to just maybe fetch them like a bag or a jacket that for example a bag that might have the face like cartoonic face of a dog like when they want to go out or something. You have to distinguish Anas between grown-ups and kids. Children are permitted to play with dolls, aren't they? So they have statues but these statues are permissible for them and likewise if they were to play with other toys and the likes that may mimic the creation of Allah Azza Wa Jal. Fetching your sister a jacket that has a Mickey Mouse on it or a bag or a lunch box or the likes, you did not purchase these things. So you don't have any sin in bringing them. You can advise and say to them it's best not to wear such things for our children because they're not protected from shaitan and they don't have the immune system to save them from the jinn and the likes and by putting these images on them, they're most vulnerable and they're probably would be negatively affected by it. This is advisable, you can give such advice but you won't be sinful for moving product A from place A to B or for buying cereals that has a lion on it or a roaster or whatever. These are all negligible things and Allah knows best."
