  "title": "People say we don't have to wear masks because of hadith 'There's nothing that is contagious' Assim",
  "transcript": "the prophet says that there is no um contagiousness i don't know if this is the noun or not i'm just making it up there's no contagiousness there's nothing that is contagious now people say then we don't have to wear face masks and we don't have to uh social distance etc because there is no no no no this is your understanding because you do not understand an ayah without reading the whole quran and the whole of the sunnah of the prophet isaiah in order to understand it it's a package deal it's not a retail shop you have to buy wholesale so when we get a hadith like this does it mean okay if someone has hiv i'll take blood transfer from him was with with uh no problem of course not the prophet alaihistalato himself said run from the one with leprosy like you run from a lion so when you see a lion you don't stand in the face of the lion and greet it simply because you see its teeth thinking that it's smiling to you you run likewise the prophet says if you meet someone with leprosy and it is contagious run the prophet himself said as if you heard of a village a town struck by the plague do not enter it this is known as quarantine and if the plague hits a city or a town you are in do not exit it and then you say that there is no contagiousness this is your understanding so okay sheikh give us a break what's the understanding of it the true understanding is that you do not attribute getting sick to a person or to the means that may have gotten you sick may have infected you why because allah azzawajal is the controller of everything so when you say after catching a flu for example i said oh yeah yeah my cousin came yesterday he had the flu i caught it up from he infected me when you say that you are claiming that he is the one who caused the illness and this is not the case he may have been the means of the illness infecting you but he's not the one who infected you and this is why we say there's no contagiousness and the prophet alaihistalam gave a logical answer to this when a man said after hearing this hadith the same hadith is it prophet of allah i have a herd of camel and one camel comes into my heart and may infect others so the prophet said to him logically who infected the first one so the one who k that came with the infection with leprosy whatever disease it had and infected some of the herd who infected it originally where did it come from it was created by allah azzawajal the creator of everything in this universe so you don't say that this is what allah has preordained and i'll give you a second example and we have uh this is this was the last question so maybe we have a couple of callers or few questions pending because we have like four minutes left i'll give you another example now in a household you find that a three or four members suffer from a very bad sore throat or the flu and two or three are healthy and they're mixing nothing happened to them how is that possible in the same household you may find someone who was affected by corona virus covered 19 while his wife and children were not affected at all how is this possible this is what is meant by there is no contagion contagiousness it is from allah azzawajal who chooses that and allah knows uh best"
