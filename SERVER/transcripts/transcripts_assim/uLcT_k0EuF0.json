  "transcript": "sh I have watched your videos regarding memorizing and later forgetting the Quran but however I still have a doubt and the doubt is because of the Hadith in sahkari where the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam saw a man's face being crushed for forgetting the Quran could you clarify please to whom this Hadith refers to like who is the one who's being crushed there is no suchith Inari do you have the Hadith in front of you HUD I don't have a Hadith in front of me but it was the dream of prophet Sall yes I I know what you're referring to see the problem is that you guys go and depend on a translation of someone who may not be able to give you the right meaning and this is very dangerous the Hadith was referring to the prophet sallallahu alh alh wasallam seeing a man being asleep and another person holding a big boulder or a rock and crushing his head with it and the boulder rolls away the man goes and picks it up and comes back again when the man's head is fixed and he crushes it again it's not his face it's his head and when the prophet asked about who are these two men two men the the he was answered by the angel that this man used to overs sleep of the Quran not to forget it which refers that he memorized the Quran but he does not pray whether it's night prayer or fure prayer and he overs sleeps whether he doesn't implement it in his life so he knows that is har and he memorizes the verses yet he has a mortgage and he deals with RBA and with interest without any problem this is what the Hadith was referring to and Allah Knows Best"
