  "transcript": "abdul from canada? uh i have a question regarding \nshortening the salah so i am a geologist and due   to my work i travel two weeks to a camp that is \nmaybe 400 kilometers from where i live and then   i spend two weeks there and then i come back home \nfor one week and then that's how my schedule is,   so i was wondering while i am at camp do i shorten \nmy salah or do i not shorten my salah? Sheikh: The   camp is fixed in one place or it moves from one \nplace to the other? Abdul: uh it would be fixed   throughout my contract. Sheikh: okay and you would \nhave your own room that you settled in? Abdul:   yes i have a room that i share with someone but \ni can i pray and so far from my last shedule   like week that i was working i was praying in my \nroom. Sheikh: yeah but i mean it is your fixed   room room number 205 for example this is your \nfixed room so you go back home for a week or two   you come you find your room your clothes your \nthings? Abdul: uh no when i come back depending   if someone that i switched my rotation with \nis in the room i might be in a different room   with different roommates. Sheikh: okay, i will \nanswer you inshallah. The rule of thumb is that   whenever a person leaves his \nhometown's border or city limits   on a journey and 400 kilometers is a distance \nof a journey, then this person is labeled and   classified as a \"traveler\" anyone who calls \nhome hi where's daddy? oh daddy's traveling   where at? well he went to this camp. this \ncity, this village, this town, whatever so   you are classified as traveling you pack your \nbags and you say the dua of traveling and you   bid your family farewell. Now the issue \nis if a person who is in such a situation   reaches his destination which is 400 kilometers \naway and it's a camp in the middle of the desert   or in the mountains, in canada i don't think \nyou have deserts so what is the situation   this guy is still a traveler he hasn't \nsettled down he hasn't put his p.o box to be   there and he is commuting until the project or \nthe assignment is over so he is still labeled as   a \"traveler\" and he may shorten his prayers and \nhe may combine if there is a necessity for that.   When is it that shortening prayer ends \nfor him? The most authentic opinion is   that he does not shorten once he settles. What do \nyou mean by he 'settles'? If i work in a in a city   and every couple of weeks i go for the \nweekend to my wife and kids and my family   in my hometown and then i travel for another \ntwo weeks or three and i have a house there   and i am settled there and i work there now \nthis i wouldn't be considered to be traveling   my hometown i have to pray full prayers \nand i cannot combine but when i go to this   new location location b which is actually where i \nwork and i may stay a lot of the month sometimes   more than what i spend in my hometown in \nthis case i'm also had settled in that   b location in the second location which means \nthat i can only shorten when i travel between   these two cities or two locations once i \nreach my workplace then i have to pray normal   why because now i'm settled i have my house i know \nthe times of prayers i go to work i sleep i nap i   do it's like my home i'm settled unlike someone \nwho goes to a camp and the camp is in the desert   and he doesn't have a fixed place and he moves \nfrom one room to the other depending on the need   and he knows that this is a project \nthat will soon end and then he will   be relocated somewhere else that would \nbe a traveler and Allah azza knows best"
