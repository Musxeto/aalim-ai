  "title": "Making dua or dhikr in the heart or mind, is moving lips a must? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Radha from Saudi Islamic computer sample avocado better I needed to ask you about the zipper and the recitation of Quran which you explained that we we should recite it with the tongue that is mandatory but what about if we are a praying from Allah like we are sitting in a gathering but our heart is talking with him like we are talking with Allah in our heart we are praying about something is it necessary to use the tongue at that time sometimes we are like not in a mood of like just this is between me and Allah so somebody told me that the angels will not be able to hear that I don't understand the idea that if I am talking to Allah in my heart how is it possible that he is not able to hear that he is not able to listen my duaa okay did you understand that point any more questions no thank you so much you're welcome so sister Haga question is clear we always emphasize on the importance on the obligation of moving your lips when you are reciting the Quran when you are making duaa when you are making vicar so if I want to say subhanAllah it's not sufficient to run it in my mind when I want something from Allah oh Allah make this thing happen facilitate for me to buy this car and I keep on saying in my heart without making duaa she says it's not logical if the angels are unable to listen to it which is doubtful because the angels are giving the capability of knowing what goes in our minds from Allah then Allah Himself knows what we are saying and doing and acting upon so why do I have to move my lips or move my tongue the least when making Vicker when reciting in the Quran why isn't it sufficient to just keep my lips sealed and do and say whatever I want now radda logic does not apply to the rulings of Islam in the sense that your logic is different than mine my logic is different than someone in France or something someone in the US or someone in Japan each one has his own upbringing and his own logic but what does not change is the Quran in the Sunnah so we have to refer back to them and know what is going on maybe it would make it clearer to you if I ask you this question Radha if my lips are sealed and I'm thinking negative thoughts of non muharram women fantasizing thinking of how it is to drink intoxicants or to smoke a joint and get high thinking of how will I conceal if I steal someone's money and become rich how can i conceal it and how can I hide it income of logit would i be sinful for that the answer is no allah almighty has forgiven for the humans for the followers of mohammed ali in salat wa salam whatever goes in their minds as long as they do not speak about it or act upon it so if this is the case and this is the grace of allah azza wajal not to hold us accountable for what we do the last three ayahs of surat al-baqara talks about this issue that allah says to the believers if you express what's inside of you the thoughts if you press them or keep them concealed Allah will hold you accountable for that the Companions came to the prophet sallallaahu and said o prophet of Allah had prayer zakat fasting even jihad we can cope up with that and we can do that without any problem but this ayah to be held accountable for what we conceal of our own thoughts this is uncontrollable so the Prophet told them at is a son do you want to say like the Jews we hear and disobey say we hear and we obey so they said that immediately and acknowledged it on the spot and Allah revealed the last ayah of surah al-baqarah where it abrogates the ruling and Allah forgives the thoughts that we think of likewise if you think positively without moving your lips this would be like scanning a page of the Quran in your mind or reading something with your eyes only without uttering it the scholars say that this does not count and you will not be rewarded for it and it does not suffice so if I recite the Quran in my heart with my seals with my lips sealed this doesn't count and my prayer is invalid so I hope this analogy makes things a bit clearer for you"
