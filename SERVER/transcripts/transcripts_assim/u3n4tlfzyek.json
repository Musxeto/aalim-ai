  "title": "Is Ramadan divided into 3 parts: Mercy, Forgiveness & Freedom from Hellfire? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] some chair a hadith which is quite famous everytime Ramadhan approaches and in this hadith Ramadhan is divided into three parts the hadith goes as follows this is a month the first part of which brings a las merci the middle which brings a lot forgiveness and the last part of which brings forgiveness and it from Hellfire now this hadith is not authentic having said that we have to be careful so that we don't paint all with the same brush what does that mean in regards to weak hadith it is different than fabricated hadith or baseless hadith the weak hadith some scholars would adopt it more than those who implement their own logic so we have two schools Madras at RIE it is the school of intellect of logic which is known to be led by Imam Abu Hanifah and there is the madrasa true LF L which is the school that relates and depends entirely on the hadith the Sunnah or the hadith of the tabi rain or the hadith of the tabata being so when it comes to an issue that there is no authentic hadith on it the school of Allah ie the people of logic and intellect they improvise they say ok there's no crown there's notion so we think that the closest opinion to be authentic is this and they come up with an opinion of their own logically and out of their own intellect the other schools say there is no evidence from the Quran no authentic hadith however a weak hadith to us is more preferable than the opinion of our own whims and desires and intellect and logic so these are two different schools we cannot say that these are wrong and these are right or the opposite because a weak hadith to some scholars is not to be mentioned and this is what I am inclined to and this is opinion of Cheryl Bernie as well before me and a number of good high-ranking scholars why because Allah as social has revealed the Quran and the Sunnah and pledged to up to protect them to preserve them both Quran asana so when we come nowadays and say this is a weak hadith but we will implement it and apply it this goes against a lot preservation of the Quran the Sunnah so we cannot insert it nevertheless we accept what some scholars say and we honor what they say not necessarily that we agree with them but we accept it in the sense they say that when another one a week hadith comes to us if it doesn't speak about the Quran if it doesn't speak about halal and Haram if it doesn't speak about things of the unseen of Jenna of NAR of Day of Judgment something that relates to our Ikeda but it is in the virtue of a particular vicar a particular robada so they say that we can be a bit lenient in that this is their opinion and they say that there is no much harm done because the hadith is weak it's not false totally or fabricated this week one of the narrators might have missed something forgot something his books were burned so he was reading from memory etc so this is their opinion we accept this but or rather we honored it but we do not necessarily implement it so when we come to the hadith I wonder whom Olivia also tomorrow at 1 min and not one third is forgiveness with the second the middle third is mercy and the third is setting of away from Hellfire this Halle this week so we do not implement it because there is another hadith where the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam in every night of ramadan allah has a portion of his servants set free from Hellfire and this hadith says that only in the last third now we've agreed that the last third of Ramadan has great importance because it includes leg little Adam and lailatul Kadir is the night of decree the Quran was revealed in it and also the destiny of the whole universe is planned and decreed in it and we have two types of destiny the first type was preordained was rewritten 50 thousand years before Allah created the universe in the authentic hadith Allah so gel when he created the pen he said to the pen right so the pen said what should I write my lord so Allah said write the destiny of all of the creation until the day of judgement the Prophet said eraser Sam this incident was fifty thousand years before Allah created the creation so whatever is written this is written in the preserved tablet in Allah Allah helmet fool no one knows what's in it except Allah OSHA there is an annual destiny where allah azza wajal on the night of decree lailatul other orders the angels and they write the destiny of the creation there is their provision when they die when they are born for the next year unlike what people say and believe that this is done on the 15th of Shaban i think they call it shall be bharat something like that I don't know Anna speak or do something like that similar so they think that the 15th of Shaban is the night where Allah social divides the risk for people and some of them innovate by praying night prayer salat attesa be they do a lot of Vicker which is innovated all of this is innovation neither the Prophet had done it is awesome nor the companions may allah be pleased with them nor the Tiberian one would say ok they didn't do it so what's wrong in us doing it ah be careful the Prophet said that is awesome whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it it is rejected so all what you will do it will be rejected and thrown back into your face what bigger sin is there if you think that you know better than the prophet alayhi salatu salam I'm telling you he did not do it and you say ok no problem I'll do it subhanAllah is it part of Islam he says yeah what's what's wrong in that should know it's not part of Islam Allah said in Hajj it'll wither in the farewell hedge Aloma Akmal Tilikum Dina come today I have completed your religion so if the religion was complete at the time of the Prophet a little Absalom and you are coming today and saying yeah I know the Prophet didn't do it but I'm doing it because it's good either it is part of the religion or is smart if it's not part of the religion then this is an innovation and you are in serious trouble so this is misconception of people thinking that things are decreed on the 15th of Shaban it is decreed on Leila to powder the night of Destiny so the last 10 nights are blessed nights but to specify and say that setting off an out of Hellfire is done only in these last 10 nights this is not true and the hadith is not authentic [Music] [Applause]"
