  "title": "Sold item for a friend at a higher price, can I keep the profit I made & the commission he gives me?",
  "transcript": "Emraan says if a friend gives me something to sell on his behalf and he gives me a specific amount to sell it for so is it permissible if I add some amount on the price and I give him his amount and keep the rest without informing him but after the deal is over he may give me some appreciation fee not knowing I had already taken some profits can I take that as well this is a question that a lot of the Muslims ask about this is greed and whenever greed gets involved in our minds and in our transactions we're bound to lose and I always tell brothers and sisters that when someone comes to me and convinces me of a project and of the high return of such a project I usually get greedy and invest only to lose all what I've invested in a few months time why I did my due diligence I looked into the investment yes but I was greedy had I known better I would have taken my time I would have taken guarantees I would have ensured that the process was monitored to avoid any abuse but greed comes in it it raises everything high risk high profit they say well usually it's high risk high loss rather than high profit so now most people whenever they do something for others did want to make a buck out of that the transaction first of all has to be analyzed when your friend gives you a product to sell are you one a partner so the money is from him the work is from you and you split the profit according to the percentage you agree upon - are you an agent meaning that you're selling it for him and he's giving you a fixed commission whether it's you like someone working for him so you're not an agent per se rather than you are an employee of him take this sell it and at the end of the day I'll give you X amount of money or are you a good friend a good Samaritan so you're just doing it as a favor for him now you have to analyze this because then you can tell whether what you're taking from him is halal or Haram if you are a partner this means that it is laid down on the table from the very beginning take this and sell it okay this is the capital of our company and I'm the one doing the marketing whatever profit we get it has to be 80 20 50 50 30 70 whatever percentage we decide agreed he says agreed go ahead but you're not a partner okay am I an employee or an agent selling it on his behalf and he's given me a fixed amount of money for my work there is no there's no agreement so am i a good friend of his doing it for his sake not charging a penny this is what he's convinced of and now you're cheating him and acting behind his back there's a fourth category which is you are the owner of the merchandise so it tells you I'd like a hundred euros for this this is with my profit you say okay I'll buy it from you and you give him the hundred or you consider it as alone but he sold it to you you take it and you market it and you maybe sell it for five hundred dollars three hundred two hundred euros whatever he has no right to complain and say wow you made so much money give me more he sold it to you for a hundred euro that's it this is the end of it whatever you do with it it's up to you so which one is it definitely it is number three you are doing it as a favor so you cannot make money out of him this is cheating and lying it is like me going to Europe on a business trip and someone shows me something listen I need this perfume and body lotion and hand Jill for example woah this is expensive yeah I need I need you to buy this for me please said yeah sure okay I go and buy it for 100 euros I go back to him and said here you are it costs 120 euros and the guy gives me a hundred twenty years thinking that this is what I bought it for now if he were to know that I made twenty euros profit off him probably he would never speak to me again in his life why I paid for the taxi I paid for my time which I took Ana spent and wasted for him no problem tell him this ahead of time or tell him this before you give him the merchandise so when he tells you buy me this said no problem but listen I'll charge twenty percent my fee for whatever I buy you if he says done deal hamdulillah you now become an agent or an employee for him but if he says no this is a lot I don't need this okay end of story but to go behind his back and make profit without his knowledge this is totally Haram and unfortunately a lot of the Muslims are doing this thinking that this is their god-given right no it's not people are asking you to buy things or to sell things for them thinking well of you thinking that of you as a friend and that you're doing it for the sake of their friendship not to make money out of us tell them ahead in the beginning that you will be charging this or that and then if they agree then it becomes halal for you insha'Allah"
