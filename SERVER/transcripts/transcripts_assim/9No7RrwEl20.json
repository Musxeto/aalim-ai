  "title": "How many hours did the Prophetï·º sleep? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Heena she says how many hours did the prophet erase salatu salam sleep in general i don't know but if you look roughly you would assume that he used to sleep between three to maximum five hours in total the Prophet rarely slept except at night and only for a couple of hours maybe a little bit less a little bit more but that was it so we don't have clear record of the hours that he used to sleep sallallaahu anywho I do sell them and people differ from one person to the other moderation and balance is important"
