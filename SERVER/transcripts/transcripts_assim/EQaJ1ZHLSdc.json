  "transcript": "Yunus from India Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu I hope your health is good Sheikh Alhamdulillah Rabbil Alameen Sheikh I always being asked by some non-Muslim Sheikh that what would be the first priority to me being an Indian or being a Muslim I would answer to them that it is like asking whether I am a person of 5 feet 8 inches or a man who has weight 70 kg you are asking to select features of mine so I am both is it correct answer Sheikh? No it's not correct because we are Muslims by choice and by default as for our nationality this is a piece of paper we can toss it and throw it in the garbage you can go to any other country and pick up a different nationality so there is no nothing binding us to a piece of land or to a flag or to a nationality our priority our origin is Islam and we are proud to be Muslims yes if you belong to another country and you love your country you say I am a Muslim first and I am an Indian second or a Pakistani or a British or an American but my priority is always Islam so if my country says right or left and Islam says otherwise what will you follow definitely Islam without any hesitation and Allah Azzawajal knows best"
