  "title": "What is meant by \"Kill the disbelievers\", in Surah Tawbah? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay they also some say that you have that verse in the Quran in Surah that to kill the kafir or the kafiron but actually behind that verse there is a context yeah because of there may be some agreement by the prophet and the qurais and after a few months or after some certain condition uh the the force is there because they broke the agreement right correct can you please clarify that this verse they're referring to is one in thousands of different verses of the Quran it's in chapter 9 in the very beginning it's talking about a conflict between the Muslims and the idol worshipers that had been going on for 20 years or so yes and they have killed a lot of the Muslims they have oppressed them they have confiscated their wealth their houses their property and they forced them to migrate and live their own Hometown to other countries so Allah tells us or tell them that there shall be a truce and a treaty for a period of time yes a certain period yes four months period yes after this truce whenever you find them kill them so this is not for any Muslim yes to kill any disbeliever because even at the time of the Prophet peace be upon him in Medina after this verse was mentioned there were Jews living there were Christians living there were idle worshipers living but they did not fight Islam or show and express animosity against the Muslims that verse is on a specific or for a specific condition a people in certain conditions yes thank you so much"
