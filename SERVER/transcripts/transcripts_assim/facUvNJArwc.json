  "title": "Before going to Hajj they do celebration and do send off",
  "transcript": "saying that it's a custom that whenever a person is going for Hajj they throw up a throw a party for him where they gather and eat and congratulate him because in some countries hatch is the journey of a lifetime they required to say for 20-30 years to come it's difficult it takes two to three months and people may not come back because back then it was difficult to travel so the custom continued that they would give a farewell party to this person going for Hajj and they would make dua for him or ask him to make dua etc in general throwing a party is permissible but when connecting it to Hajj for going to hatch this is something that is dubious I would not say it's Haram because this is not related to religion in the sense that it's a religious party it's just a celebration it's just honoring the person before he leaves so it's a farewell party in a sense however connecting it with hatch makes it a bit dubious and when it comes to the issue of making congregational dua or having a certain ritual attached to it as they do in some countries in this case it becomes an innovation so if it's just a party the man is traveling next week with we're gathering together his friends and relatives and preparing some food and that is it they get along and mashallah yanny a gather there's no problem in that but the problem is when thinking that this is a must or recommended when thinking that it is a prerequisite for Hajj when thinking that the do√≠s is also part of the deen in that occasion he said"
