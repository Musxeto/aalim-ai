  "transcript": "um when we wipe our ears in woodo do we have to use our index fingers and or thumb or can we use any fingers in order to be valid the Sunnah as the scholars describe is to insert your index fingers partially in your ears and having the thumbs at the back of your ears and you do this once so if there is another reason for inserting any other finger there's no problem in that but this is not part of the Sunnah and Allah Knows Best Yet your wiping would be still considered to be valid"
