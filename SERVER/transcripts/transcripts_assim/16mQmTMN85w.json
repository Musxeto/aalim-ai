  "transcript": "Alima from France. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. Yes, I thank you very much for everything. My question is, I know that Allah hates Muslims to tell others their sins, even the sheikhs, the imams. So before Allah guides and forgives us, what we can we can repent on our own without telling others? By contacting a lawyer for example. Is this permissible? What kind of sins that you need to repent from in order to contact a lawyer? Is it something legal? No sir, it's not legal. So why do you need to talk to a lawyer? For example, maybe I should just take a step by trying to repent to Allah Azza Wa Jal since he's affecting my situation and I don't know what to do sir. No, no, no. If the sin is related to something that you are afraid that may impact your residency, your work, and you need to contact a lawyer to get the legal verdict from it, yes this is permissible and this is not exposing your sin. But if there is no legal need for it, and this is between you and Allah, and no one can have any say about your sin impacting your citizenship, or staying in the country, or PR, or your job, then you must not disclose it to anyone."
