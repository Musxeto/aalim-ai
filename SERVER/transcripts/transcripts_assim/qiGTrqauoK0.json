  "transcript": "uh namira from georgia uh so uh i know about uh this uh salam transactions uh in which uh like uh you give a specific uh day for the delivery and all that but uh what i'm not sure is like is that do like do you do that for goods which you have it in your position or like is it for goods which you do not have it in a position and uh like so i ordered address and it came but they didn't deliver it due to some reason uh on the day which she was supposed to deliver so now i'm not sure whether it comes under under such transactions and is the transaction valid okay namira from georgia she says in regard of bayer salem selem transactions which we usually give as an alternative for shop uh drop shipping so she says that she bought something namira it's okay if you bought something you paid them the money they told you they'll deliver it on the 20th of august and they didn't deliver it except maybe on the 30th of august there's no problem on you because you're on the buying end there's no problem in that insha allah as long as you give your consent the issue is for the seller and when we say that the conditions of salem is one to have a clear description of the item that is beyond ambiguity to to pay the full amount up front free to give a date of delivery the date of delivery is approximate so give or take a week or two no problem the problem is when i say i'm gonna sell you my uh crops next winter and next winter is like three or four months that that doesn't work you have to give a specific week in the month of so and so so that i could not fall into ambiguity waiting for something that would not come except after a few months as for you there's no problem now her question again related is it transaction of sedum regarding products that you possess the answer is no it is regarding products that are not produced yet in in terms of crops and fruits and vegetables they're not planted yet or regarding things that i will buy or manufacture or obtain later on"
