  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Italy the question is we know   that it is sunnah to recite Quran from \ncover to cover at least once in a month   what if I have time maybe I finish it around 20 \ndays or 17 days and I will ... for the next month   so that acceptable for us to read it day by \nday or is it allowed to read it at least one   month anytime you have time okay so basically \nspeaking about abdulrahman is asking about   the Sunnah of finishing the Quran once a \nmonth so he says if I finished in 20 days   should I sit back and chill for 10 days \nwithout doing anything of course not   the Sunnah is to complete the Quran once a month \nin the sense that every night a Muslim has to have   a portion of the Quran known as wird he has to \nhave a wird that he maintains every night and if   he oversleeps like sometimes the prophet did \nhe would make up his wird during the daytime   between Fajr and Dhuhr at the time of Doha prayer \nso this is what is the Sunnah is but when someone   finishes the Quran finishes his word his wird \nearlier than the month and there are a few days   left it is not recommended at all for him just to \nchill and and relax and not read anything no he   has to go and read the Quran memorize revise \nsome of what he has memorized and occupy his   night with such a similar wird with so that he \nwould not be neglectful and Allah Knows Best and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All foreign"
