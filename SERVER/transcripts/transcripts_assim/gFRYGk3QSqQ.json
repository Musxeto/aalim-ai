  "transcript": "um is my husband committing fornication he watches foreign videos okay and the second one is can I reject something like that if he watches these videos or if he hits me can you watch for any reason can you can I reject him can I reject him in the intimacy okay if if uh he watches from Egypt question number one her husband watches blue movies pornography so she says that she's hurt because of that is he committing fornication the answer is no this is not fornication nor adultery it's a sin and it is something that is prohibited but it is neither pornography fornication nor adultery because that requires penetration and sexual intercourse and this is only the fornication of the eyes he's sinful and he'll be punished for that she says can I reject him okay you tell me uh I'm at Allah you have two options one to reject him and two not to reject him if you reject him what do you think would happen usually those who watch pornography would have to do something to relieve themselves from the tension and from the desire they're getting if they go to the Halal means of doing so and that is his spouse and she rejects him first of all the Angels curses her till morning regardless you're not afraid of STDs the guy is just watching he's not doing secondly you force him you push him to look for fulfilling his sexual drive sexual desire elsewhere whether through a prostitute a girlfriend may Allah protect us or through marrying a second wife so the second option is the best option and that is try to fulfill his sexual desire in halal way you are his wife but not only that most likely he did not watch pornography except because his Iman is low and because you are not doing your job if you were doing your job as a wife by taking good care of yourself by exhausting him and the bedroom so do it twice or three times a day if he has the power to do that when you drain him totally he wouldn't even look at the hijabi woman let alone pornography so you have to analyze and see what is happening so that you can fix it before it's too late"
