  "title": "Can the dead hear us before they are buried? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the final question with us today is from neslin can the dead before they are buried and in their grave hear the recitation of the quran of the family members i know the hadith about the dead can hear the footsteps and the salams of family members what about the quran's recitation well nasleen what you have said is crystal clear the prophet told us allah what will a deceased encounter before his soul is taken and what would happen when he's placed in his grave from the time his soul is taken until the time his body is placed in the grave and buried there was never ever any mentioning of the deceased hearing anything or feeling anything whether they've washing shrouding perfuming praying as a prayer carrying the deceased on their shoulders until they put him in his grave then bury him all of this time he does not hear a thing the prophet tells us only when they start to leave the graveyard he hears their flip-flops he hears their sandals as they're walking away so he doesn't hear their weeping or crying he doesn't hear their dua for him the only thing he hears is their footsteps are there as they are walking away from his grave therefore there is no evidence none whatsoever that when you recite the quran the deceased hears it or benefits from it or that he's happy with it and hence we cannot say that this happens because the prophet did not tell us that it would happen and allah azza knows best"
