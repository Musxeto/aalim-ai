  "title": "Ruling on washing the feet in wudhu",
  "transcript": "brother Adnan sends us a question regarding washing the feet while performing W he says in the Quran it is commanded for us to mass our head and feet that is to rub over our uh heads and feet as asked by one of my Shia friends I was not able to Rebo him in this matter as he said there is nothing above the command of Allah in the Quran even the prophet Alat hope you can give me a reliable and beautiful answer first of all it is not permissible for you to take a friend that does not share your beliefs so you can only be friend with Muslims okay you may have an associate a colleague someone who works with you this is permiss I whether he's a Muslim or a non-muslim but to hang out with such a person or to befriend with and to socialize and favor him more than any uh other Muslim this is not permissible secondly those who follow deviant sects you cannot be friend with them unless you want to call them to Islam which means that you have to prepare yourself with the proper knowledge but if this involves that they insult your religion if they insult your Prophet Alam if they insult his wives or his companions this is not permissible for you to talk to such people let alone to be friends with now thirdly when you said that Allah commanded us to do M that is rubbing the heads and the feet this is wrong Allah did not command Us in this fashion as your so-called friend understands it if you look at the verse inah Allah instructs us whenever we want to pray to wash the uh the faces to wash our faces and to wash our hands and arms to the elbows and to wipe over our heads and to wash our feet to the ankles this is the Ayah that if you open any book of any Quran you will find it written in this fashion if you know Arabic you will find that Allah asael is saying this but the order of the limbs has been made in such a way that you have two organs to be washed one to be wiped and one to be washed again this to indicate that the order is one of the pillars of wood otherwise the verse would have been like so all you who believe whenever you want to pray wash your faces wash your hands and arms to the elbows wash your feet to the ankles and wipe over your heads this is one way of reciting the Ayah and the and this is found all over the uh books of the Quran the other is which he referred to washing over the head and washing the feet and this is only when you're wearing your socks or your shoes to wipe over but if someone comes and wipes over his foot Barefoot his wo is invalid and his prayer is invalid he has to wash his feet the only thing that he can wipe over is socks or his shoes and therefore we understand the Quran not by our whims and desires but by the one who has been revealed this holy and Noble Quran your friend is saying that nothing comes over or on top the commands of Allah not even the prophets Alat this is true but unfortunately this ignorant friend of yours that does not know that the prophet Alam does not utter anything except by Revelation so all what the prophet Alam says from the Sunnah from the teachings of the Prophet is a revelation from Allah if he makes the effort and he decides something or chooses something and makes a mistake Allah would correct him so whatever the prophet does it is been monitored by Allah and and if approved it is part of the Sunnah if disapproved Allah Asel would show us this as in the case when the blind man walked in and the prophet frowned in his face because he was calling the dignitaries of Mecca Allah immediately revealed that this was wrong also when the prophet Alam was instructed to marry the wife of his adopted son har may Allah be pleased with him he did not like this and he feared what the people might say about this and Allah showed us in the Quran that this is wrong you should not fear the people and you should only fear Allah and this is going to happen because Allah said it was going to happen and he did marry his cousin z b j may Allah be pleased with her after Z divorced her because they could not uh um live together with the way each thought of each other so whatever the prophet says it's a revelation it is like the Quran the prophet said in the authentic Hadith I have been given the Quran and something else similar to it which is referring to the Sunnah and you cannot understand the Quran without the Sunnah how would you know that we have five daily prayers two for four for and three for M and four for as well how would you know the number of rakas how do you know that each raak has two prostrations or we should do this or we should do that how would you know that zakat has to be in this nisab after one year from the cattle or from uh um gold and and silver and from this and that how would you know that I'm not allowed to marry this or that and I'm allowed to marry this or that so many things in the Quran is is explained to us by the Sunnah of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so you cannot fully comprehend the Quran without going through the Sunnah therefore I I I request you that you choose and select your friends and that you learn your religion so that not every time someone pops up and gives you doubt makes you doubtful about your religion"
