  "transcript": "she I watched your videos on this issue my question is there is a conventional bank and they have a separate Islamic banking Department I spoke to them and they said that the Islamic banking department is operated independently according to Shar and it is not connected to the conventional banking department now uh I can't Deep dive into their systems to see if they have a legit Shar code or not so I tried to check their authenticity with whatever I could and I'm not sure but there seem to be leged as it's a reputable and trusted bank so would it be permissible to open fixed deposits and take profits from the Islamic banking Department fixed deposits mean that you will put your money and they will invest it on your behalf but you don't know what they're investing it in if you don't know whether they have Shar board that are trusted or not overlooking their transactions definitely the answer is no you should not do that but if you want to be on the safe side just open a current account where you can do your banking transactions freely without having anything to do with investment so that you would avoid any possibility of Haram money coming to your account"
