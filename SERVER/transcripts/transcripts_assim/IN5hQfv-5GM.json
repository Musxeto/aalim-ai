  "title": "Am I Severing ties of kinship if I don't visit relatives who do Haram (free mix, alcohol, etc) assim",
  "transcript": "Hamza from Bosnia Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh, when I travel to visit my relatives, they always do haram activities in their houses like free mixing, drinking alcohol, backbiting, listening to music and the whole nine yards. It seems impossible to physically keep the ties of kinship with them and I cannot control what they do in their houses. No, you are not the one who cuts the ties of kinship because it is totally 110% prohibited for you to go to them when there is such haram activities. This exempts you from visiting them. Free mixing, consumption of alcohol, haram presence of sins, you're not allowed to go there. Now you have to figure it out. Sometimes you say that I go to them on the occasion of Eid and they're all celebrating. Say okay, don't go to them in Eid. Visit them in other occasions when they're alone because they do these sins when they're together. So instead of going to your grandpa's house where all the uncles and their wives and their children are gathering, you know that this will be haram. Go to your grandfather's house a month later when there is no gathering so you can visit your grandfather and your grandma."
