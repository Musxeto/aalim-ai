  "transcript": "okay my question is uh every year I go with my father and Uncle to slaughter Buffalo and they order me that if I want to SL buff then I have to read a long Dua uh then they give me a list of names to take six names of them and one name is of our Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam this is because they are B so my question is can I Slaughter Buffalo the answer is yes sacrificing a buffalo or a cow or a camel or a bull such an animal suffices for seven individuals or their families that they provide for so if they tell you to do so yes you can do so reading the long Dua is an innovation if it's not related to the slaughtering then you ignore it just sayb when you Slaughter it and offering it on behalf of six individuals and stating their name is okay as for offering to the prophet Alat this is an innovation and you should not do that and you should not tell them about it either and Allah knows best"
