  "transcript": "it's been a while I hope you're doing well alhamdulillah how can I help you yeah uh my question is we know it's the bare minimum to complete reading the Quran once a month but is this for uh reading outside the prayer only for example if I read one just while praying T and one just outside the prayer does this count as read two shorts a day meaning completing the Quran 15 days yes it is not limited to reciting it while in night prayer tahajud or elsewhere as long as you recite the Quran this is considered to be reciting it if you recite half a in and then after you finish prayer you sit down and read half a this means that you finish the Quran in one month if you read one in and one throughout the day this means that you've read the Quran once every 15 days and this is a great reward and Allah Asel Knows Best"
