  "title": "Can We Poison Stray Animals that cause us hardship or harm us? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] says is it permissible in our dean to position or to poison the street animals or to trap and throw them in the desert that this depends on the harm one gets from such animals so for example if i have a house where i raise or keep chicken and every night i get cats wild cats coming attacking the chicken killing them and eating them i tried my best to build fences etc it's not working so there's the only option is to kill the cats no problem this is totally halal because anything that is harmful can be killed but you try your level best not to torture the animal so if you catch a mouse for example in a trap you can't drown the mouse to kill it you have to actually kill it shoot it in the head slaughter it do something that is swift and lethal rather than torturing that animal"
