  "transcript": "sofyan says that a friend is asking if uncovering the right shoulder is obligatory during Umrah first of all say fianc question is about a revert and this brother the revert has tattoos all over his right shoulder and parts of his back he was a kafir so is he held questionable on the day of judgement not all all this was a sin done before accepting Islam once you accept Islam everything is erased all your bad deeds that you've done before accepting Islam killing stealing whatever heinous crimes you've done it is all erased once you say ash-hadu anla ilaha illallah wa ashhadu anna muhammadan abduhu wa rasuluh and you believe with your heart that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah Almighty and that is Messenger Muhammad peace and praise of Allah be upon him is his servant and messenger this means that you've become a Muslim and by default all of your bad deeds have been erased if not transformed into good deeds as mentioned in surat al-furqan so the brother says whenever I go to Mecca if I follow the Sunnah and we know that the Sunnah is to cover your shoulders until you reach Mecca what just before you start the Tawaf around the Kaaba the Sunnah is to expose your right shoulder and covering your left so the brother says that whenever I go and implement the Sunnah during Tawaf people touch my tattoos and say that this is Haram this is not permissible your sinful you dote and may Allah reward them they're doing this thinking that they are advising him for the sake of Allah and that he may not know the ruling but this is not the case I have tattoos I cannot remove them okay I was sinful but I was not a Muslim now it's a different story anyhow so the brother is agitated irritated and he is not at ease when he goes to Mecca so saying that in order to avoid such comments can I cover my right shoulder the answer is yes no problem it is not an obligation it is not part of the pillars of Tawaf or the pillars of Umrah and therefore there is nothing at all on you cover it and go and make homra as much as you wish insha'Allah"
