  "title": "Prostration of gratitude should only be done for events that do not reoccur assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Allah. And this happens only in something that does not reoccur. Unlike what many ignorant among the Muslims do nowadays, after Fajr prayer, all of a sudden after Dhir adhkar they just go and prostrate. Akhi, what are you doing? Come. He said, I'm prostrating to Allah Azza Wa Jal, showing my gratitude. And I said, but this is not permissible. He said, Subhanallah, the Prophet used to offer this Sujud al-Shukr. And I said, yes, but old scholars say that he used to do this when something that does not reoccur happens, such as the conquest of a country that was in war against Islam and the Muslims, or the saving of a Muslim prisoner and the release, or something that happens once every blue moon. Because if we were to be grateful to Allah and show our gratitude with this Sujud for His blessings and favors, we would not stop prostrating. He gave us the sight, He gave us the hearing, He gave us the health, He gave us the wealth, He gave us the shelter, so many things. So we will keep on prostrating till the day of judgment. This is not the way of the Prophet alayhi salatu wa salam. So what you're doing is an innovation. Don't do this. When you receive your paycheck at the end of the month, don't prostrate for gratitude, because this is coming every month. But if your father goes into ICU and he undergoes a surgery, a major surgery, a life-threatening surgery, and he makes it, yes, you can make this Sujud, because this is once every month."
