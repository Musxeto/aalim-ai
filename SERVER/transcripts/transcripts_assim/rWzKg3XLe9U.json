  "title": "Can a doctor treat homosexual people or treat infertile couples who are not married?",
  "transcript": "Ammar from the U.K. Says that, 'I'm a doctor \nand I'm interested in a specific field but to   train for that field, I have to maybe deal with \nhomosexuals, or with getting people pregnant   who are not married.' Well, akhi, dealing \nand treating homosexuals is permissible,   if this is in halal ways. So if you get someone \nwho's a homosexual who needs medical treatment,   nobody tells you that you should not \ntreat him and leave him to die like a dog.   No, you have to treat him. 'Oh, Sheikh, but \nhe has herpes. He has aids, HIV positive.'   No problem, deal with it, treat him, give him the \nnecessary medical treatment, he's a human being.   Even with animals we are told to be kind to \nthem. He's not an animal, he's a human being.   Maybe he will repent, maybe he will accept \nIslam, at the end of the day he's a human   being. We can be kind to him. But when it comes \nto something that is haram in our religion.. So   they say to you 'okay, this woman needs to \nbe impregnated by the sperm of this donor,   or of this man, and they're not married', this is \ntotally prohibited. Training or no training, you   are not allowed to do this no matter what because \nthis is unethical and it's Islamically wrong."
