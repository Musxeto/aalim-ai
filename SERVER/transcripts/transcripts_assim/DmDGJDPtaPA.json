  "transcript": "is it permissible to limit your conversation with a person who verbally abuses and because that person is older there is no one who can persuade that person to stop I usually opt for ignoring and for forgiveness and advise others to forgive - but this is getting worse over the years and I have forgiven for more than a decade Islam is a religion of Tolerance it is a religion of forgiveness yet it is not a religion of weakness so your forgiveness and tolerance they originate from your strength from your Iman and hence one should not humiliate himself now in the case that for him is telling us about this issue is reoccurring in so many places and times people usually complain of elderly doing this and we've addressed this before and we said that reaching such an old age is a bless from Allah so Allah however it is a menace if it is not accompanied by righteous deeds and good character and that is why the Prophet said is awesome the best among you are those who Allah prolongs their life and excels there a moral character and at the same time they offer righteous and good deeds so the elders who fail to have good character with the youngsters they have a problem nevertheless for the youngsters they should tolerate they should respect they should give an advice in a diplomatic way so that it can be accepted by these elders however if this does not work then in this case you may reduce and minimize your contact and the period of sitting with that person so you have to try and have a win-win situation completely cutting them off is not a solution on the contrary it can be a major sin especially if this person is one of your next of kin and mixing all the time with them is a big problem because they verbally abuse you and they heart harm you or hurt you knowingly or unknowingly so the best thing to do is to minimize mixing up with them to the bare minimum and limit that to what Allah Allah would not punish you for so instead of seeing them every day see them once a week instead of going to them and mix with them for two three hours give them a call or just sit for five minutes and then apologize because you have an appointment by this you would have a win-win situation insha Allah"
