  "transcript": "Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Excuse me Sheikh, I'm from the United States and I still have some issues about eating halal and haram food in the United States. According to my experience when I lived there, I used to live in a city, in a state which is hard for me to find halal foods. For example, I lived in Massachusetts at that time and it's not easy for me to find halal chicken, halal beef, which is basically halal. But I don't know if this beef or chicken is halal or not. But sometimes I'm so obsessed that I want cheeseburgers from the McDonald's. I also want steak from the restaurant. So the question is, is it okay for me to eat the American cheeseburger and Burger King steak like that? Short answer or long answer? It's up to you. Short answer, yes. Alhamdulillah. Why? Why? In Surah Al-Ma'idah, chapter number 5, Allah tells us in the beginning that the slaughtered meat done by the Jews and the Christians is halal for us. Is America a Christian country? Yes or no? Yes. Now, second problem. I don't know they slaughtered or not. No problem. As long as they're Christians, I say Bismillah and I eat. Evidence from the Sunnah. The Prophet, peace be upon him, in Medina was invited by a Jewish woman. She said, come I have prepared for you a ram. And I cooked it on fire because you like it. So the Prophet said to his companions, come let's go and eat. When they went, the Prophet did not ask the woman, is the money halal or haram? Because we know Jews deal with riba. But the Prophet did not ask. The Prophet did not ask, is this zabiha, halal? Or it fell from the mountains? Or you found it dead? He did not ask. He simply said Bismillah and ate. So we don't know more than the Prophet, peace be upon him. The most important thing is that there is no cross contamination with pork. So if they fry pork or ham with halal meat, no. This is contamination. But if not, then go ahead and eat inshallah, double cheeseburger and hold the lattice."
