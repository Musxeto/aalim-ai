  "transcript": "so brother abdul aziz is asking what's your advice to someone who's afraid of falling sick or harm coming to him or maybe dying and he gave a medical terminology i'm not good in recording those so what's your advice my advice is to have full trust dependence and reliance on allah azzawajal this fear is not natural and in addition it's not islamic what do you mean by not islamic we have six pillars of iman the sixth pillar is to believe in pre-destiny whether good or evil what is predestiny pre-destiny is that everything has been written down and overdone with 50 000 years before allah created the whole universe the hadith says when allah created the pen allah said to it right so the pen said what should i write allah said to him or to it right everything that's happening is going to happen till the day of judgment and that was 50 000 years before allah created the universe so the pen started writing and it's done and it's in the preserved tablet everything is going to happen is in there whatever you do is not gonna change you and i don't know what's written there so i say to myself okay i'm gonna drop this mug on the floor and let it chatter into pieces and my green tea will split all spill all over the place and this is predestined say how did you know it was predestined he said i don't know so i'm gonna change my mind this is pretty destined changing my mind and if i dropped it it's also predestined you and i don't know that so we're accountable for our actions now having said that the date of my death has been already registered before the soul was breathed in my body when i was in my mother womb the angel came and said oh allah male or female alhamdulillah happy or uh richard when what is his provision what day is he to die all of this has been registered and no one knows when he will die it's all in allah's books so the angels know that this person is going to die on that particular day but this is also changeable so all of a sudden they may get a command from allah increase his life by five years and they will do that because they have knowledge year by year but the ultimate knowledge is with allah and the preserved tablet which nobody knows about so everything has been done with whether you worry or not it doesn't matter so my daughter has corona diagnosed yesterday my wife has corona diagnosed yesterday am i afraid of getting corona no am i keeping my distance yes i'm taking all the necessary precautions but am i afraid am i anxious am i having these worries that oh i might get it no because if i'm gonna get i'm gonna get it should i relocate to another house no no need my death is known exactly what is going to happen so as long as you live trusting allah and live safely nobody says to you go and jump in the ocean without knowing how to swim and without being in protection from sharks and other predators and say inshallah have trust in allah this is nonsense this is crazy so when you have this trust in allah and when you know that everything is predestined you will feel the tranquility in your heart filling it up when you lack this this is what's going to happen to you i had a counseling session a few months back with a brother who was crying and weeping he said what's wrong he says it's been three years now i've quit my studies i don't have a job i'm sitting in my room weeping and afraid of dying and i said okay he said what do you mean okay he said okay did you die he said no not yet said you're nuts for three years you've been in this position you've left everything and maybe you're not gonna die for another 20 years are you nuts get a life man whenever you're going to die you're going to die but you have to die trying you have to die living but to just sit there doing nothing weeping and being afraid of death this is exactly what shaytan wants and i'm assuring you satan is 100 percent pleased and happy with what you're doing this anxiety pleases him and allah is angry with you because you're not trusting him may allah make things easy"
