  "transcript": "Osato salam ala rasoolillah he was a happy human est√° debajo de a man Salam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh the third type of toe heat is known as though he do asthma was safe at the toe heat of a las beautiful names and attributes and this is a great type of doe heat the Orang anderson is filled with verses and hadith confirming this by worshipping allah azza wajal alone with his beautiful names and attributes by thinking that there is no equivalent to him there is nothing similar to him neither in his names nor in his attributes subhanahu wa'ta'ala and the people have gone astray in this form of doe heat mainly because they are negligent of the quran and the sunnah mainly because they sometimes use their logic over what they are supposed to embrace and submit to without thinking and this form of the heat is based on two pillars the first pillar is to confirm and to affirm to Allah what he has described himself with and also what the Prophet also have described his Lord with so such beautiful names and attributes cannot be manipulated you have to believe them as they are when Allah says that he is a Samia all-hearing do we know or understand how this can be know because Allah has nothing similar to him and there is nothing compared to him but we know what hearing is and we know that Allah has a lot of as erosion has the highest level of it so we do not go into details and we take it as it is without twisting the meaning without trying to find similar things to it we affirm it as Allah has described himself or his Prophet Allah so some describe Allah with the second type is the negate negation type and this this is called tansy and this type is when we exalt Allah Almighty from attributes that do not befit him so now I'm not describing a logical with affirmative description or attributes I am denying Allah schedule of having any of these negative attributes so anything that is not befitting a las ocho we would say that Allah does not have this and for example if someone says Allah does not sleep so I'm negating this huh this is ok because sleeping is not befitting of allah azza wajal and we have to also remember that when we use this to describe a human being this is a defect when we say that this individual he doesn't sleep at all at night no this is insomnia this is an illness but when we say that Allah Almighty does not sleep this is not a defect this is a sign and a characteristic of perfection because if allah azza wajal would have or where to sleep for a fraction of a second the whole world would collapse allah does not sleep subhana WA Ta'ala and anything that does not befit a large L we have to negate this we have to say that does not happen to allah the almighty if someone says allah azza wajal is everywhere okay what do you mean by Allah is everywhere Allah is with us Allah is in my heart Allah is in this room Allah is with me when I go and when I come this is not befitting of Allah soldier because Allah described himself in the Quran and the Prophet described the Prophet as Salam and the Prophet described Allah in the Quran the hadith that Allah is on the throne analyzed above the seventh heaven so Allah cannot be with us as erosion as people think yet he is with us with his power with his sight and with his hearing and with his control but Allah is exalted subhanaw taala above his throne as virgil so in short it is to believe in allah azza wajal in his beautiful names and attributes as he described himself and as the Prophet Azam described him by without any tariffs this is Distortion so you don't come to an attribute to say yeah it sounds like this but this is not the real meaning the real meaning is that so this is distortion without wheel without twisting the meaning like when they say Abraham a no other darkest hour they said that no this doesn't mean Estela this kind of distortion he Allah is not above his throne it means that he has control over the throne oh this is his Dominion as some explained at the throne the harsh as mulku lillah this is rubbish this is not according to additional Gemara and also twisting when someone says Allah is hand over their hands it no Allah does not have a hand a lot of Almighty's power is over their hands and powers again this is twisting voila tarteel not denying the reality like the jamia says Allah is all-hearing but he doesn't hear from Hanna why are you playing with a las ocho this is kufur these things are so important in essential for a Muslim to know though the majority the vast majority of Muslims know it by heart by the nature but because of these philosophy philosophy that came to us from the Greeks and the Romans it corrupted the religion centuries ago and without the kief and without asking how they are so Alonso gel has an eye a large circle has a a hand how is this hand how does it look can we say they said no this is all the time we have until we meet next time via Manila or Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
