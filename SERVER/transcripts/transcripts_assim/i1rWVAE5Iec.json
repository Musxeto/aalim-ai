  "title": "Is it permissible to offer the Sunnah of Fajr if someone overslept? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so sister safiya is asking about a person who overslept and woke up after sunrise is it permissible for him or her to offer the two raka's of sunnah the answer is yes the evidence is that in the authentic hadith the prophet alaihis salatusam once prayed fajr with the congregation after he concluded his prayer he saw one of his companions offering two rakahs at the end of the masjid so he came he stood next to the man who was offering prayer and he repeated saying is fajr four is fashion four is fajr four so the man concluded his prayer in a quick fashion in order to be able to speak with the prophet salallahu and justify his action and after he concluded the prayer he said oh prophet of allah the congregation started and i was home and i did not pray my two sunnah prayers so i came quickly and i joined the congregation after concluding the salat with the jamaa with you now i'm praying the two i'm making up the two raka's of sunnah so the prophet alaihi salat wasallam did not comment and walked away this means that it is totally acceptable if you miss the sunnah that you make it up after the fart and by default if you miss the ford itself that when you make it up you pray the sunnah before it as usual because the prophet alaihis had stated that whoever forgets a prayer or oversleeps over it he must pray it as soon as he remembers there is no expiation for it other than that so if a person oversleeps and wakes up like seven o'clock or eight o'clock in the morning and the sun is already in the middle of the sky he prays the two raka's of sunnah then he follows that with the two raka's of and allah azza knows best"
