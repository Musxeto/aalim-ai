  "title": "Ruling on upholding kinship with relatives who do not want to talk to us",
  "transcript": "Jahan from Bangladesh. I would like to ask, one of my cousin tries to brainwash me about my future and tries to prevent me from admitting in a university. I talked about this to my mother and she got angry and called my aunt and talked about it but they got really angry. Now they are not receiving our calls as we want to apologize to them and we don't want to break the kinship. What's the ruling on this? Should we continue calling every day or is there any time limit to this? This is an internal dispute that happens in all families. As long as they're in a state of rage, most likely because your mother miscommunicated with them and maybe was a bit harsh to their son and they felt offended, due to this, it's human nature. Give it some time, give it a few weeks so that they can calm down and forget about it and then try to either contact them through SMSs, general SMSs without referring to that topic, or you probably would meet them in a wedding or a family gathering or someone would come and invite you for a feast or something like that and then little by little you can start to build up the relationship as it used to be before, little by little. To try and reconcile immediately after they had a fight or they expressed and showed their disinterest in communicating with you is very unwise. Let it settle, let them calm down for a while and then inshallah things would go back to normal go back to normal."
