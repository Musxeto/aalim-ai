  "transcript": "U my my friend asked a question uh is a re if a person wants to R to Islam but they don't want to do something obligatory about it can they still become a Muslim and before becoming a Muslim can a r is it obligatory for a reer to ask forgiveness for major and minor sin what if they miss these things after becoming a Muslim what what do you mean by don't want to make an obligatory act uh like for example if a person wants to rever to Islam and they do not want to do the hijab for example have this intention first first of all a person who's not a Muslim is bound to Hellfire regardless of how good you are if you know about Islam if you know about the Quran if you know about Allah Prophet Muhammad Alam you've got the means to go and research it yet you insist no I want to remain as I am following my same religion I'm a good person Allah will put me in in Paradise I guarantee you you will go to hell for eternity all what you need to do is just die if a person says Whoa okay I'm willing to accept Islam the moment he accepts Islam and submits his will to Allah Asel he's a Muslim and he has reserved his seat in Paradise depending on how much sins he would come on the day of judgment on his shoulders and on his back so if he reverted or she reverted to Islam but said I believe in hijab I can't wear it it's doesn't fit me I believe it's mandatory but I am too weak I'm afraid of what the people say would say about me and she does not wear it she's a Muslim and Allah would hold her accountable as a Muslim and if she has many many Good Deeds that would overweigh her sins Allah would compensate that and put her in Paradise but if she not then she will put in Hellfire and she will B Be burned and tormented for Allah knows how long inevitably eventually she will be taken and then put in Paradise for eternity but believe me one second of fire is not to be taken lightly let alone couple of years"
