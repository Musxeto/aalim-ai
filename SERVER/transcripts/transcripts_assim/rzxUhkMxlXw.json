  "transcript": "some people send me questions saying that it is prohibited to take a shower to take a bath naked and they have to wear clothes or - what is this next time you're gonna tell me I'm gonna wear a three-piece suit in order to have a proper whistle or a proper ritual bath this is nonsense this is baseless there is nothing in Islam that recommends this let alone to mandate it so I hope this answers this question"
