  "transcript": "a person is going to follow the way of his friend so you have to be careful the most important thing in raising our kids is not following our opinions or other opinions one of the qualities you have to look in the man that he will look after you and the girl has to pay them this is exactly what happens this is and he needs to have a supplement with religious commitment is that a lot of the muslims nowadays don't this is the prophet when you type it in welcome back again to another episode and i'm your host ismail bullock we're continuing in the very interesting episodes of what a muslim believes and our last episode we discussed the importance of the salah and how it is a connection between the person and his lord and we gave you various tips on how to improve and get that sweetness in your prayer today we're going to move on to the zakah the third pillar this giving of charity could you maybe explain to us the importance and i mean why do we give this a call what's special about it zakat is originating from the word teschia which deals with purification and there are a number of evidences for backing this up in the quran and in the sunnah we would not go into the linguistic part we would go into what is zakat some people consider it to be taxation and it's not taxation taxation is forbidden in islam to the ruler to come and say that you have to pay this of your income as so many non-muslim countries do unfortunately even some muslim countries as well taxation is forbidden and it is one of the major sins in islam if there is no legitimate and 99 of the cases there isn't any legitimate reason behind it it's simply just to gather and collect money so in islam zakat is a different means altogether first of all zakat is being given voluntary by the person not enforced by the law except in few cases and zakat is a percentage that is 2.5 or 5 or 10 percent that is taken from a person's wealth and given to the poor and that is why in the hadith of when the prophet sent him to arizona to yemen he told him inform those who are you are calling to islam that allah has prescribed has made it mandatory that we take a percentage of the money of the wealthy and return it back to the poor so it's not to buy arms it is not to make the rich richer and the poor poorer on the contrary it is a social factor that balances the wealth in the um why not they said 2.5 5 and 10 percent if that's any obviously there's no misconception or confusion to the viewer from the money if that that can be i mean the cash will be 2.5 only right true and the other one goes back to the agriculture yes and i'd like to explain the 2.5 which is something is beloved by everyone in the world you can imagine the non-muslim viewers who pay 18 35 some 40 of their income like wow two points yeah that's cool exactly last night i had a person who is from china i said that try to imagine this 2.5 tax if it is we call it tax we don't like to call it tax but just for the sake of the audience to understand what we're talking about is only paid on the unused money for a whole year let me give an example if your salary is a million dollar per year and you spend it all and there is nothing left at the end of the year you don't pay any tax zero zero zero tax that means almost all the people in the world will not pay taxes so because if you spend the money because this helps the poor indirectly because this helps people to find new jobs it helps the economy in any country to go on to continue to prosper but we pay the ca only on the money that was unused for a whole year which caused some indirect problems to the poor or to the economy this is something it's very important for people to consider and also i'd like to bring the viewers i'd like to bring their attention to that the money or wealth in islam is divided two types hidden and obvious or apparent or visible the majority of the people have hidden money which is your money your income your gold your silver your savings this no one has the right to come even the ruler and say listen you have to give me this and that because this is something of your own this is something you give or you don't give it's between you and allah azza but the visible or the apparent wealth this is where the ruler comes and he designates people to collect the zakat and this happens with people who have farms and not all the crops we give zakat only the crops that can be saved and measured by size or weight kilograms or liters but things that you can count like watermelons there's no zakatian watermelon in vegetables so the zakat is in grain dates grapes raisin that is etc if you have live cattle then in this case yes this is visible so the ruler sends his man to collect and to take the zakat but if you like shaksalam said if you don't have any savings there is cash money and if you don't have items to sell and buy transactions you don't have to pay zakat i could have four or five buildings and i'm having them on rent i lease them apartments people are living there and paying me rent and the rent that comes i buy other stuff with i buy other buildings or i buy cars that i lease and at the end of the balance i did not have cash enough for a whole year to go through and it did not reach the nisab the level there's no zakat even if i consider to be a millionaire because they do not have this money in my bank account in monetary is usually measured by silver and this is 595 grams of silver so the cost of 595 grams of silver if you have less than that there's no zakat even if it stays with you for 10 years in gold it's measured by 85 grams of gold so if you have 84 grams of gold and a whole year passes with this in your possession there's no zakat so basically if you want to say like in dollars or something you would see how much the 85 grams is equal to in dollars and you see do you have that much throughout the year and if you pay if you don't you don't so and like you mentioned is that maybe the majority of people are not gonna even pay the zakat if this car was implemented as it should it would save a lot of all this poverty you see in a lot of these countries which have been loaned by the international monetary you know they would basically and they can never get out of this debt you see a lot of this would be you know neutralized and that reminds me of the who they called the fifth khalifa or the fifth muslim world because he was so close in his pioneers to the first four malibun abdel aziz and it said that during his time that the zakar was implemented so perfectly that when they would come the next year to the those that they considered to be poor they would refuse it said we still have something years before we're no longer really poor so it just shows you that if that was and this leads us to who should be receiving the zakat allah mentioned this clearly in verse 60 chapter 9 in the quran that the cat is to be paid to eight categories of people one of the eight not all of the eight divided through them and these eight people i don't know if my english is going to help me translate it but it's for the fukura and are the poor the kin are the needy poor meaning that they have nothing needy means that they have something but it is not sufficient for their normal life those who are designated by the ruler to go they can take their wages not from their own whims but from the ruler telling them that they can take a portion as salaries and also whom their hearts are inclined to islam so if we have a tribe in africa and the dignitary or the leader of that tribe is inclined to islam we would give him from the zakat so that if he accepts islam then this would be good inshallah for the rest of his population this is a source of paying the zakat those who are captive some say those who are captive some say those who are enslaved so islam promotes freeing slaves this is any 1400 years ago promoting that they came in the western country where they and they abolished slaves existed prior to islam and islam came with the solution so if someone points the finger say what is the solution in your belief it is islam that provides the solution true so the captive even if we have prisoners of wars in islam it is a source of paying zakat and this is one of the sources of paying zakat those who are indebted into the extent that they might be imprisoned or their debt occurred because they were reconciling between two tribes so if i know of two tribes fighting and feuding and there's a possibility of war and i intervene and i say listen how much you need for your losses and damages and i give them from my own pocket it is permissible for me to take from the zakat because of the good thing that i had done or if i incurred a disaster something happened first major my business was burned to the ground and i have debtors that want their money and i'm unable to pay them islam tells the community gave this man from the zakat so the credit crunch also has a solution in islam through the sources of paying for the zakat the last two obviously so those who are stranded in establish a person travels to europe and is stripped of his money he loses his wallet or lost his credit card and then he doesn't have means to go back though he's rich but now he doesn't have mean to go back the muslim community give him from your zakat money what is sufficient to go back to his hometown once he goes back to his hometown is he obliged to return the money back no this is not a debt this is not a favor i'm just giving away what allah told me to give away and the last and eighth category is fisabilillah the zakah solves this how islam came with the solution pragmatic solution islam is a pragmatic way of life people they have problems solutions in islam humanity has a lot of problems today islam offers them the solutions why don't you take the islamic solution we have the solution for your problems so islam can contribute and solve your problems so the issue of poverty how islam handles that and addressed it through the zakat and when the zakah was applied properly as you mentioned the example they could not find any single poor person during the reign of ahmad abdul aziz they told him the zakah collector they said oh we can't find anyone who's in need or eligible for the zakah he said then okay find out and count those who are not married and get them married and they did so from the zakah you can see so the car is a pragmatic way of solving the problems he fought those who refused to give the the zakah unfortunately many muslims those who are wealthy they don't give the zakah if they give the zakah there are many studies you will not find one single poor muslim family that's because of the zakah but we could see that islam then was maybe one of the first to fight for the rights of the poor we hear okay it's not exactly the same but we hear this story of robin hood and how he took from the rich to the poor but we see that you know islam this is way before this 1400 years ago addressed the issue and the satan abu bakr when they refused he fought them he said by allah i will fight whoever differentiates between the salah and the zakah and those who do not give the zakah the prophet sallam taught us what will happen to them on the day of resurrection this amount of wealth will be hated if it is gold or silver will be heated on fire and then you will be branded by these kinds of gold and silver if you have livestock the livestock are stabbing you with the hooves and it is the responsibility of the ruler the state to step in and take it by force if needed if needed if you are not paying it you the state takes it by force and nowadays accounts are unknown you cannot hide all the money in the bank so the state can take it if you don't pay willingly they take not only they take it and they take half of it also as to remind you to discipline you so the next time before they ask you you come and you give the the zakat so this is a very serious matter and in this zakat as all of the things in islam it shows you any problems with humanity islam has a solution and if you look for example we talked about the prayer before why the suicide why the difficulties people facing because they don't have they might be in good shape they take care of their bodies they work out but they forget the other part of the body which is the soul how to nourish that the zakat takes care of the poor people the issue of racism it was discussed 1400 years ago all these problems the issue we just mentioned before the break you'll see now that islam has the solution for all of the problems that mankind's faith and this obviously what it does for the muslim is that it increases his faith in allah subhanahu wa and it makes him hold on stronger to his religion even now the financial crisis for example even the western countries in alaska the solution is an islamic banking and this is a any a message or a call for the non-muslims to look into islam look into the view of islam and how could something afford if it wasn't the religion of truth how can all these solutions be there sorry but you on the issue of right even from animal rights apart from the many sayings of the prophet muhammad talking about being kind to animals and not necessarily hunting them and not taking the chicks when the mother circling above all those different examples but even and i believe it was in the time of iran abdel aziz the first you could say hospice for retired and old animals i mean it's something that they've done maybe in the last 60 70 years and you know the iris pca in the uk and this kind of stuff but back then what did the muslim ruler say rather than putting them down which they do now he said just as they served us and cared for us and took care of our needs in various ways we built a hospice like a retired not even a hospice a retired home for retired animals where he hired people from the government's money to look after care feed bathe the animals he just reminded me about this story when said no he saw a you old you begging said why is he begging they said no one to look after him he said oh this is unfair this is unfair if we used to take the yuzia from him when he was young and now to leave him like that give him from baital mal see this is our islam from the money of the muslims the muslims and to respect him this is an old man we should not let him stretch his hand and beg the people something that you can notice by the way when you visit islamic countries when you have the majority of the people are muslim i don't recall that in egypt that i have seen a homeless person i don't recall that i recall that i've seen in egypt many poor people but not homeless and no one would die of salvation and i have never seen someone in egypt or syria or other countries that dying out of starvation although these countries in general are considered classified as developing and poor countries and this is not the case when you go to some countries in europe and some states in usa you find people are homeless and they see them at night and many of them in the streets and i think this is due to the purification or the zakat that the muslims pay they don't wait for the government to solve these problems but they do solve the problems by themselves this is one of the examples that islam provides the solution even without having an islamic government they still can solve the problem of humans even a lot of muslims in some countries where they take the taxes which is obviously haram islam takes taxes they still pay the zakat because they say this is they take it to be haram we want to have the barakah the purifying of this zakat from our money so they give this god even though the government had taken from the money and you'll see the blessings like you said in the society you just mentioned the tax muslims they should pay the tax not tied to escaping the zakah saying it is haram but it is they will carry the sin don't try to escape because then they will say you see on the newspapers muslims for islam or some this islam is encouraging the people to avoid paying taxes you go by the law you go by the law and the sin on them not on you and it's not only the law the unfortunate that those who abuse and bend the rules they claim to be muslims you find people in the uk for example living out of the benefits that the government gives and they even don't register their wives as wives and so the wife would go with wearing the niqab some very minority these are not practicing muslims she would be wearing the cub and she's eight months pregnant and she's filing for benefits being unmarried and the people doing this we know you muslims don't lie why are you doing this so they try to tax evate they try to avoid paying taxes they say this is a cafe country yet they benefit from their roads from their water from their electricity from their individual services health services and from the benefits that the government gives and they refuse to pay taxes i mean i thought any brothers actually when it comes to marrying more than one wife they are nowhere capable but say they i mean i've heard things that's myself i'm going to get married oh really but you're not working that's okay she's going to go and sign on you know she's going to go and she you know she'll claim obviously they can't announce that they're married because it's against the law but they still can you know if you have the capability then you can get a second wife and you can provide for her but they will purposely marry one two three wives and i've known this one brothers who actually have a high paid job but obviously having a high paid job and having two or three wives can't always work abusing the system because you're coming with the nihab but you'll say that you know you're unmarried but you're pregnant so they've come make fun of them like the religious this is something yeah i understand but who would decision this it's the brother shame on him of course okay the brother who is living on the dole and the prophet salallahu is telling us the upper hand is better than the lower hand and the other hand is the hand of the non-believer and you are the beggar shame on you and you say i want to bring the sunnah revive the sunnah you put the system in such situation the prophet sallallahu assalam when the woman came to him and he said three of your companions proposed he doesn't have any single penny it's very poor don't marry him so if you can't look after your family okay first of all prove that you are a man not a male a man who can look after that family yeah okay i just want to point out something very quick is that what assam said it's so bad that people go even sometimes change their name or they'll go to different places in european countries vessel and register in more than one place and if they get caught up it's going to be big trouble for them and like for example if we're in america and we're not paying uncle sam his taxes he's going to break down your door he can take all your belongings causes more harm than good and at the end of the day we have to realize what we're doing what is the message you're sending about islam like you said this muslim woman she's pregnant not married what does this say about islam what is the negative message you're sending and it's known that muslims they become known as people who are lazy people who don't want to work and they say let's get these muslims out of here not do anything but what on the other hand if muslims were to stop doing that and to work hard even if it was a low-paying job and to be productive members of that society what's the positive message it's going to send to that community about islam about the muslims that's the reality of islam of the muslims and those who act upon it properly again to the end of this episode inshallah join us for the next episode where we finish from zakah we'll move on to the topic of ramadan that month every year where us the muslims fast so join us and until then foreign oh welcome again to another episode i'm your host ismail bullock and i have in this episode mccarthy and we will talk in this episode the continuation on what a muslim believes and we've come in this episode now to ramadan so please uh tell us a bit about ramadan this very blessed month first of all we need to start ramadan what is ramadan why do muslims fast ramadan it's clear that we make it clear to the viewer especially now muslim viewers that ramadan or fasting is nothing new all of the past nations used to fast that's why allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala when he ordered us the fast and he sent down the command for the muslims to fast he said yes has been prescribed for you just as it has been prescribed for those who are before you perhaps that you attain attain piety or the taqwa the fear of allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala so something not something new in islam ramadan however the fasting in this month and in this way as the process sallam was ordered to fast from allah subhanahu wa ta'ala this is something for the muslim um and especially for the muslim man okay now he mentioned that verse which ended so that you may be have fear or consciousness of allah could you really explain to the people because this is a you know one as we see from the verse this is one of this is the main reason why fasting has been prescribed so could you explain what is this taqwa what is this god consciousness this the which is the fear of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala actually linguistically or literally is to keep a buffer zone between you and the things that displease allah subhanahu wa ta'ala so how to ward off all types of evils so that is the taqwa and all the teachings of islam aim at this that the fruit of the ibadah fruit of all acts of worship is to achieve this chapter the fear of allah subhanahu wa ta'ala and the fasting brings about that actually because when you are fasting your animal tendencies or inclinations okay like the desires okay they are diminished so there is a chance for the soul to be nurtured through the ibadah and that's why every muslim feels during ramadan his spirituality is is rising because throughout the year you are taking care only of the body and neglecting your soul in ramadan the intake material intake of food is less and you are focusing now in the spiritual part so the soul now finds a chance to shine and that's what you feel within yourself so the month of ramadan or fasting is not punishment the main objective or the goal is that to approve and eradicate these evil tendencies within one's self the prophet sallallahu asallam he mentions in one hadith which is very scary because many of us they think that abstaining from eating and drinking is fasting that is not the true foss which allah needs so in this beautiful hadith he said and what he gets out of his fast is only hunger and thirst and perhaps a person standing at night prayer taraweer and what he gets of his standing nothing more than fatigue-ness and tiredness so if you don't achieve this taqwa you don't get anything out of your fast so the main objective of fasting is the taqwa the fear of allah another thing that's important is on how it's not just like you mentioned not just this abstaining it's even refraining from bad speech and maybe you can reflect talk about that hadith that says the one who does not you know give up idle speech and then you know the continuation of the hadith well as the shield have mentioned earlier fasting is to abstain from certain things with the intention of getting closer to allah from the break of dawn till sunset if someone goes for example and goes under a diet and he does not eat or drink from the break of dawn till sunset this would not be counted for him as a day of fasting because he did not do this for the sake of allah and the prophet tells us clearly that those who do not refrain from false testimony or lying or having dispute and fighting with others then their hunger and thirst does not benefit anyone not even the person doing it and they have not fulfilled allah's commandment to abstain from drinking and eating for the sake of not drinking and eating it's an act of worship and a lot of the non-muslims would look at it and say why are you doing this to yourselves and they're feeling that they're merciful to us come on we want to help you not knowing that we do this for the sake of allah and that is where we get our strength from i remember that all of my children with the grace of allah when they were seven or eight years of age they used to fast the whole day we do not force our children by the way muslims do not force the children to fast they encourage and if they fulfill that and they manage to fast half a day we give them presents to encourage them but never ever threaten them or fight them or reprimand them this is non-islamic so my children used to fast when they're eight seven eight some of them nine complete ramadan and they feel proud of doing this and their children and the beauty of fasting is that it is an act of sincerity see prayer everyone sees me pray giving zakat everyone sees the impact on my income or wealth but fasting though you don't see any act of going against fasting i could go to the bathroom and drink water a child in his thirst while performing wado he could drink water a woman in her kitchen cooking taste the food and eat no one knows about this and that is why in the hadith allah says all the deeds of bani adam are the sons of adam is for him except fasting this is for me and i reward abundantly accordingly so when you look at fasting it is not simply refraining from food and drink it is something that shoots higher because when you stop from lawful things eating up an apple i'm not eating pork apple is halal you're fasting stop drinking water is not like drinking whiskey water is halal you're fasting stop so if allah tells us to stop from halal things during this holy month of ramadan by default refraining from things that are forbidden would be much much easier because they are forbidden we know the harms of it not only that islam is taking you away from being addicted even to halal things as you get addicted like now people who are overweight when you see when they say where's my weakness donuts cookies chips whatever it becomes like addictive to them as well not only that i'm talking about haram things you find people smoking and we say that smoking is haram for you you find people on drugs and we say that drugs are haram for you now muslims have no problem with these haram things because they initially are not addicted even to the halal things even to water and food their souls are not attached to it because they have this one month every year that they just come out and refrain from doing things according to allah's pleasure and as a form of worship therefore you find them the rest of the year when others who do not have the same commitment when others have this weakness towards forbidden things towards stealing dealing in rib eating poor drinking intoxications the muslims will always excel and say i don't know why you're so weak why are you doing this so and then that's this is why i believe that it's always important to point out to the people is that when it comes to ramadan you're actually going into a month of training just like you train for anything else in life you're going a month of training and you're training yourself for the coming months you remind yourself when you go through a low stage you get yourself back in training he's like a soldier now he has to constantly train to remain a soldier and in this life a muslim he's a soldier he's the soldier of allah ta'ala fighting against his greatest enemy which is the satan that ramadan is a school and that's why one year when i did a lecture about ramadan i think about different things to talk about i called it madras ramadan i did in arabic and in english and that was the school of ramadan the first time i did it i came with like 40 different points and then obviously it continued to grow after that mashallah so it shows you how ramadan is training once you mentioned for the example the class it's the only act of worship that only allah knows it's teaching you the pure class uh to teach you how to control your anger how not in islam if somebody curses at you not to reply it's renewing your relationship with the quran with the salah with the night prayer all of these things it's helping you also the issue of the fast we talk about the wisdoms and it's something we found in new research that was done we talked about you know it's difficult for you and it harms you and some people say we really feel for you know sorry you know it's wrong i'm sorry is what the non-muslims say but the reality is is that a new research in the west from the non-muslims they found that one of the cures for alzheimer's disease is fasting two days a week which is the sunnah of our beloved prophet muhammed that he used to fast mondays and thursdays and fast other times during the month and they said not just the faster refrain from or like drink water like some fasting there's another religion you can drink water and not eat but they say not eating or drinking anything from like morning or from dawn until dusk like the faster the muslims yeah they're really promoting it now in the west it's a very popular and proving obvious like you said proving to be very successful therapy many it's a therapy that many people are turning to this whole fasting thing the fasting makes those the rich to feel how the pool the suffering of the poor i am rich i've never tasted hunger i've never had that experience so allah says no you have to taste it so that's why when ramadan comes everyone the ruler will will stop eating those who are well off the rich so that they feel oh so that's what the food they go through so there's a divine wisdom behind it and not only about behind fasting all the teachings of islam because they come from the all wise the all noah so everything there is a divine wisdom behind it and it is for the benefit of mankind allah is not in need of any one of us but the one who reaps the the benefit it is the believer himself the prophet tells us clearly that those who do not refrain from false testimony or lying or having dispute and fighting with others then their hunger and thirst does not benefit anyone not even the person doing it and they have not fulfilled allah's commandment to abstain from drinking and eating for the sake of not drinking and eating it's an act of worship and a lot of the non-muslims would look at it and say why are you doing this to yourselves and they're feeling that they're merciful to us come on we want to help you not knowing that we do this for the sake of allah and that is where we get our strength from i remember that all of my children with the grace of allah when they were seven or eight years of age they used to fast the whole day we do not force our children by the way muslims do not force the children to fast they encourage and if they fulfill that and they manage to fast half a day we give them presents to encourage them but never ever threaten them or fight them or reprimand them this is unislamic so my children used to fast when they're eight seven eight some of them nine complete ramadan and they feel proud of doing this in their children and the beauty of fasting is that it is an act of sincerity see prayer everyone sees me pray giving zakat everyone sees the impact on my income or wealth but fasting though you don't see any act of going against fasting i could go to the bathroom and drink water a child in his thirst while performing wado he could

lawful things eating up an apple i'm not eating pork apple is halal you're fasting stop drinking water is not like drinking whiskey water is halal you're fasting stop so if allah tells us to stop from halal things during this holy month of ramadan by default refraining from things that are forbidden would be much much easier because they are forbidden and we know the harms of it not only that islam is taking you away from being addicted even to halal things not just that i mean even the uh the gemma the gathering all those people kind of makes one think to some extent what it will be like on yom al qaeda where we're all gathered you know the same clothes as well nobody's different and then you see it's upon the day of judgment what i wanted to ask you is that what is the story behind hajj why do we do it why what are these rituals that the tawaf around the kaaba the running between the mounting of safa and marwah what is this is it something many people think that maybe this is some old pagan thing that was brought in by the muslims so what exactly is it we can give as many interpretations as we wish we can go to the books of history and find the origin of each and every thing but this is not of a great concern to us as muslims and we have to know that not everything in islam we are requested to justify and find the wisdom behind it our religion is a religion of submission and to follow the prophet allah who himself said to us in black and white take your rituals of hajj from me from me so we follow the prophet now we can say that standing at mount arafa or next to mount arafa is because as people say adam met eve when they descended from heaven and they got lost and they met in arafah so this is why they and they got to know each other it's been called a mount arava and the funny thing this is a footnote i saw a clip for one of those so-called imams or scholars of nowadays he's saying that everything in islam is justifiable even mawlid mawlid is part of the sunnah and then he says even the five daily prayers you know why the five daily prayers like this and he starts giving something out of this universe yeah and he's making up stories that are so funny and the people around allah what are you doing he's playing with you he said why is that this is because when prophet adam was ordered to descend on to earth allah forgave his sins he prayed two rakaats and i say what did he pray for no no two records of gratitude okay it's up to you what about the photokines of lord was he pleasant what the sheikh was present then we go to her prayer why is it for raqqa for raqqa is because this is the time that the ship or the ark of noah descended on the judy and the water was drained and he prayed four records of gratitude and i was thinking turk after adam for a cafe okay up to you what about the answer prayer he said assad prayer this is when allah azzawajal instructed ibrahim to slaughter his son ismail and then the sacrifice came so they all both congregation prayed as a prayer for raka's i'll tell you this is when prophet ayoub may allah peace and blessing upon him was cured from the 18 years of illness then he wanted to pray gratitude to allah azza on the third raka he was weak so he sat down and finished it and i was wondering why did he pray two raka's then prayer what kind of religion is these people innovating and the masses they take this as well this is completely baseless we can say in hajj it had originated from the time of ibrahim peace and blessing be upon him but we do not attribute this because the mother of ismail hajj went between safa and warupa looking for water this is true and we know the story of zamzam but we make say because the prophet instructed us to do this we also throw the pebbles with general kubra the the medium general and the small drama that people now it is called shaytan we do this because the prophet did this not because the shaytan stood to ibrahim peace be upon him so he threw him seven and seven and seven we do this because it's part of the rituals that the prophet alaihis saw instructed us and that is why we go to muzdalifa and spend the night in muzdalifa and we go from arafah after sunset not before that not like the pagans used to do hajj is a great manifestation of unity of the muslims when you look at those four millions coming from all over the world you know we hear about the segregation about the racism about the blacks and the whites in islam we have nothing like this we have the blacks the white the red the yellow all kind of technicolor around you and they wear the same garments so if i look at the king or a peasant it would be the same it's only two garments okay one say yeah but the king has small royalties no he can even wear underwear he cannot put perfume he smells only for these four days not necessarily smelling meaning that he is not in his prestige that he used to be and subhanallah one of the greatest signs of unity is that if you gather a hundred thousand person in one place and you ask him to do something this would probably take a half an hour an hour for them to execute in islam the muad then makes the quran in less than a minute just before he finishes all the 3 million the 2 million the four million are standing in the same row shoulder to shoulder foot to foot no one is picky saying i don't want you next to me i want someone from my own country they standing in submissiveness facing the same place same direction making the same moves all of this is portrayed in and hajj and the grace of allah that now the rituals of hajj is being broadcasted worldwide so people non-muslims when they look at this they feel that they are part of it they want to be part of it they feel ah even he's another muslim he feels that this is surreal this is nice i wish i was part of it and i give you the invitation you want to be part of it all what you have to do is just say the kalima and that is it well we've come again to the end of a another interesting episode and to you the viewers today obviously we mentioned the final two pillars the pillar of the fasting ramadan and we mentioned the main purpose behind ramadan is this creating this awareness of allah knowing that allah is always watching us and we mention that it's one of the most sincere acts of worship because it's something that you cannot fake or do in front of other people and we ended on the hajj and how the hajj is a very good act and we mentioned some various points about the hajj being the obedience of following the prophet saw sallam and how it reminds us that we are all equal many people from different nationalities and colors and then it also reminds us of that day when we will all stand before allah all equal in the sense and we will all be judged by allah and we've come in this episode to the conclusion of the five pillars please join us in our next episode where we talk about iman and essan so please make sure you stay tuned and
