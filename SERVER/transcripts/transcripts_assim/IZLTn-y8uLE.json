  "transcript": "and salheim from canada his employer mandated and forced him either to get inoculated to get the vaccine of the covet 19 or he'll be fired so he says can i sue my employer and for how much the issue of suing is unislamic someone prepares green tea for me and it is hot boiling so i don't know i take a sip and i i'm sco i'm burnt with it scalded with it and then it fell on me and i go and sue them for damages and i get a million dollars is this halal no it's not in islam you may be compensated for the damage that took place actual damage so if there's a fault in my car and i make a small accident i can't sue them for 10 million dollars i can sue them to fix my car to pay for any damages that my car did that's probable and possible so your employer has the right to fire you i don't want you i don't like how you look i'm paying you you come and work for me if you decide to come in your shorts and i tell you don't wear shorts to work you have to wear a suit and a tie and you don't can i fire you yes i can so if i tell you to do something which i as an employer believe that it is for the safety of the community and for the employees and you refuse then you are on the wrong side of the rope having said that it also depends on the laws of the country if the laws of the country states that he's not allowed to fire you for such a thing yeah you may sue for damages which is maybe a month or two salary because if he's entitled according to the laws of the country to fire you giving you a month or two head notice in this case he did not do anything wrong except for firing on the spot so you're entitled for the month or two notice other than that no you're not allowed to sue him because this money is haram money for you it's a relationship between an employee and his employer he doesn't like to employ you he may sack you you don't like the work environment you may resign and leave and the issue of not believing that the vaccine is good for you this is your own opinion but the whole humanity had already taken smallpox um polio hepatitis and all these things that we are given when we are children or infants even and nobody is crying wolf so how come when when such an epidemic it's not a pandemic okay i i agree with you but in such a disease that we've seen people and we know people that died because of it and we've seen people have had taken the vaccine and nothing has changed in their lives i'm one of them i took the vaccine six months or five months ago both shots and nothing happened yet i hope i don't die all of a sudden but everybody's taking it everybody i know is taking it and people keep on insisting there's a conspiracy there's a microchip in it it will make you infertile it will make you impotent it will make you this and that and everybody's taking it so making an issue of it maybe one should reassess"
