  "title": "Can we pray behind an imam who makes only one salam in fard prayers? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is is my prayer valid if I pray behind an IM he only gives one Salam at the end of the prayer if so what do I do because all of the message near me just do this is to offer one Salam in F prayer this is a sh opinion and the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam did never offer a Salah with one Salam except in the funeral prayer so if this is something that this man is following a reputable school of thought and I don't know of such a school of thought but if he is and he believes that's only one Salam that is mandated upon him and obligatory and the one the other one is a Sunnah and he skips it you offer the second Salam and your prayer is valid inshallah and it's best that you find a Masjid and an IM that follows the Sunnah uh and Embraces it"
