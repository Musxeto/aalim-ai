  "transcript": "we'll have a mandala him al-hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik Harlan my Barozzi rahmatan lil had a mean nabina muhammad in one other early he was so happy he a Jemaine I'm back dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh one of our mothers the mothers of the believers one of the prophet's wives sallallahu alayhi wa huwa seldom was a woman who underwent a lot of tribulations calamities trouble and problems in her life and she was the daughter of the leader of Quraysh at his time her name was Ramla but she's most famous among the Muslims with her nickname which is um habiba she's Ramla bint ABI Sufyan Obinna Sacrebleu her her mother is Sophia bent AB alas evening Omega she was born 17 years before the first revelation came to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam this means that when the Prophet migrated to Medina she was thirty years of age in the beginning she accepted Islam and she got married to rob a dealer even you Josh even Allah Bob they both accepted Islam and she was pregnant when they decided to flee Mecca and migrate to the scene there she gave birth to her daughter habiba which she is nicknamed by now she was the daughter of Abu Sufyan and whenever the name is spoken people acknowledge him as the head of Quraysh especially after the Battle of Badr where all the dignitaries in the top idol worshipers who led the aggression against Islam were killed so when Abu jahil atre Sheba the sons of Rabia omega m no halluf obey even halluf Aqaba even know Ava Marie all these people were killed in the Battle of better the name of Abu Sufyan resonated all over the place and he was the one who led the Army on the Battle of odd and he was the one to lead all other battles and aggressions against Islam the Muslims so to imagine that his own flesh and blood his own beloved daughter accepts Islam when he is one of the greatest enemies of it it shows how strong her a man was she fled Mecca and her father's oppression to go to a new land to go to people that don't speak her language don't share her traditions and customs while pregnant in a sea journey that was full of danger just to be able to worship allah azza wajal alone she disobeyed her father despite knowing that it is mandatory to obey the father and this is the fork of the road a lot of the Muslims face when they are given the choice between obeying their parents or obeying Allah Almighty any Muslim who submitted his will to Allah knows that there is no obedience to any of the creation and disobeying Allah the Almighty Allah comes first without a second you must obey allah azza wajal no matter what the consequences are so she migrated when they settled in Abyssinia she tells us that she saw a vision and she saw her own husband obeyed Allah in a very bad situation and status he looked awful so she was scared and when she woke up she said to herself by Allah he's not like he used to be but what can go wrong they both were Muslims and they both migrated for the sake of Allah so she saw him soon afterwards after she woke up and he started the conversation by saying o my habib a-- i contemplated upon upon the religion i did not see any religion better than christianity and you as you know i was a christian before then i accepted islam and now I'm telling you that I have gone back to Christianity and as you know that the Abyssinians were all Christians so this may raise the flag on the ruling of migrating to a Christian country or a non-muslim country and the impact that it would have on those who have weak Eman as we see in the second generation of Muslim families that travel and migrate and settle in such non-muslim countries so she told her husband of the dream she saw and how awful and bad he was in it which would be a sign to anyone with intellect that what you're doing is wrong but he did not pay her any attention and he kept on drinking wine getting wasted for the rest of us of his life until he died in Abyssinia as a kafir and an apostate now she left to Abyssinia pregnant defying her father's orders defying her own people fled with her religion trying to worship Allah Azza WA JAL and now she's stranded in a country that she does not speak the language of a foreign country her father opposes her her husband has become an apostate and a Christian and she is on her own yet she was like a mountain that the winds cannot shake she remained steadfast on Islam and she didn't know what Allah had in store for her but Allah definitely wanted to her the best of this dunya and the rest of the era as well in Medina hundreds of and thousands of miles away the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam was not in the dark of what was happening to his companions wherever they were he was the supreme leader and he knew what was happening to his companions and he was following their news and affairs and keeping in touch with them and this shows you that the prophet Ali Salim was not any normal person or any normal leader he was the perfect man the perfect human sallallahu alayhi wa sallam though he was illiterate he could not read and write but if you study his life story and biography you will be shocked of such perfection in terms of human nature the prophet alayhi salatu salam while in Mecca knew every country around him and who was the leader in such countries and how he treated the people and those who came as visitors and this is why when the oppression reached the max the Prophet told the companions to migrate to Abyssinia why not to Egypt why not to the east part of Arabia because the prophet nooh alehissalaam and he told them that that in Abyssinia there is a just ruler a just king people would not be wronged in his presence he's fair and just so the Prophet Isis am knew what was going on he is a responsible official checking on his City so what he was told that habiba a woman of honor and reputation the daughter of Abu Sufyan the head of Quraysh when he heard about the things that she had faced there and how she was patient steadfast and firm on her beliefs the prophet's alaihi salatu salam help came to her as soon as it was possible um habiba says may allah be pleased with her i saw another vision and I saw in the vision someone calling me yeah omen meaning o mother of the believers so I woke up frightened and I interpreted it that the Prophet will marry me Ali his salat wa sallam though it was quite far fetched due to the distance and lack of communication and not before long after her day was over a messenger from the Abyssinian leader and Najah she came to her she was the concubine of Anna Joshi who was in charge of his clothes and his perfume and she said to her my master had sent me to tell you that the prophet alayhi al-salam had send had sent to him to propose for you in marriage so Anna Josh she says what do you say and she said of course I accept that may Allah give you the glad tidings as well so the nagashi the king said then appoint someone to be your guardian and she appointed hardly the necessary domini laus to be her guardian the stories say that she was among the prophet's wives most to receive the dowry where Anna Joshi gave her 400 dinars and lots of perfumes and lust of jewelry in lots of clothes and this was from Anna Joshi himself but it was considered to be the dowry of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam and no other woman the Prophet had married a lesser Sam was over so long distance she got married and came back to Medina on the seventh year of hijra the year of Heiberg which means that she remained with the Prophet as his wife had a solid asylum for four years only when she came to Medina she was one of the prophets honoured wives there is a report or a story that circulates around where her father abu sufian came to visit the Prophet Azam and tried to extend the truce period and then he visited his daughter's house and when he wanted to sit on the mattress she folded it and he was shocked do you want me to sit on the ground I don't know my daughter whether you think that the mattress does not fit me because it's dirty or you think that I am not worthy of sitting on such a mattress and she said that you are a disbeliever and this is the mattress of the Prophet as a son and you must not make it impure by sitting on it this story is quite famous but it is not authentic and therefore we just mentioned it to remind the people to be aware of stories that are not that authentic especially when it comes with dealing with non-muslims which is part of the rulings of Islam so I don't want a son or a daughter to treat his father in a similar way depending on such a story which is not authentic in the first place mother o Habiba may Allah be pleased with her had many stories but one of them that impacted the life of the Prophet as I am and also gave us a ruling in Islam was when she proposed to the prophet alayhi salatu salam to marry her sister as the daughter of a b sofyan and this was whoa we know that she is a jealous woman but how can she do that so the Prophet a Salaam looked at her and said to her would you like me to marry her and she said o prophet of Allah it's not that I don't love you or I would like you to go somewhere else but I heard that you were going to marry someone else so the best one in my view to share with me my love would be my sister rather than a stranger so the prophet sallallaahu Salim said to her this is not lawful for me meaning that a man cannot combine between two sisters and the same marriage this is totally prohibited and the marriage is void so she said to him in this case people are circulating among themselves that you are going to marry dora the daughter of abu Salama and he asked to enquire dora the daughter of own Salama who's my wife and she said yes and he again said by allah if she wasn't my stepdaughter she would still not be halal for me because Abu Salama and myself are brothers tybo the slave woman suckled us when we were infants so she is my niece because her father is my brother do not offer me your daughter's all your sisters so that was the end of it now um Habiba was a woman who followed the teachings of the Prophet Alice or some to the letter and she conveyed that to us and taught the whole Ummah such things when her father died it is normal for people to mourn their loved ones and her father by the way Abu Sufyan accepted Islam on the eighth year of hijra the era of the conquest of Mecca and he became a good companion of the Prophet s Sam and fought battles in the cause of Allah so when he died his daughter mourned him only to order on the third day of his death some perfume which she applied on her sideburns and on on her hands and arms and she explained to those who were around her so that they could convey this knowledge to the Muslims she said by Allah I don't have any interest in getting perfumed but had I not heard the Prophet Alyce of Salaam say it is not permissible for a woman who believes in Allah in the Day of Judgment to mourn over a dead person over three days except if he were her husband then she must mourn for four months and ten days so being my father I had only three days to mourn him according to the hadith and instruction of the Prophet arrazolo salam and hence this is why I asked for the perfume to be of and if you look all around you you will find the Muslims always abiding by the emphatic sunnah prayers and we all know that twelve rak'ahs in the day and the night would build you a house in Jannah this hadith came to us through who it came to us through whom Habiba may allah be pleased with her well the Prophet Alastair Sam said whoever prays during the day in the night twelve rocailles allah will build him a house in paradise for before lahore - after it and - after Maghrib and - after Isha and two before fetcher so she was the one who conveyed this hadeeth to us may Allah be pleased with her and even though she was in good relationships with the other co-wives the other mothers of the believers she was in good relationships with them however when it was time for her to leave this world she sent to Aisha - umm Salama - all the other wives of the Prophet Isis I'm telling them Aisha says o Habiba called me while she was on her deathbed so I came and she said to me you know Aisha as co-wives there must have been something between us and anything that was done I pray to Allah that he forgives me and forgives you whatever we had done so she is telling her issue may Allah be pleased with her that she is setting her free from any liability on the day of judgement as she has forgiven her anything wrong that she had done or said to her Shammi allah be pleased with her reciprocated on the spot and she said may Allah forgive you all of this and may allah azzawajal overlook all of your sins I have made you free from any wrongdoing that came to me through you and she said may allah azzawajal pleased you as you have made me happy and pleased and she sent to all the mothers of the believers the same thing I'm happy by may Allah be pleased with her died in Medina in the year 44 and she was 80 she was 68 years of age and she died in the reign of her brother mahalia even ABI Sufyan the Caliph at that era may allah azzawajal be pleased with her our mother our mother and the wife of the prophet alayhi salatu salam had our lahu eylem when especially in merely aslam was allah who wa sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad why the early he was happy he at Jemaine"
