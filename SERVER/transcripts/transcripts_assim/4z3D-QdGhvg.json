  "title": "What did Abu Hanifa tell us? Following the Hanafi Madhab | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "abu hanifa was one of the tabi it tabe and they would say that he did not travel as much as imam shafi and imam who came later on because as we know imam abu hanifa died in year 150 hijrah while imam shafi was born in the year 150 hijrah did not travel did not go to yemen to syria to egypt to medina to mecca to learn the different hadiths from the tabernin and tabi it tabi who heard it from their their ancestors so his knowledge was limited compared to other uh imams and this is not to downsize him he's one of the greatest imams of all times but he himself told us that whenever you see the hadith of the prophet wasallam then follow it and ignore my own opinion don't listen to my opinion because my opinion is based on the hadith so if the hadith is authentic follow it nowadays the blind followers of the hanafi school of thought don't care whether they follow the quran the sunnah or any tom dick or harry they are so blindly misguided only to follow their books and if they see the quran or the sunnah going against such opinions they are reluctant to abandon their merhab as muslims we respect and honor imam muhammad and muhammad they are all on our heads they are the greatest scholars of islam but whenever they differ we go back to the quran the sunnah as allah ordered us in the quran whenever you dispute over an issue return it back to allah and to the prophet meaning to the quran and to the sunnah"
