  "title": "Eating from fast food joints in NonMuslim countries? The controversyâ€¦",
  "transcript": "the next question is what is the ruling of eating from food joints in non Muslim countries like us and UK you have Minds you have mins on your road people put for you you you all know my opinion and controversy that Scholars from XYZ they are taking and aome I said this in a 15 minute long video on YouTube I Believe that eating the animals that were slaughtered by the people of the book is halal and I stated in my video that in order for me to eat a meat a sheep for example it has to be one slaughtered by a Muslim or a Jew or a Christian two it has to be mentioned the name of Allah three the slaughter watering has to be through the Islamic way which is cutting the arteries and the veins and shedding or making the the blood gash out so now in chapter 5 verse 5B AB says and the consensus of all Scholars of T the slaughtering of the animals that were done by the people of the scriptures is halal for you okay she how do we know that it was slaughtered in America because we have reports that they stun that they kill with a needle or with a nail or with a gun and some of the brothers mallah posted a video saying that this is taken from a facility that supplies meat to McDonald's in America and I look at the video it's somewhere in Africa and it's so primitive and the recording is bad and you can see that the workers are not up to the standards of McDonald's in America so who should I trust a random video now I said the prophet Alat wasam was invited to a ram cooked by a Jewish woman was the intention of this Jewish woman good when she invited the prophet Alam or evil it was evil because she placed a lot of poison in it why she wanted to get rid of the Prophet wasam but if he's a prophet Allah will tell him so he came accepted the invitation brought his friends he did not ask the woman who is Jewish whether this is halal or Haram meaning was it is it slaughtered or you found it falling from a mountain some would say yeah because the default is they only eat kosher they only eat halal meat the only Slaughter that's good that's the default now why wouldn't the prophet suspect when we know that she had ill intent the least would have been that he would ask we know that their monetary income is from what the Jews from riba from ement from eating Haram the prophet did not ask so like the Clinton era don't ask don't tell over a different thing so the prophet went and ateam so now I'm in America and someone invites me to KFC I hate KFC I don't think it's meat seriously it does it's not like a bake if you know okay I'm not endorsing I'll be can you edit this please but KFC is tastly I don't find anything but someone invites me I go do they cook pork no I say bis and E this is not slaughtered I said good how do you know oh they don't Slaughter how do you know we know Sheik we live in America I live in Saudi does this mean that I know all the slaughter houses be realistic so no we heard reports I heard reports that Colgate and closeup toothpaste contain pork and soap contain pork so are you going to refrain there are hundreds of reports um yes but she we saw a video where the cow is being thrown into a machine and it is with flamethrowers come on what is this bring me evidence that can counter this the companions came to the prophet Alat wasam and said oh prophet of Allah people bring us meat and we don't know whether it wasal Oram actually they said we don't know if they mentioned the name of Allah or not the prophet said you mention the name of Allah and eat wouldn't it been easy for the prophet to say h ask them when someone brings you meat ask them did you Slaughter it did you say bah no the prophet said no don't do that don't ask because the default it is what people of the book it is halal now they came up with another strategy okay she they how do you know they there are people of the book America is not a Christian country there are so many atheist there's so many um atheist agnostic agnostic so in in in UK 46% are not Christians so how can you blel it as a Christian country everybody knows that the people of America and the people of Europe are Christians there are agnostics but where will you find a country labeled Christian country you will not find that and the same ideology and analogy would be a applied in let's say turkey how many Muslims are in turkey and how many agnostic and atheists so if I go to Turkey I cannot eat in the restaurants because I don't know oh she no one among the Christians Say bah is that true but the Ayah says do not eat from what other than Allah's name was mentioned and this is one of the interpretation ations of the of because the meat we eat in Kuwait you insist that I will not eat this until I hear the butcher sayah allahar or you will eat it who Among Us say I will not eat meat until I hear it with my ears nobody so if I go to Pakistan would I refrain because some of them might be from different Cults or grave worshippers or this or that so I'm not going to eat any come on the religion is easy it's simple if you don't want to eat in America or Europe good for you be my guest be vegetarian eat seafood but when I eat a big T-bone steak medium well with a a mushroom sauce you don't come and say oh sh shame on you I am following the Quran and the Sunnah and by the way this is the fat of and and some of the brothers they brought the fatwa to counter my argument and said listen to the F you listen to it and the fatwa is exactly what I said but then they say but if you are quote unquote certain that it was not slaughtered see the Sheik says if you were certain I said okay are you certain this meat provided for you by this restaurant are you certain and able to stand on the day of judgment and say this T-bone steak was not slaughtered so no no but she we've seen the fat is clear if you're certain refrain if you're not certain what do we do the Quran and the Sunnah says say if you don't want to eat yeah don't eat just leave me alone please and Allah Knows Best"
