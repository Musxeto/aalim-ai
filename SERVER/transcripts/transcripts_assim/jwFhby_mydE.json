  "transcript": "Fahim from India. Sheikh, if I come late to the masjid and the imam is in sujood or elsewhere, what's according to sunnah I should do? Should I wait for him to come back or what should I do? The sunnah is whenever you come to the masjid and the imam is in a particular pillar of the prayer, whether in ruku, whether in sujood, whether in tashahud, you have to offer takbeerat al-ihram, Allahu Akbar, and follow that imam. Although this rak'ah is not valid, but you must follow the imam in wherever he is. What about if he is in the last tashahud? Say Allahu Akbar and sit and join him. What about if he is going to finish in five seconds? Say Allahu Akbar and join him. Once he gives salam, you stand up and pray the prayer that you've missed. Isn't it best for us to wait until he offers salam and then join another congregation? The answer is no. You're a late comer. Don't add insult to injury. You have to join him with whatever position he's in and Allah azza wa jal knows best."
