  "transcript": "samina says if i do not praise allah while fasting are my fasts valid this is an issue that we spoke about a lot stating that these are two different things if you don't pray at all then you're not a muslim you're a disbeliever a person who does not pray a single prayer prayer period he's not a muslim because he falls under the category of the hadith the oath that's between us and them or the pledge that's between us and them is prayer whoever abandons prayer is a kafir but if a person prays on and off we do not come to him and say don't fast no keep on fasting hoping that he would continue to do that afterwards and allah knows best finally"
