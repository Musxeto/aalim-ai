  "transcript": "from india he says if the three major schools of thought say that there is no zakat on gold that a woman wears and i am not following a particular madhab can i choose this opinion the answer is no if you don't follow a particular madhhab this means that you are one of two either you are a person from hadith who follows the evidence from the quran and sunnah wherever it may be regardless of the school of thought in this case you have to look into evidences of the three schools of thought and the evidence of the school of thought that says it is mandatory to pays a cat whether a woman wears it or not or you are a a person who follows his whims and desires so he is cherry picking he is fatwa shopping he goes with his cart and says okay let's see what the schools of thought say about this particular issue i don't like this this one looks good let me take it and they have an offer take one free as well this is not permissible this is not religion of allah so either you follow one of the schools of thought and stick to it if you're a layman or if you're a student of knowledge then you have to look into their evidences and follow what the evidences state faith you"
