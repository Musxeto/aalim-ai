  "transcript": "and this can make it or break it for you believe me the depression you have the intimidation the anxiety you're going through the confusion the many times you felt that you need to commit suicide and end your life all of this would vaporize it will all disappear once you give yourself a chance to believe whether this religion is true or not and once you find out it's true then you will find the eternal peace in this life and in the hereafter inshallah and that is the truth if you're a christian if you're a jew if you are a follower of any other religion i urge you to do your due diligence take only half an hour of your time in your life just to look at what islam preaches if someone comes to you with an investment and tells you that this investment the return of it is five hundred folds and the possibility of loss is zero and he said nah there's nothing like this wouldn't you be regretful and remorseful if in two three years time you see your friends who had invested in it are now multi-millionaires while you are where you are wouldn't you have hoped that you gave half an hour just to look into it and to study it islam is far more than that islam is your salvation you have to study half an hour be objective ignore the issue of hijab polygamy the things that are controversial to some who don't know what is the wisdom behind that ignore all of that all what you have to do is look at what islam preaches meaning what are the good things in islam one percent five percent ten percent thirty percent eighty percent and it's more than that but i'll assume it is eighty percent only what are the bad things you don't like about islam twenty percent now if you try to look into other religions you will find it reversed or even worse you'll find that what you like in other religions is less than 20 and when you dislike and disapprove is more than 80 yet it is human nature to make a choice is difficult islam is a religion of nature meaning that it's a natural thing it calls your nature it talks to your nature it addresses your natural needs unlike other religions that prohibit you from getting married prohibiting you from doing this or that while your natural needs acquire it then why aren't you thinking about islam now this is the warning of the prophet you may say but what's in islam is also found in christianity and judaism it's not the same islam has the divine miracle that will remain until the day of judgment islam started about 14 centuries ago and it's the fastest religion in the world the spread of islam is huge masha'allah and it's enormous what is the miracle of islam when people come and say okay jesus christ gave life to the death cured the lipid and the blind and the death and the mute and he had so many miracles musa peace be upon him had the staff that turned into a snake he had the ability to split this the sea so that he would cross with the sons of israel while drowning pharaoh and his troops he had many miracles other religions claimed the same muslims believe in most of this if not all because it's mentioned in the quran it's mentioned in the sunnah however we usually tell the people that we would like you to prove to us that these miracles did take place and they did exist usually people are stunned they can't prove any of this because there are no deaf blind leopards there are no dead to be brought back to life all these miracles were limited to a specific space and time and these miracles have gone with the death or with the ascension of the messenger as in the case of jesus peace be upon him we don't believe that he died no muslim believes that he was ever killed or harmed or died so all of these religions cannot prove their religion their miracles while muslims are proud to always present the quran that has remained for 14 to 15 centuries unchanged it's the same quran that was revealed to the prophet the miracle is that it is preserved in the chest of men and women they memorize it by heart letter by letter and it's written in millions and millions of copies allah almighty has pledged upon himself and guaranteed that he would preserve this quran by saying [Music] it is we allah says who have bestowed this reminder who have revealed this quran from on high and it is we who shall preserve it intact and allah kept his pledge without any doubt now one person like me who's been leading prayers almost for the past 33 years as an imam imagine that if i were to go and pray isha prayer tonight and i make a mistake in the recitation of the quran a nine-year-old child praying behind me can easily correct me by raising his voice where everyone in the masjid can hear him and reciting the verse correctly a nine-year-old younger than my grandchildren yet he corrects me because this is part of allah azza keeping the quran intact you know how many people memorize the quran in the world they are in the tens of millions tens of millions of muslims memorize the quran by heart 300 to 400 million muslims speak the language of the quran and their natives if not more and there are few hundred millions more non-natives who speak the arabic fluently so the quran was preserved the language is still spoken and preserved what more evidence do you need you want scientifical scientific evidences you can go through the various articles talking about the miracles that the quran hinted to why do i say hint it to because the quran is not a book of science it's not a book of geology or astronomy or embryology but it gives you signs that prove to you that this is impossible to be manmade a layman from arabia who had never traveled outside of arabia who had never studied in colleges or universities when he puts forward such a miracle a book that provides spiritual guidance that provides scientific theories miracles facts that scientists still date are struggling and confused how this is possible and when you fail as a human being to acknowledge that this is from allah this is not man-made simply because the prejudice in your chest the arrogance the pride of accepting a religion that does not suit your ancestors and was not practiced by your parents this is the separation between hell and heaven and this choice is yours so every non-muslim should be fair to themselves take half an hour of your life not of your day just take half an hour to talk about islam ask any of the duat the callers to islam the scholars the students of knowledge the imams of the masjid about any doubt you have you can come to me ask me about islam if i know i will tell you if i don't i would say i don't know i'm not going to lie to you what would i lie to you and put myself in hell or in harm's way this doesn't make any sense so take half an hour of your whole life and devote it objectively to figure out whether islam is true or false in comparison to the religion you actually believe today and this can make it or break it for you believe me the depression you have the intimidation the anxiety you're going through the confusion the many times you felt that you need to commit suicide and end your life all of this would vaporize it will all disappear once you give yourself a chance to believe whether this religion is true or not and once you find out it's true then you will find the eternal peace in this life and in the hereafter insha allah"
