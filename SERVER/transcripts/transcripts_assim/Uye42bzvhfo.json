  "transcript": "while watching the new moon sighting it felt like a good lighting this day is all right as the first start we here T night with family around a nice meal we're making do I I feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love oh we are studying the book of and to be specific the chapter that deals with fasting and this program is the virtues of of fasting and yesterday we took the first Hadith and inshallah today we will try our level best to go through the first and the second Hadith together but before we go into this issue some of the brothers were asking why was fasting prescribed not on the same spot not directly but rather on stages and the answer is that Allah the almighty is all wise and all knowledgeable and he knows what is best for his servants and that is why there are a number of cases where things were obligated on durations on steps there were things that were made easier there were things that were made a little bit more difficult and there were things that would be made prohibited after being not recommended before being uh permissible and so on for example Allah Asel in the very beginning made intoxicants permissible for people to consume so the companions used to drink alcohol wine but then a verse came because some of them did not feel good about it and Allah said that intoxicant and gambling there are benefits in them and there are lots of uh uh evil things and the evil far exceeds the benefits but it was not made prohibited and on a third incident Allah Asel restricted the time ofe of uh um consuming intoxicants by saying that you should not approach prayer while in the state of intoxication ation you must not pray while you are intoxicated so this meant that you could pray for you could probably be drunk for like six seven hours at night time after before fud then you would sober up and then came the final Ayah which made it totally prohibited until the day of judgment when Allah the almighty told us that it is uh uh the doing in and the works of Shan so this is is totally prohibited wine gambling the lots and the idols Are all uh from the evil uh works of Shan likewise with prayer at the very beginning Muslims used to only pray night prayer five daily prayers were not prescribed until like six or seven months and when the prophet Alam got the Revelation and he got the instruction of the 5050 prayers a day which Allah with his Mercy reduced it to five prayers a day then this became final with fasting it was the same thing when the prophet came to Medina sallallahu alaih wasallam he found that the Jews used to fast the day of Ash the 10th of the first month of the Islamic calendar and the idol worshippers and the people of also used to fast it when they were in Mecca probably for a different reason so when he saw thisat as a continuation of something that was good as a sign of gratitude and allegiance to Moses the prophet ordered everyone to fast Ash and it was a it was mandatory and this was only for one year and then the obligation for fasting the month of Ramadan abrogated the instruction to fast Ash so it is not mandatory to fast ashur anymore but it is highly recommended it expat the sins of a whole year as the prophet Alam gave us the Glad Tiding and then Ramadan was made mandatory but those who had the financial means could have bought their way out by feeding one poor person so it was optional whether you fast or you pay but then afterwards this was abrogated and it is mandatory for all to fast except in the case of a traveler someone who's ill for an old uh uh woman or man who are unable to fast so this is one of the reasons of uh um having it over stages not uh uh directly making it a must from the very beginning we go on to Hadith number one which we read yesterday and this Hadith is narrated by Abu Hur may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophet of Allah sallai wasam said none of you should fast a day or two before the beginning of the month of Ramadan unless it is a day on which one is in the habit of fasting that is voluntary fasting that coincides with that day and this Hadith was agreed upon which means that it holds the highest level of authenticity reported by bukari and also reported by Imam Muslim we spoke about this Hadith a bit yesterday and now it is time to take the second Hadith so Hadith number two in the chapter that deals with fasting this Hadith was narrated byar Yas may Allah be pleased with him and with his father he said that whoever fasts the day of doubt he has then disobeyed abulm this is Hadith number two it should be uh displayed on the screen hopefully within a few seconds Hadith number two Amar y said may Allah be pleased with him whoever fasts the day of doubt he has then disobeyed abim that is the nickname of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam now in these two hadiths we find that the first Hadith of Abu Hur the prophet tells usat you should not precede Ramadan by fasting a day or two and from the Hadith ofar may Allah be pleased with him we understand that there is a Prohibition of fasting what is known as the day of Doubt so we when we look at these two hadiths we get a clearer picture first of all the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam prohibited preceding Ramadan by fasting one day or two days so this means that if you fast 3 days before Ramadan this is okay yeah if I fast on the 26th of Ramadan or the 27th let me rephrase that if I fast on the 26th of shaan which is three days or four days before Ramadan then this is permissible and the answer is correct this is totally permiss missible but what do we learn from this it's very easy a lot of the questions that come they quote a Hadith where they say that the prophet said when it is mid of shaan do not fast so a lot of the Muslims when it comes to the 15th of shaan they stop fasting and some even Scholars and jurors who do not have sufficient knowledge in Hadith they thought that this Hadith was was authentic so they went ahead and Justified it and said yes because if you fast the second half of shaan you'll be tired and you will not be able to uh fast Ramadan with full enthusiasm and uh uh strength but they failed to indicate that one of the most important things in our religion is that we do that we depend on Quran and authentic Sunnah and there are a lot of hadiths that are not authentic and who would tell that these hadiths are authentic or not the scholars of Hadith like if I have a problem with my tooth I would not go to a a mechanic I would not go to a doctor that a neurosurgeon for example because he would not know anything about it he's an expert in his field but not in the other fields of medicine likewise in uh uh knowledge a scholar in Hadith is highly needed to tell us that this Hadith is authentic or it is not authentic where we take this Hadith and then give it to a juror a scholar of F and he would bring us the benefits and the issues and the verdicts from that Hadith so the Hadith is not authentic when uh it is med of Shan do not fast this is not authentic and the evidence about for this is this Hadith of abur because the prophet forbade us from fasting one or two days before Ramadan but any more than that it is permissible and this is or this was his action sallallahu alaihi wasallam he used to fast a lot of shahan if not all of it so there's no problem in that again if a woman has missed days of previous Ramadan and she was caught and there was not enough time for her except a day or two before Ramadan to make up for these M days there's no problem why because the prohibition is clarified in the Hadith ofar the prophet saidat wasam in the Hadith of uhar Yas or actually Amar Yasir himself said to us whoever fasts the day of doubt he has then disobeyed abim one would say if this is the Hadith ofar why are we reporting it it's not the prophet who said this Alam in the science of Hadith there are two types of Hadith one is known as and this is related and attributed to the prophet so when we say that this isi immediately you know that this is the prophet's words and there is a Hadith that is known as and the terminology immediately is known to the students of knowledge and to the schols that this is the saying of a companion not the prophet Alat am and like Imam Abu hanifah the great Imam over Islam Abu hanifah said may Allah have mercy on his soul when we get the evidence from the Quran and the Sunnah this is on the top of our heads we have no say at all and we when we have the agreement among the companions on something this is on the top of our head we have no say they are the companions of the Prophet Alam but when we have the opinion of the followers of the companions then they are men and we are men so when we have a Hadith that was reported or narrated by a companion and he's not relating it to the prophet Alat wasam this is his opinion we have to look at the other companions did they they agree with him if no one contradicted him no one went against his opinion then his opinion op is valid we have to follow it but if they conflicted they had different of uh uh opinions among themselves in this case we have to go back to the Quran and Sunnah and to see which one is following it more and then take his uh uh opinion and follow it so here is this Hadith of his or is when he said that whoever fasts the day of doubt he has disobeyed abim the prophet now can this be said out of his own desires and whim scholar said that this is not a Hadith that is this is not AI this is a why because such things are not said by your own desire or by your own opinion especially when you attribute it to the prophet Alat wasam and therefore the Hadith has the rulle of Al likewise the Hadith of Abu for example may Allah be peace with him when thean has been called in a Masjid where he was and a man went out of the Masjid he said as for this person he has disobeyed the prophet Alat wasam and this isur because the prophet Alam as Abu is telling us indirectly said that whoever goes out of the Masjid after the aan has been called then he's sinful so we take this as it is now what is the day of doubt that Amar is referring to is it a day or two before Ramadan the answer is no the day of doubt and this is the most authentic opinion and this is the opinion of the majority of school schools of thought they say that the day of Doubt is the 30th of shaan because the 29th of Shaban is definitely of Shaban and let me remind you of a Hadith the prophet saidat the month is this or this so it is either 29 or 30 days we don't have a month that is 28 and we don't have a month that is 31 so the month can either be 29 or TW or 30 days long so when the prophet is telling usam that whoever fasts the day of Doubt then he has become sinful the day of Doubt can only be the 30th of Shaban because on the 29th after Sunset we go and try to detect and site the moon and if we do not see the Crescent either because it's not born yet or because there were uh uh um clouds blocking our vision or there lots of uh wind and dust and Etc in this case the following day by default becomes the 30th and because it is the 30th there might be someone who would think that let me be safe rather than sorry tomorrow is the 30th and it might be the first of Ramadan we could not see the Crescent so I'm going to fast tomorrow now doing this act saying that you want to be safe rather than sorry is an innovation because if it were a good thing to do the prophet would have done itat and if it were a good thing to do you would not have been sinful when who says how am I sinful well the answer is easy you have disobeyed the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam and whoever disobeys the prophet Alam has disobeyed Allah and this is a a clear sin so it is an innovation and it is a sin as well one says what's the innovation in it and this is a big topic the issue of innovation Muslims are so confused about understanding it that they do not go back to the sources to understand the dangers of innovation and it is sufficient for you to know that by fasting the day of doubt you are innovating because Allah says the almighty and whoever Witnesses the month that is of Ramadan he should fast you didn't witness the month of Ramadan but you're still fasting just to be safe rather than sorry it is exactly like those who refrain from eating and drinking half an hour before the aan of F and they call it why are you doing this said just to be safe okay if you want to be safe can you pray now said no you have to wait until the fuder is being called for the aan then this is the actual Innovation that you are doing and this is not uh permissible so what to do well it's very easy the prophet told us in a authentic that if you were blocked from seeing the Crescent if you were unable to detect and sight the birth of the new moon in this case you have to complete the month of shaan to become 30 days this is a crystal clear Hadith that tells you if you were unable to detect the 29th the the moon then tomorrow by default is the 30th of shaan and this makes life easy easy because and we will come to discuss this inshallah maybe tomorrow when we talk about the sighting of the Moon and how it is detected things in Islam are very easy it's they're not difficult unlike other religions for example how do we detect the beginning and the end of the months of the lunar year in the hij calendar any Layman could detect this by observing the moon When You observe the moon and you see the birth of it this is the first day in the middle of the month we have the white days so the moon is full and complete at the end of the month the Moon is disappearing the Crescent is disappearing once we see it again then this is the beginning of the new month no way any person could detect this in the Gregorian calendar without a calendar without your calendar to know which day it is there's it's impossible for you to detect what day it is Islam makes things easy for all what about time times of prayer Islam is very easy it's the easiest around any Layman a bedwin in the desert could detect the time of prayer so fer is distinguished when you see the first light of the break of dawn prayer is when you detect the Sun as it goes away from its Zenith and it goes a little bit to the west and if you have an erected object it has a shadow to the east this is the time of when the erected object's shade is equal to its length this is a time of when it is twice as long this is the the end of the recommended time of ass when the sun sets this is the end of altogether and the beginning of M prayer when the redness in the Horizon in the direction of the west where the sun had set disappears then this is the time of is till the middle of the night that is that is it you don't need a watch you don't need alarm clock you don't need anything you can figure out the timings of prayer even if you're flying on a an airplane it's very easy to just look out of the window and detect whether it's time for f or not the ETC is the same thing and this shows you the Simplicity of Islam that it is a religion for all it's not for clergymen or for priests or for monks or for uh astronomers or for uh any Tom Dicker Harry it's for all likewise when you come to something that people need it has to be made easy for them to get so everyone needs to breathe and that is why Allah has made air available for for all you don't have to be a rocket scientist to get some air all what you have to do is inhale and breathe now our need to water is less though it's great and that is why you have to look a little bit for water around you but you'll find water with the grace of Allah and in Islam everything is like this people die what to do do we have to pay a fortune and to get a band marching behind uh uh uh car Caravans and and whatever do we have to do this do we have to pay a lot of money for a head uh uh Stone and and to build Marbles and set no no no it's very easy we prepare our loved ones when they die in less than two to three hours wash them perfume them shroud them in three uh pieces of cloth and offer funeral prayer take them to the graves and dig it six feet under and that's it end of the story end of a life and the beginning of many more people when they want to get married it is very easy made easy for them the father says to the proposing guy I give you my daughter in marriage he says I I accept her marriage the presence of two witnesses or more of the same religion or all of them and that is it she's married she's your wife go ahead and people need this Simplicity rather than lots and lots of complications in their lives so likewise you do not become more Roman than the Romans Allah tells you to fast when the moon is cited you should not exceed and say no I'd like to be safe rather than sorry Allah tells you to wash your limbs maximum three times when performing W it is prohibited for you to say listen I'll add one more just in case no this is Haram this is an innovation so you have to go back to the basis do whatever the Prophet Alam did and follow him follow his footsteps and you'll be uh uh safe inshallah Amar may Allah be pleased with him said that whoever fasts the day of doubt he has disobeyed abim now who's abim this is the nickname of the Prophet Alat wasam he had Alim who died in his lifetime he had Abdullah he had ibraim and he had his four daughters that you know of rum uh Zab and Fatima may Allah be pleased with them all and he used to be known as abim the Restriction was that no one who was at the time of the Prophet alham can be called abim this was especially for him sallallahu alaihi wasallam after his death it is permissible to call yourself Abul kasim even if your name is Muhammad or not this is up to you is it Sunnah to have a nickname yes it is Abu Hur for example uh ABD may Allah be pleased with him he was called Abu Hur and he didn't have a son by the name of Hur Hur is the short and small form of a cat a kitten but he used to carry one in his sleeves so he was called after it Abu Bakr never had a son by the name of Bakr AA herself was named um abdah and she didn't have any children but she was named after Abdullah Zu her nephew the son of asak so even the prophet when he visited s sallallahu alaihi wasallam an Malik and he had the younger brother he used to nickname him and he says and imaf said may Allah have mercy on his soul I spent a whole night contemplating on this Hadith and I got about 80 benefits out of it 80 different rulings out of this phrase the prophet is playing with this young child who was saddened because a bird a a bird died in a cage so he said oh you child what did the bird do so Imam Shafi got like 80 benefits among them is that it's permissible to keep birds and cages uh even if they die as long as you take care of them it's permissible to hunt in Medina unlike Mecca it's so many things so it is permissible and it's part of the Sunnah to give names uh uh or nicknames uh even if a person does not have a child uh for this we have a short break and after that we will receive your phone calls so stay tuned assalamu alaykum and welcome back uh Muhammad sent an email saying that is it kufur to be a part of an organization that promotes ideas such as premixing equal gender rights between men and women the United Nation Declaration of Human Rights and other code of Ethics that contradict the Shar for the reasons that it could be muat or judging by other than the Shar or rejection of Islam this is a long topic that needs a lot of uh elaboration and I believe we have two callers on the line but I'll give it to you in short the issue of Tak or labeling something to be kufur or not it is becoming an obsession to a lot of the Muslims unfortun Ely and this is a gateway to Shan when he takes people overboard so yes ruling other than the sh can be kuur as mentioned inah and can be and it can be F so yes it can be kufur but as interpreted by IB Abbas may Allah be pleased with him that it is not the major kufur it's kufur that it is minor and it depends if someone legislates something thinking that is is better than the Shar this is total kufur if he thinks that it's equivalent to the religion of Allah this is kufur but if he does it out of following his own whims and desires this is not kufur if he does it because he is a transgressor he's making zul he wants to keep something for his uh self for himself and to deprive others from their rights this is not kufur and you shouldn't always get involved in this without looking into the conditions that must be fulfilled for kufur to be given and the obstacles that must be prevented that prevents people from being labeled with kufur and it it's a long topic maybe we'll come to discuss it later on inshallah Mah from Saudi yes yes M what can I do for youum to you as well just I want to clarify one question regarding esterday I have heard the regarding the zamzam water standing drinking the zamzam water while standing is uh is Sunnah or I don't have any authentication Hadith for this so can you clarify this okay okay I will inshallah thank you AA from Saudi I have two questions yes if we did not make our on mik I ask tomorrow this question then we have to slaughter an animal so we do we have to slaughter it only on in Makkah okay and my second question is can a Muslim do business with a non-muslim okay okay thank you're welcome okay first question of mm what's the ruling on drinking zamzam standing up is it a Sunnah the prophet did itat and we have to know that what the prophet did sallallahu alaih wasallam is divided into two types something that is highly recommended and it's called Sunnah and something that he did out of his human nature so or out of the culture so when the prophet saysat wasam go against the five worshippers the Jews and the Christians grow your beards and trim your mustaches one would not say that this is a Sunnah one would say that this is an obligation because it's an instruction of the Prophet Alat he used to do it he instructed instructed us to uh do it as well now when we come to the issue of wearing a turban never ever the the prophet wasam recommended this and it was a cultural thing so it is not mandatory would I be rewarded for it not necessarily it depends on the culture if you live in a place that no one covers their head and you want to cover your head this is going against the culture why do it then says oh the Sunnah the prophet did it okay yeah but the prophet also went from one place to another on his mule so would you go to your job riding a mule said no no this is not not logical said yeah because this is cultural this is the things that they used to do so uh drinking Zam Zam while standing up the prophet did itam he didn't recommend us to do it but if you do it then you're not sinful because he had done it sallallahu alai wasallam we have uh um Alia from Saudi asalam alikum allum Salam uh Sheik I have two questions yes uh while fasting can we use toothpaste uh not every day only when we miss suur is it permissible and uh second question uh my daughter she is 9 and2 years old she is doing har Mah she knows a very big surra she want to lead prayer in Jama like only when ladies are there at the time of for and Salah so is it permissible for her to do this okay um AA from Saud Arabia she says that she called yesterday and she and her family performed their they did not assume their from the mik so what's the ruling in that and the answer was they have to pay experation by slaughtering a sheep in Mecca area in the Haram area and the meat must be distributed to the poor people around the Haram area only it cannot be done in jeda her second question was what's the ruling on working with a non-muslim in business business this is permissible there's nothing wrong in that however you should uh first of all make sure that he's trustworthy and it is best to deal with Muslims all the time Your Allegiance should be to Muslims but if this is uh a good opportunity and the man is trustworthy and he would not deal in Haram and he knows the boundaries where Islam cannot cross then this is inshallah permissible omia from Saudi Arabia she says what's ruling on us using toothpaste while fasting there's no problem in that inshallah providing you make sure that you do not swallow any of that toothpaste and you wash your uh mouth you Rin your mouth thoroughly and her child is n and a half years old uh and she is mallah or she memorizes at least more than the other ladies can she um lead the prayer um lead her mother her aunties her uh sisters as long as they're all females this is permissible and it can also be recommended as well alhamdulillah uh Fatima says if we hurt someone's feelings unintentionally is it necessary to seek forgiveness from them or seeking forgiveness from Allah is enough my mother-in-law criticizes me often and spreads things about me which are not true I feel hurt when she does that and sometimes don't reply when she talks to me or I sometimes complain to my husband about her I feel guilty for behaving like this since she is older than me well Fatima the prophet sallallah alaihi wasallam said that sin is what itches you from inside and you don't want people to know about it this is burden and sin how would I know that this is sinful or not how do you feel about it you're telling me you feel so bad about it and definitely you don't want people to know that you behave like this with your mother-in-law and it is worth saying that a lot of the sisters fail to communicate with their mothers-in-law and the issue is this woman is not there to stay she's going to die soon because she's older than you you know statistically speaking usually she would die before you do so without you killing her of course uh you have to gain your husband's heart and gain her heart as well by being kind and tolerant so that you would not lose it once you try your level best to tolerate her and remember that your mother also has a daughter-in-law and you would not like your uh uh sister-in-law to deal with your mother in the same way that you're dealing with your mother-in-law maybe she's wrong I give that to you but this doesn't justify you going down to her level why not Excel why not let her rise to your level and face her abuse with tolerance with kindness with a big smile maybe this would not work for a week or two a month or two but eventually she would feel ashamed of her actions in the way is dealing and she would uh come to good terms with you so I believe that you should try your level best to seek the her forgiveness be kind to her tomorrow Allah knows maybe you're going to be a mother-in-law and what whatever you invest today you're going to find the benefits of uh in the future inshallah M from Saudi hello we from from Medina and as be on the way to Makkah to do the umra and she because she was taking a tablet to stop the period okay and uh now she's seeing that the de is not the period but she see the dirty and every one after one day and is she okay to do the um okay any more questions uh no thanks okay I will answer you inshallah Nadia from Saudi hello radan and back to you as well she I have a question that I want to invite uh uh two three families for AAR so my house is not that much big so my husband asked my neighbor he's his colleague uh and ask his to give him one room just for uh tomorrow like after time but my question that he is not a Muslim so we want to arrange our gents to in his room uh but the food is served of course from me so is it permissible for them to eat in his house like especially for Ramadan in a star time okay the food is of course from us but uh only his room we will use so is it permissible and if it is permissible are we allowed to ask him also to come and have food with us as he's not a muslim okay I will ask you I will answer your questions inshallah okay thank you very much you're welcome M from Saudi Arabia says that his wife assumed from Medina from the mik AL or as it's known and she is taking tablets to stop her period but now she is beginning to see spotting or what is known as brownish uh discharge alra so uh does she refrain uh from fasting and from continuing her omra the answer is no she may go ahead with her om and she may continue to fast until she sees the flow of the blood this is a drop or two of blood does not uh uh consist or does not make a woman in the um the S of mensis but when the flow of blood appears then this is her mensis so she can go ahead inshallah without any problem Nadia from Saudi Arabia she says that they have Anar party tomorrow and they're inviting uh their families but they don't have enough space in their small house their neighbor is not Muslim and he volunteered or they asked him for a room and he agreed so is this permissible the answer is yes no problem alhamdulillah uh being a non-muslim does not make his house uh something that is filthy or you should not go there it's a house like any other house and should we invite him definitely you should what kind of dawa is this if you take the man's room and you invite your families and you tell them don't eat with us what kind of of of of picture are you giving to him about Islam Islam is a dean of generosity it tells you it recommends you it encourages you even to send him food onar when he's in his house send him food every couple of days give him food this is your display of generosity of Islam but when you don't see the guy don't meet him you don't offer him any greetings when you see him you just you frown in his face you cfir disbeliever I'm going to kill you I'm going to step on your stomach or whatever and when you need him or you need his room you kindly and courteously ask him politely to uh allow you and then you don't want to feed him no this is completely unacceptable go ahead and uh do that inshallah um Abdul a says I wanted to know whether we can fast while traveling if not then why can you you explain this this will come inshallah later on but one of the excuses for not fasting is to not be able or to have something that prevents you from doing this and Allah has Exempted a traveler and a sick person from fasting telling them to make up for the M days later on but fast but traveling is is is not all the same so there are levels of traveling if while traveling if you fast this becomes dangerous for your health hazardous for the health of those uh with you then it becomes totally prohibited as in the case of a person flying from uh West from east to the West which means that he's running after the Sun the day becomes like 20 20 20 plus hours and the Sun never sets and he is the pilot and the flight is not double crew or augmented he's the only solo and if he does not drink coffee and if he's not aware maybe he would uh uh have a crash uh uh with a plane and those with him in this case it is totally prohibited a surgeon who insists on fasting while making uh uh his surgery and he knows that this affects his precision no this is prohibited because he has a need to break the fast maybe the the surgeon bit let us keep this a little bit off this let's talk about a traveler the second type is a person who travels it's not harmful for him to fast but there is hardship so really he's going to be really tired in this case it is highly recommended for him to uh fast we have a caller from Sudan Abu Bakr yes yes Abu Bakr what can I do for youum yeah hian H just uh I have a question yes Abu Bakr listen to me from the phone please and mute your television yeah okay uh yes I have question okay uh if I come to kdom of Saudi Arabia and if I don't beginning in and I have my brother in our house in can I go to from direct and I'm going to begin after that come mea no you should assume your when you pass the mikat so if you are coming directly from Sudan to jeda crossing the uh uh the sea without passing by any kind of mikat then your mikat becomes Jed itself yeah I know that but you cannot exceed jeda and go to and then make it from there because you have initiated your and you intended it before uh reaching there so you should make it from jeda and Allah knows best yeah thank you you're welcome uh tazin from bahin to you yeah I just want to know uh regarding the FD in the banks the the what the fixed deposit the fixed deposit in the bank okay okay that uh the money what uh I have put some money in the bank and with the interest money I help the poor people is it permissible or no okay any more questions uh no that's all and this is very important uh Shake please answer this I will I'll be waiting for the reply I will inshallah thank you thank you you're welcome abdulaziz um question about traveling uh the third scenario would be if a person travels but while fasting in his journey he has no hardship and no harm none whatsoever in the case it is highly recommended for him to fast why because he would be fasting during the month of Ramadan and it is easier for him to fast when everybody else is fasting and he would gain the reward of the month of Ramadan rather than making it up in other months though he has the permission though he is capable of skipping it and fasting it elsewhere but it is highly recommended for him to fast it uh with the grace of Allah sh from Canada I have a question my neighbor is a Drews um I'm very scared to mix around with him I I've heard so much about them I don't know whether they're Muslims or they're not Muslims whether we allowed to um sit with them or not okay so if you could clarify that I would really appreciate that okay I will do that inshallah thank you very much you're welcome um tazin from bahin she says what is the ruling on fixed deposit uh uh investments in the banks and this if I'm yeah not mistaken it's like bringing a 100,000 um dollars and putting it at this bank for a fixed time let's say six months a whole year where I'm not entitled to to to withdraw anything from it and they give me a fixed percentage this is totally prohibited this is riba this is the actual interest now she is saying that I'm taking the interest and I'm helping the poor with it now this is not permissible because if it were to be done by force then yes take them interest and give it to the poor but in bahin you have Islamic bankingsales and you have conventional bankingsales uh of of someone who's using usury and this is not permissible in Islam abdan from Saudi asalam alayum Salam uh shik I have one question my father's brother my uncle that is he died last month and uh my auntie she had to complete 4 months 10 days according to the the period uh like but she she kept her daughter's marriage in between her the period so my parents are allowed to attend that marriage uh I just want to know this so you're not asking about her you're asking about your parents yeah about her also as she can uh do this okay I will answer you insh okay um Shams from Canada she's asking that she has a neighbor who is from the durus and he's a Dury so what is the ruling on interacting with him she said him well first if he's a Muslim or a non-muslim it is prohibited for you as a female to interact with him he's not a Mah so this issue of you know having it easy and and having fun or just interacting no this is not permissible in Islam as he is from the uh Cult of the duus they are not Muslims and and they um don't have a religion related to Islam they only fast I think 19 days they have no prayer they have no pilgrimage they have zakat given and they claim that there's a treaty between them and the prophet Alam witnessed by Salman Etc it's all fabricated and they believe in reincarnation um so you can be a human being now but in a previous life you were a fish that's why you like swimming Etc all of these things are contradictory to Islam it's Blasphemous to believe their beliefs so they are not Muslims you cannot eat from their slaughtering and you cannot read Salam to them uh Mahmud from Saudi Arabia I have a question there is this is it is the the last is it used for stopping me from s or I can eat after they okay I will answer your question inah om abdan from Saudi Arabia she says that um her uncle died and the marriage of her cousin Falls within the period of her uh uh uncle's wife so she's asking what's the ruling on attending such a wedding the wedding itself has nothing to do with the death of your uncle so your cousin could marry without any problem find mean men in the same place no music no photography or video uh taking of the women's um part if everything is Islamic and segregated your parents can attend the wedding without any problem as well as you but for the weow for the mother of that uh uh bride it is totally prohibited for her to go out of her house and attend such a uh an occasion especially that she would put on makeup wear beautiful clothes and put her go jewelry probably all of this is totally prohibited in normal cases what about uh uh if it is uh uh in a wedding this defies the purpose of the period which is four months and 10 days to honor the deceased so this is totally prohibited for your uncle's wife Muhammad says that when the aan is called till when can I eat the answer is Allah did not tell us about the aan Allah told us about recognizing the the fer the dawn the break of dawn and the the white thread from the black which is the whole night so there are two types of dawn the false Dawn and the true dawn the true dawn is the horizontal one the false Dawn which is about 10 to 15 minutes earlier which is vertical and it soon disappears so this light once it you see it on the hilltops and and the Horizon this is the break of dawn you should train now in the city we don't have this ly because Dawn is everywhere with the lights city lights and and Etc that is why we Depend and rely on the MU on the man calling the aan so if he calls the aan and we hear it we can pray so if we can pray this means that the dawn has broken and we must refrain from eating and drinking The Only Exception is that if you are holding a glass of water or drink or juice or a container and it's in your hand and the aan is given you do not have to put it and say I'll refrain no the prophet told usam you have the permission to drink from it until you're satisfied and this may take a half a minute a minute no problem this is specifically if you are holding the water container before the Dan starts not when you hear the aan you rush to the kitchen and open the fridge and get the juice and start making it and no this is too late for you therefore uh uh you should refrain the minute you hear the aan and Allah knows best this is all the time we have until we meet you tomorrow same time inshallah I leave you it felt like a good this day is all right as the first time our we tonight with family around a nice meal we're making do I night feel how nice it is to be so near to those I love whenever we think of Ramadan all the good things that we need to do and plan it's not always easy but we'll do the best we can"
