  "transcript": "so Piazza foggy is asking about the right time to pray tahajud we've answered this question so many times I'll put it in a nutshell we have a big umbrella that is called night prayer and night prayer is any prayer you pray after Isha until the event of fire which is a break of dawn so all of this is called night prayer now underneath this umbrella you have something called taraweeh and taraweeh is any prayer prayed in congregation in the masjid during the nights of ramadan after aja then we have something called Tahajjud and huge willie tahajud is anything prayed at the night time prayer providing that is preceded by sleeping so if someone prays elisha and goes to bed and wakes up at let's say 12 o'clock this is and he starts to pray this is called tahajud and the best time for Tahajjud is the last third of the night and how do we recognize the last third of the night by calculating the time from sunset til the break of dawn and dividing it over three the last third before fetcher is called the last third of the night and this is the best time for Tahajjud"
