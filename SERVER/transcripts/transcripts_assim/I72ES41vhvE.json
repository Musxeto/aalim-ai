  "title": "Borrower has not paid me back; Can I consider it as Zakat? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "her second question was about those who borrow money promised to return it and it's been a year or two and they did not return it what should we do can I consider it to be zakat the answer is no because this is hitting two birds with one stone you are giving up from this money that they had borrowed so you know that it's not gonna come back and instead of giving away new money for the cat to the poor and needy you consider this lost money to be from the zakat so you have saved there's a cat the actual zakat money in your pocket if you are hesitant or reluctant to remind them then you must give the cat on this amount of money that you have lent to them let's assume that you gave them ten thousand reals after one year they did not return it go and ask them for it you say mom I'm shy in this case you have to give 2.5 percent on the ten thousand every single year as the cat but if you go and ask them for it and they decline they reject or they apologize they don't have then there is no zakat on this amount of money next year you do the same now zakat third year forty knows a cat as long as you annually ask for it but whenever you get anything of it immediately you give 2.5 zakat for it even after five ten years you give only for one year zakat not for the five ten years but only for one year because they did not return the money willingly or unwillingly whether they are rejecting that they took anything from you or they apologize due to their poverty either way there is no zakat because you are annually asking them for it back"
