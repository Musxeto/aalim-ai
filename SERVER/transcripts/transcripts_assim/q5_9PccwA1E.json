  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] bismillah or so that was our Isola dedicate him welcome back to our second episode of lights of darkness I'm your host use of karma where we will be discussing the essential nature of child rearing and investing in our dunya and both in our akhada as well as panel tonight I said no Koran I'd met with Benin zenith of height at dunya so we'll be discussing how to operate children what is the process begin what is the roadmap to rearing children as we know when we were building a building the most important thing is the foundation so how do we set our foundation for our children and we have with us today our wonderful guests Sheikh awesome look mounted Hakim and Sheikh awesome is a teacher at that Academy and he is also a teacher at the knowledge International University and he has been any mem and a teacher for over 30 years so it's our honor and there you know privilege to have usually miss an Emirati waalaikumsalam what Allah Allah Karim Allah who Helen for having me I'm a hack so if I further didn't show a lot to either we would like to know what is the roadmap for effective child rearing okay absolutely not a human hand Allah what salat wa salam ala rasulillah he was our hero saw me a minute la villita it goes without saying that extramarital relationships in Islam are totally prohibited not only in Islam and Christianity in Judaism anything that is outside the institution of marriage is prohibited so Islam directs and channels us to getting married and there are so many hadith highlighting this issue of getting married and selecting the right spouse so in order to have children you cannot have children by artificially semi nating for example and this is a trend that some women are doing they want children but they don't want to get married so they get a donor to donate their sperms and they conceived out of that this is totally prohibited in Islam Islam is a religion of nature so marriage is between a man and a wife and a woman we don't have any abnormal things so when a man gets in contact with another man this is homosexuality this is not marriage and it's not accepted in any religion on earth to my knowledge unless they've invented something just to please the LGBT cue s WR whatever they call him now and a relationship between a woman and a woman is not marriage so the natural thing is for a man to get married to a woman now each one has to wisely select his or her partner and Islam did not let things loose alhamdulillah it governed it so in the beginning you're interested in having righteous offspring select your spouse wisely how would I do that well when it comes to a woman who's someone proposing to Islam tells the Guardian to check on two things or 3/1 his religious practice his religious commitment so is he a practicing Muslim or he's a loose individual and this is also debatable in the levels we have so do you share mean that he has to be any ma'am an acknowledged a renowned daddy he has to be a person who memorizes the Quran he has to be a teacher in a message these are all parts of his religious commitment but not all yeah so first he has to be someone who walks the talk if I look at him he does not sin openly because a person who prays five times a day who fast Ramadan who goes for Hajj and give zakat is a Muslim there are 1.8 billion Muslims but are they all religiously practicing and committed we have to look if he's openly sinning if he parties though he prays if he does things that are not accepted in slum such as skipping prayer with the congregation he doesn't pray them as  so how would I say that he's a practicing Muslim if he deals with RIBA and works for Haram occupation such as selling alcohol or selling intoxicants in general selling cigarettes tobacco Haram income dealing with the media Haram media in this case he is not a practicing Muslim so there are so many things which you can judge not entirely but it gives you a hint what drives this individual so a person who prays five times a day and fast Ramadan he looks religiously practicing but works in an interest-based bank and he is a leading figure in that bank and he is jumping up the ladder in his career path and is not thinking of quitting it doesn't they say he does not see anything wrong in his occupation he's got a problem this problem would come up later on if there's a dispute because whenever the spouses have a dispute their point of reference should be Quran and Sunnah so I can tell sister you're wrong or brother this is unfair so they come back to what can be commonly referred to piranha Sunnah but if he's not a religiously practicing person then he would not accept the ruling of allah azza wajal so first of all the Prophet says I some either otaku moment are done' Dena who I'm Ana Tahu and another narration wahoo Luca who visit with you whenever someone comes to you proposing to your daughter to your sister whatever he and you accept his religious practice meant and practice so this is one part the second part is a Monica who who Luca who which is being trustworthy or his moral conduct I'm talking I stop you for a second sure is what's the distinction between his Deen and is a clock there is a big difference yes and this difference is the core problem of the Muslim community we have so many people who are religiously committed on the surface so I have a long beard my fob is short usually I'll be carrying my twig my name is wac and when I talked to you jaeseok allahu khairan barakallahu chicken I use Islamic words mush a lot of this is Sheikh he's a practicing Muslim I pray in a fashion that follows the prayer of the Prophet as a Salaam to the letter and I quote ayat I caught a hadith whatever I do I use Islam to govern my whole life this is a Muslim who is religiously practicing he is religiously committed but when it comes to moral conduct we have a big gap so with you I'm a good person I joke around I'm Hoss hospitable if this is right word I'm generous I this and that when I go to my home the way I treat my missus the way I deal with my children it shows like dr. Jekyll mr. Hyde personality enough when I deal with other people who are not following my man hash as they call it or the way I think or believe I treat them as vicious reptiles and I consider whatever comes from them is venom this is not the proper way you have to go it has to go side by side and the role model is a prophet Isaiah rampant how did he deal with disbelievers how did he deal with sinners open Lee sinning how did he deal with those who committed major sins like fornication would he swear them curse them or try to have them repent instead of coming to him and asking for capital punishment or whatever so this is a very important issue to take care of not everyone who proposes and people say masha'Allah he prays in the first straw he has a big beard and he memorizes the Quran can be a good husband to your to your daughter because if he has this split personality if he deals differently than what the Quran Sunnah recommends and commands him to do we have a big issue yeah so so subhanAllah here you find this is a major issue because people aren't able to distinguish between my religiosity our the religiosity and good luck so ideally a person that has good Dean should it should lead to good luck I should build on a person like luck but that's not always the case so we find people that are outwardly religious very religion and some you know not malicious or anything they just have these outward rigid practices will we call performative Islam so they know how to perform and have the binocular that vernacular they have the costume but it hasn't really reached their hearts their internal you know the things inside of them as always for another child I said that he made hard on for us the things of the bought and in the door hip so they have the door head but the button isn't hasn't you know been perfected yeah so but it's hard to look at a person and recognize that it is hard but this is not the problem the problem is that most people and I've seen in my life which is not very short and Allah I've seen a lot of practicing people yes turning back on their heels so so many practicing people Imams danny's who had long beards and wound it went almost less than a fist length so there's a difference opinion among scholars whether the beard should be left alone or to cut a fist length they are doing the fist length from top instead of the bottom this is a sign but then you can see that they're free mixing that they have weird ideas that the teaching people deviant thoughts what is this ten years ago you were doing well yes but there inside is different than what's on the outside and this is what's causing this yeah sure thank you for the beautiful answer we're going to stop for a break pause this episode but we'll be back with our series of life adornments please stay tuned and join us back until you come back assalamualaikum warahmatullah [Music] Salam alaikum warahmatullah her but I care to welcome back to our second segment of nice adornments with chigan we last stopped talking about when a man comes to a family to look for to look for a wife what are the things that you should look for in his character and we start by talking about his Deen in his o'clock and the shallots are al you can continue yeah okay so the religious commitment is important a lot of the Guardians when the someone proposes to their daughter or sister failed to investigate and come after a couple of years complaining that the guy is a drug addict or he abuses women or he lies a compulsive liar why didn't you ask what who to ask sure you have to go and check the man go to the Masjid where he claims to pray I remember so many times I get people coming to me in say chef do you know so-and-so I said no they say Sheriff he lives next to your Masjid I said I've never seen this person they show me his picture and the man doesn't pray the Masjid at all if the Imam doesn't know the person then this gives you an insight of what a person he is so you have to do your due diligence ask and check his friends his family members his colleagues at work and at school so that you can sketch a profile of what a person he is now religious commitment we're done and through with there is another part with the Prophet Allison tells us to check upon his luck his moral conduct so you have to check his companions his relatives his colleagues about how he deals with people so if they all say or he is a good person but he's so stingy he doesn't spend a dime this is go he's going to make your daughter's life miserable cross him out if they say he's generous but to the extent that he doesn't save a penny again this is a problem if they say no in spent and expenditure is good he's generous and his kind and he saves money he manages his financing quite well but he has a problem with anger issues and fits this is a total disaster stay away from this person if they tell you that he doesn't fight he doesn't shout he doesn't scream but he flirts yeah with females and coworkers and he has no problem in mixed gatherings again this would corrupt your daughter and influence her negatively in the future so all of these things have to be a combination which you should look into what is his relationship with his parents if his parents say that he's dutiful he's kind he's loving he takes his sister's places he drived them he takes her his mother's shopping and you know that this guy is a family man mm-hmm but if they say we don't see him except for half an hour once a week this is bad news and so on yeah so I think theoretically it makes sense you you have a list of things that you're looking for but isn't it really difficult to reduce a person just a list of things not truly understanding the fullness of their humanity perhaps a person has these deficiencies but they're working on is something they're getting better over time or do you immediately look at the red flag and say no or are there some considerations that you can make some like a lead way a person you know he praised us a lot on time as I did a lot but as you said he's a flirt or he has these little deficiencies in his character and how do you know when to break and want to sort of give leeway there are red flags yes so if someone tells me that this individual flares up in seconds and he has anger issues rage issues I would definitely not wait for him to develop and improve because I'm not willing to gamble with my daughter's life and marriage but there are things that okay I may not compromise in this day and age if someone is for example not praying in the Masjid but is well known to be praying on time so I may compromise because it that the demand is far less than the supply if you raise the bar and keep it high you end up not getting your daughter married so you have to go a little bit down but there are red lines you cannot cross so someone who flirts someone who has anger issues someone who is unable to communicate it's only Simon Says someone who has weird ideas and this comes in the beginning when someone comes and I've seen so many things I do a lot of marriage counseling between the spouses so I've I see a lot of this on daily basis someone goes and proposes and he asks the woman he's proposing to him in the presence of her guardian are you a virgin have you ever had sexual relationships I would take my shoes and beat the heck out of him out of my home this is inappropriate you are in a respected families a house and you're asking a woman who did not marry before if she's a virgin or not this is inappropriate UNAC if the person from the initial interview comes and says listen I'm interested in marrying your guardian is here but you're not the only one I'm gonna marry I'm gonna take two or three wives in the future this is a lunatic he's not even capable of thinking straight okay you want to get married in the future let that come at the future not now so there are things there are signs that makes it or breaks it and this is what a father should be aware of okay so we talked about when the male comes to seek the hand of the daughter of the sister or likewise what about the event when a man is looking for a spouse what are some things that he should look for when seeking a righteous wife well the prophet Alice awesome told us in an authentic hadith that a woman a woman is sought after for four reasons for her wealth for her lineage for her beauty and for her religious commitment so choose the one with the religious commitment or may you be holding something like dust in your hands meaning nothing now the Prophet is not telling us choose someone who is religiously committed who's ugly poor and from a bad family no he's saying that this should be your measuring tool the religion and if she's Miss Universe wow that beats everything and if she's wealthy and an orphan at the same time inherited billions we've got it made and if she's from a reputable lineage and family hamdulillah this is heaven but usually these four are only found in Jannah with the Elaine so the most you should focus on is her religious commitment it goes without saying that also her moral conduct goes side by side because sometimes you choose a woman who's a hijab' who's any hobby who wears gloves black from head to toe nothing is seen masha'Allah excellent but her model conduct is zero she does not respect her husband she is always cursing and using abusive words she has rage and this you cannot stay married to and you can definitely not expect her to raise good children so you have to do what people call in management 360 examination and profiling so you have to ask her colleagues parents elders and those who are under her so that you can make a good idea of who you're getting engaged to okay last question typically in Muslim Islamic societies you find people getting married rather quickly so if a merit if recording process is let's say three months six months a year which is you know not the norm how are you within this constraint time able to assess a person's character and the ability to be a good spouse the essence of all what we do in life is trusting Allah to have full to what : dependence and reliance on a large ocean yes this doesn't mean at all that you do not do your due diligence but at the end of the day your heart is connected with Allah even after all the investigation you had done and committed it's like buying a watermelon so it's green from the outside you knock it here knock it there by the sound you can try to guess whether it's red sweet or why than a bitter and you only know that after you open it in marriage it's almost the same we don't have any engagement period or let's say dating period so it's not me dating a woman for three months and then if we there's chemistry we're compatible we get married because I had a matter an American friend we used to go to the gym together and work out and this guy was like in his late 30s early 40s and every time I see him he's a Christian and I say you're not married yet man what's what's wrong with you say no I'm still looking for the right one and I keep telling him he he's not a key sorry this is for you I keep telling him the right one will never come now show me your black book yours your your address contact agendas just four out of curiosity how many girls that you've dated and seen so so many by the way you're doing you'll never get that it in Islam it's different in Islam you do your due diligence they tell you this is a good girl you ask around you propose you see her she sees you and then there's chemistry you hope for the best and you get married 99.9% and this is a big percentage things work out I got married with the grace of Allah 36 years ago in the same fashion and I'm still happily married I don't know my my wife prior to the engagement and I don't have anything we get to know one another till date and we live like this because I have shortcomings so whenever she does have her own shortcomings I always look at mine and say Touche so I accept her for what she who she is she accepts me for who I am and we live in Charla in in love and happiness is amazing as I sheikh may allah bless you reward you and unfortunately this is the end of our segment today thank you for sharing with us all your knowledge for our viewers and sha allah stay tuned with us for our next episode of life's enormous we hope that you'll benefit it until next time assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh [Music] [Music] you [Music]"
