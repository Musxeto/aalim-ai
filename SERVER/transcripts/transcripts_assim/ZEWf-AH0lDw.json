  "transcript": "Allah commands his messenger sallallahu alaih was by saying it's composed of three sort of paragraphs so the first one would be and keep yourself patient oh Muhammad by being with those who call upon their lord in the morning and the evening seeking his face meaning out of sincerity for the sake of Allah now be or keep yourself patient patience is divided into three types as we all know to be patient on doing good deeds you need patience you need to be patient to wake up for fer prayer and make woodo with this in this cold weather and to walk from your home to the Masjid to attend the Salat in the congregation with the congregation nobody can do this seriously nobody could do this except those who have huh patience because they're doing this seeking Allah's face so they have the energy so this is the first type of patience the second type of patience is to be patient not to do Haram and Haram is very easy to get because it is going downhill and always going downhill is the most easiest thing you just drop while climbing up is difficult and in this country and many other countries nowadays FNA is all over the place whether it is in buying a house in mortgage RBA based loan one of the seven major sins in Islam she but we have to live pay rent I've been paying rent for the past 40 years alhamdulillah for two houses not one for me I don't have a property I don't have a house so what I'm pay I'm living no sh I have to have this condo it's been my dream and I have to have this 50 in uh uh TV screen and then I have to have the and an automatic garage and and the whole nine yards well suit yourself so to be patient from doing Haram is also one of the types of being patient so much fit outside for us men I'm a family man if you push me too far I just might so they say third type of patience is the patience on Allah's calamities and this I have nothing to do with because an earthquake took place a volcano a tornado a cafir country is bombarding us with bombs and killing our children and displacing our families what did I do nothing this is Allah's test for you what are you going to do be patient but again this is not our topic patience this requires an extensive explanation and elaboration so that you would understand what am I doing on Earth am I just supposed to work 9 to 5 commute 2 hours to job and back this is what Allah created me for Allah is testing you each one of us is being tested are you passing the test are you being patient suit yourself so Allah says and keep yourself patient by being with those who call upon their lord in the morning and the evening so what kind of patience is this number one number two or number three half an hour later what are we doing here guys it's it's not we haven't had lunch yet what type of the three patients is this number one to be patient upon upon doing good deeds so Allah is telling commanding his messenger by default this command is for us to be patient so many times it's difficult for us to respond to an invitation of a friend to attend a talk or a Circle of Knowledge or a banquet for or which I'm obliged to uh respond to but I feel tempted to go elsewhere to attend a hockey match maybe some sports event maybe some Gathering that has Haram elements into it or watch a movie so this is the Temptation we are getting you have to be patient make yourself patient by being with those this command fits us as a glove in this cfer country if you neglect having buddies Muslim friends Society Community an environment that would you would hang out with be with people that would have your back it's not long before you go astray why this is human nature the prophet said a wolf would not attack the herd of sheep because they're together he waits until one of them sheep says I've had enough with these guys I'm going for a smoke and it drifts a little bit away from the congregation this is when the wolf attacks and likewise this is what shatan does if you're on your own Shan hits you the hardest but when you when you are with the Muslims with the community this is this is some shba we have this we have that let's go uh play football together it's a Muslim environment you still belong you have this belonging you have this identity but when you don't you start yeah drifting you start going astray tomorrow maybe do your hair like Mr T you shave it from the sides and I don't know what Tomahawk or what they call it whatever and then a few weeks later maybe a little earring looks cool in one ear not both huh so that they they don't mix you up then maybe you get a tattoo a little bit The Bling blings masah whoa what is this and then you change your name huh from Muhammad to Mo mashallah everybody knows short for  anyhow so what is this you've lost your identity and this is dangerous you have to have people that have your back what are you doing when we eating you're eating with your left eat with your right okay I need someone to put me back on the straight path to remind me you're wearing the finger in the Haram finger you can't wear it in the index and the middle finger this is Haram I didn't don't know that now you know and so on people tell me I haven't seen you for in for a couple of weeks watch out you're in danger last jum I didn't see you and they remind you you remind them and you keep on doing this until you meet Allah in jenah"
