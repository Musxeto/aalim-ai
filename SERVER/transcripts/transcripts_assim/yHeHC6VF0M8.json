  "title": "Want to sell Merchandise branded with Sheikh Assim's catch phrases, is it halal? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um so i want to know if this income would be halal or okay so i'm a big fan of ask zad so i was thinking to start like a merchandise line where i have like t-shirts mugs uh baseball hats where it will be like maybe like one of your catch phrases like are you serious or you ignorant imbecile and it will be like um it'll say like sheikh asim or it'll be like a silhouette of you so i was wondering since it's not my catchphrases and it's not my show i don't have no rights to the show would it still be permissible are you ignorant imbecile i hope you're not going to say no why you guys focus on little things and leave the whole package lots of the people unfortunately do this all the time and they come and say you said this you said that it's funny it's not intended just move on to go to your question as long as there is nothing haram in it there's no problem putting a t-shirt saying are you serious there's no problem in that putting the picture of the sheikh this is haram or any other human being so putting catchphrases like that or um coats like a beautiful coat for imam malik and this was a coat i used in the straight path in malaysia convention three years ago that the sunnah is the ark of noah whoever embarks on it will be saved and whoever refuses will drown in the flood so yeah such catch this is too long this is an essay but if you put that on a baseball cap probably you'd need a hindu turban to accompany that you can't do that there's no problem in that making a business out of it there's no problem in that it's a halal business and you have my permission to do that providing there's no haram being committed inshallah you"
