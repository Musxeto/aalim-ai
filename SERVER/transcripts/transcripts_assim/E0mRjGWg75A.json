  "transcript": "from here the section speaks about who is to lead the salaat the Prophet told the son is a lot isn't that the best deserving person to pray or to lead the prayer is the one who memorizes most of the Quran and this is when we come to a situation where we have a number of people in a public place and we have to evaluate which one to lead the prayer but when we are in a message it then by default the Imam who was appointed by the authorities so whether the authorities is the government or the committee that runs the Masjid as long as he was appointed then he's the one who deserves to lead the prayer even if he recites he won't do so if those behind him memorized the whole Quran doesn't matter he is the one who's supposed to lead the prayer because his it's his duty and it is his Masjid in general cases as if we are at work or for example at an airport or in a public place and there are five of us who leads a prayer one says I memorized the full Quran and he memorized it more than anyone else we say you go ahead and lead a young person can also lead elders there's no problem in that and also a blind person can lead it's not a necessity that he is having his full senses because of the love in my Maktoum may Allah be pleased with him the blind man used to be appointed by the Prophet alakazam whenever the Prophet went for jihad he used to appoint him to be the ruler of Medina and the leader of the prayers"
