  "title": "LETS STUDY A HADITH TOGETHER",
  "transcript": "and you fooled around and you cheated and you lied and you were not punctual on prayers when you are asked these questions in your grave you will not be able to say other than huh huh I don't know I heard them say and I said what they said then the beating starts up the torment the punishment of Allah is unlike anything you could imagine the angel would beat him with one blow on the head he turns into salt and he cries so loud that all inhabitants of Earth heares them except the gin and the humans all animals all insects all birds everyone hears this Cry of his because he failed to answer these questions so we want to know the way out what is the way out how can we make it so the prophet saidat three statements and this is a concise of speech that he was given he said restrain your tongue and let your house be a sufficient shelter for you what and weep over your sin easy but it is easier said than done and if we will try to explain this Hadith in the 20 minutes I will not give it its fair amount of uh respect because this is a life strategy that the prophet is setting for us in what three statements six words it's mindblowing nobody could come up with these things nobody could come up with such a life strategy in so short statements but so profound meaning restrain your tongue what do you mean your tongue is a beast you keep your lips shut it's in its cage you guys know Safari huh I don't I did not go to Safari I will not never go inshallah I have National Geographic I don't know why people waste time anyhow put your beast in the cage you will be safe the moment you open the cage and let the Beast out what will happen Carnage it will beat eat and do heinous things your tongue is like this you tell me where do we use our tongues and and talk in what in VI no when we sit together what do we do let's revise the Quran no let's do anything beneficial nothing we talk about celebrities oh did you hear what she did did you see what he did they got divorced oh then they get married again and they divorced again oh did you see her dress did you see his suit wah his hairstyle is very nice tomorrow I'm going to go to the barber and do the same hairstyle I don't have any hair so Al my hairstyle is the best topless anyhow so we gossip about Scholars did you hear what shik so and so well he's crap he's no good but Sheik so and so refuted him and they started fighting and we talk ill about Scholars about diis we talk ill about politicians oh he's corrupt he takes money from the drug lords he does this he does that we talk ill about about our relatives about our loved ones about everyone So eventually what is your tongue doing Carnage is destroying everything you see I can't help it when I see something in front of me and I don't try it so and forgive me I have to know is it coffee or tea okay yesam you can't afford this I can't this is one of the advantages of being a Sheikh alhamdulillah you treated like royalty so this is the problem with our tongues is it difficult to restrain yes or no no no come on I'm going to eat you don't want to have dinner no no keep this is it difficult to restrain your tongue it is the most difficult thing to restrain to the extent that our Prophet saidat whomever wants me to guarantee Jenna let him preserve two organs H only two organs if you preserve them Allah will admit you to Jenna what are they your tongue and your private part and these are the most two organs in your body that will take you to Hell everywhere in the world your tongue does horrible things but it also can do Miracles imagine the impact of the word one word in Islam has great impact from kufur to Islam he's my brother he becomes a Muslim by saying what one word and a Muslim becomes a cfir by saying one word he makes fun of the Quran he makes a joke about Allah he makes jokes about Muhammad Alat wasam he comes out of the fault of Islam by by what one word a house is based on one word the father says I give you my daughter in marriage the young groom says I accept and two witnesses are witnessing Mall take your wife she's your wife and they have a family they have children alhamdulillah and they memorize the Quran and they become a very good Muslim family one word demolishes this house why didn't you put salt in the food I divorce you what did I do you broke your marriage he goes knocking on my door sh door I I was angry I don't know I have six children so if you have 10 children what is going to you said it you broke the the marriage by what a word that came out of your mouth this organ is very very dangerous now imagine if I am a singer songwriter if I am an atheist writing posts on Twitter or on Facebook or or writing books casting doubts about Islam and about Allah how much sins do I compile on myself but if I'm a sheh and I go around give dawa and remind people of Allah guide people to Allah teach people about Islam how much reward do I get so this organ is a double EDG sword it can slit your throat and it can fight in the cause of Allah so the prophet said restrain your tongue meaning from saying bad things not from saying good things good things set it Loose Let It Go the prophet says whoever believes in Allah in the day of judgment he should say good things or shut up very simple how many houses did we destroy by going to the wife and saying why are you accepting this he's treating you like trash you should speak up for yourself you should stand up for yourself don't let him deal with you and treat with you like this and the husband comes from work tired and sayam alaykum Hab honey where's the dinner you go cook your dinner yourself he gets a heart attack divorce takes place how many times we went to the man said why are you being treated like a doormat allowing your wife to treat you like this stand up for your rights show her who the man is beat her up pull her head she she has black belt and Jiu-Jitsu you crazy she was training with khabib I'm I'm not going to do anything you go and do that to your wife I'm not going to do anything to my wife so at the end of the day what are we doing how do you turn this on okay never buy new things when you travel anyhow so your tongue is very very crucial for your safety if you restrain train it from saying bad things you're in good hands otherwise you're going to suffer greatly the prophet saidat a man speaks with one word doesn't pay attention to it it will cause him to fall in Hell Fire for 70 years before reaching the bottom 70 years you're going from medium rare well done you go 70 years you're being roasted like crazy and and and and this is not a joke Hell Fire the least punishment in Hellfire is what yeah let's assume you smoke this is not a big sin I'm just harming myself I just smoke cigarettes if Allah wants to punish you he will place one stone of fire in your shoes you're out of hell H only one stone of fire in your shoes your brain will boil from it what is happening to the rest of the body it will conduct heat to boil your brain this is not a joke one word does this for you the prophet saysat and let there be enough shelter for you in your house what does that mean so many of us don't like their homes what are you doing I'm fed up I'm bored I want to go out and going out is permissible Hal if you're going out to earn money to feed your PE to feed your family to study this is halan but if you're just going out because you want to go out then we have a problem staying home is better than going roaming the streets and causing problems and fighting staying home is better than going to the market and to the malls and looking at women premixing and doing heinous things staying home is better than attending concerts or going to movie theaters or going to places where they do I don't know what do you call in in in AR Arabia they do of you know and and they're drinking but no coffee tea and what you're doing oh and and he like this like a frog so okay put it in both ways be a real frog not one-sided this is Beau what are you doing they work for 8 10 months to collect money and then they spend the in half an hour on this is crazy so mallah after one session did you grow up biceps no did you get in more intelligent a PhD maybe a bachelor degree diploma no did you make any connection business-wise yes I will smuggle inshallah half a kilo and maybe crazy stay home the prophet is telling you staying home is better and the final so that we will open the floor for questions instead of wasting your time so much the prophet says and weep over your sins what does weeping mean to shed tears one says why excuse me why would I shed tears for your sins it doesn't make any sense come on I'm a grownup man I don't cry yes if you watch your ROM Mantic movie and the the heroin dies or the hero is killed what will happen I wish I could save them I wish I was there I could have done something will you hear a romantic song and this and that and your heart is broken and you remember khad Z whatever on the the on the tree next to the beach what happens to you you cry but when you hear the verses of Torment of hell when you hear the verses of Allah's greatness and Allah's Beauty what do you see what do you do nothing when you remember that you've done major sins minor sins in the millions what do you do shrug your shoulders and say nothing why because shatan has blocked your vision you can't see none of us can see their sins but we're very good in seeing other people's sins our sins we cannot see this once in a herd of camels you know camels you have camels here alhamdulillah they saw a camel laughing like crazy so they went to the Campell and said hey why are you laughing so hysterically look at all the other camels yeah they have a hump on their back it's just Subhan Allah du you have a hum on your back as well really can't see it but they look funny this is our problem we good in detecting other people's sins we never reflect on our own sins why because in the car we're listening to music in the home we're watching TV in the office we're gossiping and reading newspapers and having breakfast Mah in your office is breakfast is from 9:00 until 1:00 when are you going to work this is what's happening in so many countries they don't work they don't produce so when are you going to contemplate about or upon your sins you don't pray night prayer you don't wake up at 3:00 and make tud and ask Allah for forgiveness and repent and weep over your sins this is why you live like this and you will die like this but when would you see your sins after death when it's too late these three statements of the Prophet Alat you should learn them contemplate upon them if you want to be saved if you want the way out always remember restrain your tongue let there be a sufficient shelter for you in your home and weep over your sins"
