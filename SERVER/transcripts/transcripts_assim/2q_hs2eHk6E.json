  "transcript": "I've been Majid Iowa says please regarding the current praying at home due to covered 19 in my area people still observe congregational prayers in the Masjid I'm scared of joining big came people or because people go out to different places to work and coming together to pray when they returned appears to be risky but I still have fear regarding my own action of praying at home while others are praying in the Masjid please what can I do I pray in congregation prior oh I used to pray in congregation prior to the pandemic saga if the Masjid the mosques are open and the authorities allow people to pray in the congregation you my friend must go and pray with them if you behave normally and you go to work and you go to school and you mix with people but if you are the type of a person who's afraid so you are actually confined to your home you don't go to work you don't go to school you don't mix with people you don't buy groceries or go to the market in this case due to your fear you can pray home but I'll tell you this copied 19 is the flu on steroids so it's not normal flu it is a bit more dangerous yet it is not the plague that kills tens of thousands every day and within 2 to 3 or 4 days no that's fatal this is an illness that 80% of those infected don't know that they are infected and they heal by themselves without any medical intervention I don't 15% of those infected must get medical intervention whether it is the top ventilators or normal medications 5% as average died in Sweden for example all those who died were over 70 years of age in Italy the average of the deaths were 70 years of age so there are 80 9100 so the deaths come to those who are susceptible to death due to their age like myself or due to their medical condition like mine those who have deficiencies in their immune system those can be quarantined but when you are young and healthy you have to go to the Masjid you have to mix and if you get infected you will be healed insha'Allah with the grace of Allah but we have covered 19 tomorrow we will have coffee 20 25 30 will we be in continuous lockdown till we die this is ridiculous so this is up to you you have to look into what suits you most depending that is illegal so you have to follow the laws of the country and you have to look into yourself if you are sick or having temperature high temperature no you must not go through that you will not harm others but if you're healthy and you're wearing a mask what more do you want to do"
