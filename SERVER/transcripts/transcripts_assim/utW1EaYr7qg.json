  "transcript": "Yusuf from Ghana Alhamdulillah Sheikh, do you know how excited it is whenever we call you one on one like this? Don't be too excited, huh? Alhamdulillah. My question is about our previous lesson, about our role model. You spoke about things that our Prophet loved and also things that he used to smile or laugh at. Was there any Sahabi named Noaim, if I'm not mistaken about it, used to prank our Prophet and sometimes he even go extreme? And also about things that our Prophet loved. Okay, you know you have one question. So your question was about Noaim, the companion of the Prophet? Yes, but I think this is combined. No, no, no, no. We will stop it here and inshaAllah ask a lot later on, maybe if you have time at the end of the show or tomorrow inshaAllah. Noaim was a prankster, a companion of the Prophet, that used to prank other companions. A lot of the stories narrated are not authentic. But it was well known to historians that this companion used to do practical jokes. And at the same time, it was unfortunately known that this companion used to drink wine and be whipped for it. Regardless of the many times that he was brought to the Prophet, a.s.w., intoxicated and the Prophet would rule that he would be whipped. 40 lashes or 80 lashes depending. But the majority was 40 lashes. So one incident that the companions saw him frequently coming to be flogged, they said, may Allah a.s.w. disgrace him. Many times he comes to be flogged like this. So the Prophet heard this and said, do not assist Satan over you. Satan over your brother. This is a calamity. This is a test. This is a weakness in him. So don't make dua against him and collaborate with Satan against him so that he would not feel despair and leave and do something more. Rather, make dua for him. And Allah knows best. Allah knows best. Allah knows best."
