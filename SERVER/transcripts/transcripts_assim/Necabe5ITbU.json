  "transcript": "a few months ago and asked about how to do the thing and you had mentioned the surahs and everything that had to be done but i wanted to start reciting even surah baqarah as a lot of people have told me that it's good i want to do what are the ways of reciting it can we like some have said that you're supposed to do it in three sittings in three days you can finish the whole bakara or in one sitting you have to finish the whole or you should read it with the meaning what is the best way to do it first of all the scholars say that suratul baqarah is not recited as a rookia and one recites it as a form of blessing a form of barakah and to protect his house from um evil eye from devils from black magic etc but it is not a rupiah that we recite upon or over someone who's sick to protect your dead your your house reciting the last two verses of the surah of surat al-baqarah suffices you and it keeps the shaytaan away from your house for three days and nights now if you want to recite the baqarah you can recite it within the day whether you divide it into two or three or four or five par parts there is nothing prescribed limiting it to three is wrong saying that reciting it over three days is wrong you can recite twenty percent of it in uh after fajr before after assad before maghrib until you finish it and this would be sufficient inshallah you"
