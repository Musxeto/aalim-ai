  "transcript": "consider subscribing we have from bangladesh if someone takes sleeping pills or relaxant which cause drowsiness and may cause hallucinations if taken in a large amount and he takes them without a prescription of a doctor is doing so haram and will his prayer of 40 days not be accepted first of all the issue of the prayer being not accepted for 70 for 40 days is related to consuming intoxicants willingly so if someone drinks intoxicants wine whiskey or whatever doing drugs and he's wasted then his prayer of 40 days would be unrewarded yes he's obliged to continue to pray for 40 days but he will not be rewarded for that and it would not be accepted from him now if a person takes sleeping pills that causes him drowsiness or hallucination without a pres a prescription from the doctors this depends why he's doing this if he has already been given such pills or he had them through a friend and he was in a state of mind or a health condition that required him to sedate himself or get them so that it would reduce the pains he's having and he had no intention of being intoxicated or falling in such a state of hallucination in this case he's not included but if he does it without a reason while knowing the consequences or he does it just to get high and in this case he would fall under this threat and punishment and allah knows best you"
