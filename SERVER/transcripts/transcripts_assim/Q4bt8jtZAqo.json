  "title": "A famous daee says that it is permissible for women to wipe over the hijab in wudu - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "he says that there is a famous guy who says that it is permissible to wipe over the hijab of the women because bilal did something like that etc i don't know the hadith that he's referring to but again let's apply logic if everybody could this this thing is as good as a hijab of a woman so if i'm making wudu i just do this i can easily take it off i can take this thing off and wipe underneath it and put it in the same time women usually say that it's difficult to take off the hijab in public toilets where men and women can use the same place and see it well how are you going to wash your arms to the ank to the elbows this is even worse so if you can manage to wash your arms to the elbows without people seeing it without concealing it then you can do that from underneath your hijab as well you"
