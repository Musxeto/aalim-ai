  "transcript": "so uh am I allowed to sleep naked when there's only myself or if there's only my me and my my wife if you are with your wife this is no problem inshallah because this is part of uh being intimate with her and she may like it she may not I don't know but this is no problem if you're alone there is a Hadith where the Prophet wasam did not like it and he said that would you like people to watch you and look at you and he said no he said well the angels are there so one should be bashful and should have this ha in him when he's alone but if it's with your wife and this is part of being intimate there's no problem in that inshallah"
