  "title": "A woman's hajj without a mahram | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "and this is where a lot of the Muslims take the wrong turn when they want to do a form of worship but they have to in order to do this bend some rules or even break them so you get a woman wanting to go to Hajj and she says sure I have sufficient money and funding to go for Hajj I'm a rich woman and I'm healthy but I don't have a Muharram a male man whose relative related to me a Muharram who can accompany me for Hajj so we say you're not permitted to go she said sure I'm booking for next season's Hajj and I'm going to make Hajj without a Muharram so I said well this is not my problem this is your problem she said I want to please a life as and I say to her know by what you're doing you are pleasing your desires in self rather than pleasing Allah because Allah is pleased when you do not disobey Him and going to Hajj without a Muharram is disobeying him but no one listens"
