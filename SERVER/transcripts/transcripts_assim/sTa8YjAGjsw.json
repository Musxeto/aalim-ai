  "title": "I let my NonMuslim father give me a Muslim name after reverting, - loving others more than Allah?",
  "transcript": "Salman from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. Sheikh, when I accepted Islam, I came to know that Allah does not like certain names like mine. So my dad was totally against me changing religion. I thought that if I tell him to select a name for me, it would make his heart soft and make him come closer to Islam. So he agreed and he said okay and he named me as Salman. I could have rejected this and kept my name as Allah's favorite names like Abdullah, Abdur-Rahman, Al-Harit Al-Mannan, but I went ahead with Salman. So does this make me fall under the ayah 24 of Surah At-Tawbah which says that if your fathers, your sons, and so on are more beloved to you than Allah and His Messenger and struggle in the cause of Allah, then wait until Allah executes His command and Allah does not guide the disobedient people. Jazakumullahu khairan. Wa jazak. First of all, Akhi, it is not permissible for you to interpret the verses of the Qur'an without knowledge. And what you're doing this particular situation is exactly that. The ayah is referring those who prefer their parents and their brothers and the likes over Allah, which means that you choose to follow the religion of your parents, your father, rather than follow Islam. This is where you are in trouble, when you select to obey people against Shari'ah. But doing something that is permissible, that is changing the name, there's nothing wrong in that. First of all, you're not obliged once you revert to Islam to change your name. You can keep your real name without any problem. If you want to change your first name, this is permissible, but it is not mandatory, as long as the name does not have anything to do or it does not mean anything against Islam. Secondly, Salman is a name of one of the Prophet's companions, may Allah be pleased with him, Salman al-Farisi, the Persian. And he was one of the great companions of the Prophet, alayhis salatu was salam. To the extent he, the Prophet said, alayhis salam, Salman is from us, al ul-Bayt. And he is well known to be the truth seeker who travelled countries searching for Islam until he found it in Medina. May Allah be pleased with him. So it is a beautiful name. And imagine if every person on earth calls their son Abdullah ibn Abdul Rahman or Al-Harith or Al-Hammam. There will be no other names. Even the Prophet himself, alayhis salatu was salam, he was granted a son, he called him what? Ibrahim. He did not call him Abdullah or Abdul Rahman, which means that this is something totally permissible and you should not interpret verses of the Qur'an to your liking."
