  "title": "Is it haram to cut ties with non Muslim friends, what about our MUSLIM friends, can we block them?",
  "transcript": "Consider Subscribing ğŸ˜„ uh my question is about cutting ties, do I haveÂ \nto maintain ties with a non-muslim and is it okayÂ Â  to cut ties with non-muslims? [Sheikh] is he aÂ \nrelative, a relative or a friend? [Questioner] ahÂ Â  he's a friend, friend [Sheikh] No you haveÂ \nno obligation to a non-muslim friend. If youÂ Â  simply just want to um ghost him, and not seeÂ \nhim anymore not meet with him, and not talk toÂ Â  him there are no strings attached. The prohibitionÂ \nis between two Muslims and again these two MuslimsÂ Â  the prohibition is when they meet one anotherÂ \nand they give each other's backs to one anotherÂ Â  this is prohibited. If I meet my Muslim brother noÂ \nmatter what is the relationship between us how badÂ Â  it is I have to say Salaam alaikum he must replyÂ \nby saying Wa 'Alaykum Assalam or vice versa. ButÂ Â  if we were best friends, or we were on good termsÂ \nand all of a sudden we don't call one another,Â Â  we don't text one another, we don't inviteÂ \none another, nevertheless if we were to meetÂ Â  one another in a party or a restaurant we gaveÂ \nsalaam and as if nothing is happening, no problem.Â Â  There's no obligation on me to keep on checkingÂ \non my contact list and calling them whether I haveÂ Â  feelings towards them or not occasionally. I'mÂ \nnot obliged to do this - my kinship is a differentÂ Â  story so, if I have a friend who's Muslim, andÂ \nI don't want to be a friend of him anymore,Â Â  I block him on social media,Â \nI don't return his calls,Â Â  but when I see him I exchange salaam I'm in theÂ \nclear if he's a non-Muslim I have no obligationsÂ Â  none whatsoever towards him or any rightsÂ \ntowards myself and Allah Azzawajal knows best."
