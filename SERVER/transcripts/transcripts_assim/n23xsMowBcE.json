  "transcript": "what's the ruling on women visiting the graves this is an issue of dispute women visiting the graves is an issue of dispute among scholars the most authentic opinion is that it is not permissible for women to visit graves because there is a hadith where the prophet allah cursed those who frequently visit the graves and in another narration those who visit the graves of women not frequently but just visiting and there are a number of evidences governing this but as i said this is the most authentic opinion backed by sheikh bin bazemin and the great scholars of islam who adopt and follow this opinion now the second question is is visiting the grave of the prophet alison does it fall under the same category again it's an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that it it does women should not visit the grave of the prophet so what should women do when they go to medina simply when they enter the masjid they greet and salute the prophet by saying muhammad that's it and if they make some dua there's no problem for the prophet hashem and his companions that it would be good you don't have to go to the rauda or to the grave itself and stand there like so many people do and this is the most authentic opinion on allah knows best"
