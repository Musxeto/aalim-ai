  "transcript": "Khalilullah from Nigeria Sheikh, my home is close to the masjid where In Sha Allah I'll be performing my Itikaf, Alhamdulillah. So, I might be able to go home to have my bath and also take my meal from home. Not really taking it from home, just take it to the masjid for Iqta and Sahur. Jazak Allah Khair. I'tikaf is to force yourself to be in seclusion in the masjid and not to leave the masjid unless there's a necessity. What are these necessities? Answering the call of nature, having a bath when it's mandatory or needed, to eat. If you can find someone to bring the food to your place, then you have to do this. Because we know that if you leave the masjid and go home and check on the missus and the kids and see them even for five seconds a day and go back to the masjid, it is joyful. So no, if you have a servant or a neighbor or one of your kids who can bring you the food over to the masjid so that you don't have to leave the masjid, this is a must. Otherwise then you can go and take it and go back immediately to the masjid. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
