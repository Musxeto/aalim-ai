  "transcript": "Brother Saadman from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh my question is for how long should we move our index finger during the tashahud and the last sitting of our prayer? Jazakum Allah Khair. Jazakum. We said that before and you have to keep on wiggling your index finger when you sit for tashahud and for the last sitting of the salat like this shaking it in its place not up and down not rotating like some people do just rather point and just wiggle it in its place as if it's shivering or shaking from the beginning till the end and this is done because it harms shaitan and it tortures shaitan and you move it while making dua tahiyyatu lillahi wa salawat wa tayyibat assalamu alayka ayyuhan nabi or assalamu ala nabiyya wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuh till the end once you finish dua you don't have anything to do you just put it down and Allah knows best Jazakum Allah Khair"
