  "transcript": "consider subscribing um Myra or Maria from Pakistan uh my friend my husband basically went to a friend Gathering where they discussed a Hadith regarding you know when Allah is happy and when Allah with you he basically takes you in this life and they concluded that if uh you know you are not being tested in this life that means that uh you know Allah is not happy with you or either you're not on the right path so can you please clarify on this concept of it because I am very confused about this concept okay so basically what Maria is saying that there was a discussion and it all revolved around the issue of whomever Allah loves Allah will test and the issue of testing is a bit ambiguous among people Allah mentions where he says and we shall test you with hardship and with prosperity and ease so how could that be when you see people living in places where the weather is fine it's prosperous they're wealthy and they're healthy and you look at them and you find that they are disbelievers and you look at some Muslim countries you find quite the opposite so you try to scratch your head and say how could this be Allah azzawajal mentioned in Surat al-fajr that when a man Allah gives him and opens the doors of favors and blessing upon him he says Allah azzawajal loves me Allah has given me and when Allah limits his provisions and blessings upon an individual he says Allah has insulted me he did not honor me like the other person Allah says no this is not true when Allah gives you worldly issues health wealth Prosperity security this does not mean that Allah is honoring you this is a test and likewise the opposite when Allah tests you with poverty with illness with floods with natural disasters volcanoes or earthquakes or even Wars this does not mean that Allah is humiliating you and Allah does not love you so Allah's testing is manifested in different ways you look at the prophets and messengers of Allah they were the most severely tested people of all what they had done to Yusuf by throwing him in the well accusing him of stealing accusing him of fornication jailing him for what when you look at the sons of Adam one of them killing the other out of jealousy when you look at no peace be upon Him 950 years and he's calling his people to Islam until heed and they are opposing him and when he builds the ark to escape the floods through the orders of Allah azzawajal his wife and his son Renegade and refuse so what is it and you can go on and on look at our Prophet Muhammad he was the most severely tested with different calamities his father died when he was in his mother's womb his mom died when he was six years old his grandfather died when he was eight years of age who's taking care of him and look what they had done to him after accepting the Revelation and becoming Allah's prophet and messenger how they taunted him how they prosecuted him killing his companions forcing him to flee and Waging War after War but look at Prophet Solomon he was a king he had control over the Jinn all the birds and the animals adhered to his instruction he knew their languages and so many blessings of Allah azzawajal yet they were all prophets of Allah azzawajal yet the tests and calamities were different so don't listen to those people if Allah has privileged you with health and wealth and prosperity and security and you're grateful and you're beautiful and you're doing whatever Allah commands you to do staying away from Haram and sharing these good things and favors and blessings of Allah with others you are doing well well"
