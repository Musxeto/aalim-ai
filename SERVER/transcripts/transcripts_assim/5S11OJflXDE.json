  "transcript": "Sheikh, can my wife correct my recitation when she is praying behind me during an obligatory prayer or Taraweeh? Secondly, if I make a mistake in my prayer, like missing Iraq, how can she call my attention? Does she say SubhanAllah or clap her palms? The scholars say that if a woman is praying with her mahram and there is other non-mahram, she must not speak. She just claps to bring his attention to this mistake. But if she is praying with other mahram, other women, and they are all her mahram male, she can correct him by raising her voice. Likewise, if he makes a mistake, she has the liberty to say SubhanAllah, like men usually do, or to clap. Either way is permissible because why not saying SubhanAllah is permissible for her, the reason is not there anymore. There are no non-mahram for her to clap. So she can say SubhanAllah without any problem."
