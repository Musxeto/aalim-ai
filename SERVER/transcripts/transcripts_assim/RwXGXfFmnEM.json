  "transcript": "he's asking are the parents sinful exactly as the sin of the children if they facilitated it first of all this is in allah's hands are they sinful or not definitely they're sinful but for example if the parents facilitate it for the children to install a receiver in their bedroom and a tv set so that they can watch movies and listen to music will the parents get exactly the same sins that the children are involved in this is in allah's hands and most likely such parents wouldn't care because they don't care about punishment of allah azzawajal otherwise they would not have indulged in it in the first place nevertheless it is something that is in allah's hands some scholars say that yes they get exactly identical since others say no they didn't do the sin so they don't get exactly the same but they get a huge portion similar to it"
