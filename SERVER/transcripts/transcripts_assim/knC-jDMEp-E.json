  "transcript": "Amir from Malaysia can you raise your voice I cannot hear you hello can you hear me yes barely what can I do for you barely okay I have a question for my friend mhm what's the ruling for a man marrying four Wom at the same time this friend of yours is with all du respect don't be angered by uh my response is pathetic marrying four women at the same time what is this is he a cattle breeder this is unheard of Nobody Does this in the old times where people had slaves and had women all over and money and let alone in today's time so such hypothetical questions are a waste of time a waste of energy and a disrespect to the person being asked because this is not logical it's like saying what's the ruling on getting married on the moon so again technically it's a marriage contract it's a contract you can do a contract or multiple contracts at the same time you can buy one car you can buy 10 cars no problem so the marriage is a contract between two if you make that a contract between you and other four individuals at the same time there's no problem in that technically sleep speaking but logically this is a h a hypothetical uh question that is a waste of time"
