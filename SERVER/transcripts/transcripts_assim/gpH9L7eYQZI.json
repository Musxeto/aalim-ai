  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Canada yeah if someone gets out \nto someone in a not a fully Islamic Islamic way   will he be uh settled for the Haram he did and the \ngood reward for the good he did so for example uh   a man giving dawah to a woman but while \nhe's doing it he doesn't lower his gaze   he even cracks jokes and maybe maybe even be in \nseclusion and he justifies this by saying uh he   wants to show that Islam is a tolerant religion \nin this case would he be sinful and rewarded   or what the deed rejected so this \nis something that needs to look into   is he going to be rewarded if he's sincere and \nhe's doing it for the sake of Allah yes but would   he be sinful for being in seclusion and cracking \njokes and not lowering his gaze 100 percent   and maybe these sins May overwhelm The Good Deeds \nhe gained from giving dawah what what's next   taking her on a date so that they would think that \nIslam is a tolerant religion no we have red lines   so cracking jokes not lowering your gaze being \nin seclusion with opposite gender even for the   sake of dawah is totally prohibited Ibn Mas'ood \nmay Allah be pleased with him the great companion   said do not be alone with a woman even to teach \nher the Quran because the shaitaan is the third   with you shaytan is lurking there waiting \nfor the right moment to strike and you're   a man she's a woman what do you expect so there \nmight be reward depending on the sincerity but it   would be overwhelmed with all these sins that \nyou have collected and Allah knows best this and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All"
