  "transcript": "ma ma hen or mahine says now with non-surgical intervention that is with silicon or such liquid insertion knows structure can be improved as well as the other facial features also can be beautified there are not hour these are not permanent but for a short duration are these non surgical interventions halal or Haram what about other cosmetic surgeries this is something that is recent and it is from only few tens of years maximum maybe 100 years old make much less so when you want to study something as such you have to go back to the Quran and Sunnah to see the roots of it in chapter 4 Surat Annisa Allah tells us that Satan took a pledge upon himself to make the humans change the creation of Allah this is number 1 in the authentic hadith which is a great upon a little bit miss root may Allah be pleased with him the Prophet Allah saw some cursed those a number of women among them who used that tools who make hair extensions and those who file their teeth to separate the front teeth to give an impression that they are younger the Prophet said in the description to change the creation of Allah so we get a glimpse of what is haram but at the same time there was a companion who during battle got his nose chopped off so the Prophet ordered him a lease awesome to take an extern nose made of silver and silver as we know when it comes in contact with moist and and liquids it changes color and gives a smell so the man complained to the Prophet Alice Osama and the Prophet SAW solemn ordered him to take a nose of gold so when we look at these in a nutshell there are many other evidences but we don't want to spend so much time explaining to you in a net in a nutshell Maheen scholars said that if the change in Allah's creation is for the sake of beautification mere beautification this is totally prohibited in a major sin but if it is to remove a defect to remove something that is wrong a person born with a cut lip children have this illness or disease I don't know what they call it and when they grow up it doesn't look good a person who has a sixth finger a person who has in his body burns and scars that resulted to an act due to an accident and he is mutilated in this case beautification or plastic surgery or cosmetic surgeries are permitted because they are restoring what is normal and original but if it is something for beautification a woman who would like to enlarge her buttocks so that it would look more sexy or a man who would like to do something in his body that is not natural he likes to change the way his nose looks or his cheekbones or whatever and there's nothing wrong with him and this is not permissible coming back to the question what's the ruling on fillers surgical interventions that where silicon Jews or liquid insertion scholars say that yes if there is something bad in your nose is crooked it's out of balance it looks not normal and you use these fillings then this is permissible there's nothing wrong in that a woman who after seven or eight pregnancies had her breasts sagging and dangling and her husband doesn't like this can she have surgical intervention to correct it as it was before totally permissible and legit insha Allah and Allah knows best"
