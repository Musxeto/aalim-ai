  "title": "What are my duties towards my father who did not fulfill his responsibilities, abandoned me? Assim",
  "transcript": "next question is from a sister what responsibilities are on the child whose father abandoned him abandoned him or her emotionally financially physically once the child grows up there are two things here that do not conflict and should not conflict there are rights and there are responsibilities so your right as a child to be fed taken care of given shelter being brought up in an islamic way this is your rights your responsibility is to be dutiful to your father or to your parents to take care of them to obey them to respect them and to cater for their needs if you're wealthy and they are in need now if they fail in delivering your rights this does not exempt you on the day of judgement from fulfilling their rights from doing your responsibilities and this is what a lot of the people are unable to digest especially and i totally understand especially those who were abandoned by their parents or one of them lots of the sisters lots of brothers say my father disputed with my mom divorced her when i was a young child and for 20 years he would not even call us or send us a penny now after i've graduated from uni and i have a good job with a good career he's calling me and asking me for money he's wanting me to visit him and i don't want to do anything with him this is where shaytan creeps in big time no he's sinful he's accountable for his actions on the day of judgment but you as well must realize that your father is the middle gate of jannah whether he's a good father or a bad father and if you fail to do what you have to do your obligations towards him you'll be as sinful as he is on the day of judgment and you will be punished maybe even further or more severely than him and allah azza knows [Music] best"
