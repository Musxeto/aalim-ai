  "title": "Am I sinful if I laughed at someone, didn't realise/forgot it was backbiting & a sin assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "the shake uh let me just give a bit of a background before my question so what I hope it doesn't exceed more than 40 seconds uh I'll try to make it as quick as possible so what happened was that I did learn about back biting and slandering but it was I think a few years ago that I was doing certain actions and but I didn't realize that this was back biting a standard for example I was laughing about my teacher but I did not feel a single bit of remorse because I did not realize this was wrong and it was I think after two years or three years yeah two years that I realized this was wrong this was backbite but unfortunately I had forgotten about the ruling that this was backbiting so am I still sinful because I did not realize this was a sin you know if I did I would have uh perhaps refrain from it Allah Allah says in the last Ayah of oh Allah do not hold us accountable if we were to error to ER to make a mistake or if we were to forget what you've done in the past was a mistake what you're doing at the moment is an act of forgetfulness because you forgot in both cases Allah says in response to our Dua I shall do so and this is in Muslim I shall do so I will not hold you accountable for whatever mistakes you had done or acts of forgetfulness that you've committed so embrace it that Allah is most forgiving most merciful most compassionate the one who guides us to repentance and accepts it from us and you will be saved with the grace of Allah"
