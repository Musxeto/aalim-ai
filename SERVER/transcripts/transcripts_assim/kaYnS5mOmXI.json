  "title": "Laying on something that has Allah's name such as a book or my phone, is it kufr? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign first of all we have to distinguish between the intention when I lie and I'll give you an example this happens a lot in masjids and now it's happening less often than before because of my white beard I'm considered to be among the senior citizens before when it was a little bit black less gray people would come in you know bombard me with complaints what are you doing this is disrespectful this is this the elderly now they can't do this because oops I'm the same boat so whenever I I'm sitting to a pillar of the messaging and I'm extending my feet they used to come and say oh this is disrespectful you shouldn't do this this is Blasphemous why you're extending your feet to the crebula and you're disrespectful respecting Allah do you know what's in my heart how dare you say such a thing when I'm reciting from the Quran and I place it on the ground to perform sujuda tilawa somebody picks it up and I said excuse me it's my my Quran said yeah yeah I was just honoring it from the ground she said why would you do that oh this is disrespectful this can't be kufur says who I'm putting my forehead on the ground is this cover as well the issue is what is your intention when you extend your feet or place the Quran on the ground or you lie on a book or your mobile of course has nothing you can lie on your mobile if you are not afraid of cracking it there's no problem in that the Quran is locked and closed and it's not there it's only codes so is there any form of intention to disrespect the Quran definitely not do you want to humiliate the Quran or the Qibla definitely not then don't listen to these people because they don't know what they're saying and what you've done has nothing to do with kufur"
