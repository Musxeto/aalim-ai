  "transcript": "is it permissible to read the whole Quran starting from Surah Nas or do we have to begin from Surah fat if you mean that if you mean is it permissible to change the order of the Quran by praying Surah 114 then 113 112 the answer is yes this is permissible it's not normal but it is permissible there's no Prohibition in this especially if we know that the prophet had done this himself in many occasions so in the authentic Hadith in theah he started reading in night prayer with alak then he recited then he recited and we know that the order is but he started with chapter two then chapter four then chapter three which means that the order of the suras is not something sacred that has to be followed it can be uh um intermingled he also prayed in the first and then in the second he prayed with and this is before the other one so there's no problem in that but if someone is reading from the Quran he goes from left to right that's pretty weird and not normal but I wouldn't say it's Haram"
