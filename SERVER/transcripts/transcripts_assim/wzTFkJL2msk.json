  "transcript": "finally navid says is having currency notes or coins that contain photos of idols or people in the front pocket of the trousers or the shirt permissible while praying is my prayer valid answer is yes your prayer is valid and this has no impact because it's folded and it's put in your pocket it's not showing on your body and no one would say no keep it beside you when you pray because thieves would have a good time picking it up for you so there's no problem in that inshallah and allah knows best you"
