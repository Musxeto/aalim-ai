  "transcript": "sarah says must we send salutations upon the prophet sallallahu alaihi when we come across his name when reciting the quran during salat during iran and during iqam this is an issue of dispute among scholars as to offering salat upon the prophet saying whenever his name is mentioned especially when praying in the uh in congregation for example and the imam recites muhammad so should we say allah muhammad the most authentic opinion is that you should not say that why because it was never reported that the prophet had done it nor his companions now the prophet was reported to whenever be reciting in night prayer not in fault in night prayer if he recited a verse that mentions mercy he was he used to ask allah for his mercy and whenever there is a verse that mentions allah's torment and punishment and hell fire he would seek refuge in allah azzawajal what does this tell you it tells you that this is the sunnah this is the way we should follow involuntary prayers in night prayers but not in fart because in far the prophet used to recite these eyes eyes of sarah and not ask allah for his mercy or seek refuge in allah from his torment so the fourth prayer is separate now as for the adhan and the comma the prophet said allah whenever you hear the adhan say whatever the mueller is saying and he did not mention saying the salutation after ashadu and muhammad rasulullah so i'm inclined to say that we should not say it though i acknowledge that whenever i hear the name of the prophet salaam i offer salutation upon the prophet to the extent that many people say why don't you reduce the amount of offering salutation upon the prophet allah so that the time of your lecture or your talk would be utilized in something other than the prophet's salutations i said no it is part of your love to the prophet alaihi salafsalam that you offer salutation as much as you can but we don't do this when it is not mentioned as in the hadith in so when a man sneezed in the presence of abdullah may allah please with a man with his father the man and i also offer salutation upon the prophet sallallahu alaihi but this is not how the prophet had taught us the prophet told us that whenever you sneeze you say alhamdulillah and he didn't mention often intelligence so this is some scholars i acknowledge say that whenever you hear the name of the prophet salallahu you offer salutation but i have not come across a strong opinion of scholars that recommend this or endorse such an opinion and therefore yes we mentioned the name of the prophet whenever we read his name or hear his name except when it's in places where it is not prescribed to us it was not done by the self and allah azzawajal knows best you"
