  "transcript": "Shimona from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh can I get one or two minutes extra to finish my question? You can get, one minute is fine. We have so many people waiting. Shimona. Okay Sheikh. I read romantic novels and stories. I fell into whisper that you like novels so much now. What will you choose? And that your prayer be accepted to Allah or you continue with novels and the prayers you pray? Your prayers, none of your prayers will be accepted if you read novels. And choose between the two. What kind of novels are you reading? Actually romantic novels. No, dramatic novels are part of idle talk, which is laghu, which is something that is not recommended to recite, to read. Nevertheless, it has no impact on your prayer. As long as you pray on time, and you try your level best to do your adhkar and to pray your sunnahs, reading these novels, though it contains foul language maybe, it contains lies, it contains haram things, still the scholars since long time, they say if the moral of the story is good, and there is not a lot of fitna or haram involved, it is acceptable. I personally don't do that. I think it's a waste of time. But I wouldn't prevent someone from reading normal novels that does not have sorcery, or black magic, or jinn possession, or talking to the dead, or zombies, or haram things such as gambling, or womanizing, etc. No, normal novels that are decent and honest, there is nothing that impacts your salat negatively, insha'Allahu azza wa jallam."
