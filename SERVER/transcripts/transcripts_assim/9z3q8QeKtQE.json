  "transcript": "I have been performing Salah irregularly for many years like sometimes I would read only I would pray only M and and the rest I would not from the past few months I have been regular in my Salah and asking repentance from Allah what should I do about the Salah I have missed in the past years the prophet sallallah alai wasallam said this is Hadith huh this is why Always we try our level best to refer everything to Quran and Sunnah after that we stem the conclusion not the opposite people say Hal the evidence let me look let me look let me look and they try to find evidence supporting what they have just gave a ruling on she what's the ruling on smoking cigarettes Hal the okay if it's Haram we're burning it if it's Halal we're smoking it haha this is not a de you can't do this you have to go the other way around what's the ruling on smoking cigarettes let me search read the Quran read theah Allah says that and this is so the prophet would make things that are uh uh abhor and and this is one of it and this would kill you okay and this would kill you all doctors say that it kills kills you then it's and this is the data sheet so when we come what was a question uh can we repent for what we have not prayed okay so now he's saying about prayer that was missed prayers that were missed the prophet said whoever overse sleeps on a Prayer or forgets it two reasons two causes sleep and forgetfulness he must pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no experation other than that meaning praying it as soon as you wake up or remember now Scholars said hm experation but he overslept and the pen of accountability is uplifted from a person asleep until he wakes up so he's not sinful and forgetfulness H if a person forgets Allah forgives Muslim Allah says I've done so so Allah forgave us if we forget then why did the prophet said there is no experation this means that if you miss the prayer for any other than these two reasons sleeping or forgetfulness you cannot make them up these are the only two reasons as says and great number of Scholars say if you miss a prayer deliberately intentionally it's gone how imagine when do we go to ha when do we stand Ina on the 9th of the day of is on the 9th of if I come wearing my to perform Haj and in the airport they say your Visa is not valid you have to come and they detain me for 4 days on the 13th of they sent me toe I'm in my I go TOA where am I going TOA I stand Ina alone the the police comes in you crazy everybody's in meca what are you doing he said well they detained me and they prevented me from standing in in but alhamdulillah I'm making it up now what do we say to him is his H valid why because the time is limited from this time and it expires this time another example someone has a flight and he's boarding the flight M time is due in 2 minutes in 2 minutes the sun sets so he said well on the flight I will not be a Allah he prays is his prayer accepted if it's 1 minute Before Sunset 15 seconds before Sunset there is a beginning and an end likewise if you don't pray and the Sun is going down going down going down going down disappeared so I'm going to pray ass huh same thing beginning and end if you pray within good for you if you miss the deliberately no sleeping no forgetfulness no valid reason it's gone forever till the day of judgment what should I do commit suicide you will go to hell forever ask Allah for forgiveness do not despair from Allah's Mercy some people overthink oh Allah will kill me oh Allah will put me in Hell Allah will never accept anything I'm doomed I'm this I've lost 10 kg in my counseling sessions I meet these people they I'm a afraid of this and I've lost 10 kg are you using OIC I'm using OIC I've lost a lot so why no no I'm afraid that Allah will do this what are you afraid of are you crazy what are Allah's beautiful names all these beautiful names of forgiveness of repentance of compassion all of this you forget and you just remember that Allah will throw me in hell this is negative thinking Which is far worse than your original sin thinking bad of Allah like this is much worse than drinking alcohol and drinking uh Haram stuff because you're thinking bad of Allah what do you think of Allah the lord of the world I think positive of him I think that he will forgive me I think he loves me that he guided me and I will do my level best to please him think this way all of your previous prayers and sins will be forgiven with the grace of Allah"
