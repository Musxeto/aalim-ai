  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh. My question is, you showed in one of your videos,   how can a person with long hair \nor wipe his or her hair in Wudhu. It was something like putting both hands in \nthe middle of the head and going downwards.   So can you please show again how it \nis done so that I can be certain. Jazak Allahu Khairan.\nWa Jazakum. I don't think I can do this to my head because \nI've just finished hamming it, anyhow the first   well-known way of doing it is going from the \nfront to the back and from the back to the front.   The second way of doing it is with \nwet hands putting it on the middle   of the head and going downwards, that's it,   you don't have to do this and this, no just doing \nit this way, and this does the job Insha Allah."
