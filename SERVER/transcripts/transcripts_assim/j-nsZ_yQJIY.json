  "title": "My clothes are thin, transparent but when worn doesnâ€™t show body, can I pray in them Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh so my question is about the plane clothing so if the material itself is thin in such a way that if you cut a square of it and you put your arm behind it you can clearly see the arm but when you wear it it doesn't cover your arm only from the front from all the sides um and then you cannot see the arm would the prayer be valid in that because technically it's very thin but you can not see the arm when it's worn and also given the fact that the color of the material is dark but if it was lighter perhaps the arm would be seen what counts feydan is can i see or not if it's not see-through if i see a person wearing it and i cannot recognize their body shape so it's not see-through then the prayer is valid in sha allah you"
