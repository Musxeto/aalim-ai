  "transcript": "M or Mah that is sent us a question saying that is it allowed in Islam to watch videos in which one of the actors speaks harshly to God this is a frequent question that a lot of the Muslims ask nowadays and this is not due to the concept itself but it's due to the fact that a lot and I mean a lot of Muslims are watching and engaging in following and watching movies soap operas uh TV series uh video clips YouTube Etc and these types of media indulges a Muslim in wrong practices no matter how hard he tries to preserve himself there are lots of movies and movies in Islam are Haram generally speaking because you will find nudity you will find violence and you will find kufur like the brother is asking so someone's talking harshly to Allah is it okay to watch him someone is making fun of Islam of fasting of Prayer of Muslims someone is ridiculing the Quran debates that people speak ill about Islam and you're watching it why are you watching it he says I want to learn you don't learn from people insulting Islam you learn from the Quran and the Sunnah this is what Allah would hold you accountable for on the day of judgment not on watching debates Allah says in verse 140 in Surah chapter number four and it has already come down to you in the book that when you hear the verses of Allah being denied and ridiculed so do not sit with them until they enter into another conversation the consequences indeed you would then be like them indeed Allah will gather the Hypocrites and the disbelievers in Hell together so Allah is telling us that if someone is ridiculing the Quran is denying the religion of Allah is making fun out of it as in the case of someone speaking harshly to Allah then you must not sit with them otherwise you will be like them and this would make you a hypocrite or a disbeliever so this is one of the major acts that nullifies Islam it is one of the acts that causes a person to fall into apostasy so people take this lightly especially in standup comedies especially in comedy shows when they make fun of Islam and of the Muslims and I've heard that there was a a program a standup comedy in UK or Canada or in us where they're Muslim comedians making fun out of Islam so that they would F fight uh the stereotyping the the people have this is not done by making fun of your own religion or of the practice of Muslims here and there this is done by giving dawa and showing people the correct Islam making fun of Islam is something that would take you to apostasy and would nullify your Islam even if you pray and fast because the Ayah 140 chapter 4 is crystal clear a sister"
