  "transcript": "Mohammed says what shall we recite or say when the Imam sits down between the two hot bus at Juma at Friday's prayer is there any specific dua or vicar we should say we know that when the Imam is giving the hot but we must not speak we must not even return Salam when someone comes and says Salaam alaikum we should ignore him and not reply to him we should not even tell someone who's talking to this even is prohibited and the reason is that we should give our full attention to the Imam to the orator who is giving the hot ba of Juma now having said that we know that there are two sermons and the Imam sits in between them pauses for about like 20 to 30 seconds so what should we say during this pause there isn't anything prescribed some scholars say you should offer salutation upon the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam because this is highly recommend and recommended during a friday so you say allah humma salli ala muhammadin wa ala muhammad etc others say you seek Allah's forgiveness by saying allah allah fear allah allah ma fille or ham you are Feeny a third portion of the people sir say said that it is recommended for you to make duaa because the Prophet himself told us I assume there is a moment during the Friday day from the break of dawn till sunset where no man or woman would ask Allah for something Allah Azza WA JAL would give it to them so there is a moment and moment is in Arabic Sarah and Sarah can translate to an hour and can translate to a moment of time so there is a moment that people should seek and look for trying to make dua so that Allah would answer their doors and there are some narrations that this hour or this moment is between the two sermons so there's no problem at all making Torah what about raising our hands when making dua between the two sermons when the dua is on your own there's no problem in raising your hands and make him draw so when the Imam says a palooka we had our stuff here allahu allah o allah confessed on fuel and he sits down for this twenty to thirty seconds if you raise your hands praise Allah offers a rotation to the Prophet as Salam and say o Allah pay off my debts or Allah make my son passed the exam or Allah guide my wife not to be nagging and demanding all of this is as good as gold and there's no problem in that"
