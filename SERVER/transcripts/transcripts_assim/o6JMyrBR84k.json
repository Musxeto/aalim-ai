  "title": "Are all married women Mahram to me cuz I can't marry them?! #islam #islamic #quran assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Yes. So if one said that uh the husband is a maham because a woman cannot marry somebody she's already married to and he said this at in class at school and he said this to Maharam and also the teacher who is a quite old lady here heard that and his male friend also I think he thinks I mean heard this. Is this considered talking about religion without knowledge? Of course it is from course it is talking about religion without knowledge and most likely that individual and those who heard him are confused. So they think that because my sister-in-law is married, my wife's sister, she's married and I cannot marry her. This means that she's mah to me logically. not knowing that yes but if her husband dies or she's divorced I can marry her if I'm not married to her sister they don't think about this way because if they thought in expanding it every single woman who's married should be maham to me I can't marry someone who's married so does that make her mam of course not but they're not thinking straight they're confused so this ignorance of theirs has to be explained to them and then they will find out the answer inshallah"
