  "title": "Aqeeqah: Slaughtering two rams for a baby boy and one for a baby girl - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "now his second question is about octopi and he says in the subcontinent they believe that sacrificing two Rams whenever a baby boy is born on the seventh day while they sacrifice one ram for a baby girl when she's born on her seventh day so he says is this authentic and the answer is yes this is authentic and it is one of the five situations in Islam where the woman is half of the man so for example in inheritance Viveca ramoth you have the insane a male gets twice what a female gets and this is in cases such as baby a son and a daughter the son gets two thirds the daughter gets one-third this is the division likewise brothers and sisters who are inheriting their brother etc this is case one case two in the case of testimony two men are sufficient to testify but if they there are no two men then one man and two women so two women's testimony is equivalent to the testimony of one man and this again is in specific things not in everything but in financial transactions etc in other things that are related to women such as virginity birth suckling the testimony of women works but the testimony of men does not because this is not their area number three in Apia and we have just mentioned that two ramps for a baby boy weren't around for a baby girl number four in blood money by mistake I kill a man I pay a hundred camels as blood money by mistake I ran over a woman I pay 50 camels and finally number five when freeing a slave if I free one male slave Allah would free each limb of him a limp of me from Hellfire and if I free to slave women I set them free Allah would free them or there is free me from Hellfire because of freeing two of them these are the five cases where the women are half of the men in Islam other than that to go through the justification that you would require a lecture but usually we don't ask for justifications we just say Salmonella Aparna we hear and adhere"
