  "transcript": "mohammed from pakistan uh sheikh my question is uh today medical science tell us that plastic temples and plastic water bottles is causes cancer and disease so can we say it is haram now the issue of plastics pvc and the likes that cause cancer even the medical reports don't say that they cause cancer instantly it would take 30 to 40 years so maybe plastic cups if you put boiled water or liquids in it that may cause cancer on the long run but not every plastic bottle or plastic container causes cancer and the cause or the result in cancer is not eminent it's not immediate it's a probability therefore we cannot come and prohibit it because if you look at the rest of natural things in this world you would find that even these scientists may say that oh this specific vegetable may cause this on the long run this particular fruit can cause diabetes on the long run so am i going to prevent even sun rays would cause skin cancer if one is under it for too long that doesn't make any sense no this is different than what is a necessity now these things are necessary for us now if you come to smoking yes smoking cause cancer lung diseases heart failures it may take some long but all scientists and doctors and physicians say this is habit this is harmful this is haram but no one dares to say that about bottled waters when you give them bot a bottled water water that is in a bottle nobody would say no sorry i don't want cancer i'm i'm green i'm no you're yellow not green this is nothing wrong everybody does it so i hope this makes some sense"
