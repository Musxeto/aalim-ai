  "title": "If I found a lost cat, can I keep it? Islamic ruling on lost & found items - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign States so I've been doing research in regards to Lost and Found items in Islam due to what the prophet uh in regards to Lost and Found items okay okay yeah so the prophet Allah said in an authentic narration and I quote remember and recognize its time material and its container and make public announcements about it for one year if somebody comes and identifies it then give it to him otherwise add it to your property end quote what I wanted to ask you today was with the same directions apply to Lost cats or lost pets or any other type of lost animals owners unfortunately lose their cats in my neighborhood often and I usually find the cats and bring them back to my place thank you first of all it is not permissible for you to pet a dog so this is out of the question secondly as for the cat if it is a stray cat that has no badges no traces no marks on it is for you to keep I have no clue whether this is a domestic pet or a stray cat so if there is there are no traces such as a collar or a tag number or a name or whatever to prove to me that this belongs to someone then yeah it is for you to keep there's nothing wrong in keeping it inshaallah thirdly it is best of course if you know that most likely this belongs to someone and they've lost their kitten or cat and they're emotionally attached to it that you announce it yeah and it don't be so cheap you can get cats elsewhere and ask people to donate who have extra cats and there are so many of them fourthly the Hadith you've mentioned about [Music] which is lost and found this is about property that has value and it belongs to someone that can be identified so if I found a pen like this which costs peanuts you know pennies on the ground I can take it and move on I don't have to identify it because if people dropped it they wouldn't go half an hour later to look for it it's so cheap it's negligible but if you found a pen that is worth like a hundred and fifty dollars something of value or more you can't keep that you have to identify the brand the color the shape it's in and then a mouse around you that listen I found an item of some value so whoever had lost something within the vicinity of this area please contact me and you'll get people calling you so listen I lost my watch I lost my my wallet I lost this and that and you can just simply ignore these calls and say no it's not what I found until someone tells you I found a pen to explain it described the pen he says it's a brand of so-and-so said sorry it's not the pen until someone fits the description correctly and then you can give it to them in Allah Knows Best"
