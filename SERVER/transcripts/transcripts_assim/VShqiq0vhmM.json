  "transcript": "[Music] i didn't realize this that i thought that the smell was not just manifesting and so then after the prayer i was like showering so i was busy for like 20 minutes and while i was showing i like realized that the smell i got in the fuji which was the actual smell of farting so i got out the shower and gave wadu and at that time they were like four to five minutes left till sunrise so i played fajr again but then i passed wind and dashahood and then by the time i i said that this team it was like two minutes past the sunrise so then what should i have done nothing you should have prayed it again see initially the first incident where you felt something coming out you concluded your fajr prayer with the congregation on the assumption that my prayer is valid to come and say that while showering 20 minutes later i realized that the smell was the smell of farting come on there's something not in sync here how is it possible for a person to realize something 20 minutes later if any the motherboard is is busted you you you don't do this either you figure it out on the same spot or you get a report saying to you after 20 minutes analysis that yes what came out was a wind or farting or but you don't all of a sudden realize 20 minutes that oh that probably was it doesn't work with so this is shaytan messing up with your head your first prayer is valid and you don't have to do anything sha allah"
