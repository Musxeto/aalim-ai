  "transcript": "Zarah from Saudi Arabia is asking a question that we know that the Prophet said that Islam whenever someone perfects his voodoo and walks to the Masjid Allah would give him with every step he makes one good deed he would erase one bad deed and he would elevate him one degree in Jannah for every step so he's saying can we get the same reward if we drive the answer is no you will not get the same reward at all if you drive so is it possible for me to walk to a more distant Masjid to be entitled for more reward answers yes the further the Masjid is the more or greater the deeds you will be getting and believe me the time spent walking from your home to the Masjid whether it's five minutes or 10 minutes it's time of Vicker it's time of a badda you are actually in the state of worshipping allah Dajjal by walking it gives you time to contemplate to see the blessings of Allah over you and to remember allah azza wajal so I hope this answers your question Oh"
