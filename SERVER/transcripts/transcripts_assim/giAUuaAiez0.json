  "title": "How to get a House in Jannah on a Friday Praying the 12 Ratwatib Prayers Daily",
  "transcript": "total after and before the zohar salah but in friday how many raka we should pray after and before the jummah okay i will answer inshallah from bangladesh he says we know that in order to get a house established for you in paradise you have to observe offering 12 voluntary raqqas every single day and this is known as two before fajr six uh related to lahore four before it two after it two after maghrib and two after asia these are twelve so he says i have a confusion which is on a friday we know that there is no sunnah before friday and the sunnah is to pray either turak has home after friday or if you want you can pray four raka's at the masjid either one so this means that i'm either two raka's uh four raka's short or two short so what to do friday is an exemption it's a special case and if you maintain praying and offering the 16 the 12 raka's six days a week and offering the eight rakaas uh during friday or 10 rakaats then you will be inshallah included in the reward"
