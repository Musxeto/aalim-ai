  "transcript": "Areeba from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. I have a question if a father paid zakat on the jewelry he had that also included the daughter's jewelry he was keeping but he pays zakat after calculating throughout the year rather than paying it immediately and he gives zakat not just in cash but also can give in food and groceries then given that this father is from Pakistan and usually listens to the imam of the masjid who seems like Hanafi because they pray asr late is the zakat valid should the daughter repay the zakat in the form of cash and immediately does the daughter have access to that gold yes or no yes yes she does if this is the case she should be the one giving the zakat on time or correcting her father by telling him and if he does not comply it's her responsibility and it has to be given in gold or in cash not in food or in clothes"
