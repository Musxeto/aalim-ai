  "transcript": "As-Salamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu So Sheikh, I just wanted to ask if, let's say someone used to wear clothes in public that should not be worn as a Muslim. For a guy it could be shorts above the knee or for a girl it could be dresses which exposes her skin and they still have such clothes with them. How should they get rid of them? Can they sell them or can they give them to a charity? What should be done? Such inappropriate clothes they can keep and wear to their spouses if they wish and if not they can sell it to those who can use it in halal means or they can donate it to charity organizations, Muslim charity organizations who know how to utilize it by giving it to a newly wed couple who would use it for one another in a halal way and Allah knows best."
