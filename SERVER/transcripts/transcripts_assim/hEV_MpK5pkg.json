  "title": "4 Rakats after Dhur & 4 Rakats before Asr, should we do it sometimes or regularly? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Shahrukh from Singapore. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. So we know that two rakah after the mandatory prayer of Dhuhr is from the 12 rakahs that we pray to get Insha Allah palace and Jannah. What's the ruling on praying like four rakahs after Dhuhr? Should we do it regularly or should we do it like sometimes? And does the same ruling apply to four rakah before Asr? JazakAllah. These extra two rakahs after the emphatic two rakahs of Dhuhr and the four rakahs before Asr which is also not emphatic, they're recommended. But they're not part of the 12 rakahs that the Prophet ﷺ used to observe. But he recommended it. So if a person says, okay, every day I'm going to pray four rakahs before Dhuhr, two rakahs and two rakahs after Dhuhr, and four rakahs before Asr till the rest of my life, you're doing good. And you'll be rewarded highly for that Insha Allah without any problem. And don't listen to those who say that, oh, the Prophet ﷺ did not pray them all the time so we should pray them on and off. No. Ignore them. The Prophet ﷺ recommended it. So you can do it all the time till the rest of your life without any problem with the grace of Allah."
