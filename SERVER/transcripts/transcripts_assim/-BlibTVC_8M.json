  "transcript": "hey at least from Saudi Arabia was asking about the toothpaste and he says people say that it nullifies your your fasting and my Mona was if I understood her correctly because there was so much air and interference with her call she says that she violated her fasting with someone I think through a fight and she said verbal bad words so does this voice hurt fasting the things that void your fasting scholars say are seven so memorize them and then you don't have to worry about anything else because now you know that these seven nullify is your fasting nullifiers fasting so anything else does not first of all eating and drinking so eating and drinking anything that goes into your stomach into your stomach through the mouth or through the nose then this nullifies your fasting even if you swallow a stone it nullifies your fasting secondly whatever takes the role of food and drink such as the IV if you have gel across for example that you can live for three or four days without eating and drinking just because of this IV is going into your veins so this nullifies our fasting and this means that if I take antibiotics if I take voltaren shots if I take insulin if I take penicillin anything that does not nourish me that does not take the role of eating and drinking this doesn't nullify your fasting so if someone says if I have to take vaccines does it affect my fasting no it doesn't I have to extract a tooth and the doctor gives me what they call it tranquilizers whatever or anesthesia does it affect my fasting the answer is no thirdly vomiting intentionally I ate too much I have something going on I don't like it I put my finger or smell something and I vomit intentionally this voids my fasting if I ate too much and I feel disturbed and all of a sudden without me helping it I'm throwing up I'm vomiting this is unintentional it doesn't affect you fasting fourthly cupping and this is an issue of dispute among scholars so the most authentic opinion it's safer not to cop while fasting cupping is having scratches and slashes on the back of your neck or on your shoulders and then extracting the rotten blood and it's a form of healing and medication it is good the Prophet encouraged it is awesome but during fasting refrain from it because it's an issue of issue of dispute however taking samples of your blood for the hospital is totally permissible bleeding from your gum while the doctor the dentist is working this is does not affect your fasting try not to swallow it what else donating blood if it wears you down in a pint or two if in this case make it after Maghrib and if you don't have the possibility to make it after Maghrib then do it and make up for that day fifthly ejaculation any person ejaculating while he's awake of course because this is different than nocturnal emission what you suffer or what you have of what what they call wet dreams when you jiggle it while sleeping this doesn't affect your fasting at all but if you do it intentionally while awake by seeing at looking at something or thinking or masturbating this nullifies your fasting sixth is intercourse and this is the highest of all and we spoke about the expiration in the beginning seventh is the blood of menses or postnatal bleeding these two if there exists then the fast is void even if it's seconds before the end of the matter rip now if you look at toothpaste and look at these seven categories you will find that as long as it doesn't go into your throat you're in the clear and for sister my muna again verbally abusing people in doing wrong things or fighting it's not part of the seven so it reduces the reward but the fast is correct who we have"
