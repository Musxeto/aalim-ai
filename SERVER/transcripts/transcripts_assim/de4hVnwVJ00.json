  "title": "Will my good deeds be rejected if I'm rude to my parents? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I've heard in a um in a lecture that there's a Hadith in which the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that there are three people whose deeds will not be accepted and that one of them is the one who is rude to his parents so I was wondering if if if this Hadith is truth I don't know the Hadith that you're referring to but there are a number of hadiths where the Prophet says Alam three Allah does not talk to them and does not look at them and does not purify them and they have great torment on the day of judgment and he mentions three categories in one of these the one who's undutiful disrespectful to his parents in another Hadith the prophet says a person who's undutiful and disrespectful to his parents will not enter Jenna however the scholars look at these hadiths to indicate that these are major sins but not sins that nullify Islam so we don't say that a person who does this is out of the fold of Islam and is in Hell For Eternity rather it is a one of the major sins in Islam and a person is in great danger and I hope this answers your question"
