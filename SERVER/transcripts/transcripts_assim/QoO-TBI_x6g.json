  "transcript": "alhamdulillah i think we have reached hadith number 40 of the book um and this is an achievement that we would not have able to achieve had it not been to the grace and favor and blessing of allah upon us as and we have a long hadith which has a lot of lessons though regarding the chapter that deals with purity it's only a short statement but i feel that we have to understand and comprehend this hadith because it talks and speaks about our prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam so who would do us the honor of reading it okay raise your voice please abdullah the prophet saw allah said i have been given five things that were not given to anyone before me first allah has made me victorious by all by his frightening my enemies for a distance of one month's journey second the earth has been made for me and for my followers a place for praying and a means to perform tayammum dry ablution with clean sand or soil and therefore a man or a woman from amongst my followers can pray wherever he may be at the time the prayer is due third the booty has been made halal lawful for me yet it was not made lawful for anyone else before me fourth i have been given the right of intercession on the day of resurrection fifth every prophet used to be sent to his nation only but i have been very well the translation has a minor mistake because it's stated that the prophet said in the very beginning i've been given five things that were not given to anyone before me anyone is wrong it should have been that we're not given to any prophet before me so this is the arabic word used is talking about the major differences between him and the previous messengers of allah and by far we know that he is the best of all messengers and prophets of allah and he is the chosen one so the first point is that the prophet said i have been victorious by all meaning that allah azzawajal gave him a special feature that before reaching his enemies through a journey of one month traveling before he reaches them one month prior all would be thrown into their hearts o and fear and intimidation would be thrown only in the hearts of his enemies now let us go back in history the prophet islam was he a tyrant was he a man who used to torture his enemies crucify them throw them in boiling oil chopping them into small pieces as a lot of the tyrants at the time used to do at all on the country the prophet islam used to honor the prisoners of war allah says in the quran that the characteristics of the believers that they feed people the food though they love the food and allah mentioned who they feed the poor the mesquin and the orphan and the prisoner so this is our religion we value the prisoners of wars we honor them we give them food we respect them and this was our prophet then why would his enemies fear him so much though they know that he's the most generous he's the most merciful he's the most kind he is compassionate he would never say no to anyone who would ask him yet allah gave him this feature despite all of his good character because the enemies should not be his enemies and that is why they themselves were astonished by this we know that he does not torture people so why are we afraid of him this is not something human this is from allah azzawajal the second point is that the prophet says earth has been made to me a place of worship and means of purification so whoever gets the time of prayer due he must pray and this was only made for our prophet other religions must pray in their synagogues their churches their temples the muslims pray anywhere and this is a sight to be seen if you travel to the depth of united states of america if you go to china if you go to indonesia if you go to europe if you go to arabia if you go to the jungles of africa you will never miss the sight of someone in the middle of nowhere praying and no one is watching him so many times i travel in the middle of the desert for long hundreds of kilometers and there's no one there complete isolation and all of a sudden i spot a car and while i'm passing the car the car is parked and there's a man praying on his own or with his wife on the floor on the ground on the sand who's forcing him to do this no one who is he doing it for for allah does he have to wait until he reaches a gas station no the earth has been made a place of worship for me and for my ummah the prophet says so whenever you want to pray pray anywhere every place that is pure and acceptable for prayer you pray anywhere you don't have to have a designated place only otherwise i will not pray and why are we mentioning this hadith in the chapter of purity because also the earth was made means of purification for the muslims so if you do not have water then alhamdulillah you have earth and there is nowhere where you could say i can't have neither water nor earth even if you're in a space shuttle and you're flying going to the moon going elsewhere there's still a place for you to perform ablution through the dry evolution which is the ground or the floor of the space shuttle so you still can perform salah the prophet goes on to say in the third place or the third point that he was awarded and given that the booty of war the treasures and the things that are left over by the enemy the booty that when you are victorious you collect these were made halal one would say so what is new well in the previous nations as mentioned in the quran and in their sacred books as well whenever someone conquered or attacked another village the booty of war was not permissible for them to use they were instructed to gather all what they have gained and put it in an open plaza in an open area and stay away from it and then fire comes from the sky and consumes it all this was done you know kane and what's his brother's name abel and whatever kabil and habit we know them i've always make mistakes in pronouncing their names gog and mog and mug and whatever i know it in arabic so cain and abel they disputed and allah instructed them to provide a sacrifice one gave the best of sacrifice he has and the other gave the scum and the rubbish which he had and allah accepted it by sending a fire to take that so this was the norm when the prophet was sent allah allah made these booties halal for us so that it would add value to the muslims and it would increase their provision and would act also as an incentive the fourth part is the prophet says i've been given the right of intercession on the day of resurrection what is meant by intercession do you know the word in arabic no shafa intercession is a shafa and it originates from a shepherd meaning even numbers you know that there's shepherd and witter is even whiter is odd and why do we call intercession to be shafa because when a person wants to go and speak to an influential person a rich person a person with position and with fame if i go alone he would tell me go and take an appointment i don't have time and may he may not even meet me that is why i come with a second person who knows him so both of us are called shepherd and he is interceding to me and he's speaking on my behalf and because he has power over that man probably i will get my stuff answered and my request uh fulfilled the prophet says i've been given the right of intercession on the day of resurrection and we all know that intercession or shafa is a privilege given by allah it is not a right that you acquire it is not something that it is a must one of the main conditions of shafar is that allah approves of it and the second is that you do not intercede except to whom allah accepts it so in short the right of intercession has no great value because it's with the permission of allah and only to those whom allah wants yet allah gave it to the prophet over all the others so that he would elevate his status and would show all the humans an older jinn the status of the prophet to allah and that he is the most beloved to allah and a lot of the times we hear the wrong word or the wrong expression when we hear that ibrahim is khalillah and muhammad is they say habibullah right and this is wrong ibrahim and muhammad peace be upon them are both khalillah because the highest grade of love so when you say that muhammad is habib allah it's a lower degree and this is wrong the prophet said in the authentic hadith i am khalil rahman he said if i were to take a khalil i would have taken abu bakr to be my khalid but i am khalil i cannot do this because i only have allah to take as my khaleen intercession on the day of judgment is a number of levels and layers the highest layer is the intercession of the prophet and you all know the long hadith when allah azzawajal makes all the people standing and waiting for the judgment of allah azzawajal what do they do this is inshallah what we will know after the break so stay tuned assalamu alaikum and welcome back so on the day of judgment when all the humans are gathered in one place without any clothes newt uncircumcised men and women alike together allah be pleased with her said of allah men and women know next to each other won't they look at each other and the prophet said by allah they have seen what occupies them they're unable to look anywhere it's like if the most beautiful woman is passing by and this 18 wheeler going 150 kilometers an hour headed towards you what will you be looking at it's the the it is coming to rampage it's gonna go over you and the woman starts taking her clothes off are you gonna you will not have the terror that you're facing does not make you look at anything on the day of judgment it's even worse so people will not look at each other at all and they're waiting there the prophet tells us that the sun is drawn so close that the people sweat and their places in accordance to their deeds it is less than a mile away from them some of them because their deeds are good their sweat reaches their ankles and some of them their sweat reaches their knees and from the knees to the ground it's all sweat and some of them it reaches their waists and some of them they drown in their own sweat because they have very few deeds torah deeds as they say and the problem is that when it's too long the day is 50 000 years long that day of judgment so they go to adam asking him for intercession don't you see what's happening to us didn't allah create you with his own hands and had the angels prostrate to you go to allah intercede for us he said no no no no i'm not the one i ate from the forbidden fruit and i disobeyed allah go to so they go to noah and they said you are the grateful and thankful slave of allah and allah has blessed you with so many things don't you see what we are suffering intercede what does he say i am not the one i had one invocation but i made it against my people and ask allah azza to drown them all go to ibrahim he's the father of messengers so they go to ibrahim and they tell ibrahim don't you see what we're suffering intercede so that allah would judge us and then we will go but we would like to go it's so terrifying and ibrahim says i am not the one i lied three lies in my life subhanallah he like three lies in his life how many lies do we lie per minute from 0 to 60 i i presume like six seven lies every single so and so and look at his lies they were not even lies when he said that this is my lord and then when it went down he said my lord is bigger i don't like those that set talking about the star talking about the moon and then talking about the sun he was telling his people these are the gods you you pray two okay this is my god when it sets no this is not my god and when he saw the moon this is my god and when it says then i don't want to worship a god that sets and when the sun came up say this is my god this is even bigger and when it said he said i do not believe in all of your gods i believe only in allah azza and he's giving him dawah the second lie when they asked him did you break our idols did no no i didn't it's the biggest one look the axe is in his neck he's the one who broke all of this they said to him you're crazy you know like we know that he cannot do such a thing and then he told him if he can't do such a thing how can you worship him and the third lie was when they went to egypt and the king of egypt was a tyrant who would take any beautiful woman and if she had a husband he would kill the husband so ibrahim told her listen if he knew that i was your husband he'll kill me and if anyone asks you just say that you are my sister because by allah in islam you are my sister there is no one muslim on earth except you and i and these were three lies and they were all justifiable lies but he could not intercede because he thought that this was not acceptable he told them to go to moses they went to moses you're the one who allah spoke to allah you're the one that allah split the sea for you you allah gave this and that for you intercede for us he said no no no i killed an innocent person go to isa isa is one of the great messages of allah they go to isa but isa declines and he does not name any sin he doesn't say i did this or that he just no i'm not the one go to muhammad they go to muhammad was he said i am the one yes i am the one and he goes and he seeks permission to enter and allah allows him to enter and once he goes next to the throne he falls on his face prostrating he says i start to praise allah with phrasings i did not know it's something that allah is giving me and revealing to me as and then after a long prostration allah says muhammad raise your head and ask for intercession and you will be given so this is the greatest and highest level of intercession the second level is shared by a lot of the believers shared by the messengers shared by the angels and that is when people intercede for people of hell who've been already in hell and the prophet comes alistair or the messengers or the angels or the prophets or the righteous people and they intercede for them so that allah would make them out so instead of spending a thousand years there's been maybe 10 years in hell maybe less maybe more the third type of intercession is for those who were doomed and judged to be in hell not to go in hell so allah go to hell but then people intercede messengers into seed their loved ones intercede and allah with his mercy and generosity gives them to their people so instead of going they don't go the fourth type of intercession is when people are in paradise allah azza accepts the intercession in elevating their status in paradise and this happens when righteous people are in one level and their children are in a lower level allah azzawajal with his grace raises their children's and offspring level to be with them as part of accepting their intercession as mentioned in surat and najman and elsewhere and number five the prophet says that before me every prophet used to be sent to his own people we know that musa was sent to bani israel the sons of israel the jews and isa jesus christ was also sent to the jews issa was not sent to mankind peace be upon him jesus christ was not sent to all of humankind he said i was sent to the lost sheep of israel so this is his message except the prophet salallahu he was sent mercy to mankind not only that also to the jinn and he called the jinn and the jinn listened to him and he communicated with them and he told him what to eat and what not to eat and he told him what's halal and what's haram and the quran we recite is the quran that they recite and when we go to paradise they also would go to paradise and those who did not believe among them will go to hell as those humans who did not believe will also go to hell so this hadith i know i might have bored you to death but it is one of the greatest hadith that talks about our prophet islam and it has some of the foundations of iman now a lot of the muslims say okay if the prophet was given the intercession so nowadays after salah what are you doing i'm calling the prophet he's my fear no this is haram the prophet is dead you don't call him you only call but through your good deeds when you die the prophet will intercede for you but you cannot by any chance while you're alive on this earth ask the prophet for intercession this would be shirk calling the dead is shirk otherwise none of the companions may love appease with them ever went to the grave of the prophet and said oh prophet of allah we need rain oh prophet allah we need food oh prophet of allah we need this or that none of them did this and therefore we know that this is an act of aggression that one should uh stay away from so until we meet next time"
