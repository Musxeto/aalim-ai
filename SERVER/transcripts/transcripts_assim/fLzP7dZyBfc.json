  "transcript": "Hamza from Pakistan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sir my question is that I actually suffer from a bit of a swastika and OCD so I actually for example if I'm studying economics as a subject and I'm actually thinking that is what I'm studying halal or not or is the way in which I'm studying halal or not for example I am not praying and I'm studying and does that mean that what I'm studying or the way I'm studying is haram and I'm not supposed to learn this or I'm supposed to abandon this? These are two different things. If you're studying something that is halal, not praying has no impact on what you study. So it's like saying Sheikh I don't pray and the food is being served so I eat this food. Is the food I'm consuming is haram because I don't pray? This has no relationship. These are two different things. Not praying is a major sin that can escalate to be kufr and disbelief and takes you out of the fold of Islam. Studying something that is halal is totally separate from it and there are no relationship between the two and Allah knows best. you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all."
