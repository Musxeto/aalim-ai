  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] ketta yesterday I was deprived of a lot of time to continue my lecture so without going into an introduction the theme is flee to allah and it is based on seeking refuge in allah from a number of things so what i will talk about seeking Allah's guidance would be on two things the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam used to seek refuge in allah azza wajal from Allah well cook for well food super worship up one knee fappa chef you failed your mathematic class these are five and you said you're going to speak about - yes I will speak about a Shiva when nifA but there is a weak hadith that is famously spread among the Muslims allahumma inni ah who do become inertia party whenever he was who will a flock this is not authentic the authentic one is a longer version that includes about eleven to twelve things that the Prophet used to seek refuge from sallallahoalyhiwasallam and this is a portion of it which is a fan ticket this is why we always begin our talks with what is authentic and this is what differentiates us from others that the hadith we use you have to trust me not that you don't go and check no please do whatever comes from my mouth you have to check it because this is not awesomes religion or Tom Dick Harry is religion it is the religion of Allah no one is above the law so when we talk you have to verify whatever the ship is saying the truth or he just made that up especially when people just keep on nodding their heads which is good but still so what is Shiva and if Alper these are two separate things and if it were for me I would have to chosen one to devote a whole lecture for but it's not for me so I'll do my level best to go through them Shiva comes from SHOP NOW you know when we die there are two types of graves do you know them there is a ladder and a shock pop a shock is a type of [Music] separation or a hole or a barrier or a trench so the origin of the word shepherd stems from leaving a barrier between you and I so it is disunity it is division because when I have disunity and division with you each one of us takes sides so the Prophet used to seek refuge alayhi salatu wassalam so Shabaab is to have this unity division and enmity with whatever is right and correct because if I was on the side of goodness I wouldn't be doing Shabaab I'm on the right track so the one who's doing Shabaab who's doing this disunity and division is the one on the opposite side or you can say on the dark side of the force anyhow so what is meant by disunity I can disagree with you but not half shikaka as in the case for example he loved the Prophet Elisha he supported him he defended him and he had she fought with him no they had difference of opinion and this is why he was on one side and the Prophet was on the other side but there was no ship up there was disagreement also with Shaitaan we have enmity free one among us in this whole hates Shaitaan and has enmity against Raven but we don't have disagreement unfortunately he is our mentor in most of the cases but we hate him this is actual so when we talk about jihad we talked about disunity and division that is accompanied with hatred with enmity with the whole nine yards and this is something that Allah has warned us greatly from because such disunity once it occurs in a community it does not affect me and you English wise I'm supposed to it does not affect you and I but in Islamic terminology and this is a footnote so this is a commercial break and it says don't pay attention to it they will edit it in Java this is a mistake a lot of the Muslims do when they make Dora they say may Allah forgive you and me and this is wrong in Islam you always begin with yourself whether they like it in the english-speaking countries and say oh this is selfish this is inappropriate who cares this is what the Prophet used to do is awesome so whenever I make Torah oh Allah I say don't say I mean because I would be cheating you if I specify making dora for myself so don't say I mean I'm just giving an example oh Allah forgive me and for you or for them this is the right way instead of say Allah forgive us all and I this is not okay we go back to the program welcome back so suffers most from this disunity not only myself oh you the whole Ummah and listen with your heart lead with your heart the book of allah azzawajal then you will prosperous then you will become successful Allah says in the Quran and this is my path which is straight not the convention this is Quran this is my path which is straight so follow it and do not follow other ways for you will be separated from his way our soldier so there is only one way to applause of Halliburton and this is a servable mooster paper straight path and if you divert deviate then you have gone astray and this is what will happen when you have this and Allah Azza WA JAL has condemned division and disunity so Allah Subhanahu WA Ta'ala says indeed those who have divided the religion and become sects you are not associated with them in anything so the Prophet is not associated with you if you keep on raising the flag I am this sect I am this cult I follow this shape I follow this Arica if I do this way I follow the way of who sallallahu aleyhi where he was at them he says right I say right this is left I say left whatever he tells me to go I will go unquestionable and Allah tells us in the Quran in a long in surah al-baqarah verse 213 that in essence originally all the humans were following one way since Adam 10 centuries after Adam they were all until hate on the way of Allah Azza WA JAL but then disagreement dispute division disunity occurred and they were divided now do you mean to tell me that I cannot dispute with my spouse I wish you can but this is not possible the beauty of marriage of having dispute with your spouse when she tells you this and you say yes dear this is a good marriage so there has to be dispute it's inevitable but we dispute in tastes I like this food I don't like this food I like this color I don't like this color things of such nature are totally legit the Companions used to have it not only that even the recommendation of the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam were subjective to such disagreement there was a slave woman by the name of Maria and she went to mother aisha she told her I want to buy myself out of slavery and become a free woman mother aisha gave her the money now she's what she's a free woman but she was when she was a slave she was married to a man who is a slave himself by the name of movies so this lamb says if a woman gets her freedom becomes a free woman she has the choice whether to stay with the slave man or call it out she goes I don't want this marriage so she chose her freedom from both slavery and from her husband who wants to be married to a slave now she's free she has her own life she could look for a free man movies was so in love with his wife that he tried his level best but she was adamant look I don't want you anymore so he went to the prophet alayhi salat WA Salam and begged him to intercede so the Prophet came to marry her I said Maria why don't you go back to MU if it's a difference of opinion there is a problem here look at what this great companion said she said do you order me because I have to make the distinction is this an order from the prophet of Allah or just a recommendation I'm just interceding I'm just recommending she's just she said I don't have anything to do with him as long as it's a recommendation I appreciate your recommendation but this is not part of religion I do not want him the story goes that whenever she walked he used to follow her in the streets weeping and crying with the great love so this is a difference of opinion but this is not Romeo and Juliet this is real life this is real love between the spouses that we miss that we want so if this is the case then what type of division and disunity are you referring to huh listen each one of us has his own power of intellect his own logic his own personality we cannot all be close all of us here we have to be clones of Rossum engine yourself we can't have clones Islam is a religion of beauty you have your own personality your own choices your own life to do but what governs this is the Quran and the Sunna so you differ you don't like nasi goreng no problem maybe you like something else but if I like it don't blame me we can different this but when it comes to issues of religion then we have to look into it more thoroughly meaning even in little things that are little in sense that it is not backed by anundson they are issues of each D hat do you know what HT hat means if the heart is to put effort so I try to carry this is heavy so I have to put some effort to be able to carry it this is rude so is the heart is when I get a new issue contemporary issue I look in the Quran doesn't say open the Sunnah it doesn't say smoking for example is it in the Quran cigarettes no but I have to make HD hi in this case if your HD hat is against mine this is not division and disunity providing that you are qualified to make each the Hat and one of the most well known respected issues though in my opinion it's great yet in the opinion of a lot of scholars is trivial the issue of donating organs after death so people a lot of people say yeah there's no problem in donating my kidneys my liver my eyes my heart my this by that no problem yet but scholars say that these are not yours these are Allah's first of all second of all respecting the corpse of a deceased Muslim is a must in Islam how do you justify for people to disrespect you and cut you open like a watermelon and then discover that it is not red it is white and it has no taste so keep it concealed alas you're dead let them marry you it's an issue of dispute I personally believe that it is not at all permissible to donate organs after death because Muslims corpse must be respected sure we have 5 waiting lists they'll die they're going to die eventually not today after a year after 10 years Massa Lama Hollis so do not it is an issue of dispute does this mean that I have to have enmity division disunity with the brother who said who's qualified who's an alum who says no I believe that it is permissible no this is his opinion this is mine but when the difference of opinion comes in a Bader in Allah beautiful names and attributes I think Allah is like this Allah is like that who with all due respect are you to think we have the aura we have the Sunnah Allah tells us about his beautiful names about his beautiful attributes and you manipulate you play around and you think it's just something that it is cross correct or wrong no in essential things in Islam that are crystal clear this unity and dispute must not occur because there is only one way and this is the straight path of Allah Azza WA JAL Allah made everything clear for us and this is the beauty of Islam you do not have to be a rocket scientist to discover that this is the religion of Allah that you are on the right path because of yeah but shares also in Mozambique says differently flat for him I'm a Muslim I have Quran and Sunnah give me something from the Quran and Sunnah to debate and talk about but they can't so you are on the right track so a lot of those who follow their whims and desires they spread you disunity and division such as the very beginning al how are it they came and made everybody covered either my way or the highway you commit a major sin you're kafir what you cover nothing not only that you're covered but I can also killing you so I not only that I take your money and then your women are my slave where are we we're not in the jungle what kind of religion is this they caused disunity and this is why the Prophet I saw some describe them as what the hounds of then you have all these last week at in the iesson tell him in a short crash course which was like politicians they cause disunity and division among division among the Muslims though who fight for wealth they have no problem in dividing you in causing fitna between you so that they become richer and among the biggest problematic dividers of the Ummah and those who caused you this unity in the Ummah are the people of the media not you camera man don't worry and the directors and the sound engineers will be doing a good job the media is an evil influential divider if those who are running it do not fear Allah but if they fear Allah we are in good hands this threat or ad and Sunnah and they bring us together look any time you open your newspaper or magazine or turn on your TV to watch News Channel's what do you see hatred disunity you hate one another there cannot be agreement and we are united in religion and our Akita I cannot sit with mohammed rasoolallah said no I say I do a lot okay and I committed adultery any type of unity with someone who curses my mother and slanders and says Abu Bakr and Umar Uthman or or kapha so without having the true religion of origin they can't be unity so we have to go back to the basics to square number one what was before square number one the time of jahiliyya how was before the message of the prophet alayhi salatu salam there were scattered tribes this united no one had ever paid any attention to them the head of the Persian Empire said that you were like bugs and beetles nobody cared about you who are you you Arabs but then when Islam came what happened total transformation 180 degrees unimaginable no weaponry no heavy artillery no technology only Quran and Sunnah and a good strong heart and they conquered the whole world conquered it without what we see nowadays of massacres of atrocities of abuse no spreading peace through which we had spreading peace through the word of allah azza even if we have to go into war but with fairness and justice and this is why Allah warns us from being divided Allah says and hold firmly to the Rope of Allah all together and do not become divided and remember when you were enemies and he brought your hearts together so he's telling us to abide by his rope what is his rope Islam or and indeed the Sunnah of the Prophet erase salat wa salam you do not have a choice I love it when I come here to Malaysia and I speak to the brothers and sisters but as they say old habits die hard I used to be a teacher for 15 years in high school that was about 30 to 33 years ago and as part of my teaching job description I correct students so whenever I see something bad long fingernails wearing necklaces having wrong haircuts I usually bring it to their attention and one of the common mistakes they have is they drink and eat with their left hand so I see a lot of you a lot and if I would just wait and have to bring it up old habits die hard it is haram to consume something with your left and this is what I used to tell my students and some would argue ok teacher if I have a sandwich in my right hand and I'd like to have a drink what to do so I say okay if you have a bisquit what to do use your left foot what what kind of analogy you guys are doing some people just make things to eat and drink with your left hand stop don't bring justifications over with commercial break number two we flex our muscles we showed the world truly who we are as Muslims united strong abiding by the Quran Sunnah and fair what did the enemy of Islam do something we have to change and how would we change this well you have to put yourself in the enemy's shoes put on your socks first you don't know what was there so you put yourself in the enemy's use what is the thing that you want to do to break this power and strength this unite them divide them and this is where they divide and rule or divide and conquer this is what the British colonial power did they came to our Muslim empire the last Empire and they started dividing them into small countries and nations putting imaginary boundaries so behind that line you cannot crush and making them proud of that ethnicity from an Arab yo guys don't speak Arabic you say you we're Malay you don't have our heritage they say no we are from Algiers no from Morocco we are from Syria we are from this country and that they divided us sometimes I make a joke when I pray with the congregation my friends so when we make a comma and I'm the Imam I look at them si excuse me only Saudis in the first row please but unfortunately this is what is actually happening in the Muslim world they have managed to divide us and this is why when someone is introduced to me I look at his head to his toes then again to his head I analyze which country you see Arab is not good okay is he from the Middle East no he's from the Middle East from that even Peninsula no he's not is he from number one no no good yes is he from McCann medina is he from the central province is he from this and I keep on downsizing it until it fits me he is me and then I would say but your prayer is not that good so at the end of the day oh the whole world is nothing except me this is how she works and this is how the non-muslims try their level best we can never be strong again until we unite until we leave all our differences behind and put our GPS our compass to be the Quran and the Sunnah not individuals not a ruler or a scholar or a wealthy man or a diary our compass is the Quran and the Sunna if they follow them if not we respect them but a much religion is more worthy of being followed and this is what is known as al Gemara the Prophet said a lot o Sam who average disunited whoever leaves the Gemara then he has taken out the not cattle Islam the not of Islam it's like a knot tied to a camel's neck and you can pull it behind you if the camera does not have this knot you cannot say hey  you would not come it probably kick you or bite you so this Jamaa is what we're looking for the unity sooner part 2 of the lecture which is about hypocrisy and navab but focuses on unity and not dividing the ummah yet this begins from the very bottom from our one-to-one relationships to go through but I'll give you a handful the Prophet says is awesome he is not from us Amina who turns a wife against her husband Wow we do this all the time my wife goes to my daughter and says look at your house why does it your husband buy you new furniture what is it your husband take you on vacation why doesn't your husband give you monthly allowance why do and then my daughter hears this stores it in the hard-disk if it were in there are no problem she sleeps it accepts a new day but she stores it in the hard-disk no antivirus [Music] why don't you buy me new dresses why don't you take me out and division and disunity takes place the Prophet says a lease or sublease Amina Mahabharata nada so jihad a good real parent when his daughter comes and says my husband that which other go back to your home kiss your husband and ask for his forgiveness yes but he's their own door nevertheless your marriage is more important than your feelings because Shaitaan utilizes this in seconds and I've seen this unfortunately 99.9% parents don't do this did he do that the son of a so-and-so stay by your fingernail is more valuable than 10 like him I will marry you to the best of men that was 15 years ago and she's still in his home divorced so this is an issue of bringing people together not you dividing them and having disunity in our homes in our day-to-day communication he prohibited if there were three people in the room in the car the two of them speak secretly leaving the third so Mohamed Salah we're good buddies with us is booty he just came he's a new kid in the block so I'm talking too much Allah is with us but he's unable to hear this is prohibited Haram why because this would put depression and sadness maybe they are talking against me maybe they're making fun especially if we laugh and I do this when I travel with my brothers especially in foreign countries so if I am taking a cab or a grab whatever you call it and person driving is a Chinese and I'm with an Arab and we speak in Arabic I immediately stop the product and say to the driver excuse me we're Arabs and it's easier for us to communicate in Arab is it okay with you or should I speak in English this is me how I do this because not because I'm a good person because my religion orders me to do this and this is the beauty of Quran Sunnah you follow you're not being followed you follow the Quran and the Sunnah and we see this a lot the brother has a chair empty so I come and I want to sit in between them noticing that they're talking to one another this is how I mean Islam this causes this unity I have to seek their permission first excuse me can I sit one of them would say sorry we're talking here I go somewhere else this is also part of the Sunnah there's so many how much time 3 minutes so there are so many things I'll tell you how Islam protects our unity I see a woman I like her I propose to her father he accepts we're engaged Muhammad Sawa happy the man he is he says this woman is far greater than being sure her son's wife tell you what go and propose so he proposes being tall being fair skin being they accept what will this caused me hatred and enmity it is prohibited for a man to propose to a woman he knows his brother has proposed to her not married it's a proposal so if one is already committed to another as an engagement and another one or a third one or a fourth one do not know about this and they propose say no sorry we're booked no it's free seating you select may be number two is better three number four as long as they do not know there's no enmity because they don't know but once they know there's a problem I'm in my shop a brother comes and says how much is your miswak I say five Ringgits said Wow that's a good deal okay I'm gonna buy it my neighbor comes and say hey Fife is a lot I have the same miss work for three so he breaks my bargain and he takes my customer this is totally prohibited and he's sinful at the sight of Allah so why it's free business it's a free market when you implement Islam you have unity you have the purity of the heart and there's so many examples but due to the restraints and restrictions of time we have to move on to the second topic but before I conclude this first topic you have to analyze how you deal with your brother's well I I know this for any certain and out of experience there are among us and you know probably if you open your mobile phones you'll find in the contactless someone with the red flag next to it there are people who make you and easy sometimes I sit and come people I speak with them freely I joke I joke a lot unfortunately and they feel good about it we make fun of one another and I you know my tongue is very shy so people laugh sometimes you get people who make you uneasy you feel that I want to get out of my skin so Salaam alaikum brother they've had why didn't you invite me to dinner last night with others I forgot you always forget me what about three years ago when you made the wedding of your daughter you did not invite me Allah you keep on apologizing you there are people who make disunity and division their way of life so they sit and they gossip so while they're sitting with you mashallah yes yes he always makes fun of you yeah yeah once it did this is it and I feel agitated angry and I have hatred in my heart such people are among those whom the Prophet as I'm used to seek refuge in Allah from causing disunity causing division division among the Muslims so what will we benefit from today's talk or half of it in my one of those do I cause division and disunity wherever I go or I try to gather the Pope the people and the Muslims and try to love one another try to think well of your brother why didn't he call why didn't he send me a message some people just keep on blaming you when they see you Ali you never call you never send me flowers not my wife flowers and flowers die in a day or two I'd rather give her a check or money or something that's useful so be careful not to be one of those okay now hypocrisy is a topic that everyone of you know so I'm not gonna reinvent the wheel but we will try to open our eyes on the dangers of hypocrisy it is one of the worst diseases and illnesses of the heart so once it infest a Muslims heart corrupts it it kills it though you see think that he is alive and walking but he is among the walking dead truly in the sense that this person has no heart Allah judges you through what your hearts and your deeds so if your deeds are okay but your hearts are corrupt you are in hell for a day no for a year no for a million no for eternity so this is an extremely important topic Allah says in the Quran about the hypocrites in their hearts is disease so Allah has increased their disease and for them is a painful punishment because they habitually used to lie hypocrisy is something that all righteous practicing devote Muslim fear the most we don't feel poverty as we feel hypocrisy because money comes and goes today I'm poor tomorrow I'm rich today I'm rich tomorrow I'm poor but with hypocrisy when your heart is polluted corrupted and dead then I have lost this life and the here after in sahih al-bukhari no ABI Malaika one of the great appearing he says I interviewed I accompanied I questioned thirty of the prophet's companions sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and melody peace with them one of them fears me fart upon himself they fear hypocrisy is it possible that a companion fears about hypocrisy yes one of the Companions was known to be the secret keeper of the prophets Allah so solemn his name is who they eva newly a man his father and who they accepted islam in the same year in the second year of hijab they went and met the Prophet on the battle of butter this is when they first met but they had a covenant they had promised that this believers not to fight so they asked a prophet we are Muslims but we gave our word is it do not fight with us in better the battle sorry in the Battle of third year of hijra correct this edit piece so on the third here in a third the battle started and it was chaos when the archers came down from mount hood and the Muslims could not see or recognize so they just kept on hitting and striking whomever they see and one of them was Yemen the father of Haditha and he's urging the urging them brothers he's my father already they have ended his life after the battle was over the Prophet a son discovered that the Muslims killed him and this is what they call friendly fire so the Prophet said his blood money 100 camel is from the treasure of the Muslims to you who defer they said no prophet of Allah they have done it by mistake I forgive them so the Prophet Allah so salaam felt very happy of such forgiveness and of such a caliber of a companion he kept him with him all the time and he informed him of the names of the hypocrites who tried once to assassinate the Prophet eResearch since a long story I will not go into detail so he was known to be what the secret keeper of the Prophet Iceland because he knew the names of the hypocrites imagine Roma in old hubbub the second Haditha may Allah be pleased with him used to go to him in he urges him Haditha am I one of those whom the Prophet has named to you to be a hypocrite where is he let me check where is in Medina and the Prophet said that he is a martyr and he is in Jannah and the consensus of all Muslims that he is number two in the Ummah of Islam after Abu Bakr yet he feared hypocrisy upon himself and hypocrisy is divided into two types hypocrisy that is major cover which is known as related to al-qaeda to your belief and this is to show people that you are a Muslim but you actually are not you hide this belief you hate Islam you hate the Muslims you love other religions and you respect other religions more than you respect is not only that you look down at Islam at Sharia you considered it barbaric you don't love the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam why did the Prophet sat down on the ground and ate why didn't he use a chair stuff follow you here some atheists you hear some hypocrites say such things now this is me goofer allah azza wajal says in the quran warning us from those who are hypocrites and if you look at the quran it is filled with evidences with description of the hypocrites describing to us their characteristics why it's not vague it's crystal clear you will know them by the tone of their voices you can say that they do not mention Allah will not remember Allah they're lazy when they go to forms of worship so many did characteristics of the hypocrite why because they are far greater in danger than the enemies of Islam of among the different religions so if we have an army who's about to attack us the hypocrites are more dangerous sure the enemy has air force they have Marines they have tanks they have RPGs guns yes but you know them and you can fight them and you can defend your country yourself and your religion with someone standing next to you pretending to be a Muslim you never know when he'll stab you in the back and this is the most or the biggest problem Allah says in the Quran warning us again we have to refer to the Quran read the Quran Allah says and of the people are some who say we believe in Allah and the last day but they are not believers this is a testimony of Allah they think to deceive Allah and those who believe but they deceive not except themselves and perceive it not they don't know it and [Music] the hypocrites when they are hypocrites they're not making a small sin that you can just brush it off your shoulder and tell us kiss and make up no harm done no it's problematic it is something that takes you out of the religion of Islam Allah says in the Quran indeed the hypocrites will be in the lowest depths of the fire and never will you find for them a helper now houston we have a problem whenever we speak about hypocrisy do you ever for an instance small tiny bit consider yourself maybe I am a hypocrite I will not make a survey because if I say okay who those who do please raise your hands everybody will raise his hand or face being a hypocrite but the fluid thing is that we don't when we speak about hypocrites the first thing that comes to mind rulers politicians wealthy people people of the media actors and actresses sinners night clubbers drunkards everybody else except the one from the Arabian Peninsula everyone except me and this is a prep a problem the companions did not deal with hypocrisy like this they were truly afraid and this fear shoots you straight to Jannah but if you don't have this fear you have a problem so what are types how much time okay enough what are the types of this major hypocrisy that we can relate to one corruption in or on earth any type of corruption on earth makes you a hypocrite either a full-fledged or any close but no cigars so such as so any type of wanting to spread sins an advocator an endorser of sins would be having this characteristic of hypocrite hypocrite hypocrisy in the sense that we know that listening to music is haram i play music so what the heck no problem it's sinful but if you spread it you endorse it you know it's Haram and you're calling people to do it and defending it you're in great danger and likewise if you open a nightclub if you open an interest-based bank and you spread our armed transactions among the Muslims involving them in consuming RIBA Allah says and when it is said to them that is the hypocrites do not cause corruption on the earth they say we are not but reformers we're not spreading corruption we are reformers unquestionably it is they who are the corrupters but they perceive it not number two among the science of people being hypocrite is that they deceive the believers and the disbelievers and this is the story of the vast majority of Muslims who take sides with the disbelievers against the believers not because there's a dispute on land or on wealth or on power but because they have devotion and allegiance to the Kofun I can the Muslim so it's religiously based and this kind is found profoundly in the Muslim countries in the Muslim world from those who were brought up and educated by the disbelievers in every country you will find moles being there waiting for the right moment maybe after 20 years 30 years when they strike so you find in most countries the Constitution is not Islam it's not the Koran who did this Mohammed Abdullah I've met highly Muslim names but where were they educated don't ask so Allah says and when they meet those who believe they say we believe so when they meet the believers they claim to be believers as well and when they are alone with their evil ones they say indeed we are with you we were mocking them if you open the newspaper or watch news channels you see this clearly all over the Muslim world they enjoin evil and forbid my oath and righteous and virtue Allah says the hypocrites men and women are from one another they enjoin on the people al-munkar and forbid people from al-munkar hands from spending in the way of law of Allah part of their characteristics is that they always swear by Allah lying and you can see this in their press conferences no more he knows what's in my heart yes you hypocrites and ever so and so Allah does but you are a hypocrite and this is why when someone swears a lot when he speaks this is condemned in the Quran don't use Alma's name in vain so that people would believe you your actions should ensure that but when you say well la he will look there's something wrong you probably are lying Allah says they have taken their oaths as a cover so that they avert it people from the way of Allah part of the characteristics of hypocrites is showing off boasting about their good deeds and we have to make a distinction in an hour it is time for so if I'm walking out and I'm going to the Masjid and someone says where are you going I have something to do masha'Allah vada Kanda what are you doing is it I'm hiding my good deeds wrong why is it wrong this is followed followed you do not hide you announce where are you going I'm going to the salat in the Masjid you have to announce this in Ramadan would you go with me to hear this I'm tired yes I'm fasting we're all fasting but when it comes to the London three deeds this is what you should hide and not disclose only if needed with a legitimate reason I go to the office and a friend comes and sits I'm busy working typing printing having calls businesses working hours and he sits there for her our yawning I feel tired all I haven't slept I don't ask him why didn't you sleep it's none of my business I don't have time so he keeps on doing these things and after half an hour when he gives up that I don't ask Amy sit well Maya I'm tired because last night I sprayed 292 hours night prayer the hundred what are you doing are you crazy this is showing off and this is Haram and this is part of hypocrisy your deeds should be for the sake of Allah Imam Malik Nana's in Medina one of the four great Imams he used to spend his time do you think I have my side mirrors I can't see he used to open in drama ban and reach and whenever someone comes in he hides it with his garment why so that people would not see that he spends a lot of time reading the Quran unlike us when Ramadan comes first five days we meet and SMS everybody I finished half of the Quran how much did you finish we see huh what's juzu know better than you and people lie I'm embarrassed someone is asking me two times I lie you're forcing me to lie and this is sure throwing off and this is part of what hypocrisy and also part of the signs of hypocrisy is to be lazy in forming in performing forms of worship what yes hypocrites by the way at the time of the Prophet Elisha lotto Sturm used to travel for she had they used to accompany the Prophet in Jihad now we don't even go to five minutes over times because we don't want to the hypocrites used to travel the hypocrites used to pray in the masjid but when they go to pray they are a little bit lazy so instead of going in the first truck I they go in the third rack or the fourth record or after the prayer it but they go to the Masjid as described in the Quran the hypocrites remember Allah Allah Allah Allah but but they do it seldomly rarely okay now you compare Apple Apple do you go to jihad do you go to the Masjid being enthusiastic in the first row do you remember a lot they use to give min ash-shaytaan-i'r rajeem this is scary for us when we give terror when you eat lectures o Allah I'm exempted tax-free I feel known if on myself I mad I know they used to give tower as well but their articulation is beautiful what they say is very nice and articulate and fluent yet what's in their heart you can detect in what they say so this is problematic because now it could be any one of us and no one is able to detect this except you you have to look deep inside am I fully devoted to Islam to worshipping Allah erosion on purifying my Ikeda now they say that time is almost over but we haven't gone to part two of hypocrisy which is the practical part because there is a part that takes you out of the fold of Islam which you had mentioned and there's a part that is practical firms of hypocrisy which which deals with the do's and don'ts and this is the type that Rama asked the Prophet Hosea may Allah be pleased with them ramen was not in doubt that he's a kafir he was doubtful that maybe he might lie he might break a promise he might betray something he's interested with and all of these are characteristics of this practical type of hypocrisy in a nutshell what should we do my business stuff like this is your problem I gave you what I have up to you to follow or to neglect but making the door new do bika min Ashiya party one nifA seek refuge in allah in your food that you become a fool or a source of unity not of disunity and seek refuge in allah from hypocrisy to analyze your actions cleanse your heart fill it and pump a man in it Iman is pumped through your actions the moment you sit back and relax and say I don't like this I don't like that in Islam it is part of the things that take people out of the fold of Islam to hate something in Islam so I come to a drunkard and he says sure I love whiskey I love booze I know it's how I'm and I admit that it is Haram but I think it is he a kafir and a hypocrite whatever what what were we doing the whole or you have to do you have to know is he a kafir and hypocrite no he's a sinner but when someone comes and says I don't drink ship and I don't do drugs I cannot digest the fact that something that Allah grows from the earth is Haram what's wrong in having a sniff of cocaine Oh doing some crack or meth or doing some pot smoking pot and getting high there's nothing wrong in that this guy is a kafir and a hypocrite yes full-fledged because he rejected something from Islam sometimes the sisters fall into this ok the brothers so that they would not say discrimination women empower no no the brothers do this all the time the brothers hate things in Islam and you can't eat it this is why I don't like this the sisters issues are very few but the systems are evoke this is why we've learned since we were young to say yes TV otherwise faced high heels coming and flying at your skull so I'm an obedient man the sisters complain it's not fair why does a man marry for I don't like this I don't want and they object verbally this takes you a little bit out of the folder Islam if not 100 percent this is Allah's religion now you don't want your husband to get married this is legit you do not object on the ruling of Allah you do not object that hijab is mandatory even when it's hot and humid in Kuala Lumpur some of the sisters say you always say come on and once in summer and let me see how you do I am sweating like a pig it's air-conditioned I know how sisters feel but this is their test from allah azza wajal so what takes you out of hypocrisy is that you give your heart give it the leadership of the foreign nation give or Andersen the leadership of your heart and let steer it to Allah's paradise and Allah's pleasure I shall use irani what he come one vagina nominee birdie in Elmore 13 in Hawaii you dolly karate Doralee
