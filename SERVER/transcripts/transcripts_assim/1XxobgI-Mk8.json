  "transcript": "this is a question from our good brother and his question is if a brother would like to marry his ability left but he is in his studies now and with a part-time job he can almost provide is it good for him to marry or should he wait because asham said that the best age to marry is now even if he has no money and so on because with his wife in which will come faster risk without without a wife it's coming you should know so what advice will you give this is not a wise advice and unfortunately so many people give genetic answers without knowing the background of the people asking him so if someone comes to me and asks me is it best time to marriage go ahead and marry and end up in six months time finding that the brother had married has loans is unable to provide for his wife she's pregnant and he's under a huge amount of stress and he divorces her then he comes and blame me you're the reason you told me to get married generally speaking yes marriage is good but we have to look at the circumstances this individual who's interested in marrying he's studying he's working is HE capable of providing for his wife renting a house paying the bills without borrowing and lending from uh and borrowing money from others if the answer is yes then inshallah go for it but if there is some Financial constraints and that would cause problems in the future if his wife is demanding or she has health issues and he cannot afford to help her or to provide for her financially then we would say that maybe you would wait a little bit six months or at least make it clear to them that this is what I can provide and if they're willing to go for it alhamdulillah they accepted willingly and wholeheartedly but to jump into the ocean without knowing how to swim you can't blame others for drowning you're the one who jumped so generally speaking yes getting married early is one of the best things you can do and set aside what people say about age limit so a boy cannot get married if he's under 21. who said so this is man-made law this is kaffir law Muslims know better and we have evidences in a society and an environment where you put fuel next to the fire and you pray to Allah it does not ignite can't be when you put men and women together at schools in workplaces in entertainment and in sports facilities not abiding by the hijab or by the Islamic rulings of segregation and then you say let's hope they don't get involved in relationships or wedlock or even get pregnant what do you see in the west go to any country on in Europe show me one single country that is modest or they have no problem compared to Arab countries and Muslim countries where the ratio is way way negligible and can't be compared so Islam gives you the right system because it's from the one who created us and he knows us inside out he told us the best system that would maintain our decency and to preserve our modesty the people in the west and the East don't want this they want orgies they want freedom for all whether you're a boy or a girl transgender whatever you want to be you want to be a bird be my guest this is all what's their countries and societies revolve around and this is why Allah is inevitably going to make them face their worst fears because they went against his ruling so marrying early is good but you can't have one size that fits all we have to look at each and every case to be able to judge this and Allah Knows Best"
