  "transcript": "[Music] I am three months pregnant not me of course questioner I am three months pregnant how do I go about Ramadan fasts prayers Tara we as for your prayer and Tara we these are not affected because you pray like you usually do being pregnant has no impact on your prayer yes maybe if you are you are in the eighth month of pregnancy it might be difficult to bow and prostrate in this case or sometimes even to stand up in this case you're exempted you can pray sitting down even when you're three months pregnant you have the permission to sit down in voluntary prayers I have the permission to sit down even if I don't have any reason to sit down as long as it's voluntary prayers all of us can pray sitting down this is new mostly it's not the hadith of the Prophet say that is salat wa salam the prayer of a person sitting down is half of the reward of a person standing up and this is only further voluntary prayers as for followed it is a must it's a pillar if you can stand you much scent if you're unable hand Allah you have the permission as per the hadith of Imran Imran Hosein may Allah be pleased with him he said that the prophets Allah Salim said pray standing up if you're unable pray sitting down if you're unable pray lying on your side this is for fault as for voluntary prayers you can pray whatever voluntary prayers sitting down without any problem as for fasting if a pregnant woman or a woman who's suckling was breastfeeding her child if they fear for their own safety or for the safety of their children so a pregnant woman who is three months pregnant four months pregnant five months pregnant she fears that if she fasts that she may faint because she is eating on behalf of two or she fears that the child would find difficulty sustaining a healthy life in her womb because she's not eating for 16 hours 15 hours and the doctors recommend that she doesn't fast a woman who's suckling usually is always thirsty and hungry because she's feeding someone else if this is the case alhamdulillah Allah has given them the permission to skip fasting should they feed anything no should they pay an expiation no should they make up for these missed days indefinitely so when would they make up for these missed days whenever the obstacle is uplifted share my wife is pregnant she missed drama by the following Ramadan she was stuck lling the third Ramadan she got pregnant again the fourth Ramadan she was suckling our child in this continued for 1517 years no problem what should should be what should she do nothing after 20 years she should calculate how many Ramadan she missed and she makes them up oh sure she has to make 400 days no problem she doesn't have to feed anything and she can easily make them up so if she fasts every Monday and Thursday and the three white days of every month these are approximately 80 plus days a year which means that if she has 40 day 400 days this requires maybe six years and hollis she's done so it's not that difficult but it's not probable that a lot of women would have like 20 years of skipped Ramadan masha'Allah productivity is good but not all women have pregnancy delivered then they suckle their children and the cycle goes on for 20 years but hypothetically speaking if this is the case then at hamdulillah Allah has made it easy for them to make it up as they wish [Music] [Applause]"
