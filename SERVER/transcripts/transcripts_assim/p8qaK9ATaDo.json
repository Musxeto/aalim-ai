  "transcript": "Zaid from the Emirates Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikum Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh my masjid is 10 minutes away so is it fair for me to go pray in the mosque? The answer is yes, a 10 minutes walk is about less or more than 1 kilometer and in normal conditions if a man stood on the top of the masjid and called the adhan as loud as he can this distance of 1 kilometer would carry his voice to you and the Prophet said to the blind man alayhis salatu wassalam and this is the measuring stick when he came to ask for permission not to attend the congregational prayer the Prophet said alayhis salatu wassalam do you hear the adhan? The man said yes, the Prophet said ajib respond and answer it because there is no permission for you and Allah knows best"
