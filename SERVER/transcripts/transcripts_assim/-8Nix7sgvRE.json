  "title": "Is she sinful for not making up missed fasts? Can she fast in winter, any expiation? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign I was wondering I'm sorry I have like around um above 200 fasts to make come so I heard from like if you didn't make it up until Ramadan you're sinful for that but at the same time um to make it easier for myself can I make them up in the winter and do that like over a period of years until I've made up all my fasts or does it have to be made up just before Ramadan okay so basically speaking someone who has 200 days of missed fasts this means that minimum of seven to ten years they've skipped Ramadan either due to pregnancy or uh breastfeeding or monthly cycle if it is or it was back to back they don't have any sin on them so now the kids are settled she's not breastfeeding and she has to make up for the these days 200 days are a lot and it's almost impossible to do it in one single year over one shot and nobody says that you have to do this so you try to make them up to the best of your ability and if you manage too fast Mondays and Thursdays of every week and the three white days of every lunar year over the 11 months other than Ramadan you would be able to do 90 days approximately give or take few days which is great if you were to do it over a period of year or two or even three years are you sinful no you're not sinful alhamdulillah Allah made it easy for the likes of you to make it up without pressure do I have to pay and feed a poor person per every day for every day I've missed it's an issue of dispute some Scholars say that you have to others say that it was not mentioned in the Quran nor in the authentic Sunnah but it's only from some of the companions who used to recommend it therefore I'm inclined to the second or to the latter opinion which is that you don't have to feed a poor person for every day you miss all what you have to do is make it up and Allah Knows Best"
