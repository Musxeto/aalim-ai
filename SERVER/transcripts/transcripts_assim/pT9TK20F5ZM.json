  "transcript": "if we intend to do a good deed um for the reward before we actually do it and then forget the specific intention well actually doing the good deed will we still be rewarded for it depends give example um for example if i make food for breaking the fast and i specifically intend to gain the reward of the people who eat the fast to eat the food who are fasting but then while i'm making the food i forget would i still be rewarded the answer is yes you do not have to anticipate the intention with you from the beginning till the end if your intention in preparing for the food for those fasting people to break their fast on so that you may gain the reward of their fasting as the hadith of the prophet allah indicated but as soon as you started working on the food you forgot this happens to everybody they cannot be focused 100 percent on their intention throughout the work but their initial intention is there there is nothing wrong than that and your reward is fully restored in sha allah"
