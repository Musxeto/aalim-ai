  "title": "Should we obey our parents even if we are in doubt as the story of Juraij? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "foreign it says that we have to leave that which we are doubting in to that which we have no doubt about um and also in the photos of the Muslim media for when one is striking by by his faith his uh he or she should say when then deceased from doing what he or she is in doubt about now I got from somewhere that if our parents instruct us to do something when we should then we should do it even if we are in doubt about this according to the Hadith of the man who says praying who was praying and his mother called him and he was in doubt whether to respond or not now when he continued with the prayers and didn't respond to his mother his mother's cast quote him so according to according to that the Sheikh I had said that we should we should do that which our parents instruct us to do even if we are in doubt about so I just want to have more clarity and is it right now this is not entirely right simply because the Hadith leave what's doubtful to what's not doubtful is when you are in doubt but when you are certain that what your parents are asking you to do is Haram it is totally prohibited for you to obey them now the amount of of doubt is measurable so if you have 90 doubt that this is not permissible you have to not obey them until you make sure and certain that this is permissible but if it is doubtful by 10 percent and ninety percent you have clarity about that yeah this is okay in this case you have to act upon what they're saying to you because you don't have evidence to back your doubts it's just mere doubt so it can be your whims and desires as for the Hadith of your age the priest when he was praying and his mom called him he was praying voluntary prayers so his doubt whether to answer or continue his prayer should not have been there because he should have the knowledge to know that yes I must interrupt and break my prayer and to answer my mom answering my mom is mandatory continuing my voluntary prayer is voluntary so I should do what is a priority and that is answering my mother and I hope this answers your question"
