  "transcript": "lovely you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters about it on the Sony gay here is cream and after no maroney's well say no to me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome to another episode of contemporary Islamic issues on her the TV I'm your host our machine in this episode we will continue our conversation on Islamic eschatology now just to give you a recap of what we've covered so far in this subject we started off with the belief in a last day and the Muslim view or the Islamic perspective on this matter and then we went into some of the minor signs of the day of judgment speaking of what have which of them have already taken place which of them will take place and the Sheikh gave wonderful examples connecting it with contemporary issues are things that are taking place in our world nowadays and then after that we started with the major science and last episode we've covered the Maddie who is he when is he coming and what is his purpose and then we started a little bit about the gel and that's where we will continue inshallah today so let's start off by welcoming our wonderful share share Cozumel Hakeem I said I'm Rodrigo and welcome to the show why do you consider more like a tomb okay so sure in the last episode you gave us you know what's gonna happen when the Maddie's there the war that's going to take place and then we touched a little bit about the judge so let's start off by why is he dangerous because if I remember correctly you've mentioned that every single prophet that that's come down has warned his people against this person so why is he so dangerous not him handle a house or someone else would Allah he was early he was right be humiliated every who death I'm a bad every Muslim when they are about to conclude their prayers they sake they seek refuge in Allah result from for things along Manero they become inaudible Jahannam I mean I have a witness in my ear while my mad woman fitna in mercy hidden Jen you seek refuge in Allah from four things the fourth of them is the trial and calamity the tribulation of the Antichrist and Messi the impostor Christ which tells you that this is not your average impostor allah azza wajal sends him as a test as a trial like Allah so Allah sends to us illnesses poverty Wars air earthquakes volcanoes because this is part of Allah's wisdom not that Allah so gel the evils are attributed to him no subhana WA Ta'ala has exalted from this but he cannot appreciate daytime without having light night you cannot appreciate your health without falling sick so Allah sends such trials and tribulations to test the belief of the believers and he sent a Dajjal to us so that we are to be tested and he also equipped him with things that are extraordinary things that are supernatural and we would won't call them as miracles because miracles can only happen to the prophets and the messengers of Allah the other supernatural things can either be Kurama which is appointed and giving to the followers of prophets and messengers or it can be how are a little harder which can be given to the followers of devils and disbelievers we know it's not Kurama van definitely it's not Kalama because he is an enemy of allah so yeah go ahead I was gonna ask you so what is he gonna do what are these these are things that are hard color hard that that kid's gonna come with he has a number of things that Allah so L give to him that are not natural you know that at the beginning he comes and proclaims to be a Messenger of Allah no prophet and then he gives himself a race and he says I am your God so in order to justify his claim allah azza wajal gives him a lot of powers that are not given to anyone else for example he travels the whole earth and imagine going around the world visiting all the villages and towns and in countries this would take ages the Prophet told us out of some that he will remain on earth only for 40 days that's it yeah that's it one day is equivalent to a whole year meaning that the Sun would not rise and set as it huge that usually does in a day but it would take 365 days to do that another day is a month a third day is a week and the rest of the 37 days are normal days so Allah so Allah gave him these powers the prophet Aristotle sallam told us that there would not be any town or city except that the Dajjal would enter them except Makkah and Madinah these are the two cities that his unable would not be permitted to enter at them because it they are guarded with angels with swords waiting for him to come and kill him so he doesn't enter them and other narrations say that even the masjid of a tour and the messier devil Aqsa would not be entered by him again as well among the powers that Allah gives him our powers over matter so he has the ability to change things he has the ability to order the heavens and it rains he orders the crops to grow and it does and the Prophet told us as some that before the coming of this Dajjal the people would suffer for three years without any drop of rain without any crops being grown and they would starve severely so when he comes and he comes not empty-handed he comes as the Prophet says with heaven and hell so he has what seems to be hell and fire and he has what seems to be paradise and with him comes a river of good things and a mountain of bread so people who were starving people who were thirsty when he comes with all these things they are deceived by him and they say that you are our Lord you are our God among the things that Allah gives him control of over the devils they accompany him to the extent that people who do not believe them believe him or believe in him he says listen you don't believe that I am your God I will give life back to your dead father and mother and they will speak to you and these devils who are the Kareem would come to that individual and say my son follow him he is your Lord and the guys listening and watching his father and mother who died like 20 30 years ago talking to him you can see the emotional impact he is manipulating and playing with that he orders the treasures imagine going in a place and all of us are those following you believing in you said ok you want gold you want silver you want treasures come out in all of a sudden it comes out from Earth and becomes on the surface or it follows him and walks behind him and the people see this something that is supernatural this is not normal and they said no one can do this except allah azza wajal he kills people and he gives them life back again of a way of camouflaging things so one of them the people of Medina come comes out they said I know that you're an impostor so he kills him and he splits his body into two and he throws both these two halves far away and he walks and comes back while laughing and then he orders the body to patch up and the man is alive again and he's laughing his head off he's happy because now you believe that I'm your Lord I'm your God and the boy says by Allah I'm not more convinced that you're the impostor more than ever now he goes and tries to kill him but he's the last one he ever kills because Allah does not give him the power to kill him again so the people now have some Eman and they have this idea of yani okay maybe he's not God after all so before I ask you what should the Muslims do when the job comes let's lightly speak about some of these descriptions maybe some facial descriptions there any sort of description that the prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam has left us through their hadith ok the Prophet said at a his salat was telling me he described him to us that he is one-eyed so he has one eye that is right eye but he's blinded it's normal he cannot see with it and it has like an extra edge to it like a nail and he's blind in it he's one-eyed the other eye which is the left eye is not normal so it is sort of rubbed off and it's concaved into the inside to the extent that this is the right eye that the left eye is coming out big like a big bowl of of glass so he looks pretty weird and the Prophet told us that he's redheaded and that is short but he's so big and huge and hairy that he is scary a thing to look at the Prophet told us that he is barren he doesn't have children and we don't know about more details whether he will get married or not this is something we don't know but this is what the Prophet told us about and one of the biggest signs that you can recognize him with he's a sign that is written on his forehead and it's written ha ha ha or kaffir so every believer the minute he looks him in the face he will recognize that he is a kafir and that he's the Antichrist or that the job that the Prophet told us about Salah Hawaa hawaai he was 11 now now I want to get into what should Muslims do when he comes and also how will he die is he going to die and how is that going to take place but before we do that we're gonna go for a short break so stay tuned welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on her the TV now before we went for that short break we were speaking about some of the major signs of the Day of Judgment chef's you give us a description of the jail and you've also told us that you know he's gonna come with different sorts of actions and performances that he will be able to do that are weird and understand and not understandable and none it's not normal for a person that is a non-believer or a person that is an enemy of God to be able to perform these but you said allah subhanaw taala will give him the power is to do such actions now I want to get into what should Muslims do when when they meet the jailer when he comes but before we do that what is he going to come from is there any specific hadith mentioned about where the job will come from where is it unknown to us the prophet alayhi salaatu wa sallam told us that one of his companions who reverted to Islam his name is Tamim a daddy and he came and he told the Prophet that is a Saddam a tale of the Dajjal that is similar to what the Prophet usually tells his companion so that the Prophet was happy and he told the companions and he narrated to the Companions what Tamim told him so usually the companions in red hadith to the prophets now this time the Prophet narrated the hadith of the companion and he said to us that he found in a long hadith the dejar in an island where he was chained all over from neck down and he asked them few questions where they were from and whether the Prophet was sent or not as whether there is water in a lake of table area whether this and that and he told them that I'm about to come out so we know that he is an island where this island is Allah knows and we know as well that the Prophet told us that he would come a day so salam out to existence meaning that he would become known to people when he comes from the northeast of Iran so he would come from Iran followed by the Jews 70,000 of them wearing their hoodies and any Muslim would recognize that in Isfahan there is a community of Jews who make these hoodies especially for the Jews and who are waiting and anticipating for the Dajjal to come to follow him those who would follow him are mainly the Prophet says as in the Jews the non Arabs specifically those who look like the moguls or the Tatars you know with with their eyes and and and their noses and it's like flat faces the Prophet told us about and women would follow him to the extent that even the people in Medina where the Dajjal is unable to penetrate and enter the women of the Muslims there would fight to come out and follow him to the extent that their guardian the husband the father the brother would tie them in chains so that they would not escape to the teacher and what should people do then when he comes what should they do is there anything specific the Prophet had instructed us to do as a precaution we seek refuge in a logical from his fitna but if he were to come in our lifetime may Allah Dajjal make does not make that happen the Prophet told us as salam whatever you hear of the Dajjal stay as far as possible from him so when you see a road accident you see like hundreds of people just want to see what's happening take some clicks and this is uncivilized and this hampers the work of the emergency forces the ambulances etc likewise if you heard of the Dajjal lots of the people would say me take a look maybe take a selfie with him now the Prophet tells us stay as far as away from him want to see why prophet of Allah I'm strong any man I know myself the Prophet said I said I'm one of you may go out to meet him thinking that he's a believing person but once he meets him he goes back on his heels and becomes a kafir but if you were forced to meet him if he came to you what to do the Prophet told us are a saucer am recite the beginning of surat al-kahf and in the authentic hadith the Prophet told us assume that as part of prevention you have to recite the first and eyes of sortal calf or the lasted eyes of shorter calf because shorter calf has a lot to do with the tribulation and trials of the Dajjal though his name is not mentioned but the remedy of such trials and temptations are found in surah laughs okay and how will the is the job gonna die actually and if so how is he gonna die is is somebody gonna kill him is he just going to pass away out of illness what's the he cannot just vanish he has to be killed and the one person who would be able to kill him he's 87 new Maryam Jesus the Son of Mary peace be upon him who as we Muslims believe is alive in heavens he did not die he was not buried he was not crucified Allah ascended him Allah took him into heaven and he's still there waiting until Allah permits him to descend and to kill him he comes in Palestine he sees the dejar and the minute he looks at the journey he starts to melt like salt so he flees and runs and if he were to be left he would dissolve and disappear but harissa says no if he disappears people would still be convinced that he's God so he goes and he kills him with a spear and people see his blood on that spear and they recognize that he is the impostor okay so um without getting into any further detail of the gel because we want to move on to the other signs you know that was somewhat it was a really good overall view of who the gel is what is he going to do and why did the prophetess Anna warn us about him and also like he said many of the prophets before him all the prophets before him have warned their people about the gel as well moving on to ISA ELISA nonsense is very convenient we just spoke about a stylus and I'm killing the gel if you can give us some information about ISA let me ask you a very specific question which is very common question if the prophets all along why the asylum has told us that he's the last prophet and how's ISA gonna come again isn't that a contradiction no it is not a contradiction because we know that ISA came before the Prophet that is a cinnamon now when the Prophet tells us that I am the seal of the prophets hood and there's no messenger after me this is valid the dissension and the coming of ISA would not be with a new religion or with a new law new Sharia he would rule with the same Sharia of the Prophet aerosol Salaam and the biggest example is that when he descends in his fuzzier time it is dawn time and the Muslims are preparing their rose for prayer and the Obama is given and all of a sudden and imagine this beautiful scenery when the harm is being given and ISA is descending between two angels until he reaches the ground with water coming from his hair like pieces of pearls so the minute the Maddie sees razor he retreats giving him room and telling him we're asking him to lead the prayer because he's a one of the greatest messages of Allah Issa peace be upon him says no you are their leader and kama was given to you so you lead the prayer and he prays behind him which indicates clearly that ASA is coming to rule with the Sharia of the Prophet Isis Salam and that's why the Prophet tells us when he said descends he will rule and be fair with his ruling he will break the cross he will kill the pork the pigs and he will abolish the jizya the taxation taken from non-muslims because there will not be any acceptance either Islam or death so how long will his era be and what will it be like doing during his time the Prophet told us has some that he would remain on earth for forty years that's the judge 40 years 40 days 40 days that the jatt is 40 days Aisha would remain for 40 years and his reign would be characterized as fairness lots of favours and blessing of allah azza wajal wealth is in everyone's hands to the extent that they don't know what to do there there are no poor people at all blessings of Allah Azza WA JAL would be so great to the extent that one milking of a cow or over or a sheep would suffice a whole tribe of one sheep or one cow and that a bunch of grapes would feed an entire tribe and lots and lots of favours and blessings of Allah would be to all okay we're at the end of another episode and Sharla we're going to continue this conversation about the major signs of the Day of Judgment so just to give everybody cap of what we've covered we've done the minor signs of the Day of Judgment but we've done some of the major signs such as the gel Maddie Aneesa Islam inshallah next time when we come back for another episode on Islamic eschatology we will continue with some of the major signs that the Sheikh has mentioned in the previous episodes such as the Beast the origin ma'juj the wind coming from Yemen the Sun rising from the West and so on and so forth and until next time Allah subhana Allah bless us all assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh Muhammad's anomaly you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters about it on the Sony gay here is cream enough to know more honest well senior to me return to the guidance of Allah I will set you free"
