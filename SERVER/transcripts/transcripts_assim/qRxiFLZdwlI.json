  "title": "Job: selling products that may be used against Muslims in the Gaza Massacre permissible?",
  "transcript": "We have Sufyan from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam How are you Sheikh? I'm fine Alhamdulillah. Just a quick question. I've seen your different videos saying that it is permissible to work in a company that has haram and halal projects as long as one only focuses on the halal projects etc. But my question is a bit more specific because basically in engineering, in many engineering companies, more specifically to what I study is everything to do with electronics and developing new technologies. These companies develop technologies for all different kind of sectors. So they develop technologies for electric cars, renewable energies etc. etc. But generally in these companies, very generally, they also have a sector that is dedicated to developing technologies for the military. So developing like electronics that would go, new technologies that would go into military airplanes etc. And so as this is a careful country, it is possible, especially in our context right now, that they would then sell these technologies to Israel to kill Muslims etc. May Allah preserve them from that. It is true, but it's also possible that 15 Muslim countries would buy the same technology for their armies and for their defense. So it's like selling a knife. You can cut throats with it and you can cut meat and bread with it. So this is too far fetched. That okay Shaykh, I work in a water desalination company and this company sells water and it may sell it to companies that produce wine. So this means that I cannot work in desalination companies or plants? Of course not. Likewise with electronics, this is too generic. At the end of the day, you will not be able to work anywhere. So as long as your project is generally speaking in halal, it might be used in haram. Very small percentage. There's no problem in doing that. It's like programming. I make a program for managing your finances. Maybe a brothel or a pub would buy this program to organize their material. I'm not designing it for them. I'm designing it for the public. Who uses it is open for all. There's no problem in that and Allah knows best. Al Fatiha."
