  "transcript": "Abu Rian from Senegal Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Barakallahu Feekuh My question is I have I would like to know if it's halal for me to work as an interpreter for a lawyer who has a client that she's working for and trying to get back some money from them from some people. Is it halal for me to like just be there and pretty much translate? If what you're translating is halal and the case itself is halal, there's no problem. A person stole money, cheated money, broke a partnership unlawfully and took money and the partner or that other victim goes to your law firm and files a suit against them demanding their own money. So this is a legitimate cause. Whatever you translate is within halal because the whole case is halal. But if the case involves haram items, selling of tobacco or intoxicants, wine, dealing in riba, asking for compensation far greater than what was taken from them, then in this case no you should not work in such a translation project and Allah knows best."
