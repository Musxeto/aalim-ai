  "transcript": "ra says what is best for someone who wants to re to get reward is it best for me to volunteer in the Masjid to organize the rose to ensure that there is social distancing to make sure that they Park uh in the right place and that they leave the Masjid in um order that no one comes into the Masjid with a shotgun or with a machine gun to kill the worshippers like it's becoming the norm now and islamophobes say this is okay no problem and is prohibited but killing people in the mides it's okay it's fine so is this best or is it better to sit down and listen like the rest of the people to what the Imam has to say well this is a difficult question because there is a communial obligation that one has to do in order to save the rest of the thousands of worshippers from getting in a sin so if this task is mandatory and there's no one who can fulfill it and do it better than you it becomes mandatory upon you and more rewarding than sitting and listening to the but if it's something that's trivial is not a big deal uh arranging the parking lot and and ensuring that people are parked in this in the right position and wasting my own benefit from learning from the Imam and hearing the no I save myself first and I don't care about others I would like to benefit myself because this is a communal obligation there are people who are not interested in the don't understand what the Imam is saying let them be and let them take that role and Allah knows best Rashad"
