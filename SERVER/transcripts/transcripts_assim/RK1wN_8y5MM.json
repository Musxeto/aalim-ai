  "transcript": "Now my question is we know that the word prophet is not the name of the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam. So is it obligatory to send the salutation when we hear the word hear or say the word prophet or is it sinful if we do not do it? Who does it refer to? The prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam. So even if you hear a pronoun, if you hear people say and when he entered Medina after migrating from Mecca, you say Allah Muhammad just by hearing when he so we offer the the salutation upon the prophetam because it raises our levels in Jenna and grants us his intercession on the day of judgment and Allah would love us accordingly. And allahel knows best."
