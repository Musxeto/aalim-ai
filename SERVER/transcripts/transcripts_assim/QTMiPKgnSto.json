  "transcript": "from lebanon uh my question is uh since everything is available now on the internet will be held accountable for not learning about our dean okay i think who wrote this neri man from lebanon she says now everything is open do we get uh um punished for not learning the deen or in other words words are we accountable for not learning about islam nariman islam is a very vast number of sciences so are you telling me because we have everything on the internet available we have electronic libraries that i have to know everything from a to z about islamic sciences so if i tell you that you have to tell me the rules and conditions and regulations governing for example transactions how to sell or i tell you you have to know the nisab the threshold of a herd of camels that you have now this is a little bit confusing and the answer is no there is a mandatory fault branch of knowledge and there is complementary that it's okay if you don't learn so what's mandatory what is a must is what you need to be a muslim so if i tell you at the moment do you know the pillars of hajj he said no i don't oh you're not a muslim no that's not true once you want to go to hajj you have to learn this but at the moment i'm not going for hajj so i'm not obliged to to learn it although i can do but i'm not obliged to do it but for example to hate and what nullifies it this is a must salat and how to perform it this is a must things that are related to your islam it is mandatory this is mandatory for you to learn but other types of knowledge like learning arabic it's not mandatory you can learn it but it's not mandatory also small details of phil in terms of al-jannah is i don't have anyone deceased to go and pray janaza for in things related to al-musara farming and how to sell it and how to calculate the zakat of it etc all of these things are not mandatory for you to learn and i hope this answers your question"
