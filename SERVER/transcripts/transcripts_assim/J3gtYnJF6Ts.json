  "transcript": "the answer is because the prophet s prayed it in this fashion when he prayed it in this fashion he did not justified this so it would be premature it would be unwise to anyone to come and say well because fer is at the beginning of the day m is at the end of the day and Isa is just at the uh beginning of the night and and is silent because people just came out from their work and they're uh um so annoyed by The Noise by the typ writers by The Printers by the Internet by the mobiles and that is why it's suitable for them to pray it uh silently this is not true this is something you making it up the prophet did not justify it to us he prayed these three prayers lovely and the two prayers silently so you cannot simply just bring things out of your mind and say that these are the justifications and Allah knows them"
