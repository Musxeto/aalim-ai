  "transcript": "Yusuf from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh so thank you for sharing your opinion before about like if you had if you think you have urinary incontinence or the swells you basically get if you're urinating and when you come out you think you're still urinating so I applied the ruling of like of doing of ignoring it for five days and springing water on on the underwear and now to now I don't feel anything yeah but the thing is for the uh for the days where I wasn't doing it for the days where I was uh doing it I felt some urine coming so uh but I still prayed but now that like I think like four days has passed nothing is I don't feel anything now so should I repeat these prayers considering that before that I would uh I would look and I would see some sort of liquid coming and but then I would assume that no it's fine I would yeah I would uh not look at it after like when I do my wudu and istinja you know Yusuf Yusuf Yusuf ignore it what is in the past is in the past what goes in Vegas stays in Vegas forget about it alhamdulillah and all praise due to Allah and show your gratitude to Allah that this has stopped and this is a good example and a big shout out to those who have urinary incontinence this is a practical example and thousands of people have benefited from this the more you do what I tell you to do with the grace of Allah depending only on Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala four or five days it's gonna stop whatever you had the feelings that oh maybe something is coming out this is shaitan he wants you to go back to square one you break the chain and look and investigate you'll go back to square one you ignore him and continue to do what you were told to do in five days you'll be as clean as a whistle and these whispers will not come to you except after a couple of years because don't you ever think that shaitan will leave you alone all what's happening is shaitan is talking to his thugs telling them to back off until you let your guard down and feel comfortable and then they'll attack again this is found in his job description this is what shaitan does until your soul leaves your body on the day of your death so praise Allah and ignore what happened in the past"
