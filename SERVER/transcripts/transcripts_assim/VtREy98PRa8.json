  "transcript": "to him says I just wanted to ask what is the concept of six calamus in Islam and if there are no calamus what are those do as then for because people in Pakistan or India believe that a Muslim should know all columnas otherwise they are not proper Muslims please enlighten me in this regard so we can guide others - first of all we learn our religion from the Quran through following the sunnah of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam who came and explained to us the quran elaborated upon it and clarified what we cannot understand due to its generalization now if you look in the Quran or in the Sunnah you will not find any trace for limiting six kolima what is Kalima calaman in arabic means word and not only limited to word it can be a phrase and it can be a sentence so in Arabic the word Colima can also refer to the two Shahada the testimonies that one embraces Islam by uttering and believing in them though they are composed of a number of words but any statement any sentence any phrase can also be referred to as Kalima and a particular single word in Arabic is also Colima so there isn't anything in the Quran or agenda that refers to the six calamus meaning not five and not seven there are tens of authentic calamus but nowhere in the Quran or soon we where we will find that the prophetess Sam or his companions told us memorize these and you would not be a proper Muslim if you do not memorize them or know the meaning the Muslims in the subcontinent teach their children from an early age that the importance of these six kanima's part of these calamus are part of the thicker so it is a fragment of a different varieties of Vicar of words and statements of remembering allah azza wajal these six calamus according to the most famous and widely spread I'll kill him a PE be' a Shahada @ mg @ Oh he'd Alastair of our and Rodolfo for now if you go to these six calamus and you analyze them some of them are in the Sun for example Allah Allah Allah Muhammad Rasulullah this is the Shahada this is the first one this is known at as al kalamata but when you go to number two it says the testimony what it says I bear witness that there is no God worthy of being worshipped except Allah okay it's the same thing as the first one and that muhammad is his messenger messenger and servants Allah they are seldom the third one is glorification at Tim's eat when you say subhanAllah alhamdulillah Allah Allahu Akbar la ilaha illa Allah all of this is well known established Vicar the best words ever to be said the third the fourth one is to heat and it is the statement ila and allaha la sharika lah will call hungry Meatwad will be the hydro our Coalition Kadir this is the same as the first and the second the fourth the fifth one is still far and this is the far is something that is not found in the Sunna something that somebody made it up and we know from the Sunnah the authentic sooner that the best seeking way of seeking forgiveness is saying Allah still far the master of still far and it's not here so again who should we follow sooner or these compiled words that someone had did did that and what they'll cover also it is totally not part of the Sunnah it's something that someone fabricated therefore I say these words are good but they're not from the Sunnah why teach people something where we can find something that is better and why limit it to six why not five why not three why not one why not ten so I believe that maintaining and focusing and putting emphasis on such six words would amount to an innovation and Allah knows best"
