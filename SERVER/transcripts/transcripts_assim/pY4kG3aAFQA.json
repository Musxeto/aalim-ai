  "title": "Hadith about house fly when it falls into your vessel, dip it and toss it away - Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "mehran says please make a video on the housefly because a lot of people are asking the that everything has been proven by science but this saying of the Prophet that is salatu was-salam that he said when a fly falls in your vessel then dip it complete because one side contains extra Shan Shan so he did not write the full question but the hadith is well known the hadith is in sahih bukhari and the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam whenever a fly falls into your utensils your cup your vessel then dip it immediately and toss it away the Prophet says release awesome for the fly has illness epidemics diseases under one wing and under the other wing it has the remedy and the cure for that now this hadith was widely accepted by the Muslims because this is something from the unseen and we believe in the Quran we believe in the Sooner if we look at the miracles in the Quran and Sunnah we will find that like 95% of them are proven through science today I assume the 5% that science did not prove to be true as well because we have a track record if only 5% or 10% of the miracles scientific miracles of the Quran and the Sunnah were proven and ninety were dubious you and I may have a reason to doubt but it is the other way around the vast majority 8090 percent are all proven without any doubt by the disbelievers themselves so any logical person would come to the remaining 10 15 even 20 percent that was not proven be wrong but not proven to be correct either they will accept it because they said that the track record proves that it is right so there were people who came to this hadith and said if a fly falls into my glass I'm gonna toss the whole thing out why would I dip the fly again and drink whatever is in the container it's this is not the point now we have the luxury to have green tea we have water people in drought struck areas with our famine this is not a luxury this is a necessity so if a fly's footfall falls into it if a fly falls into it it is not an option to throw it they're gonna drink it but the etiquette of doing so is to dip the fly what kind of fly are we talking about house fly and he's saying that this is not proven scientifically and I beg to differ for the past 20 years there were so many researchers in America and also in Egypt for example in in Cairo University and elsewhere by professors proving this through the lab tests and clinical experiments without any doubt it is a well-known fact those scholars who did the dependent most on their logic their dependence on the logic when the research came from American universities with the seal on it they said oh okay if this is the case the hadith is authentic when the Buhari thirteen hundred years ago authenticated it these people who use their logic to accept and reject Quran the Sunnah said I will not accept this subhanAllah Muslims are not played like this they do not allow Satan to mess with their conviction they believe in the Quran they in the sunna what they cannot understand they believe in it and they say that it is in Allah's hands someday we will understand it but this hadith of the fly is a proven fact scientific fact and you can take that that to the bank now if the fly falls into my glass will I do this or not any proper Muslim has a choice if I have other water or tea or drink that I can use I may not do that me personally I would do this just to conquer any doubts or whispers of Shaitaan just to prove that I believe in everything that the Prophet had said that his salat was set up I would dip it and throw the fly and drink it believing in what the Prophet had said sallallahu alayhi wasallam"
