  "transcript": "so I can check my question for today is so for brother young brothers that are trying to get married especially in the U.S so of course the best way to do it is to get married by the shitty Yahweh but in America there is nothing to to enforce that like they would in U.S law but if you do it in the U.S uh according to U.S law it's not shutting out compliant but there's somebody said forces and the police the government do you suggest a young brother and America to do it in the U.S way if if to if we do it that way should we sign a prenup so let's say if something happened and a divorce happens you know it's going to favor the woman she might take custody of the kids uh also she she takes half your money so do you suggest we do a print up or we do with the Chevy but there's nothing enforcing it we just have to rely on the good of people and their piety to keep on going I've you know that I do a lot of counseling sessions especially from U.S and from Canada and and I see a lot of ugly divorce cases and Maya and and most likely if you approach an Islamic Center for an Islamic Islamic marriage they would refuse fearing that they would uh have some problems with the government and with the law for conducting a marriage without having the Civil marriage papers conducted and I would highly recommend that you do both of course Sharia our marriage is inevitable you can't be married without it but even the Civil marriage is good to protect the rights of people because so many times a man marries a woman shariaweh not in a civil marriage and then he runs and she's trying to get out of the marriage and all the Islamic Center say sorry you can't prove that you're married we don't have any papers we don't have any authentication we don't have anything to prove that and the guy fled to his country and the woman is banging all doors possible to try to get a divorce or a whole or whatever anything so yes get married according to the U.S law and to the Sharia law and definitely 110 percent get a prenup because without this document she'll sue your whatever for half of your property and the custody of the the kids and a lot of hardship comes because of this kafir man-made law so once you've got it documented before the marriage that this is what's going to happen you're not entitled for any of my savings or my business or for the property that I own and you guys managed to successfully separate your finances she has her own bank account you have your own bank account no joint account baloney this is inshallah a win-win situation uh"
