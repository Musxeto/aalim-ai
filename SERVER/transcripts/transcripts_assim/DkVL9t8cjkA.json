  "transcript": "foreign we come to the conclusion of the salat the prophet of offered the salam to his right and to his left and the prayer is over what is the first thing the prophet used to say ah if you go to some countries you will find that the people say allahu akbar and this is wrong the sunnah as thawban the servant of the prophet said in the hadith whenever the prophet al-islam concluded the salat he used to say that estella for allah i seek allah for forgiveness three times o allah you are the salam and from you is all peace blessed are you o possessor of majesty and honor so this is what a muslim should say not allahu akbar allahu akbar is taken from another hadith which even abbas narrated me allah be pleased with him that we used to know that conclusion of the prayer in the masjid by the takbir of the sahaba but this is not the first thing they said the takpir meaning that people would hear them say subhanallah alhamdulillah and these are all combined under the title of takbir but felban said that the prophet's first words that the prophet used to say none has the right to be worshipped except allah alone without any partner to him belongs all sovereignty and praise and he is over all things omnipotent o allah none can prevent what you have willed to bestow and none can bestow what you have willed to prevent and no wealth or majesty can benefit anyone as from you is all wealth and majesty so this is also a confirmed dua to say after concluding the salat and also the following dua or let's just say re-correct and rephrase that the following vikr the prophet used to say none has the right to be worshipped except allah alone without any partner to him belong all sovereignty and praise and he is over all things omnipotent there is no might nor power except with allah none has the right to be worshipped except allah and we worship none except him for him is all favor grace and glorious praise none has the right to be worshipped except allah and we are sincere in faith and devotion to him although the disbelievers detest it see how many times no one has the right to be worshipped other than allah this is to cement to hate so that people who say such things always believe not by words but by the conviction that allah is their protector there are lies their guide that nothing can happen in this universe without allah's permission and will those who are rich they've been given by allah those who are poor they've been deprived by allah azzawajal and this is for a reason allah does not do this haphazardly it's with justification great wisdom and with allah's vast knowledge that he does all of this then after all of that the sunnah is to say the prescribed vikkar and we all know this dikkar subhanallah 33 times the total is 99 and then finish the 100 by saying la ilaha so you say glory be to allah all praise is for allah and allah is the greatest 33 times and then you conclude that by saying none has the right to be worshipped except allah alone without any partner to him belongs all sovereignty and praise and he is over all things omnipotent now when we say this we have to acknowledge that there are different variations or virgins if you wish so one virgin is this subhan allah al hamdulillah about three times by the way if you say subhanallah subhan allah subhanallah 33 times and then alhamdulillah 33 times and then allah for 33 times is also valid and you conclude with 34. third version is to say subhanallah 10 alhamdulillah 10 allahu akbar 10 and stop fourth virgin is to say subhan allah 25 alhamdulillah 25. 25 allahu akbar 25 and stop you are highly recommended to vary between all of these but again look what's doing it it's doing to you it's heart wash filling it up with the heat filling it up with iman putting you right on track acknowledging that allah azzawajal is guiding you taking care of you and you're worshiping him 24 hours seven days a week till the day you die this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave you foreign [Music] foreign"
