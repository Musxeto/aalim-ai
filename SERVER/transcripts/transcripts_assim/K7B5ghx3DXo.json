  "title": "Will Jesus Prophet Issa ﷺ come as a Prophet or a follower of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "what car says it is mentioned in the Quran about the arrival of prophet ISA I think his solos was salam but the question is will he come as a prophet or an almighty of Prophet Muhammad alayhi salatu was-salam well once you're a prophet you're a prophet for life so if he was a messenger and a prophet of Allah like 2,000 years ago when he comes after so many years when he descends from Heaven's and kills the Antichrist he would still be a prophet and a messenger of allah but he will not have a new message he will not have a revelation he will not have a new religion rather he would be a follower of the Prophet Allah so slams Sharia and he would rule the Muslims with the Sharia of Islam and not a new Sharia but no one can deprive him of being a prophet or a messenger of allah"
