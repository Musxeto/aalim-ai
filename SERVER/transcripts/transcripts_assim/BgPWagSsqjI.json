  "title": "Legitimate reasons for which one can break a prayer, is answering your parents one of them?",
  "transcript": "it is from aisha and she says what are the legitimate reasons for which one can break their salah is responding to the parents calling etc included in this usually allah azzawajal says do not spoil your good deeds and this is why the majority of scholars say that if you commence a prayer you should finish it to the end till the end because the prayer as defined by the prophet by the scholars that it and now its inauguration is takbir and its conclusion is taslim so this is the prayer it's a full unit it's a whole package deal that you have to do it from takbir till teslim now you usually pray either fart or voluntary in fart prayers you must not break it unless there is a real dire necessity so if i'm praying and some child is about to fall in a well yeah i may break my prayer to save that child if someone next to me has an angina or a heart attack and nobody rushes to help him he faints he needs attention yes i have to break my prayer if there's a fire that i have to save my life by breaking the prayer and leaving i have to do this now if it's a voluntary prayer even if i break it without any reason inshallah i'm not sinful because it's voluntary to begin with but the scholars said that it is best not to break it unless the advantages outweigh the disadvantages so for example if i'm praying ford this is fart and my parents call me i should continue in my prayers because this is a fart but if i'm praying voluntary prayer and my parents call me i have to weigh the pros and cons if i know that if i do not respond to them immediately and after i finish my prayer i explain to them yet still they will be mad at me i should break my prayer because it's voluntary but if i know that they are wise and they are knowledgeable and if i explain to them that i was in prayer they would forgive me then i should continue my prayer and allah azzawajal knows best"
