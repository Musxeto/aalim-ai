  "title": "The Prophet’s ‎ﷺ grief over death of his offspring assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sorrow. If we know that seven of his own offspring, Sallallahu Alayhi Wasallam, three of his sons and three of his daughters died in his lifetime. And the seventh daughter, Fatima, he gave her the glad tiding on his deathbed that she will catch up with him after six months. What kind of grief you could imagine be in this huge big heart of someone like the Prophet ﷺ with all these calamities, with all these problems around him and the challenges. If any one of us would have had one percent of what he had suffered, Wallahi we would have died years and years ago. But not the Prophet ﷺ who was content with Allah's decree and who only relied, trusted and depended upon Allah alone. We have a short break. Stay tuned and Inshallah we'll be right back."
