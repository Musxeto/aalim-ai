  "title": "Praying on a prayer mat that has a picture of Kabah, haram of Madinah, masjids - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so sheikh my question is what's the ruling on praying in a prayer mat where there is a picture of the kaaba is it not recommended check barack obama so the ruling of praying on a prayer mat that has the picture of kaaba or the medina haram or messages or minarets etc if it does not distract you the prayer is valid either way the most important thing is to avoid being distracted how is that possible when people pray and they look down and they start to count how many minutes and then shaytan comes and says yeah but i think haram in mecca has 19 minutes or maybe more maybe less and he's engaged in these thoughts no this is distracting you from your prayer and this is not recommended the prophet salallahu salaam once was given a cloak and from a companion by the name of abu jaham and when he prayed to raqqas he immediately afterwards took it off and asked them to return it to abuja and take something else that had no drawings on it no decorations on it and he said that it distracted me from concentration and from my prayer therefore one should try his level best not to be distracted in the prayer and allah knows best"
