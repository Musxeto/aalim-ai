  "transcript": "hosea says some banks award points on buying through credit cards which is interest-free later on owner of the card can buy some items buy these points are these points halal if not can we help some poor by buying an item through these points this is a bit complicated and I don't know if we have enough time but I'll just try my level best when it's raining dogs and cats here I'll try my level best to wrap it up as as quick as possible and try to make it understandable inshallah what is the relationship between the bank and myself am i depositing my money at the bank and this is called deposit in the sense that I give my neighbor my car and I say I'm leaving for a couple of weeks keep my car in the garage in your garage and when I come I'll collect it okay he says okay I give my neighbor a hundred thousand dollars and I say keep it please with you when I come I'll pick it up and he says okay after two weeks when I come my neighbor says my whole house was burnt to the ground and your money was in my house your car was in my house and it's ashes now does my neighbor have the right to come and say or do I have the right to say to my neighbor listen I it's not my business give me back my money or my car no there's no need for this Jonnie at all because the problem is that he is doing me a favor and when I say that he is doing me a favor I mean that it is not his mistake he didn't do anything wrong therefore I have no right to demand it from him but before I left if he said lend me a hundred thousand and I give him the hundred thousand as alone and when I come back he said my house was burnt to the ground and your hundred thousand was with it he has no right to not give it to me my right is to say it's not my problem that your house was burnt you borrowed a hundred thousand you're obliged to give it to me now let us compare Apple to Apple when I deposit money at the bank when I open an bank account is it a loan to the bank or is it for safekeeping the bank puts it in a box and nobody opens this box until I come and withdraw some of the money or add some to it definitely it's the first not the latter because if the bank was burnt to the ground if it was robbed if it lost in transactions they're obliged to return my money that I deposited in my bank account so it is alone they have all the right to utilized my money they can invest it they can lend it to others unlike when it's a deposit where they are not allowed to use it hence anything that comes to me from the bank is RIBA because it's a loan so if I'm a millionaire or someone with five or six digits in my bank account every year they give me gifts they give me a box of dates they give me a Mishler to where they give me cell phones SIM cards tickets points whatever they they want to give all of this is RIBA I'm not allowed to take it because this is interest coming over my money which is alone with them likewise when we have a post no not a post a prepaid debit card so if I have a MasterCard and I charge it or put in it ten thousand dollars and I use it and I use it and I use it these this $10,000 is alone with the bank and every time I want to withdraw something I use my card and the bank gives a third party the points I accumulate on debit cards or Nutella now we come to the postpaid which is known as the credit cards now the credit cards are problematic because the vast majority of them are based on Reba and we've talked about this before the 40 days grace period if you fail to pay on time they will start to charge you a certain percentage as their RIBA and this is totally Haram but the Fozzy are saying that the credit cards we're getting are interest-free so I'm not lending the bank anything on the contrary I am borrowing from the bank when I buy worth of five thousand or ten thousand dollars from a store the bank gets its percentage from the store but what I have to pay is exactly what I have purchased and there is no borrowing from it a lending the bank anything actually I am borrowing from the bank and it's interest-free so if this is the case whatever the bank awards you with miles or with points it seems to be a lot but if it is prepaid it is Haram if it is interest based credit cards it is Haram if it is totally interest-free then insha'Allah there is nothing wrong in that and I hope this yanny clarifies it"
