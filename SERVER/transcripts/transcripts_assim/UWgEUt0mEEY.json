  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh my question is when reciting the Quran some people they move their lower jaw or the lower lips for the mud or the ghunnah and someone told me that this is tara'id and this is a prohibited and so I wanted to know like is this macro or is it prohibited what's the ruling on this because many decide to do this that's why Jazak Allah Khair. First of all to say that this is prohibited it's audacious because prohibition is a legislative ruling that can come only from the Quran or from the sunnah or from the consensus of scholars how dare I say this is haram and this is halal this is not permissible I can't say oh wearing the watch in your left hand is haram why some people say because it's imitating the kuffar are you crazy the vast majority of Muslims wear it in the left what's the problem in that and that there's no problem in wearing your watch in your left or in your right but some people have the audacity to come and throw verdicts left right and center left right and center and this is totally wrong so to say that when reciting the Quran lowering your lower jaw and you can't definitely lower your upper jaw or even move your upper jaw because it doesn't move the only thing that moves is your lower jaw but I don't know what you are referring to Ammar and I don't know what is a tara'id and there's nothing wrong in reciting the Quran in whatever appropriate way that does not disrespect it and that there's nothing in the Quran or sunnah that says anything about this movement of the lower jaw that you've indicated and Allah knows best"
