  "title": "Taking His Desires as 'God' Kufr, Shirk, or a Sin? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ammar from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh I just wanted to ask about a verse from the Quran It says in Surah Jathia So the one who has taken his desires as God And Allah also says in Surah Nisa So Allah does not forgive shirk So the one who obeys his desires Allah states that it is like he has taken his desires as God So does this constitute actual shirk that Allah will not forgive if someone follows his own desires JazakAllah Khair Sheikh Ammar Bhai If someone shaves his beard Is he following his desires, yes or no? Yes Is he a mushrik? No By your analogy He is So how to reconcile? We reconcile by going to the definition of Taking your desires as a God Where your desires makes halal things haram And haram things halal And you neglect Quran and sunnah And put them behind you And only follow what your desires dictate upon you As your God Now this is kufr and shirk But sinning is following your desires partially But no one takes it as an ilah No one takes this sin as a God And embraces having trust in it In the sin Having fear and hope Having reverence for it This is worshipping your desires and believing in them So I hope this makes some sense JazakAllah Khair"
