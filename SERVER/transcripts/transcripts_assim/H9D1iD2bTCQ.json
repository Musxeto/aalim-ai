  "title": "Does Nationalism take precedence over Religion? Saying ‘My religion is humanity’ kufr? Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "they move from the uk he says what's the ruling on nationalism what is meant by nationalism when nationalism becomes more important than religion when nationalism drives you to oppress others or to be arrogant or to humiliate and disrespect those who don't share your nationality this becomes a major sin many countries unfortunately nowadays i'm i'm talking about many countries among the muslims as for the non-muslims it's by default they say that you have to prioritize your passport your nationality over your religion their kafir so there's no problem in them saying this because they've reached rock bottom they're in hell who cares what they say whatever they say it's blasphemous but when you come to some muslim countries and they say that our nationality our unity is above islam this is where it's an act of apostasy when someone in a humanitarian organization says my religion is humanity and it is above all religions this is an act of apostasy this cannot be a muslim who says because he's saying that before i testify that there's no god worthy of being worshiped other than allah i am giving priority to this nationalism or humanity or um whatever they they may call it so in this sense yes nationalism is prohibited if not worse but if nationalism deals with religion so if your country establishes sharia and rules by it defends islam calls people to it honors the religion then nationalism is defending the country honoring the country due to what it does to islam and this happens only in countries that implement sharia that announce and proclaim islam to be their religion and constitution and no one else"
