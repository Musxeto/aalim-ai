  "title": "Covering the face during hajj or umrah | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "in regards to covering the face or not covering it the most authentic opinion is that a woman in the state of ephraim is not permitted to wear the niqab the niqab is like the Zorro mask it's any face veil that has an opening for the eyes this is prohibited and she's not allowed to wear gloves this is prohibited this does not mean that she has to uncover her face she has la mÃªme Tamia Miriam say there's no way no we're in the Sunna where a woman cup uncovers her face for a crumb or amber or hatch so she covers her face in the presence of nan muharram men but without an opening of the eyes so one veil that she one layer or two layers without an opening on her face would be sufficient insha'Allah"
