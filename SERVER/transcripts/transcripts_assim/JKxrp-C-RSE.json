  "transcript": "thirdly something that is quite awkward to the vast majority of muslims and to non-muslims as well which is the desert lizard in arabic we call it and it is a big uh lizard that lives only in the desert and it has a very fat meaty tale so this is something that the arabs used to consume and eat uh even abbas reported mellow peace with him with his father that a desert lizard was eaten at the presence of the prophet alaihis allah and the prophet when the food was served was about to eat from it it was meat so the wives of the prophet assam acknowledged that he did not know so they said to the companions tell him what he's about to eat because he does not like it so when they told him it was desert lazard he refrained from eating it so the companion said and asked is it haram and the prophet says no but it is a type of food that my people are not acquainted with they're not familiar with which means that even if the food is halal and you don't desire it you're not used to it there's no problem at all from refraining from eating it such as what such as the locust the locust is permissible to eat we joined the prophet alice islam on six or seven military expeditions and we ate locusts with him so these swarms of locusts in the millions that occupy and destroy the crops and and the farms and the green areas these locusts are totally permissible to be consumed of course they are not slaughtered because they're not animals and to many people they enjoy eating it i personally have not tried it and would definitely not go for it simply because i'm not used to it not that it is it was done by the companions may allah be pleased with him and approved by the prophet so definitely there's nothing wrong with it but it's a cultural thing so the prophet did not eat the desert lizard and he justified this by not liking it simple as that so if someone serves you some type of food that you don't like there's no problem in refusing it and rejecting it you"
