  "title": "An invitation to non believers of Islam - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "isn't there a verse in the quran the verbatim word of god almighty that allah is talking about that when there is amongst them those who when they hear the truth you know they shed tears so now you have an example of the christians during the time of heraculus and now another abyssinian king here who later accepted islam you have them shedding tears they're hearing the truth and now morgan freeman or anybody else can be uh liam neeson again it's interesting about liam neeson that there was uh when he came back because you mentioned this he was uh in the first part of his stay in turkey he was annoyed with that and then you know how the story goes is an older story but then he started he said it was something like it was penetrating his soul and there was even talk you'd watch him on some of these talk shows talking about you know he was like kind of pumped up but then he got hit with the backlash from community and that's now your test are you going to submit to what he and she says you know the community or stardom or are you going to actually go down that path and accept the truth so these are great stories for morgan freeman and others to really take a deep dive and look into islam so what would you say to someone like morgan freeman someone who now they think that just this is just another religion there's some good in there just like other religions and whatnot but you have clear passages in the quran where god almighty i mean if you look at this quran this book there's no way that it can come from anyone else there's not contradiction upon contradiction you know there's not different versions of the quran uh it's not you know uh a court a collection of books from anonymous authors this is from the creator who created you me and the whole universe and everything in it and he's saying that whoever chooses a way of life other than complete and total submission to him and him alone to the creator of the universe never will that way of life be accepted so what would you if you had to sit down now he's traveling morgan freeman he comes to your part of the world jeddah he's doing his documentary and now you're talking with them what what would you what are the kind of things how would you invite him to this beautiful way of life of islam usually i follow a very easy way of thinking very simple not a rocket scientist as if rocket science is the best and no i'm not someone who's uh sophisticated i'm an easy going person i'm easy like friday morning so um i wouldn't go into complicated stuff philosophical stuff i don't know this stuff alhamdulillah i know black and white i'm a logical person so i would say to him listen you believe in the existence of one creator most likely he said definitely okay this one creator would it be wise to create all this perfection in this life in this world and leave them astray without showing them what is right and what's wrong you wouldn't expect a apple to produce a device so magnificent so sleek so nice and not tell people whether it's a phone or a tv uh set or a microwave they would have to show them how it works operation manual etc so allah azzawajal definitely would show us how to worship him what to do and what is expected from us logical but all religions do this okay excellent number one are all religions right at the side of allah said uh maybe no no it can be if they are all right they mean that they all share the same values do they share the same same values no no no this religion goes right this religion goes left this religion does not even exist on earth so definitely the truth beside allah is one so which one which religion this is the acid test you have to do to each religion come to christianity scrutinize it look into it deeply to see if it is the accepted religion to god at the moment do you have an original scripture of the new testament of the injil no we have a translation of a translation of a translation you have the original manuscript no does anybody know the original manuscript and how no do you have one virgin no we have hundreds the catholics have the douay virgin the protestants have the king james virgin we have the new standard virgin we have the red dot uh virgin or letter thousands of copies okay go to other religions hindus buddhism do they share the perfection the authenticity the sustainability of all religions uh uh like islam or not you will come to the conclusion that okay with all religions ratings i will rate islam to have the highest eighty percent let's assume eighty percent not a hundred percent is there anything close to it no the second close is like thirty or forty five okay so why aren't you accepting islam oh because it's 80. if it's 80 the 80 which is right and correct and authentic should overwhelm the 20 that are doubtful in your head though i guarantee you that the future and the science will prove the other 20 that you're not being able to buy it's a very easy way of communicating but people who are rigid people who say no no no no i believe that jesus decreed my life that jesus cured my perilous paralysis that jesus did this jesus came to me like one american president said jesus came to him god came to him and told him to invade other countries and they said oops sorry i did it again it was it was a mistake there were no weapons of mass destruction okay sorry for the million kills tough luck next time"
