  "transcript": "Abdul Mateen from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh from this, I think I am committed shirk and I am confused about shirk, what can I do? Akhi, I don't have a crystal ball, I can't know what you've committed. Something that confuses you, how would I on earth know what you've committed? So you say Sheikh I was picking my nose and I think that I've committed shirk, how would I know? Or you said I saw a statue and I prostrated to it, so I'm confused, okay this is shirk, the first one was not shirk. So in order for the Sheikh to help you and assist you, you have to explain to him I did this and this and this and I don't know if it has shirk in it or not. And Allah knows best."
