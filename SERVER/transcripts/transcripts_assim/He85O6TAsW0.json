  "title": "Hadith to delay suhoor and hasten to do iftar (break the fast) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Cave says please tell me the hadith which the Prophet Alice of Salaam guided to do sir or a pre-dawn meal suhoor late and iftar fast as in our locality it is announced from the Masjid to stop the pre-dawn meal five minutes before the event I told them it is a bitter then that person said rule Emma have told to stop pre-dawn meal five minutes before the Adhan time first of all we apply the Sunnah in our lives if there are some scholars who go against the sin we give them the benefit of the doubt either they have their own reasons or not but this is not compelling to me to do what they say the Prophet said Alice thought sir the people will remain to be in good shape as long as they delay this the pre-dawn meal and hastened to break their fast and this is part of the Sunnah so giving a five minutes buffer zone before the event and tell people not to eat and drink this is not from the Sunnah either the event is given on time or it is not given on time if it is given on time then you may eat and drink until the last second before the Adhan calls for the prayer"
