  "title": "Can I give Dawah on social media or just through good character? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Ayman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. So my question is, we know that Dawah is mandatory. So I was just wondering, is it permissible if I give Dawah through social media or through my good character? Or does it have to be like through rhetoric or like in-person rhetoric? Jazak Allahu Khair. Alhamdulillah Azza Wa Jal that he did not limit Dawah to one platform. Not everyone of us can give a speech or a lecture. Not everyone of us can answer questions. Not everyone of us can write a beautiful article. Or is poetic in writing a nasheed, maybe. Or an expert in designing Instagram pages or YouTube clips, etc. So Dawah is unlimited. You can have the best form of Dawah through your own character. And this is the bare minimum. You don't lie, you don't cheat, you're courageous, you're generous, you're truthful, you're honest, you're cooperative. This is the best form of Dawah. Then it goes to writing, speaking, posting articles or posts in different social medias, etc. And all this counts with the grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal. Al-Fatiha."
