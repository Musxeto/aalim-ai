  "transcript": "likewise um using loudspeakers for announcing the the Salah making the aan for the prayers it is not mentioned in the Quran or in the Sunnah but they had something known as which at Early times they used to do because they had big and wide mosques so in order for the sound or the voice of the Imam to reach the back rows they had to have like four or five people relaying his sound so whenever he says Allah abbar the one in the fifth row says allahar the one in the 10th row says Allah so on so Scholars said that it is permissible to use loudspeakers because it falls under the same incident or it's similar to it and compiling the Quran in tapes or in CDs this is measured and compared to writing the Quran to and and collecting it in one mus as was done so analogy with actions of past Scholars and Muslims is taken into consideration yes this is part two Okay the third part or third way of looking at it is when you have an Islamic ruling or a principle that is not the Quran Sunnah that is not has not been done before but it it's an understanding that you measure it under and for example making which is going from Safa to Mara on the second floor MH now the prophet did it on the first on the ground floor and all the Muslims now there are lots of worshippers visiting and it's not enough so what is the ruling on having a second or a third or a fourth floor well they say that there is a general uh ruling which states that the air takes the position of what's underneath it so this means that whatever you do in the on the in a would have the same ruling and this helps us even in looking at our prayers in in the in the m in in in an airplane because some say that no this is not permissible among the conditions of prayer that you have to be on the ground or in some of the massages that have several floors because they strained by space true and it has the same ruling likewise um if you look at the ruling on impersonating prophets and Messengers now there isn't anything that says don't do this in the Quran or Sunnah or anything that was looked at in the past but it falls under the general ruling of respecting and looking up to these prophets and Messengers we mentioned that there are a number of ways of looking at this and there are four procedures that we should follow when we would like to know after visualizing an incident how to categorize it and we said that the third one is the thing that falls under a general ruling which is not Quran Sunnah which is not an incident that took place in the past but it's a general ruling or a ruling for example for the ruling states that the air takes the same ruling as the floor this is a general ruling when once we apply it we understand that if I build a second or a third floor over the M where people go from saf to marwa this takes the same ruling during and during ha and omah likewise if I pray on the ground or if I pray on a plane then it's the same ruling because I am in the air and the air takes the same ruling as the ground and uh also in person ating Messengers and and prophets of Allah this is completely forbidden and the consensus of Scholars upon this issue because there is a great rule that we follow which is that known by default in Islam that is to glorify and to well actually to respect the the the prophets and messengers of Allah and impersonating them by any Tom Dick or Harry is considered to be uh humilating them the fourth category is that does not fall under the first three but usually it is looked at as form of blocking the means so for example we come to the issue of organ transplants some say it's permissible some say it's not those who say it's not they're blocking the means because they say that you have to take this or from a dead person and breaking the bone of a dead person is like breaking it from a living person like the prophet said is forbidden MH or mutilating an a dead person or harming a living person by taking one organ of his that may affect his life in the future so this is one of the ways you categorize it now we spoke about two types first you visualize then you look at the ruling in accordance to Islamic Sciences MH does this end the process definitely not why is that because you may know the ruling you may know the circumstances that this incident took place in and you understand it fully but it still may not be applicable and this is very important because it's not as simple as 1 plus 1 equals to for example a person who is ill or sick the doctor diagnoses this illness so he's visualizing it MH then he knows where the illness is he goes to his own knowledge to seek the remedy or the medicine the treatment and he comes up with a treatment or a a surgical procedure and he knows that 1 plus 1 equals 2 so this is the illness and this is the procedure we come to the third part which is is it applicable or not there might be a reason that prevents him from applying this procedure M whether the patient is too old or the circumstances are not suitable there isn't any uh operating room that is suitable or hygienic or whatever mhm likewise in The Scholar comes and he visualize and he knows under what category it falls under but then he sees if it's applicable or not for example the prophet Alat he came to may Allah be pleased with her and told her that had your people were not so close to the times of ignorance and and pre-islam times had they not been like this I would have demolished the Kaaba and built it all over again on the pillars of ibraim and I would have made two doors for it one for the people to enter from and one to exit from what prevented the prophet from doing this he visualized the C circumstances he knew that he had the right to do this but he didn't because he understood that there were things that would prevent him from doing this and this is very important because to visual to to to apply something you have to have have three criterias or three conditions first of all you have to balance mhm between the pros and the cons advantages and the disadvantages whenever the disadvantage is overway it's forbidden you have to stop secondly you have to evaluate the necessity and whether this is something general or specifically for a or c for example the utilization of Bank interests if someone is living in Canada for example and by law they have to give him interest over his deposits in the bank would he leave it for them so that they can utilize this these interests to uh mercenaries and and Etc M or that is missionaries missionaries well it's the same or benefit from it by harming others by lending it to other people taking more money from them or should I take it and and give it to the poor this is an issue of discussion that has to be thoroughly looked uh uh to and uh finally we have to understand the circumstances the Traditions the customs of the country as in the case of the ruling on wearing pants trousers so if you visualize it and you know that these trousers are the dress of non-muslims for example and then you try to put it under a category which is islamically and look at at it whether it's permissible or not probably would say no imitating the non-muslims is Haram is forbidden so it's not permissible for you to wear trousers now I did not I gave the verdict without going into the third category which is is it applicable or not the fat is not applicable because though the non-muslims wear it the majority it of Muslims wear it as well so it is not indicating that whoever wears trousers is not a Muslim it's shared by Muslims and non-muslims alike it's not something specific to them yes so this is uh um how we the conditions that we have to have in order to know whether to apply this or not"
