  "title": "Are Public Schools for Muslim Children? What can Muslim parents do? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem -JAL",
  "transcript": "uh Sidi from Germany, he says children in a \nnon-muslim country, they're forced to go to   schools and we know how they are fighting \nvirtue and righteousness not Islam only. We know the vicious attack against morality in \nEurope and in the US and in canada and elsewhere   this is so vicious they are systematically   inserting and brainwashing people to be \npart of the homosexuality environment   justifying legitimizing lgbqtxyz and this is \nagainst the principles of democracy i don't like   that. Why do you force me to do it or to take \nit or to embrace it where is the democracy where   is the freedom of speech the first amendment? \nWhere is this where is that all down the drain   because the system wants to manipulate you to \nbrainwash you so brother Sidi says they force   our children to go to such schools and in fourth \nor fifth grade and onwards boys and girls have   joint physical education classes they go to the \nswimming pool together they play sports together   they have to wear the clothes in the same fashion \nand my children are muslims all of this is totally   haram in our religion well this is the system \nthey force them to take music classes maybe do   ballet dancing maybe learn haram things \nfrom an early age how to have protective sex   they talk about condoms they can't talk about \ndildos they talk about the whole nine yards so   what is the responsibility of \nparents usually this is unaccepted   and you as a muslim parent must not must take \nyour children out of such schools do homeschooling   it's a democratic country you \nhave the right to teach your   children whatever you want who imposes upon \nyou what to eat and what not to eat what to   read and what not to read this is not the big \nbrother society you should have rights at least   if this is not possible in this case it is a must \nfor you to migrate to a muslim country which is   a priority or to a non-muslim country that allows \nyou to practice islam freely but to remain in the   country you're in with such oppression though they \ndon't call it oppression they camouflage it they   put a mask on it so they fight niqab they fight \nhijab they fight anything that indicates your   islamic identity they want the muslims to lose \ntheir identity and to oppress them until they   give up their beliefs and religion but this is \nnot oppression no no this is re-educating them   trying to put them in a melting pot so that the \nwhole society is blending all of this is nonsense   a lot of bs and totally the muslims must put an \nend to it don't stay in such a country if you can   relocate to a muslim country if not then relocate \nto a non-muslim country that allows you to   worship allah and to upbring \nyour children in an islamic way"
