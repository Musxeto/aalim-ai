  "transcript": "question is is mentioned in the last story in Surat al-kaf the same as Alexander the Great of Macedonia I think or somewhere around that area the answer is no these are two different people the most authentic opinion is that was a righteous Warrior ruler and a king and he believed in Allah azzawajal some historians say that he was contemporary to profit and messenger Ibrahim peace be upon him and he was the person whom we were told to have gone across the whole entire world from east to west conquering people and calling them to believe in the Oneness of Allah is the one who built the barrier between us and Gog and Magog yeah he was a Muslim Alexander the Great was a disbeliever probably an ideal worshiper he was a tyrant and he did so many uh wrong things according to the historians again but he had nothing to do with Allah Knows Best"
