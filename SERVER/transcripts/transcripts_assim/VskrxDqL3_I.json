  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Georgia um so i had gone to the \ndoctors and she gave me a medicine and it contains uh it's it's like a capsule so it has like \ngelatin and I asked for alternative and she gave   the Alternatives and as far as I know both the \nAlternatives have gelatin in it and I do not I ask   the companies like those if they could give me the \norigin of the gelatin but they haven't replied so   um I don't know if I should like wait for some \nmore time or like should I just take it take   the medicines it's an issue of dispute whether \ngelatin has undergone the process of istihala   which I mentioned a bit earlier in my \nanswers or not and the vast majority of   medical doctors and scientists say that these \ngelatins do not contain any of pork or dead   cows ingredients in them after this rigorous \nvigorous harsh process of transformation therefore   I personally believe that it is permissible \nfor you to consume that and Allah Knows Best"
