  "transcript": "of man from nigeria says what about the amount of profit that one can make over a product that he sells are we limited to a percentage like 20 percent 30 percent 50 percent the answer is no there's nowhere in the sharia where we are restricted to go over a certain percentage so if i buy this pen for one real or like 30 cents and i sell it for 10 any problem no problem at all you don't like my price go look elsewhere this is my product i can sell it with any price i wish and this is dependent on supply and demand people will not buy from you if it's this expensive this is ridiculous so they'll go to somewhere else and they will find what they want with the price that they desire you"
