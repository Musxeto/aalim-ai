  "title": "Is giving a gift to thank someone considered a bribe? Bribes vs Favors |  Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Kalume says if someone does a favor for me out of humanity and in return if I give something with the intention of thanking that person will it comes under bribe like you answer our questions on Twitter here and there out of your good nature and for the sake of Allah so when I meet I give you a gift with the intention of thing thanking so will it comes under a bribe for you and and me that is no bribe is something that you give to a person who's already being paid for what he does so a government official he's getting a salary a clerk in an office he's getting a salary a teacher in a school he's getting a salary you give them a gift if they were not in that position being paid for it you would not have given them anything this is a bribe if someone intercedes for you and you say listen that official has powers and I need him to sign me papers which is halal and everything is held but he's so high up and I'm unable to get the papers to him and I say I'll do that for you give me your papers and I take the papers and and I get them signed but before that I say listen I'll do that but you have to pay me a thousand euros this is haram because I'm doing you a favour and doing a favor and taking money for that is not permissible it's different to when you hire me and say sure I'd like to hire you for a course to teach me a course or to give me a counseling session or to teach me and how to interpret hadith this is money paid for my work so there's nothing wrong in that insha'Allah I hope this answers your question"
