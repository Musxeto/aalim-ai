  "transcript": "I have a friend over him Angela Oberer Adam II also leave Oh silly Muhammad Ali Laramie nabina muhammad in Wahiawa sahbihi ajma'in amma Bhagu the brothers sisters in islam assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh last time we stopped at the paragraph related to distortion of jihad now after all what we had talked about and how important jihad is to the Muslim Ummah and to the spread of Islam we find nowadays that the picture of jihad has been distorted has been manipulated with and the reason for that usually is attributed to two type of people the first type are those who are enemies of Islam they hate Islam they want to do anything to tarnish the reputation of Islam and they would do their level best to blame anything negative on Islam so even if there is a volcano an eruption of volcano or an earthquake they would soon point to Islamic fundamentalists and that they were the cause root of it and such people usually control the media and nowadays in our current times the media is one of the most powerful weapons people can utilize for their gains depending on their agenda twenty thirty forty years ago whenever there was a coup and a government was toppled and overthrown the first thing the rebels do is to take control of the radio on the television and this is what so many people do to control the masses through the media and when you have it in the wrong hands you would have fake news as he says and this is what is exactly happening when it comes to the Western media or media that is controlled by tyrannical governments they make those who make jihad to free their country as rebels as terrorists they portray them as extremists and we know that it depends where you look at it from so someone's terrorist is someone's else freedom fighter when Gandhi or Nansen Nelson Mandela we're in their countries defending their people the government's the occupiers the enemies of the country consider them to be terrorists but the people they're people consider them to be freedom fighters so it all depends how you look at it and the way you portray things to the people having said that I do not at all deny the fact that there are terrorists and these are the second type that is distorting the image of jihad these are people who do not follow a sunnah wa l-jama'a Shaitaan works in clear ways he looks at you either you are religiously committed or you are negligent and careless those who are religiously committed he increases the doses of extremism and he invests their minds with corrupt ideology with things that are not related to Islam that would inevitably and eventually lead them to the clear and this is where how our is king so at the moment you may have a group of Muslims who are truly fighting for the cause of Islam but after a while due to the lack of knowledge due to the fact that they do not regard scholars of Islam's as scholars rather they would choose few people here or there and take the mask colors and when you tell them name your scholars to be they would say Ibaka dama abbulu Baba Abu Hamza al-masri Abu is have a daddy Abu Dis Abu that okay what are their names they said we don't know where are they residing we said we don't we don't know what do you know about their background or their academics said we don't know but they write sound articles subhanAllah and they believe what these anonymous people write to them who I could care less if they were CIA or KGB because this is inevitably playing into their own hands so they write these articles they send it to them they act upon it and they start to terrorize the people and when terrorizing the people the reputation of Islam is tarnished and there is a justification to invade Muslim countries and to kill civilians and to raid messages and to destroy home after home looking for mass destruction weapons of mass destruction so these terrorists have played into the hands of the enemies of Islam and themselves became enemies of Islam the Prophet RA sought asylum described them as the hounds of hell and he said that if I were to meet them I would have killed them wherever they are because they are worse than the enemies of Islam at least an enemy of Islam fights you face-to-face he has a different ideology different religion he's clearly holding the flag of being your enemy while Huaraz they look like us they speak like us the Prophet told us that if one would compare his prayer to theirs you would look down at your own prayer and say that I haven't done anything yet the Prophet said that they go through religion and penetrate religion and leave religion as an arrow when it goes through a pray and again so these two categories they caused the worst harm to the Muslims and to the non-muslims alike now with the grace of allah this coronavirus the covet 19 has with the grace of allah managed to change the perception of non-muslims all over the world people are discovering the beauty of Islam people are discovering how peaceful Islam is and how misinformed they were by their media people have discovered how evil nicest is the non Islamic State of Iraq and Syria and that they are blatant terrorists killing civilians discriminately never differentiating between a child a woman a man or an elderly they could care less killing is their game bloodshed is what they're after and Allah would hold them accountable on the day of judgment for what they had done and caused so we as intellectual educated people must not allow their games to fool others and we have to represent Islam as it is without sugarcoating it some people go to extreme when they say we have to fight every non-muslim and we have to capture them and kill them and take the wealth and break their women out of Allah what religion is this but on the other defense the other side of the coin you have people saying that there is no fighting in Islam there is nothing as jihad we have to accept the others and we have to bow down to them and this is not religion of Islam this is not related to true Islam we have to balance and do exactly as the Prophet had done Ali his salat Raza and this is how we manage to portray Islam to the rest of the world the real Islam the Islam of peace without weakness the Islam of strength without violence the Islam of pride and honor without arrogance so fighting is a necessity not for the sake of bloodshed no one loves fighting but it is part of the religion that has to be fulfilled and the reason of fighting as we've mentioned before is to spread the religion of Allah ah so you mean that we have to compel people and force them no we don't force people to accept Islam and if someone accepted Islam at gunpoint his Islam is invalid and those who force them are sinful we do not force people to come to Islam but we force people to pave the way for Islam to spread you don't want to become Muslim remain as you are you have no problem but you can't stand against Islam and prevent it from spreading and this is why when the Prophet s Sam used to send an army he would tell the leader to give three choices before starting fighting before starting to fight so the leader goes to their leader this is Islam Allah revealed the Quran we have the messenger Salah solemn we have this we have that shows them the beauty of Islam are you interested because if you are and you become Muslim we move on and leave you this becomes a Muslim country this is no we don't want your Islam this is okay up to you totally up to you now if you don't want to slap you're compelled to pass jizya and by the way this jizya is the payment that you pay once a year only on behalf of men who are qualified to work and to fight you don't pay jizya on behalf of women children elderly monks priests its etc the slaves servants no only men and with this drishya money with this taxation we will give you protection any army invades you we will protect you you guys don't have to fight so the guy says no we're not interested we can defend ourselves in this case you leave us no option but to fight you and to conquer your land so these are three fair conditions and it stated in the Quran and in the Sunna now if they wanted peace peace cannot come except through power and in Islam you have to be powerful you have to be strong but again without any arrogance without any violence without any unfairness and when fighting takes place there are rules of engagements that Muslims are obliged to abide by no one is killed on the battlefield except those who are actively fighting nowadays in current war fairs they have expanded the term of collateral damage so we see women being bombed children elderly without any fault of their sight and they said well we have to do this because this is collateral damage and this is not true in Islam it is forbidden to kill a woman a child ill people elderly monks priests servants it is prohibited to kill animals except if you are consuming them or to destroy farmland or to spoil water resources it is prohibited to finish a wounded soldier though he's from the enemy so Islam looks at war as a surgical operation that should be confined to the the diseased part of the body not to blow up the whole country not to kill entire villages rather to be precise in what you're doing and whenever there ever is the benefit of the doubt you have to stay away as much as you can Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him after the death of the Prophet Allah salatu salam sent who savin is a dummy - may allah be pleased really man with his father on an army to fight the Byzantines who are like 300 thousand soldiers so the Muslims who were about 5,000 10,000 against this much what were Abubakr commands they are appeasing them to Osama he said do not commit any treachery plundering or disfigurement so no mutilations with enemy bodies do not kill a child an elderly or a woman do not cut or burn any date trees or fruit trees do not slaughter any sheep cow or camera except for food you shall encounter people who can find themselves in their hemet ages so leave them alone Hermitage is any synagogues places of worship etc this is the same advice that the Prophet used to give money his salat wa salam to all leaders of his whenever they went to invade or to fight a tribe or a country and when the Prophet himself is awesome once in a battle so a woman killed he was angered by this and said subhanAllah such a woman did not deserve to fight let alone to be killed so in Islam we're only allowed to kill those who fight us so if a monk carries a rifle he's to be fought like anyone else if a woman carries a rifle she would be fought like anyone else what about prisoners of war POWs what should we do with them well in Islam in the first major battle ever between Muslim forces and the disbelievers that was the Battle of Badr and it took place in the second year of hijra and Allah Azza WA JAL granted the Muslims prisoners of war some say 70 some say less or more and these were from the dignitaries of Quraysh so the prophet alayhi salatu salam gave each Muslim man one of the prisoners and not only that he instructed them he ordered them to take care of their prisoners so they took good care of their prisoners thing they gave them preference over their own families in regards of food and drink and someone would say ah hey this is too much come on I don't believe this with all due respect an enemy that you were just fighting few hours ago he was trying to kill you and you were trying to kill him and his companions and comrades killed so many of your relatives and friends and associates you mean to tell me that you're going to take him as a prisoner of war and feed him and give him drink more than you give to your family I don't believe this well I think this is your problem if you want to believe or not this is what Allah mentioned in the Quran and he described these believers when Allah said they give food though they need it themselves to the needy the orphan and the captive the prisoners of war this is why so many people who were captive during war enter in Islam Aisha may Allah be pleased with her said that the Prophet said Alice Orson Hodge Abdullah agua minou Jamuna Aaron generative Selassie I am amazed by people on the day of judgment are being dragged by their shackles and chains to paradise this is symbolic to them being captive and prisoners in shackles and chains but then discovering the beauty of Islam accepting Islam willingly and these shackles and chains would lead them to paradise because otherwise they would have remained in the state of cover and would have been in hell for eternity and ask any one whose logical but he has to believe in Islam and in the day of judgment you as a disbeliever if I were to tell you you have a choice not to fight you but you will end up in hell for eternity or I would fight you and you may fall as a prisoner of war but you will accept Islam and inevitably you will go to paradise for eternity what will you choose of course if he believed in Islam he would choose the latter but the vast majority of non-muslims don't believe in that and this is why they rejected so now we as doctors we as people who know the truth would we fight them or leave them to the whims and desires if someone is in front of me and he's about to drink something from a glass which I am certain that someone had put a potion or someone had put poison in it I saw that so I tell that individual don't drink this poison in it I never says it's none of your business I like what I'm doing and I'm gonna drink it what is my responsibility now I know for certain that he is going to die will I say it's none of my business let him die or would I fight him and force him not to drink it's the same thing when it comes to Islam we know for certain that this is the religion of Allah we know for certain that if you don't accept Islam you'll end up in hell for eternity it's not a match that you light and put your finger on it and count from one to ten you can't bear that one to five you cannot bear that want to free maybe maybe not but you have a very bad burn it's Hellfire it's worse than furnaces and it's there for eternity and we don't have time to describe how horrible hell is so we as Muslims see it as an obligation for us to have all the people on in the world to come and embrace Islam when you embrace Islam do I get any cash revenues no don't I get to have control over you and tell you Simon Says do this to do that no so what benefit would I get when you accept Islam the only benefit is reward with Allah the Almighty secondly that I have made my due diligence and I would feel comfortable when you escape hell and go to paradise so this makes me food feel good that's it so don't think that we are getting any gain out of people accepting Islam we have a chapter that deals with war gains but I think that we're almost passing half time so maybe we will go to the questions and answers and see what do we have there so the first question is from a bra Javad Umbra and Javid says I wanted to know if permanent family planning is allowed provided I'm unable to continue with any pregnancies because I'm 38 years old I have a slipped disc problem and I already have three kids I know my physical strength can't bear more kids my husband is also okay with this decision please let me know permanent family planning meanings that you won't be able to get pregnant again and this is problematic because in Islam the Prophet Alice also ordered us to reproduce to have a lot of children and he told us that I will boast the different nations on the day of judgment with the number of followers however scholars say that temporary family planning is permissible and that is leaving a gap of two to three years between pregnancies this is okay and they said that permanent family planning is not permissible unless there is a legitimate reason so if you have a slipped disc and the doctors say that this is adding to the pain and dangers of your back pains when you get pregnant and they say that it might hinder your health and you aren't able to make a surgery whether because you're too scared or because it's too dangerous or because you don't have the means to undergo a surgery so in this case if it is critical and you are unable to cope with another pregnancy and the doctors say that this is a chronic illness that will continue that would not be recovered be able to recover from it anytime soon in this case I believe that there is no problem in sha Allah in having such a surgery Shalini says is it necessary for a Muslim woman to be a part of a group of people who take part in Islamic Dawa or do tab li'l in short is every Muslim obliged or obligated to participate in the work of Dawa if one does not involve himself in the work of Dawa what will be the consequences according to Islamic Shariah when you believe in something you usually act upon it and it is wrong to limit Dawa to giving talks and seminars not everyone is qualified or capable to give talks like us not because we are superstars or superheroes rather we were fortunate from Allah yet to have this platform and for the people to trust us but not everyone can just all of a sudden shoot for that so that way is not limited in speeches leading the prayer giving lectures it can be through social media I know a lot of my team Nayla bless them all that are involved a lot in Dawa so a sister that runs my Facebook account the do you think that she's less in reward than me who's giving the fat was no she's exactly the same whatever I say she gets the reward hey sister who channels my videos and lectures and transcribes it into words for those who are deaf and cannot hear so they read the lecture and they benefit from it she's getting the same reward a brother who drives me from the airport or from the hotel to the conference area anticipating the reward that I'm taking the share to deliver a lecture he's rewarded exactly as I am so that way is not limited you can make that way through the internet social media Facebook you can gather women if you are a sister in your community and give them two three times a week a class to see in real the salihin in anything you can give their way through the way you walk and talk my presence in a room is it all by itself your hijab is it all by itself now joining the tabla Iijima is not something that we advise off I have many friends who are from this jimana they are among the kindest the most generous the most helpful people you'll ever find they never curse their sweethearts seriously but their practice of the Dean is not correct and they have a lot of innovations so is it mandatory for a woman or a man to join the answer is no it's not only not man that a it is prohibited to join them because they are not based on knowledge or what they focus on is their sick soul and their growing the beard shorting the table using the miswak praying in the message that's it if you talk to them about anything of knowledge they say these are issues of dispute and dispute divides the Ummah and they would not allow this to take place so generally speaking people must not join this Gemara because they are not following the right way of the hadith or of the Sunnah or the way of the prophet Isaiah but they are kind don't be hostile to them they're kind they're loving they're generous douwe is so white the sky is the limit you can do so many things in terms of their way that complies with the Quran and with the swindle Nabire bin abdul-aziz says is their title for women the answer's no the women came to the Prophet Elisha Stan and said to him o prophet of Allah allow us permit us to come and fight with you in Jihad so the Prophet said our 'his alot was salaam name you have the best type of jihad for you women and there is Hajj and Umrah so this is the type of jihad that is permissible for women to participate in some scholars say the only exception is when perpetrators when enemy forces come and attack your own City so if a woman is in her house it becomes obligatory upon her to fight back rather than allowing them to take her as a prisoner so she could use anything in her hands if she has guns and gun power so be it if not even boiling some cooking oil might help because it's really bad when you pour it on someone's head and you can do so many things but you have to fight and defend yourself a free nough says is this okay to to pray for raka of taraweeh prayer if I feel tired first of all night prayer Tel Aviv prayer the hundred prayer Whichard prayer are all voluntary highly recommended to be performed but not mandated so if you feel tired instead of praying eleven raka every night you just want to pray for a Kaizen one winter no problem if you just want to pray wondering I with you no problem if you don't pray at all again no problem this is a window of opportunity for you to gain has a net and reward if you are tired sincerely and you do this every single night that you pray but this night I'm tired Allah will reward you for that without any doubt inshallah Fida says what is Muslim and water and why does it matter how to wash hair next to the ear and above that as it is not considered beard in Google well I fit I don't know what the second part is but let me try later on what is Muslim and water Muslim and water is used water what is the significance of it there's no significance some schools of thought when they came in the beginning to classify the types of water they said there is the whole water and there is nachas water the whole water is the water that uplifts a ritual impurity with woudl or washin and it removes a physical impurity not just water we know so what is it between they said what's in between is called ah hell water and defined by her water this is the war and this aspire they said by her water is water that is pure by itself but it does not uplifting a ritual impurity why because it was used so when I perform Woodham the water that falls from washing my organs this water is pure if I put it on my clothes my clothes are not considered or labeled as nudges but I cannot use that used water to perform another rule when you look in the Quran to the Sunnah you don't find anything referring to that but these are the schools of thought and how they classified water so this unfortunately came to some people over thinking people come to instance if I washed my face and without noticing some of the water fell into the bucket which I was taking water from so can I use that water or shall i this both of it of course using the scholars give examples for power water so they say if the water nature changes with the with a purity with something that's pure it is fired you cannot use it for woudl such as if they say if you put into it a bag of tea tea is fire so now when you stir it up a bit take the back what do you have they said this water is fire if it falls on my clothes I can still pray but I cannot perform will do with it we say this is true you cannot perform water with it not because it is the head water rather because it is not water anymore this is called tea so in the Quran and in the Sunnah water is either Palpa or Naji's fire and the whole being the same if the characteristics were changed with something that is pure then it changes to another substance other than water which is not cold water anymore so I hope this answers the question as for the second part I don't know what do you mean if you mean this area of hair for a man this is washed one ways washing your face not while wiping over your head so I don't know if this is what you mean or not Cassandra says I have anxiety and depression it is very difficult for me to pray and fast is it okay if I don't pray and fast with Allah forgive me well Cassandra you are one of two people either you are mentally sane and sound so you have your own choices you know what you're doing and you know the consequences of them you don't drop you don't kill people you don't harm them because you know what what happened to you you don't want to go to jail you never cross a red light signal because you know that you gotta be pay a lot of money in fines so you are a same person you have anxieties you have mild or severe depression but you're still sane if you don't pray you're considered to be a kafir and you'll go to hell forever those who do not pray at all are not labeled and considered as Muslims so it's very difficult you have to be careful but if you are classified by psychiatrists to be insane and you have reports to prove that you are not accountable for your actions or your decisions and choices in this case it is up to allah azzawajal to judge you because this is only allah in only it's only in Allah as hands to determine from your email from your question you sound to me like a normal person writing perfectly good English not confused not having any problems but it seems to me that you have whispers of Shaitaan overwhelming you and trying to convince you not to pray and not to fast so that you would improve not knowing that is you that whenever you do not pray or fast you'll deteriorate faster and faster and this would cause you more harm me Allah as I shall protect you Fatima says in in Ramadan we eat after Maghrib both after breaking the fast and after the Mallory prayer so how and when to say those long ask are of the evening well you have to make a choice masha'Allah you eat before moderate Salah and you eat after Maghrib Salah and you continue till taraweeh eating what kind of diet is is what the fasting this is bad for you the best thing is just to have few dates and a bowl of soup maybe one or two sambusa and that's it until 11 o'clock when you have your final meal not pre-dawn meal but the final main meal and just before Fajr you may take some yogurt some milk maybe a couple of dates and water and that's it but to fill it up after motherhood and then after praying mother if you fill it up again and then you ask about that car you have to make a choice you don't have to sit where you are to make your f car you can eat and say your ass car but this is something you have to balance yourself you don't expect  to come and say no you should not eat more than three days drink a glass of water and make your f car for half an hour no one would say that to me we do not tell you what to do and what not to do we tell you about the sinner you have to find out a way out that would be accepted for you and at the same time without compromising saying these of cars Rambla says can we kill the insects and with our feet squashing them she means it's very painful when they bite accidentally no problem anything that is harmful you can kill it whether by squashing it with your feet by spraying it with pesticides by washing it off no problem with that oh my cinema says what are the conditions of woudl and how to do wudu please tell me the right way chef well this would take a long time and this is a QA you would be kindly requested to revise our series maybe at number four number five where we talked about how to perform model wouldl president says what is more rewarding for a woman after fajar she prays to raka after sometimes the sunrise at home or she prays bah bahah before allah her time if you want my advice do both Ramadan is a season for good deeds so if you do that you will be highly rewarded for that lyric says what is the ruling of the one who fasts but does not pray at all is his fast valid this is an issue that is frequently asked every single Ramadan first of all is it my job to judge people I see many people in my family and elsewhere they go to someone who does not pray but it's so eager too fast when Ramadan starts they said don't fast why you're a kafir you don't pray so the guy says okay for MacArthur I'm not gonna fast what would I fast subhanAllah I see what harm would he bring you if he fasts nothing but it is our love to judge people to control others now I've often said this and I'll repeat it again the ruling of a person who does not pray is theoretical and practical the theoretical part is the hadith which states anyone who does not praise a kafir the pledge between us and them is abandoning salat whoever abandons salat is a kafir between man and disbelief or ship is abandoning Salah all these hadees are authentic in so he had elsewhere so there is no doubt in their authenticity these are theoretical it is like when the Prophet said Allah so son may Allah curse the one who deals in Reba and who takes Reba so this is theoretical I can't go to a person in an interest-based bank teller or the clerk the clerk or the clerk who is opening accounts and fixed deposits and setting the percentage of Reba I cannot go to him and say may Allah curse you Oh the Prophet has cursed you you are cursed because this is practical so the theoretical part is anyone who does not praise a cutter the practical part is to identify whether this particular individual named I met for example who does not pray whether this particular individual named Ahmed is he a kafir or not this is the practical aspect of it so what's the difference the Prophet said who doesn't pray is a kafir I met this is Brendon he's a cap I know practically we have to ensure that the conditions are fulfilled that he knows the ruling that he is choosing that ruling that he does not have any misinterpretation because he might say yes I know the hadith and I know also that the Prophet said asam whoever says la ilaha il-allah will never enter hell so I'm saying like I have Allah so there's a misinterpretation here and we have to ensure that there are no obstacles that is not ignorant that is not force that is not misinterpreting etc and this practical side cannot be done except by scholars the Muslim ruler the Muslim judge to ensure that this individual has fulfilled all the conditions and is a full-fledged kafir going back to your question lyric a person who desert does not pray and fast is his fast valid this is in the hands of Allah soldier we tried to give him dower call him to pray we would not repel him from fasting or say you don't pray your fast is invalid no but fasting will only draw him closer to Allah and some how some way down the line he will inshallah resumed praying Jamil says history we counted as tahajud can I pray it before the whole taraweeh is a new name given to the prayer not from the Sunnah but rather from what Sahaba and Italian called it and Tala we by definition is night prayer offered in congregation in the machine so if a woman is praying home during the month of Ramadan this is not culturally it's called night prayer if a man is praying other than Ramadan in his home this is not culturally what about if he prays home like we do now the messages are on lockdown so we pray at home do we call this thoroughly no we call it night prayer and this is why delaying it during the month of Ramadan so that you create at the time of the head judge the last third of the night this is best this is what Rawat may Allah be pleased with him said when he saw the people praying tella we in the Masjid he said the prayer that they sleep over is better for them than this meaning the prayer that they sleep because it is late at night the hundredth time this is better than the one they are praying in congregation so yes Jameel it is best for you to delay your prayer and pray it at the time of tahajud Pfizer says we decided to stone before the one that is the third day due to continuous announcements by the authorities in Mena to avoid the rammy after the 12 o'clock noon as we had heard about the new fatwa that permits stoning before the one we didn't ask any particular in particular to any scholar at that time so now is this condition in this condition do we need to offer expiration if you received news from the Grand Mufti of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia that it is permissible for you to stone before noon and you acted upon it because it was the official Mufti and the Grand Mufti the highest authority in in religious affairs in the kingdom and you acted upon that I believe that there is no expiration on you and the sin is on him but for people of knowledge who know what is right and what is wrong it is not permissible for them to fight to follow his command because they know that the Sunna of the Prophet and what the Prophet he did himself directs them to say that it is mandatory to throw only after noon so you have to pick and choose what is right and what is wrong in your case and allah azzawajal knows best this is all the time we have until we meet again Thursday insha Allah same time I leave you fear Manila was salam alikum warahmatu allahi wa barakato"
