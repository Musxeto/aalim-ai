  "transcript": "please check um I have this uh the severe thoughts about severe thoughts because I was sick and I was going to the doctor and this was ever since I got my job so every single rupee I have earned has been sent to the doctors and medical issues and I have not even saved the brainy field today share so this has been going on even now and it's continuing to go on and this has been worrying me a lot check uh it's like uh even though I go to the doctors and they say that I have nothing I come home content but I get a new problem physically and then I go to another doctor and then I grew with more checkups and this is a cycle that never ends and this is at a point I think that I'm going to put my trust in Allah and never go to the doctors again but then somehow I think I ended up there so this is also interfering with my daily life with the job and everything even though I try to put myself alone in Allah it lasts only for a few minutes so how can I this takes a lot of time and I advise you to come and book a counseling session with me inshaallah if you did not take a free session before if you can afford it you have to pay for it but if you can't afford it you can come Allah is your judge and witness that you can't and that you're poor and I'll give you one free session uh uh inshallah in a nutshell all these worries you're getting for the past three years nothing materialized doctors say you're fine till when are you going to allow Satan to mess up with your head like this the only one who's bothered by it is you everybody around you your family your relatives your friends they go to work as usual they eat three meals or five meals a day they enjoy themselves they play around they go to the gym they go to the park they do their thing and they're living and they're happy the only one who's depressed is you over what over nothing over an illusion over your imagination and this will continue for another 10 years until you die why because Satan is messing up with your head and you're the one who's accepting him and calling him please come in he's knocking on your door he doesn't have any control over you he's simply an auction your door you're the one who's opening it and inviting him in so you have only yourself to blame as mentioned in Surah Ibrahim chapter 14. verse 22 I Satan says I had no control over you except to call you and you responded and answered me so don't blame me rather blame yourself nobody actually is going to care about you abdulaziz nobody you live you die nobody cares you're the only loser and you will continue to lose and you claim that you have to work on Allah you have zero tawa Quran Allah because if you had Tawakal on Allah you would be like the birds birds don't have a certificate don't have a degree they wake up in the morning they chip around they fly they go eat warms eat whatever they can find and come at the end of the day with full stomachs and with food to give to their chicks and that's why Allah gives them risk and provision and takes care of them so if you have full you would never have a problem with the grace of Allah"
