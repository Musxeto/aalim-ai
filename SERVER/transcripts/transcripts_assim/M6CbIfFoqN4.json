  "transcript": "T So a person is not accountable until he reaches the age of puberty which means that if a child where to perform Hajj when he was 10 years of age and he remembers everything he did in Hajj and it was according or up to the book then he reached adulthood we tell him you have to go and perform Hajj again because you're ordered to perform Hajj once in a lifetime and the conditions were not fulfilled when you performed it with your parents of course one would say okay if it's not accounted for why would he do it well the a woman carried an infant to the prophet Allah said o prophet of Allah does this one have obliged upon him or or is it valid for him to perform Hajj and the prophet said yes and you will have reward for it but the consensus of all Scholars that this Hadith is regarding the reward and the validity not that it would be sufficient for his one lifetime Hajj which each and every Muslim is obliged to do therefore he has to perform Hajj again once he reaches adulthood"
