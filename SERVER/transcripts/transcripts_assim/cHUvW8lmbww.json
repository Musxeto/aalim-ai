  "transcript": "the most prominent ritual that people do in shawol is fasting the six days of Showa why the Prophet said Alice awesome whoever fasts Ramadan the whole month and follows that with six days of shawol Allah would reward him as if he had prayed as if he had fasted the whole year and another hadith because one deed is multiplied to ten so fasting six days of Shawwal is as if you had fasted sixty days to months and fasting Ramadan before that is as if you have fasted ten months and this is a full year now one of the benefits of fasting the six days of Showa is that it compensates whatever shortcomings you had done during fasting Ramadan and this is something well known in Sharia whatever things you miss in a fault whatever voluntary you perform would compensate for that which was missing now there is an issue of dispute among scholars in regards to whether the fasting of the full Ramadan must be done before the six days of Shawwal or not and the most authentic opinion is that you cannot fast 23 days of Ramadan skipping six or seven days due to a legitimate reason such as travelling falling sick or having menses for women and after Ramadan you fast the six days of sherwin the most authentic opinion is that this is not permissible you have to make up for the missed days of Ramadan so that you would have fulfilled fasting the whole month of Ramadan and after that you must if you wish fast the six days of show while in order you fall under the category and under the reward of the Prophet Arezzo salaam that afterwards meaning after fasting Ramadan you follow that with six days of Shabbat which means if you fasted 28 25 days you you can you did not do that and this is the fatwa of the permanent committee that you cannot fast a missed Ramadhan follow that by six year well and attain the reward you have to fulfill and complete it so a frequently asked question can we combine between making up of the missed days of Ramadan with the six days of shewhart with one intention so like for example I missed one day of Ramadan due to travelling so in sha Wan I fast one day with the intention of making up for the missed day of Ramadan plus it's a day from the six days of show while the answer is no you cannot combine such intentions you have to fulfill fasting of Ramadan entirely without a combination of intentions then you fast the six days alone and separately do I have to fast the six days of sure what in a row that says no you can break them one day here one day there one day in the middle one day at the end which means that you have the option even to combine the intention of six days of sha well with voluntary fasts so if I select too fast Mondays and Thursdays with the intention of the six days of Showa you get two birds with one stone if I intend to fast the white day's 13th 14th and 15th of Shaban with the intention of the six days of Shawwal this is no problem what about if I happen to fast on a Saturday alone this is an issue of dispute also tentacle is that you should fast a day before or a day after just to be safe though the hadith of the prohibition of isolating Saturday in fasting this is disputed upon and the most authentic opinion that it is not authentic but just to be safe rather than sorry add to it a day before or a day after a lot of the sisters complain and say that we have so many days to make up of Ramadan and we have our own excuses in show while and we won't have enough time so the answer would be as Jacobin I think means said may Allah have mercy on his soul let us assume that a woman gave birth in the month of Ramadhan or let us assume that she had 14 days of menses in Ramadan so she fasted 16 days sure while was over first day of read she started from the second day of sha1 and fasted making up the 14 days on the 15th of Shaban when she finished making up for Ramadan she got her menses again for 10 12 13 days and now after she's pure she has only two days to fast from sure while remaining we say fast these two days and in Valletta you can fast the other four days and this would make up for the six days of Showa because you had a legitimate reason and this is a fatwa women as a mean and it's also the photo of Shara Berkman David Nasser a Sarah T because you had a legitimate reason those who are lazy and don't fast during the month of Ramadan don't do not fast during the month of Shawwal and they're late and they want to make it up in the Creta without a legitimate reason there is not an excuse for them and this would not be legitimate"
