  "title": "Are women allowed to Visit Graves & offer Funeral Prayer diff of opinion among scholars | Assim Al",
  "transcript": "so sumiya from the emirates uh recently my husband visited a funeral attended a funeral so he saw their women were allowed to come in the graveyard and then they prayed behind the men's funeral prayer and in the burial procession the imam was in charge he called and encouraged the woman to come forward and throw sand in the grave and make dua along with men for the deceased so is this allowed in islam as far as i am aware women's are not allowed to visit the graveyard okay i will answer inshallah emirates she says that some scholars they say that it is permissible for women to enter a cemetery and to participate in the burial process and to throw some sand to the grave so what's the ruling on that it's an issue of dispute it is an issue of dispute among scholars whether women can attend or go to graveyards or not and there's no issue of dispute on the ruling on women praying funeral prayers this is totally legit but the problem is in them entering a graveyard or a cemetery the most authentic opinion that this is not permissible but if a scholar thinks otherwise he has the right to do so because it is an issue of dispute it's not simon says and you have to obey this is an issue that scholars disputed upon and each have their own evidences"
