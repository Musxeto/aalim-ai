  "title": "Reward for fasting 6 days of shawwal make up Ramadan fasts first? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Fuad from Bangladesh. So Sheikh, is it recommended to keep the six days of shawwal? Six days of shawwal? Yes, six days of shawwal. What's with them? Fuad? So most likely Fuad is asking about the ruling on fasting the six days of shawwal before making up missed days of Ramadan. Most likely this is what people frequently ask about. And it's an issue of dispute, and the most safest and authentic opinion according to the hadith is that you have to first make up the days missed of your Ramadan, which is a higher priority without any doubt. It's a fard. Then you fast the six days of shawwal, which is a recommended sunnah. But to reverse this, Sheikh bin Uthaymeen and other scholars say that this would not attain you the reward because the hadith is clear. Whoever fasts Ramadan and follows that by fasting six days of the month of shawwal, then Allah would grant him the reward of fasting the whole entire year. So this is a hadith that's conditional. You have to fast Ramadan first. Skipping a day or two would not mean that you've fasted Ramadan. Therefore you have to make them up and then fast the six days of shawwal, and this is a highly recommended sunnah. You're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
