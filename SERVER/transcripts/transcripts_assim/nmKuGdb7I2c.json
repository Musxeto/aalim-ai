  "transcript": "those who say these things about the Sunnah we would simply ask them do you know the Quran say no do you know Arabic says no have you read the books of Sunnah says no so how dare you have the audacity to say such nonsense I don't waste my time with such ignorant imbeciles yes if he's a scholar if he's a renowned D who has influence I'll speak to him and debate with him but laymen who make fun and oh the prophet did not shave because he did not have jell two or jell three and how did he shave his pubic hair this is from the Sunnah 10 characteristics as in Muslim narrated by mother shaving the pubic hair it's shave they used to have razors plucking the armpit they used to have creams to do that so they had razors so such an ignorant imbecile who raises such a a topic I don't even waste my time replying to him because he he doesn't know anything so as for what isah of or this is for the scholars to determine they have rules they have regulations they have and they know what is part of the culture and what is part of the religion and the beard with the consensus of the four schools of thought shaving it is Haram not from me and the prophet said all of these are verbs that order you to just let it be do you think I like my beard seriously do you think I like it if I can shave it wouldn't I be the first one to shave it I'd like to be normal like everybody else but I do it because my Prophet did it and he had a wide big beard that would fill his chest and the companions would know that he recites Quran in and from his back when he they see his beard trembling how would you see his beard trembling if it's not wide so I do this because I love my prophet and Allah Knows Best"
