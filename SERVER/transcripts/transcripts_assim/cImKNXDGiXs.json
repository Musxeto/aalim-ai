  "title": "Medical marijuana permissible in Islam ? Assim al hakeem JAL ï¿¼",
  "transcript": "Alvi from the US. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. I have a question about drugs. So if a doctor in the United States of America prescribes you marijuana that is intoxicating because like you're having let's say mental problems like stress let's say, is that permissible for you to take in Islam? Medical marijuana is openly prescribed in the US and parts of Europe and Canada I think and it's being definitely mis-abused and being used unlawfully in so many cases. But the scholars have listed a number of conditions for it to be halal, to be used. Among them is number one, that there's no other alternative. Number two, that it is not going to make a person addicted to it. So this is more harmful as in the opioid conundrum that took place like five, six years ago and it's now developing and they're being sued in the billions of dollars for their bad work with the public. Thirdly, that it should be prescribed by a Muslim doctor, not any doctor. So a Muslim practicing doctor should prescribe it in dosages that would not become addictive and it is really in need. Fourthly, that it is a real need for it, not a mild depression or the likes. Among other conditions that I've mentioned on my website and you can find the answer detailed there insha'Allah."
