  "transcript": "if muhammed sallalahu alayhi wa sallam was here today what you know the brothers and sisters divided on the so then he gave he be screaming after number on his well senior to me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh welcome to contemporary Islamic issues and concepts on Hoda TV I'm your host Arkam Rashid in this episode we will continue our conversation on Islamic eschatology now we've done two episodes on this topic already in the first we've discussed the idea in the belief of a last day according to the Islamic perspective and then after that we went into some of the minor signs of the day of judgment over the second episode the chef gave us many examples of the son of the minor signs of the day of judgment that have already taken place that are currently taking place and will take place in the future as well so I'm going to start off by welcoming our chef to the program and then we'll get into the major signs like we've promised insha'Allah cinematic come share a similar Hakim how are you why are you going to sit down but I have to learn finds a Caliphate for having me and it's always wonderful to have you on shift so over the last episodes we've already covered I wouldn't say all of the minor signs I mean there's many minor signs but some of the vital ones and you give us you know examples to relate to nowadays you know the wonderful example of global warming that you gave with the hadith of the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa seldom so now the viewers are you know waiting for the major signs you know we've done two episodes on the minor signs already so let's start off with some of the the major signs and events for the day of judgment Allah alhamdulillah I mean or salat wa salam ala muhammad in the night I mean maybe you know Muhammad in water he was a heavy rain on my back the major signs are a handful and the Prophet told the Salahi's salat wa sallam that when they start taking place it's like a prayer beads that have been cut so if you have a necklace with pearls in it and you cut it then you get all these pearls running on the ground this is the same issue with the major science once the first one takes place then the rest would follow soon afterwards and there are a number of them among them is the Maddie you have the Dajjal impostor Christ or the Antichrist you have the dissension of Jesus Christ you have juji juji Gog and Magog you have the beast that comes and brands people on their noses or and speaks to them as well you have the wind that comes out from Yemen capturing and taking all the souls of the believers and this comes at the very end of the time and one of the greatest signs of the Day of Judgment is the rising of the Sun from the West every single day the Sun rises from the east but when it rises from the West this is the end of mankind this is at the end of this life as we know it where Allah would not accept the repentance of the people at all I may have left over one or two here and there but this is ok so what we want to do now inshallah we're gonna speak about I've written down the ones that you've mentioned we're gonna get into you know we're gonna get into each sign one by one and you can give us an idea or a you know a general idea doesn't have to be too detailed of what each one is so let's start off with the coming of the Matty who is this you know this Matty guy is it the one that we seen on piece TV or this is this is very funny I was in mumbay I think it was 2009 or 2010 with a great number of dyes and shoe among them was my brother and friend chef Yusuf the son of Sheikh Jaffa Greece may Allah preserved them both and give them long life and good health with steadfast email chef Yusuf was with us he had a collection he came back and he told us that this is very funny something that happened to me and I forgot all about it until I saw it a few months ago I was sharing it to someone shared that with me at the end of his lecture a man stood up and said I have this news I want to give to you and she said okay what is it he said I give you the glad tidings that I am the Maggie and I have come Allah has sent me and she who said what so Yusuf asked him a question can you do you know Arabic said yes and the man started saying at hamdulillahi rabbil alameen r-rahmani r-rahim' e Maliki o me Dean and this is not arabic this quran' it is Arabic but when someone tells you to know Arabic means its meaning that you can speak and communicate so sure who civ explained to him that sorry yeah you're not the one I'm sorry to convey the sad news to you but he explained that if I were in his shoes I would have asked the man to tell me his name why is that because the macd the Prophet told the Salahi's salat wa salam in an authentic hadith that his name is like my name and his father's name is like my father's name so the mighty must be mohammed IBN abdullah al mahdi or i might even add allah because the prophets name is muhammad or Ahmed the praiseworthy peace be a piece of blessing of Allah be upon him so anyone who claims that the Mahdi has a different name is not the real Matty and throughout history we had so many lunatics coming and saying that we are the madam to the extent that it even escalated and turned violent as in 1980 when a group of misguided Muslims believed in one of them to be the Maddy and instead of following the message of the prophets I'm of peace of Dawa they went and bombarded the Holy harem of Mecca killing the pilgrims at the Pilgrims and barricading in the Masjid having snipers at the Maidan at the top shooting any police force that was trying to come in so they prevented the Muslims from making tawa from praying from claiming that they were following the right Maddy Maddy we have few hadith and evidences about him the Prophet told us ice under his name coincides with mine and his father's name cansado and he is from the descendants of the grandchild of the prophetess and the grandson Al Hassan even Hari so he's not from the Husein he's from Hassan and this is al Mahdi who a lot of the Muslims consider him to be the savior in a negative sense that they're not willing to change anything they're sitting back and not willing to be proactive and changing their environments the situation the Muslim situation all what they do is a loss and the Samadhi so that we can fight with him and I assure you even if the Maggie were to come they will not fight with him probably they will fight against him and discredited him because they are programmed not to do anything we have the other Maddy whom the Rafah ba we live in and this is a cause of mockery from all of the nations against Islam but alhamdulillah the Rafah do not represent Islam so we don't pay much attention to them they say that the Magdy their Maddy was a child I think his father was a person an ASCII or something like that and his name is Hammet so again he doesn't fit the criteria his father's name is not Abdullah Mohammed even hasn't and we know that his father throughout history was unable to kill to to bear to conceive he's not conceiving of course any meaning that he doesn't have children and he died without any offspring yet they fabricated this child okay where is the child they said that he crawled when he was 2 or 3 years of age into a cave and now he's hitting in the cave okay don't you have anyone to like retrieve he searched for him and this was like 600 700 years ago I mean even more and they say that he has a river of milk and a river of water in his cave and every single time you find these ruffle are going to his cave saying if begging him please come out please solve our problems and the end days and they go back and nothing happens yet all these big mullahs who fooled the people their people in the congregation they say that we have a direct client with him like a red telephone or something and he is telling us he issues verdicts to us do this do that and the masses believe them and if I were in their shoes I would be a multi-billionaire by now because everything happens by you know my word against yours so they claim that they have direct communication with this Madi okay what are you waiting for why don't you solve our problems well you come out said no it's not time yet before we actually get into any further description of the true mantheon and the Madi that we believe in not that Officer we're gonna go for a short break so dear viewers so far that we the Sheikh has given us an overview of some of the major signs of the Day of Judgment and we said we were going to speak about each sign one by one and we started with the Madi he's given us somewhat of a description and he will continue the description with with us insha'Allah soon as we come back from this short break so stay tuned Oh welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on her the TV now before we went for that short break the give us an overview of the major signs for the day of judgment after that we started speaking about the Matty sure you give us the beginning description of the Matthew what's-his-name and many people that will come and claim to be the Madeira that have claimed to be the mandiant they're not the real Matthew you've also given us the description of the Shia version of the Mahdi and what they believe in and who they believe is the mathy now if we could just speak a little bit more about the Maddie and Charlotte before we move on to the Jalen Chavez and the problem is that we do not have a lot of information of him because he will come at a later stage of our life probably but the hadith we have are numbered in the sense that the Prophet said if there would not be left of this life except one day Allah would send down to us and magic now is he among us is he like us or he is somewhere else no he is a normal human being his upbringing is normal to the extent that he was not even practicing at the time until Eliza hides his heart and overnight the Prophet says as Sam he changes like 180 degrees he changes drastically because Allah would as the Prophet says SM fix him overnight and this is astonishing but yeah I need one can relate to it so many brothers and sisters we know of who've been normal sinful clubbing having a good time not abiding by Islam they go to bed and before that someone gave them no see ha had the conversation with when they wake up in the morning they're totally different people and I know people personally like this who were transformed overnight so uh the Prophet tells us that and mathy would be like this at a stop sign he would be transport transformed overnight and Allah would fill the earth with justice and fairness through him as it was filled with transgression and injustice so he would come as a ruler not as a preacher or as any other person he will he will come as a leader and as a ruler okay so that's the that's the first time that we've covered so far now what I have here is the jeleesa the Beast Oh Judah ma'juj and the wind from Yemen I'm gonna let you choose whichever one you want to start with you see as long as we've started with Maddie and Maddie would come at the end of time and the Prophet told us al Assad Sam that there would be a great battle between a common enemy and the Muslims and the Christians on one side and this means that there would be a sort of an alliance if you may say between the Muslims and the Christians and after the battle is over and the vision and the Muslim and the Christians are victorious as they are resting in their camps the Prophet tells us that one of the Christians attracts a big cross and says that the cross has won or we won through the cross hot blooded Muslim stands up and breaks across and says know we've won by the power of Allah the Christians react to this action by killing the Muslim and the Muslims react to the murder and killing of their brother by fighting with the Christians and this is called the Mel hammer al-kubra I don't know if they in the biblical sense they would say that this is the Armageddon or not is it something else or not but this what would take place and fierce fighting would take place at this time and there are so many things that will happen the Prophet told the sorry so Salaam about the killing of 2/3 of the army a great portion of the army of the Muslim army would die one-third would flee away one-third would be martyred and one-third would stay strong and fight and Allah would make them victorious the conclusion without going into details and this by the way would happen astonishingly where I don't know give it I would take a wild guess Yemen no it's Syria Syria so a lot of the people think that what's happening at the moment is a period of what's going to happen in the future but the Sunnah wal Jamaa do not judge the events as they take place because they might be wrong they judge it after it is over has taken place because otherwise you would be speculating and saying that this is what is going to happen and Allah said this when it is not the right thing to say so at the end the Muslims are victorious and the Christian army and all the Christians are gone and defeated as they're resting the devil shouts in them that the jail has appeared and he is attacking your families your women and your children the Prophet says Allah so salam they sent ten of their nights of their riders to investigate and this the Prophet says our son I know their names and the names of their parents and the color of their horses which some scholars thought of this as a sign that there would be no fossil fuel at the time of a Maddie and the Dajjal and ASA dissension there will be no electricity no plastics no all what we considered to be means of Technology and civilization because they will be fighting with swords and bows and arrows and they will be riding horses and the Prophet says I know even the color of the horses when they go then it is a dead child and that the job has been described to us are in salatu salam quite thoroughly because the Prophet told us Allison that he is the greatest fitna mankind had ever witnessed he would be the greatest trial for mankind the Prophet said Islam that if he appears now I'll take care of him but if he takes appears after my death then each one of you should take care of himself there was no Messenger of Allah or prophet except they gave warning to their people of the Antichrist so this is something not to be taken lightly it is a serious thing and there are so many aspects regarding it I was just gonna say sure we should save it for inshallah the next episode because you know this is coming to the end so just a recap of what we've covered this episode you know we've spoken about some of the major signs in general we said the Mahdi the Jerusalem the BCR Judah ma'juj the wind from Yemen the Sun rising from the West and we've delved into Imam Mahdi a bit who we spoken about we have spoken about the the Shia approaching the Shia opinion on the mandiant we've given an insight to the Sunni approach on Imam Mahdi obviously not in much detail but just a general idea of what this is we've started with the gel and inchaallah on the next episode we will continue the signs starting off with the gel now I want to I want to remind you guys that we've been continuing this series from the beginning we started with the minor signs and the ship has given us a wonderful idea of what these minor signs are some of the ones that have taken place some of this the ones that will take place and some of the ones that took place already and are continuing to take place and then we've gone into the major signs and this is what we will continue next episode so until then may allah subhanho
