  "transcript": "the fear that allows a person to do such a sin is an actual emminent fear so if I know for certain and for sure 100% that has no doubt in it that if I do not do this if I do not trim my beard I will be thrown into jail I will be prosecuted and maybe tortured because of this and I have to go and get this paper from my government I have to go and renew my passport I have to do this if I know for sure and this has no exceptions everyone from the brother brothers previously who have gone through this process were faced with the same punishment this allows you to turn your it but to the very minimum way possible not to shave it if they say trimming it is good then this is good enough don't shave it this the lest thing but if the fear is not actual if it is not real if it's imaginable if it's people intimidating you and saying if you don't do do this we got to do this and that to you but there are people who did not do it and alhamdulillah nothing happened to them then you should have your trust in Allah and do your upon him and inshallah nothing will harm you and Allah knows BL"
