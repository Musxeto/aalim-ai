  "transcript": "maybe Miriam says a friend of mine left for Umbra and unfortunately had her menses on her way there she is asking if it's permissible for her to touch the hajj oral i sweat while in her menses well Miriam she is not permitted to enter the Masjid let alone touch the Hajj or alas word Hodja Rasul means the black stone which is in the Kaaba itself which is the Qibla of the Muslims a woman in her menses when a woman is in her monthly cycle she's not permitted to enter the Masjid and this is the most authentic opinion the evidence behind that is that the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam once is was in arity calf charity calf it is seclusion when a worshipper stays the last 10 nights of ramadan in the masjid does not come out unless there's a necessity such as answering the call of nature so we know that the Masjid was adjacent to the houses of the prophet alayhi salaatu sermon each chamber or house of the prophet s m had a door to the machine for ease of access so the Prophet said allah√≠s alot was Salam and asked mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her to hand him over a piece of cloth let's assume a towel so I said o prophet of Allah I am in my monthly cycle what do you understand she understood like we do that she cannot approach the Masjid because she is in her menses if she were permitted to enter the Masjid while she was in her menses the Prophet would have said to her no problem come in give me the item and leave but the Prophet did not say that alehissalaam was he said to her I know that you are on your monthly cycle your monthly cycle is not in your hand meaning that your hand entering the space of the message it is okay what is not okay if you enter the message it with your body while in the state of monthly cycle so the hadith is crystal clear now sure there are many scholars who say this or that with all due respect what do we care when we have the hadith of the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam that clearly states a fact that anyone on the street can understand okay sure the scholars who said it's permissible didn't they read the hadith didn't they understand it like you have done it's not my job to justify their mistakes I have the hadith of the Prophet array so of 'some you want to counter that you bring me another hadith or bring me another ayah from the Quran but to simply reject the hadith of the Prophet as Sam with a saying of a scholar or very man audhu billah it was reported that in Imam Shafi may Allah have mercy on his soul was addressing the ruling of something by coating a hadith so the ruling of so-and-so is taken from the hadith of the Prophet as of Salaam who said so-and-so so a man stood in his circle and said okay mm Geoffrey what do you say and he was furious he said do you think I'm wearing as an R which is the Rope that the monks of the Christians where do you think I'm a Christian I tell you the Prophet said so-and-so and you're asking me what do you say this is unaccepted in Islam at all therefore the way we learn and understand Islam is the way of the self did the Prophet address this issue yes he did salallahu alaihe wasalam then we follow it and we disregard anything that the great scholars of Islam has commented unless they brought something to show that this hadith we on which we understood was general arm and there is something that specified it or that it was abrogated or that there is other evidences or there are other evidences that counter mine descending and yours in this case yes but without that I see no reason to not follow and abide by the hadith of the Prophet sallallahu ariados"
