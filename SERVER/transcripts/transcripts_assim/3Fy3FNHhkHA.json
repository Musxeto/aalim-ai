  "transcript": "Sad man from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh while sitting for the last Tashahud, I sit on my left foot and my right foot is bent and after the Salam I sit on my legs crossed in a comfortable position and start doing my Aftar So Sheikh does that mean that I am still in my prayer and the angels are praying for me or do I have to sit in the position I usually sit while doing the Tashahud I have no idea what you're talking about I heard that in the Tashahud you sit on your left foot and bend your right foot which is not according to the Sunnah but it is permissible after concluding your prayer you change your posture and the way you sit there is no problem in that Inshallah and it's Halal without any problem"
