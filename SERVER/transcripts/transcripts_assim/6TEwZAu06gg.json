  "transcript": "he says the white days 13 14 15 abu huraira may allah be pleased with him said my Halil my dear close friend the prophet has a salaam instructed me to do three things I would never leave them till I die one to offer which here before I go to bed too too fast three days of every month three to pray to Erika's of Doha so too fast three days of every month in another hadith it was explained to be the 13th 14th and the 15th of every lunar month now this is a highly recommended sooner if someone fasts the 13th and the 14th and skips the 15th no problem he would he did not follow the Sunnah but he didn't do a sin so this is up to you this is up to your preference but if you want to have the package deal then you have to follow the Sunnah likewise if you pray twelve Rakas every day and night and this is referring to what the Sunan arawa tip to before fajar for before the  - after the - after Maghrib and Isha if someone maintains praying it Allah will build him a house in paradise but if he skips MRIB he doesn't create the sunnah of Muharram only the 10 records we see ok that's good today my sinful - no no there is no sin on you will I be getting the house there answers no because it's a package deal do this and you get that and Allah so John knows best"
