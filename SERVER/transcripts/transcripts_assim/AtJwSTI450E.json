  "title": "Trying to become practicing muslim but people, parents label me as extremist, wahabi Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "when we try to become practicing Muslims we want to follow the path of the salaf and we want to imitate the Prophet Muhammad in his Sunnah and whenever we try to do this our parents and people in our environments call us different labels like extremists wahhabis terrorists how can we deal with this and how can we advise them well welcome to the club when the prophet Allah came with his message what did his people say liar sorcerer magician poet priest insane all of these were labels given to the prophet did it stop him from continuing his dawah never did it deter him did it slow him down never this is our fuel when people clap to us and say oh she has them you are okay masha'allah when the Jews the Christians the Buddhists the Hindus says oh mashallah it's very intelligent very good mashallah his words are very nice I raised flags and I look in the mirror and say what wrong am I doing because Allah stated in the Quran foreign the Jews and the Christians will never be pleased with you until you follow their ways I remember I think seven years ago came to Amsterdam and I saw a clip where he was giving a lecture to the Muslims but it was an open lecture and then came this woman Cafe woman insisting to sit with him on the same table to shake hands with him and forcing her way on the Muslims and the Sheikh was very diplomatic he says he did not look at her he said right he's level best now what did she want she wanted to break the Muslims she wanted to break him so do you think if he shook hands with her she would be happy and go her way no unless you do exactly what they want such as unless you take off your Islamic dress if you're a Muslim take off your hijab expose your body if you're a man mix with them drink with them eat pork and never mention anything about Islam or Allah or the Quran they hate Quran they hate anything that has to do with Islam and what killed them most the issue of shaking hands and this kills me seriously because they want to force us accept their ways and I always you know I'm rude I'm I'm an old arrogant Saudi Sheikh again what can you do Sumi you can't people you will usually say no you discriminate women and you you look down upon them why don't you shake hands with women duh why would I shake hands with women because this is human you have to treat them like humans he said he's shaking hands treating them like humans says yes what about if I want to kiss her on the cheek because this is human to know what about if I like to touch her body in certain areas just to make sure that she's human this is inappropriate this is disgusting is it in your culture it's disgusting maybe in my culture is okay no no no no would you have to shake hands this is the the least you can do this is the least I can do in your understanding not in mind if I were to tell you if you want me to shake hands with you wear a thunk and give me a lap dance this is outrageous how dare you speak like this that's she was doing that it just came why are you offended this is how we feel when you forge yourselves onto US if I am lactose intolerant and you give me a glass of milk and say drink it and I said sorry I'm lactose intolerant what would you do you would be considered and say oh I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry no problem or would you shove it down my throat of course not you will understand why because it's harmful for me medically and physically now if I tell you that shaking hands with the opposite gender is offensive and harmful for me on the day of judgment because it will throw me in hell why don't you accept this because you don't want to accept this your issue is not with touching my silky hands and feeling the warmth of my body your problem is with my religion your problem is with my conviction and this is why we have to stand our grounds family members relatives people calling us names so what the prophet was called names so everyone has a test and this is your test in Islam you could have been tested and people say yeah but this is very difficult share this test is very horrible I said how much would you grade it out of 100 they say oh it's really difficult the pressure we're getting it's like 90 percent hardship I said okay compare it to other tests would you like to have colon cancer or your ovarian or breast cancer with the chemotherapy radiation in the whole nine yards no wow who would like that if you were to be tested with that how much would you grade it he said oh that would be a hundred percent and what about your test with such people labeling you as a hobby or extremists oh no no that is way less it's 80 percent your parents are alive yes alhamdulillah what's your rating of losing one of them oh that's 110 I cannot bear the idea of losing my mom or my father okay what about your Calamity of being labeled so oh no that's 70 Maybe 65. we can go on and on and on mentioning different tests only to find that what you're suffering from what you're facing with the community with your relatives with loved ones your parents accusing me of being extremist is nothing let them bark let them say whatever they say am I pleasing Allah or not yes or no yes is Allah happy with what I'm doing is Allah pleased with what I'm doing definitely call us who cares"
