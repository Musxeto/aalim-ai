  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the US my question for today is \nso for brother young brothers that are trying to   get married especially in the U.S so of course \nthe best way to do it is to get married by the   shari'ah way but in America there is nothing to \nto enforce that like they would in U.S law but   if you do it in the U.S according to U.S law it's \nnot shari'ah out compliant but there's somebody   to enforce us like the police the government do \nyou suggest a young brother and America to do it   in the U.S way if if to if we do it that way \nshould we sign a prenup so let's say if something   happened and a divorce happens you know it's going \nto favor the woman she might take custody of the   kids uh also she she takes half your money so \ndo you suggest we do a prenup or we do with the   Shari'ah way but there's nothing enforcing it we \njust have to rely on the good of people and their   piety to keep on going I've you know that I do a \nlot of counseling sessions especially from U.S and   from Canada and and I see a lot of ugly divorce \ncases and my advice and and most likely if you   approach an Islamic Center for an Islamic Islamic \nmarriage they would refuse fearing that they would   uh have some problems with the government and \nwith the law for conducting a marriage without   having the Civil marriage papers conducted and I \nwould highly recommend that you do both of course   Sharia our marriage is inevitable you can't be \nmarried without it but even the Civil marriage   is good to protect the rights of people because so \nmany times a man marries a woman shari'ah way not   in a civil marriage and then he runs and she's \ntrying to get out of the marriage and all the   Islamic Center say sorry you can't prove that \nyou're married we don't have any papers we don't   have any authentication we don't have anything \nto prove that and the guy fled to his country   and the woman is banging old doors possible to try \nto get a divorce or a whole or whatever anything   so yes get married according to the U.S law and \nto the Sharia law and definitely 110 percent   get a prenup because without this document \nshe'll sue your whatever for half of your   property and the custody of the the kids and \na lot of hardship comes because of this kafir   man-made law so once you've got it documented \nbefore the marriage that this is what's going to   happen you're not entitled for any of my savings \nor my business or for the property that I own   and you guys managed to successfully separate \nyour finances she has her own bank account you   have your own bank account no joint account \nbaloney this is inshallah a win-win situation [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All foreign"
