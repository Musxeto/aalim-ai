  "transcript": "[Music] disorder patient which is just recovering for about I think from last year to this year and on medication so where do you Islam I mean where do Islam put this depressive disorder or mental illness uh in the case of because when you have this disorder right you're going to be always Fear The Hope is just small yes you have hope but it's too small where until like you don't eat you don't drink you don't go to outside you know you just keep yourself fit into the I mean just don't do anything basically you cannot do anything and in Science World they call this disorder or something to do with your hormones imbalance and everything so even though with Iman how do you overcome this even without medication itself how you overcome this fear thank you okay first of all in Islam we have seen and we have insane and there is nothing in between so people say oh I have mental disorder I had to do this I had to steal I had to no no you steal I will cut your hand end of story I was in a spit of Rage I killed someone you killed someone you were killed if his heirs demand blood you have to be killed so either you're insane and the state of insanity is defined by a person who does not know what he's doing so he doesn't know if it's morning or evening he doesn't recognize his parents he would walk nude and and take off his clothes he does it would touch fire he doesn't have any uh appreciation of consequences so this kind of a person is insane now depression is very common and it's not necessarily a mental illness Yani this is a state of mind that people go through normally but depending on their level of Iman it may resonate it may be a little bit longer than others so I give dawah to people they don't accept my dawah I feel depressed this is natural this depression would not cause me to sit back home not meeting people not wanting to work not no this is yeah a deficiency unfortunately most if not all psychiatrists who are not Muslim would refer you usually to opioid to drugs antidepressants uh Prozac the likes that would make you mellow make you dumb and this is bad this is why we want to go to a psychiatrist you have to select a Muslim practicing psychiatrist because he knows how to balance between Islam and science so do you recommend taking antidepressants I'm not a psychologist or psychiatrist I don't know this is not my field and it is not Halal for someone to speak in something that he doesn't have knowledge of but the vast majority of people who come to me in depression when they speak and you give them motivations and you boost their Iman through trusting Allah's whether good or bad and by making them know what his tawakul is and by opening see all what they need those with mental illness and eye-opener not drops you just talk to them if you let them and this is the psychiatrist's role okay you have five sessions pay up front please we don't take credit cards and uh okay you have half an hour okay tell me about your childhood and you lie on the couch he's drinking his cappuccino making drawings Mickey Mouse you know Donald Duck and Donald Trump and he's doing all these things and said okay thumbs up see you inshallah two days two days come and say okay were you abused when you were young so you start to speak okay five six sessions and you're just venting and when people ask you well I felt good yes it felt good because you spoke but this does not solve your problem and this is all over the world people tend to solve the symptoms not the illness someone comes to me I have a stomach ache I'm very in pain and have headaches take I don't know what you call Panadol Panadol Tylenol take two pills he comes after five minutes I feel good four hours later he comes back again take ongoing what am I doing I'm solving the symptoms not the real illness maybe the guy has cancer maybe the guy has a serious illness but I'm curing the symptoms this is wrong likewise when someone comes shares my wife doesn't wear the hijab should I beat her okay this is a symptom my son is not praying on time this is a symptom so what should I do cure the real illness what's the real illness not knowing Allah introduce Allah let them know Allah's beautiful names and attributes let them know the Quran draw them closer you solve the illness the symptoms will go everything goes in place so my advice to you is to start watching my series on YouTube it's free it's called the beautiful names I watch it every now and then because I forgot what I said it was four years ago this is my problem I make a lecture I give it two weeks later you ask me about it no I did this I forget this is part of being old but I watch it because it strengthens I'm the first one who benefited from the beautiful names of Allah When I Was preparing it I was in shock YOLO where was the science 40 years ago I would have been a different person because the more you learn about Allah things change your way of dealing with people change your tolerance to calamities and massage changes so do this and you will find great benefit inshallah all right I think we have time"
