  "transcript": "Ultima says what's the ruling on singling out Friday or Saturday for fasting the six days of show well and what about the missed fasts of Ramadan and other obligatory fasts the most authentic opinion is that the Prophet said that in salat wa salam do not specify friday by fasting in so hey I'm a Muslim the Prophet said do not specify the night of Friday with night prayer and do not specify the day of Friday with fasting and in the authentic hadith the Prophet comes home meets one of his wives finds her fasting and that was on a Friday he asks her did you fast yesterday that is Thursday she said no do you intend to fast tomorrow which is a Saturday she said no he says break her fast now the Prophet Allison did not ask her why are you fasting when he said do not single out Friday with fasting he did not make an exception it's a general rule however the scholars came and said there is no difference of opinion that if the fasting is obligatory you can single out Friday what do you mean by obligatory either your fasting a missed day of Ramadan is obligatory or your fasting a vow I make a vow if a lock yours my child I will fast one day and I find certain a Friday no problem because it is not intended as a Friday it is intended to fulfill your vow thirdly if you fast expirations someone who swears not to do something changes his mind financially he cannot feed ten people or or clothe them so he fasts three days singles one of these three days on a Friday or Saturday no problem with that now some scar Kaskade did this a little bit further and they said that if someone fasts a Friday alone not because it's a holiday or it's a noble day or it is a day of great value to the Muslims rather because this is his only day off or because it coincides with Arafah or with Ashura all with this or with that in this case it becomes okay likewise they said that the six days of Shawwal fall under this category so some scholars say that this is permissible if you want to fast the six days of Shawwal which are voluntary and you single one day of these six days on a Friday alone not fasting Thursdays nor Saturday afterwards they said that this is Halla I personally believe that it is safer for you not to do this so you should fast a day before it or a day after it rather than singling it out and a lot so gel knows best"
