  "transcript": "says what's the ruling on suicide bombing and we've gone through this before and we said that the opinion of sheikh abdul aziz that suicide bombing is prohibited why the person who died while executing this mission who killed him the enemy no the enemy did not shoot him one single bullet who killed him um he killed himself what is this called in islam it's called suicide and what did allah say about those who kill themselves in the quran and what did the prophet say in sahih muslim about a person who throws himself from a mountain or drinks poison or stabs himself that he will be doing this till the day of judgment in hell fire so this is what allah says in the quran about those who kill themselves and this is what the prophet said assam about those who killed themselves but he killed himself in order to kill 10 20 50 100 of the enemies so this is justifiable no it's not justifiable if they shoot him then he's a martyr insha allah if he throws himself in the middle of a hundred men and start to fight them and killing as many as they he cans until and he can until they kill him he's a martyr inshallah but to go and drive a car or to wear a vest and when you are and this is the most in most cases among civilians in a pizzeria or in a grocery shop or in a cafe civilians non-combatants and you push the button and the bomb goes off who killed you i killed myself then you committed suicide you're not a shaheed and you are in hell inshallah"
