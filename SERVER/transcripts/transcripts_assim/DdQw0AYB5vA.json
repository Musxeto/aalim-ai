  "transcript": "Muhammad from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu May Allah grant you Afiyah Ameen and you as well In Sunan Abu Dawood 560 Hadith I read that whoever performs prayer in the jungle is probably 50 times more better than the person who prays alone So in my city there is a mini forest area, could say a couple of acres, and they have a forestry institute there So if I were to happen to pray there, the condition of the Hadith apply to me JazakAllah Khair Wa Jazakum I don't know the authenticity of this Hadith Brother Muhammad But to claim that the prayer in the jungle is 50 times better than the prayer in the Masjid Or alone? Did you say the Masjid or alone? Alone Alone? Yes I have no idea of any such Hadith, whether it's authentic or not Again, please send me this Hadith on my website so that I can check it out Because without knowing the authenticity, we cannot speak about it logically If it's authentic, we have to see what the scholars commented and said about it If it's not authentic, Alhamdulillah, Khalas We have no problem in that, and Allah knows best"
