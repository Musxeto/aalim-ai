  "transcript": "[Music] uh the question is clear the hadith of the prophet he who prays with the imam until he concludes his prayer quote unquote night prayer allah would reward him as if he had prayed the whole night meaning from isha till fajr so ahmad allah is asking a man prays isha with the imam in congregation then goes home and leads his family in prayer for tarawih this is permissible there's no problem in that there is no sin in that this is totally permissible because this is a voluntary prayer and there's no problem in that however will he be getting the same reward which is as if he prayed the whole night the answer is no this reward is only allocated for those who pray with the imam until he praises with her and finishes it you"
