  "transcript": "Finally, Alba says, what is the Islamic ruling on women vlogging their lifestyle on YouTube? Is it permissible or not? Now, when women involve themselves in vlogging on YouTube, the least they would have their voices showing and heard. And this is not permissible, if not, it's not recommended. Because there are those with weakness and illness in their hearts, and we don't want to tempt them by any means. However, the vast majority of such vlogs would continue the woman in her house, or on her vacation, or on her shopping spree. And she would show her children, her lifestyle, her cars, her house, and be present. And this is not permissible. Women must not be filmed, because this defies the purpose of hijab. Why did Allah Azza Wa Jal force them to wear hijab, if they can come on TV and show in their vlogs and speak about their lifestyle? Despite the fact that many so-called influencers among the women, and I'm talking about Muslim women, I'm not talking about disbelievers, I'm talking about Muslim women, unfortunately they appear in vlogs that are so indecent and inappropriate for a Muslim woman to appear in. They expose their bodies, they talk about their lavish lifestyle, breaking those who can't afford this, breaking their hearts, attaining evil eye. How many people have damaged themselves and their families by portraying how they live and how their children are, without knowing that people are inflicting them with evil eye? Whoa, look at her son, look at her daughter, how beautiful, how handsome, how attractive, how smart, and boom, it's done. And the child is suffering from illnesses, doctors don't know what the treatment for it is. So why put yourself in such positions? Why boast and show off things that would cause you more harm than good? The answer is easy, so that we become famous, we become influencers, we can gain money from the ads. And I've talked about this before, about da'is, about students of knowledge, who are following this line of showing everything they are doing. Look at me, I'm at the beach, look at me, I'm at the mountain top, look at me, I'm in my Umrah, Alhamdulillah, Allah blessed me with my Umrah, I'm in Manhaj, I'm doing this, I'm visiting so and so. This is inappropriate, why are you doing this? To gain followers, to gain momentum, to gain fame, I don't know. It is inappropriate, what's in your private life, keep it in your private life. What's beneficial for the Ummah, you can share that without a problem insha'Allah, and Allah knows best. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
