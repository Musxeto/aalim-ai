  "title": "Why did Muslims change their direction of prayer from Jerusalem to Makkah? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the prophet sallallaahu Honiara send them as in Mecca he used to face the direction of Jerusalem and when he went to Medina he continued facing the direction of Jerusalem and this was one of the points that the Jews liked and they used to brag by saying that Muhammad follows our lead religion and that is why he is facing our Qibla our direction for prayer and the Prophet did not like this on a salad restaurant he did not like imitating the Jews and the Christians because as you know we always pray in our daily prayers that Allah guides us to the straight path other than the path of those who are led astray the Jews and the Christians so for 16 continuous months in Medina the prophets Allah Salam faced Jerusalem and he did not like this but he was commanded by Allah and he was wishing and hoping that allah azzawajal would change the direction of prayer to Kaaba because it was the building that Abraham peace and blessing be upon him erected with his son Ishmael so so why did they pray toward the rocks are in the beginning because this was the direction this was the instruction of Allah remember that allah azza wajal made the five daily prayers obligatory in heavens when the Prophet SAW salem was uplifted to the heavens in the Israa and Miraj event and this was approximately three years before Hydra and this was as a sort of relief to the prophets of Salam after the death of two of his greatest supporters in Mecca the death of Abu Talib his uncle who unfortunately died as a non-muslim and the death of his beloved wife had and while it may Allah be pleased with her she is one of the greatest women in paradise as reported by the Prophet Alice awesome so going back to the the the the facing of Jerusalem sixteen months the Prophet used to look at the skies as if he's wondering when the deliver the revelation would come to him and after waiting for so long there came the direction from allah azza wajal that you should face the qibla which is the Kaaba which is the holy house of allah it's the black Kubik shaped building in mecca in the holy city of Mecca in the Holy Mosque now in Medina falls between Mecca and Jerusalem so it's a hundred and eighty degrees shift instead of facing north now you're instructed to face south and the funny thing is that a lot of the non-muslims consider Muslims to be idol worshippers because they bow and prostrate to the camera to a bunch of stones and they say that we worship the Kaaba is this true no do we do not worship the Kaaba and just to clarify this issue our hot tub once may Allah be pleased with him came to the black stone and as you know Muslims go around the black stones the black stone well actually they go around the Kaaba seven times beginning from the black stone and ending with the with the same black stone and we kiss it if we were able to do so if we're not we just rub it if we're not able to do so we just point at it saying Allahu Akbar now Omar may Allah be pleased with him came to that black stone once along with his companions and he kissed that stone and he he said talking to that stone and he wanted his companions to hear that he said by Allah I swear that I know that you are just the stone that you do not bring me any good or benefit and you cannot prevent me from any harm you're just a stone and have I not seen the prophet sallallaahu alia seldom kiss you I would not have kissed you the only reason reason I'm doing this is because a prophet did so and the Kaaba is not our God because Bilal ignore Allah may Allah be pleased with him on the day of Fatima Kaka when the Muslims conquered Mecca and took hold of it he by the instructional prophet al-islam climbed up the Kaaba and called for that then and no one dares to climb over his god if it's a God so it Muslims didn't worship Kaaba but anywhere in the world it unites them so if you look at a person in the United States of America or on top of the Himalayas or in China or in the Middle East whenever they want to pray to Allah they face the Kaaba and Allah tells us in the Quran that the East and West are all for Allah so even if you don't know the direction of the cutter of the Qibla of the Kaaba just pray and Allah will accept your prayer so it's a form of unity for Muslims and it is also a form of obedience because it's Allah who ordered us to face the table and the cabin but didn't the Prophet SAW so long when they turn to the Qibla having knowing that 360 God's was still in there didn't he still feel like you know he should really be praying there until the car was empty of all its idols well he was not present there and even when he was present there the prophets of Allah Allah used to go and face the direction of the Qibla of the Kaaba though there were the idols surrounding it because he was praying to Allah and not to the idols and here we have to look at the intention the intention has a very important role first of all your hand are cuffed your hand are tight you cannot do anything else you have to pray and because they have done these wrong things this does not prevent you from praying for example one of the Companions of the Prophet alisov Salaam once came to the prophet and said o prophet of Allah I have took a vow of myself I made another that I would slaughter a camel in an area close to Medina called Bou Anna and this hadith was reported by a man Muslim in the sight so the Prophet asked him two questions salah salem is there any celebration for the non-muslims he said no is there an idol that people slaughter for he said no so the Prophet told him fulfill your oath or fulfill your vows you do this so the intention is extremely important and the prophet alayhi salatu salam himself had this objective in mind and that is why the minute he conquered Mecca the first thing he ordered was to demolish and destroy these idols and in Islam we are very very sensitive to associating any with Allah Almighty it is with it nullifies Islam to associate anyone with Allah as erosion to the extent that we cannot even associate people with Allah verbally so I cannot say whatever Allah and you wish because and means that you and Allah are equal in wishing noon so if you tell me can you stay for lunch I said well whatever Allah and you wish no this is considered to be associating others with Allah we're very sensitive in unifying Allah Almighty and in worshipping him alone"
