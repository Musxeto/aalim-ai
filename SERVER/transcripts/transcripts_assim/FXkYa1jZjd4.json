  "transcript": "perfect with no flaws at all a way of life a way of life a way of life a way of life Islam is a way of life we praise Allah and we ask Allah to exalt the mention and Grant peace to the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam brothers and sisters we were discussing in our last episode matters pertaining to marriage and we called it a Hot Topic and it is a Hot Topic and it deserves a lot of elaboration in the second attempt inshallah to address more issues we had started dealing with some of the benefits of marriage and remember brother awesome you mentioned that there are many many that the sky is the limit so perhaps you can uh continue addressing some of these benefits which will encourage us all to get married again encourages you to marry again I wanted to retract that statement that there was no reason to get married those who are unmarried okay because no see again Manning again for a man is recommended providing that the conditions are fulfilled it is not as people think of marriage and this is our problem a lot of the men think of marriage as an easy right forgetting that it is a great deal of responsibility to the extent that it deters a real true practicing Muslim from getting married these responsibilities it is not something that oh how many wives you've got three masha'allah you're the man I have four it's not a macho thing on the contrary it's ridiculous for a man to brag about it but the benefit of marriage as a whole are so many the prophet Allah told us that the world is transient comfort and the best of these transient Comforts is a righteous and Pious woman so imagine if one of us were still to be asked about the best thing for him in this world what would he say most of us a car a house a vacation the Bahamas the prophet is telling us all in all in this world the best is a righteous and practicing spouse how is that this is Hadith because the time you spend in your home is the majority of your time and if you have a reason to stay home and to live a paradise in your home then you've got it made even if you're a janitor even if you're working in a low class job if you have a righteous and Pious wife actually You've Got It Made in your house and this only those who are married to righteous and practicing and why do I say righteous and practicing because you may marry someone who is righteous mashallah she prays night prayer she passed Mondays and Thursdays but she's not practicing because she's making your life hell that four of the women were complete were perfect among them was Khadijah why because she never ever Force the prophet action to work and she never nagged in the house or gave him something to disturb him in the house and that is why when jibril came to the house of the Prophet Islam once and said Khadijah is coming with food in her hands so greet her and read her salaam from Allah and give her the Glad Tidings of a house in Paradise as big as a pearl in it there is no tired son and there is no trouble or noise scholar said okay why these two characteristics of the house why didn't he say that it's air conditioned or it had rivers or it had cold drinks or whatever why these two they answered by saying that because this is the environment she gave to the prophet and that thus she is rewarded accordingly in the house the prophet did not need to do any kind of work not only that he it was his comfort zone but he did work he did he got engaged in in fixing his own yeah this is by himself and this is in Medina right when he married Aisha and she said whenever he went into the house he used to saw his or Stitch his his stove he used to fix his sandals he used to milk his sheep Khadijah if she saw him do this of his own will she would not let him she would do everything and she would not let the children raise their voices or jump here and there she everything was nice and comfortable for him that is why a righteous Aunt practicing wife makes a difference on the opposite side a good righteous and practicing husband makes the life of a woman extremely beautiful and the opposite is correct so it's not only as a one-way Road they say it takes two to tango Islamic Tango no music of course and between the man and his wife but you have to reciprocate there's another reason I'd like to add to that because martial law are you of course you painted a martial an idyllic picture of Khadijah and uh it may Allah be pleased with her and the prophet sallallahu a lot of people will say well if my husband was like the prophet I'd be like that um I think there's another thing I'd like to add the benefits of marrying a righteous spouse though one of the amazing benefits is connected to the Ayah that mentions that you are a garment you know you're any best for them this you know how the the scholars talked about what what does the government do you know it adorns and it protects you know from the harmful effects of the sun and the elements but I think the whole dimension one of the very important things of a righteous a truly righteous person they will enjoy in the right and forbid the wrong so they will not allow the husband a righteous woman will not allow her husband to do something wrong if she sees him doing something wrong she said to him or my husband why are you watching the television with those naked women yeah this is Haram how am I going to stand as your wife in front of Allah on the day of judgment I am not going to let you and she will do it in the nice way in a good way but she will not allow her husband to do something that is wrong and the husband will not allow his wife to do something that is wrong and this is I mean with the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam you won't find Khadijah having to correct him you know but with with us we have too many mistakes yeah and this is a very beautiful thing when you know usually one of us has the fault of the other doesn't and the other has the vote that the other doesn't so if you have this approach of supporting one another to be good this is the beautiful benefit of having a righteous husband another righteous wife so I think that's just what I wanted to add to what you were saying inshallah one of the benefits as well I think this is backed up by um clear two verses in the Quran mentioned oh you who believe protect yourselves and your families from Hellfire so this goes both ways man and why there must be some clarification because see we heard two things now at one point we said appearance the importance of appearance choosing the one that that actually is pleasing to you her appearance pleases you and some of the scholars do make that a part of the you know something you take into consideration so that you don't marry someone who whom you're not attracted to and then we mention the substance okay but let's say that the lady it does not look attractive in the eyes of that man that particular husband does that mean that she just worries about the substance and therefore ignores or appears or does she have to apply and utilize the means that Allah made available that are lawful to beautify herself no this doesn't mean that okay so she does she has of course she has to look up herself okay and in the same way I think we mentioned previously that IBN Abbas used to beautify himself Adorn himself for his wife so it is both sides so she takes care of herself the way she she looks takes shower all this is love women they know these things it is not that woman has to do it or the man has to look presentable because but the the most important thing is the substance and the the Iman and the the heart of that partner give you one example the brother called me from the UK a few years ago he's proposing he went and he saw the sister and then he called me back and he said you know it didn't work uh I don't want her she's not that uh attractive so I started talking to him I said no no go again and try to see her again alhamdulillah to make it short they got married they said you're right okay the real Beauty it's not the looks they have children and children could it be that we I mean that's something that we will be taking a break shortly and but I just want to give that introduction so we can think about what uh could be said uh could it be that part of the reason why there's lack of Harmony between the husband and wife is because the husband has taken the role of a dictator and Mr serious guy and he he's like applying to his management skills and his you know administrative skills at home because some husbands are so serious even when it comes to the way they deal with their children and their wives and it really creates this this this environment where people are stressed out and maybe we can discuss uh how a man is supposed to behave at home and how he could be Mr Nice Guy and how there's leeway to be you know funny and crack some jokes and stuff like that inshallah maybe you'll deal with that after the break will be back shortly brothers and sisters in Islam welcome back so we were speaking about the husband who needs to Mellow down a little bit and be flexible and make life enjoyable at home with his wife and kids who would like to shed some light on this serious serious phenomena in the Muslim homes well I believe that we have a problem and I also believe that we have a section to discuss the qualities of required in a spouse but the issue that you've mentioned that there are people who think and act as if they are in their companies when they are in their houses and speaking their children and their spouses as if they are subordinates do this do that never give a smile never give a good comment not only that some of them are so rude they break the hearts of their wives like tens of times a day for example I come in the middle of the day with like six or seven bags of groceries everything that the house needs with a grumpy face and my wife meets me and says Masha Allah may Allah bless you uh my dear husband may Allah reward you and give you a lot of money for what you're spending on us beautiful comments beautiful supplications that would make any normal person happy unfortunately there are men who would say yeah I did this last week you guys eat like what is this yes yes and and you know how much is that yeah and you know how much this cost me they're like 300 pounds until when I'm gonna do this I work hard and you guys just eat eat can I interject why did you say pounds we always picking on the British in this particular series but anyway yeah but I don't I don't like to say dollars let's assume let's be realistic as well okay there's that lovely wife who's saying all these things okay let's assume that the wife he comes home and he's he's been shopping for two hours and he went out of his way and then he comes home says what you didn't bring the ketchup again that's the realistic scenario and then she she you know she Nails him and she gives him a lecture and so then how is the husband what do you advise the lady and how is the husband supposed to react this is a total different bowl game because now we have to talk about things that that reduces the tension and increases the love and ignites the spark or the flame or whatever but if you want to go there it's going to be messy it's going to be bloody because everyone only holds to what his rights are and never seems to look at what his responsibilities are brother Salim was speaking before the break about the the man that called in from the UK and he did not like what he saw in his future spouse so he wanted to call it off if he called me I would have told him to go and look in the mirror see we always ask for things we are unable to provide I ask for Miss Universe in my future spouse thinking that I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger so I'm not I'm not the one to show up for what I'm asking for and and this is a problem love to your brother would you loved you yourself yeah so I believe that this we have to devote more time and so we were dealing with spending spending you see I mean what is the role of the husband at home is is it an obligation I'm to spend is it is it a subhaka that he's you know giving to his family members talking about the blessings of marriage those who are married would say spending is not one of the blessings so this would also come when we talk about the rights of the wife which is spending but if you allow me to go back to the issues related to Blessings of marriage spending is a virtue but we look at it as a burden it tells us Allah that even the morsel you put in your wife's mouth Allah will consider this to be a charity putting emotion in her mouth she'll bite my fingers off and why should I do this she has her own hands it and the guy is so negative that he is rejecting the whole concept of having affection and mercy so we have a problem with the people in understanding what marriage is but spending has to be in halal means what do you mean you can buy food for your wife which is good you can take your your children to good schools this is good but if you spend your money to provide for them something that is Haram this is bad if you get them a decoder an OSN decoder so that they can watch uh movies I've never heard of it I think it's orbit your time Network okay this is Haram what you see is something not related to Islam fortunately 95 of the houses in the Muslim World they have this and then there's um then there's extravagance in spending as well so when you spend money you don't have or you buy unnecessary things or maybe I mean even simple things like buying a lot of unhealthy food you bring home what chips and cookies yeah not vegetables no fruit no you're killing your family actually yeah you're killing me now you have a responsibility you know to yeah but also sometimes shaytan comes sometimes he's elected he's there he comes to the practicing Brothers maybe and in countries like in Europe where they the tendency is that you own a house and I think in the UK this is exactly sure this is the problem and you know I heard it from so many people I'm wasting my money on rent I'm wait this is their words exactly I am wasting my money on rent why can't I just take a mortgage then I own the house so you're not wasting your money on rent every penny you spend in rent is and you never lose you have to put the Hadith together as well you'll never lose from sadata this is the thing that that and I think this is the problem people don't understand that we need to be reminded constantly the viewers need to be reminded that when you spend on your family this is sadakha you don't lose because of sadakhi you're going to get rewarded in this Dunya yeah on your family the one that you spent in your family you will have more reward it will have more rewards so so you need to purifying your knee so that your all your Deeds can become righteous Deeds so whatever you spend in your family say oh Allah I do this okay so accept it from me I try my best to feed them halal when you are even doing your shopping huh your wife gives you a long list very long list okay and you go and you are moving from one shelf to the other okay buying the divers buying this the sanitary Towers all this stuff okay so you are while you are doing this you should have your knee I am doing it Allah because this is my duty okay okay so you will be blessed you will be rewarded for that subhanallah so this is the beauty in Islam Beauty in Islam that everything you do becomes active worship everything so all your life is but many of us they don't have this in mind yes they do the shopping they do this they spend but they don't have this this seeking Allah's pleasure they don't have that in mind if you have this in mind all your days will become only this everything you do becomes a better president it's just a very small point I wanted to add to that which is not specific to marriage but a general point about uh about our connection with Allah just it's the point that Muslims should be thinking people in other words we should always be thinking about why am I doing what I am doing constantly checking our knee because actually that near itself is part of what connects us with Allah am I doing this for Allah or not am I doing this for the right reason or not and so you're right you shouldn't just be casually shopping think about what you're doing think about the blessings think about the Baraka make sure you are doing this for the sake of Allah so I just think generally this something we should be doing insha online so I wanted to pick up from that also if you allow me go ahead sir um when you brought up the issue of mortgage I've been married for almost 28 years and I married my wife in the previous Century so alhamdulillah we're that old I always tease her like this and alhamdulillah anyhow whenever I think about it and up to today I'm paying rent yes and when I go up and I travel you know I get these questions of mortgage mortgage mortgages river is Haram it's a major sin so you want to build your house on a major sin the prophet tells us that one dirham of riba is far greater than 36 fornications yes which illustrates the gravity of this sin so a lot of the the brothers that I met think that it is okay think that it is a means of necessity it's like having to eat dead meat or so and it's not as long as alhamdulillah you have money and you're paying rent he said yeah but I'm wasting it it's not waste it's a Sabbath first of all second of all it is the alternative the only choice you have because the other alternative is not Halal it's mortgage and it keeps on Rising and going down so if it's it's not only a hundred thousand Euros so that you won't be angry it's not only a hundred thousand Euros fixed you've got to pay over the duration of 20 years it may end up 120 140. all of this is forbidden and it's River we've covered a few points but I believe there are more but the time for the episode is about to end in fact it's ending right now so inshallah in the next episode we will pick up from where we left off oh"
