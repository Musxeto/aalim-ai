  "transcript": "and we begin today in our 56th episode from the book of islamic we begin a chapter that deals with inheritance and inheritance is a very special and important branch of islamic sciences of due to the fact that it is so important that allah azzawajal took upon himself to explain and to divide the shares of the heirs when a deceased dies because if it were left to humans they would have divided it according to their own whims and desires and this is something that would not be at all productive or positive for humanity and this is why allah took upon himself to divide the inheritance and the inheritance this is an important branch of science because not a lot of people know it and those who know it don't know all the ins and outs of it because it needs someone who's bright to understand this beautiful science so al-fara comes from the root word faraday which means to assign or to obligate and al-fard is something that is mandatory and and obligate uh an obligation and this fart would be assigned to its recipient and the inheritance means the rightful share due to an heir on the death of a relative and when you first go to the science you will find that there are a number of subtitles that are very important such as the causes of inheritance the things that block inheritance the conditions of inheritance the pillars of inheritance all of these things a student of knowledge must be acquainted with so that when he studies this beautiful science he at least has a good idea now i won't say that we will cover it thoroughly in our classes but i will insha allah give you an idea about it so that it would be clear to you how it should be done and how when to pursue this beautiful science you will have the ability to understand it so i'll just give you an introduction with this introduction you can read any book of inheritance and you will have a clear idea what you are going through and reading so what are the pillars of inheritance there are three pillars one the one who is leaving the money or the wealth behind which is known in arabic as a definitely the deceased and the one who is the heir who's inheriting and he's referred to as and the money itself the wealth the property that is to be inherited these are the three pillars now what are the causes what makes a person an heir what are the causes of inheritance how how can we know that this person inherits or not there are three types or three reasons for a person to inherit one is marriage so this is related to what to the spouses once a marriage contract is conducted if a man dies his wife inherits him if she dies he inherits her and when we say one of the causes or or reasons of inheritance is marriage this does not refer to living together or consummating the marriage so even if only the marriage contract was conducted and it was authentic and accepted and valid that's it they become husband and wife and they would inherit example a man proposed to a woman her guardian said i give you my daughter in marriage he said i accept her marriage and there are two male witnesses muslims present so now there's they are man and wife the man travels straight to the country he works in and after a year or two he's supposed to come and consummate the marriage but sadly his plane crashes and he dies so the woman was never ever alone with her husband yet she inherits him and she is obliged to stay the period of which is four months and ten days so this is what is meant by marriage the simple marriage contract once conducted khalas they are man and wife and they inherit one another the second cause of um inheritance the second cause of a person becoming an heir is by blood relations which is referred to as kinship which can also be referred to in arabic as an and this refers to a person's parents which we refer to as usual so your father mother grandfather grandmother no matter how high they go they are considered your usual not the big dao organization center that we follow which you see behind me on the banner which has magnificent material for you all to make dawah and to help you how to make dawah and it's all free of charge not a penny from your side all that you have to do is just click and visit their website and also the islamic net and the hundreds of different platforms of dawa in different languages printed material videos this is not the usual i'm referring to in my class today usual means your lineage going up father grandfather great great grandfather and so on so these have a right in your wealth after you die and then we have and for the offspring no matter how low they go well maybe law is not the appropriate word no matter how down they descend so you have your sons daughters grandsons and daughters great great grandsons and daughters and so on then we have what is known as el hawashi those who are not up and no are not down but on the same level and the they are referred to as uncles cousins siblings above all so your siblings are from the hawashi they are related to you the closest to you after your parents and your children and so on the third type of the causes are what makes an heir in the book they are referring to and unfortunately they are they are referring to in one aspect which is disputed upon and the vast majority of scholars say that it is not um uh correct and they do not uphold this to be a relationship so what is meant by in islamic the prophet said and this is narrated or reported in a sahih when aisha allah be pleased with her once met bharira and barrera was a slave woman and she came to aisha asking for charity for help because she wants to buy herself out from her masters and this is a legitimate way of freeing a slave when a slave goes to his master and says that i want my freedom how much would you accept in money in order for you to set me free he says i like a thousand dollars but you have to bring the thousand dollars within a year so the slave goes and works earns and then brings a thousand dollars to his master and his master sets him free so barirah went to mother is with her and sought her assistance so aisha said listen i'll buy all of you i will not give you an assistance i'll buy all of you here's the money but go check with your master first so she went to her masters and they said yes no problem we accept but your allegiance should be to us so she went back told mother aisha mother aisha about their condition and the prophet was outraged he was angered by that and he said to her give her the money and let them set her free and the allegiance would be yours because any condition that goes against the book of allah is invalid even if it were a hundred conditions so from this hadith and the prophet said from this hadith the prophet said allegiance is to the one who sets the slave free now what do you mean by allegiance it means that after i set my slave free i am related to my slave in a way as if he is from my kinship because he doesn't have parents he doesn't have brothers and friends etc so if he were to die i would inherit him now he's a free man but who freed him i did so i have the allegiance of his in his life and also after his death this is the the verdict of the majority of scholars of phil that the slave that i free if he does not have a uh of offspring he doesn't have children he doesn't have a family he's like an orphan who we do not know who he belongs to in this case once he dies i inherit him because there is a bond of allegiance now in our book it seems that they have overlooked this fact and only mentioned the hanafi point of view which is if two men were to meet and one of them was a childish not a child dish child he doesn't have a child and he where he doesn't have anyone to inherit so i come to you and say listen you are my brother there is this uh allegiance between us you are my weddi and i'm your wedding whenever one of us dies the other inherits him as if we are siblings as if we are kinships and this is applicable only in the hanafi school of thought the vast majority of scholars say that this is not applicable this is not something you can donate or give or exchange with another this is something that is mandated by the quran in a sunnah either marriage or kinship or through the allegiance that comes after freeing a slave now again and again and again people would say slavery we have a problem with slavery how come islam supports slavery we've said this a gazillion times islam rules over all including our emotions including our logic is there slavery in islam the answer is yes of course it's mentioned in the quran it's mentioned in the sunnah oh islam is a racist religion sheikh why because it promotes slavery who said it promotes slavery you just said it's in the quran i said it is in the quran and in the sunnah to tell us how to deal with the issue of slaves but not that islam promotes it when islam came 15 centuries ago did the jews support slavery did the christians support slavery did the byzantians the romans the persians all nations on earth supported slavery so was islam against the norm so you have to be realistic and fair okay now we understood your point of view 15 centuries ago that was the norm no problem but what about today ahi look at the roots of the problem look at the roots of the issue and then we can go and discuss things logically 15 centuries ago it was chaos i meet you while traveling i put a rope around your neck under gunpoint take your wealth and sell you as a slave of mine i have children i'm unable to feed them i sell them as slaves i have a debt i cannot pay it off the loan sharks come and take my children and maybe take my siblings and maybe take me for slaves so slavery had no boundaries it is the survival of the fittest you're the strongest you enslave others and we can look at the recent 300 400 years ago in the uk and in europe how they used to live how the lords owned the land and the people that work on it that was slavery in islam islam came and islam when it came it hit the ground running so the first rulings were all types of slavery are prohibited except one channel and there is prisoners of war and war is inevitable this is how people exist and what this is what we see around us show me one country that does not wage war against others nowadays in the west or in the east everybody's attacking everybody else relying on their whims and desires relying on their hidden agenda relying on their strategies and their greed islam doesn't have this islam only legitimizes war if it's defensive you're attacking me i'm going to attack you i'm going to defend myself or in progressive jihad when the islam is flourishing and people are blocking it from reaching its people this is when we give them the choice of islam or paying the taxation or facing war so what do we do when war takes place we have prisoners of wars what to do with them the easiest thing is to execute them all to kill them deprive them of their lives why because we don't have jails we don't have sufficient prisons we don't have guantanamo bay yeah but killing them is is not this why would you kill women and children and innocent men who did not fight you this is unfair what to do well this is the only source of slavery in islam you give this person this individual to a muslim family and they take him or her in as a member of the family but to serve as a slave and the vast majority of them would accept islam anybody force them no but the moment they're exposed to true islam they accept islam so the only means of slavery is prisoners of war but there are tens of means that islam encourages the muslims to free the slaves they have how is that possible i'll tell you one the prophet said allah whoever frees a male slave allah will free with each organ of that slave and organ of his from hell fire whoa so if i free a man i'll be freed from hell fire that's plenty that's a good bargain for me two the prophet said that islam whoever frees two women would free him in exchange so if i free two slave women my whole body is freed from hell fire okay excellent what else expiations what do you mean if i say wallahi tomorrow i'm not gonna come to your house and eat biryani and then i heard that the biryani mother cooks is one of the best in that in town so i have to expiate my oath in order to go and eat what's the expiation to feed 10 people poor people clothe them or free a slave i mean okay slave is this easiest go ahead you're free expiation of killing someone by mistake i was driving i dozed off i hit a man who was crossing the street or who was on the pavement he died i have to expiate how to expiate free a slave this is in the quran remember few lessons ago we spoke about vihar when a man says to his wife you are prohibited to me as my mother's back or my sister's back meaning you are prohibited to have intercourse with like it's prohibited for me to have it with my wife with my mom or with my sis so now he wants to go back what does he do he does he does sorry expiation by what first one you have to free a slave then what a man has intercourse during the day time of ramadan what a sinful act he broke his fasting what to do first thing free a slave and we can go on and on so islam encourages us to free slaves and once they are freed there is this bond between us i wouldn't leave him die of poverty his allegiances to me so i take him in he's a free man she's a free woman yet i take the men we are related to one another now having said all of that these are the three types of conditions or the causes that is these are the three causes for inheritance marriage kinship and through freeing a slave now are there any restrictions well before we go to the restrictions maybe one would ask are there any conditions for inheriting i said yeah of course can i just inherit from nowhere or out of thin air no definitely not there are conditions the first condition is that we are certain of the death of the person who we will inherit what do you mean certain see i cannot inherit my father until he dies and this is a very important condition a lot of the folks nowadays send me questions saying chef my father has property and he has wealth and he wants to distribute our wealth nowadays he wants to distribute his in his wealth as inheritance how how is that he's not dead yet so he cannot distribute his wealth as inheritance he can distribute it as a gift and i get sons and daughters complaining that their fathers are not giving them from their inheritance and i ask them what inheritance do you mean they say from my father's wealth i'm demanding that he gives me 10 this is my share now not after his death and he's refusing he said subhanallah the audacity that some of the children may reach because of their being undutiful disobedient and disrespectful to their parents so definitely this is totally bogus and wrong first condition that we have to know that the person is deceased and dead before we can proceed with distributing the inheritance how can we be certain either by seeing him he's dead he's a corpse i've buried him or the testimony of two male muslim witnesses yeah we've buried so and so or by the widespread knowledge among everybody so you ask anyone did president so and so die is he dead is king so-and-so dead and everybody knows yes he's dead and probably rotten so this is condition number one condition number two is we are certain of the life of the air when the deceased died what do you mean sir see the pillars are to have a deceased to have an heir and to have the wealth so now the condition of a person inheriting this deceased we have to be certain that he was alive and this clarifies the misconception that grandchildren have sheikh my grandfather died and he had four sons one of them was my father but my father died 10 years ago so now my uncles the three sons of the deceased who's my grandfather are not willing to give us my father's share i said yes this is correct your father has no share in the inheritance why sheikh he was the son of my grandfather true but the conditions of inheritance number two states that we have to be certain of the life of the air when the deceased died because if the air died before the deceased he has no right he's not there so your grandfather was alive and your father was dead so your grandfather inherited his son once he dies his son is not any longer alive hence he cannot be an heir hence he cannot inherit and that is why you his children cannot inherit your grandfather because there is your uncles blocking you and this is known as hajj and we will come to mention that later inshallah so condition one condition two the third condition is to know the reason of inheritance so yes abdullah died we're certain of that ali is alive okay we have two conditions now now the third condition is important in relating to abdullah um i'm afraid they're not related so what do you mean well abdullah is from a different family and ali is from a different family so how would you want them to inherit one another they are neither married alhamdulillah they are not kinship to one another and there is no wallah between them so they cannot inherit the causes of inheritance are not there so this third condition is important to know whether he's legible to inherit or not they may be cousins but not always cousins inherit one another maybe there are people blocking this cousin from inheriting his cousin and so on so these are in a nutshell things that would expand your horizons increase your knowledge i i'm certain that now you have a greater understanding okay now we know the causes we know um the conditions and we know um the things that are pillars in inheritance what about the things that block the inheritance this is our final issue there are three things that block inheritance what do you mean block i mean that if one of these things is present you cannot inherit you cannot inh inherit your father your wife your whatever because of the presence of such a condition so what are these uh things that block us from inheriting number one murder what do you mean if i murdered my wife i cannot inherit her and this is the consensus of all scholars anyone who kills a person cannot inherit him if he is to inherit so if i kill my father i cannot inherit my father even if my father is a multi-billionaire i cannot inherit a single dime if i kill my son the same thing if i kill my uh any buddy who's related to me okay but we have murder which is intentional to kill and we have mistakes such as i was driving the car and my son was with me or my father and i was doing everything according to to the book but it so happened that i made a mistake i dozed off i had a flat tire and i was like 10 kilometers above speed limit i could not control the car the car rolled over my father my son died i've briefed for so long i didn't intend to kill them it never crossed my mind i would never even dream of it they are my loved ones so okay we know that you did not intentionally kill them so it's not murder it's killing by mistake however the vast majority of scholars say that you are still a murderer because the prophet allah said in an authentic hadith a murderer takes nothing of the estate he doesn't inherit however this is an issue of dispute so some said the hadith is clear a murderer and this man is a murderer others said yeah a murderer who intends to kill but this person did not have it even in his wildest dreams this was unintentional it's a mistake that's why we do not ask or demand for beheading him because it was a mistake so it's a long dispute but the most authentic opinion is that this person inherits like any other air except from the blood money what do you mean cher due to the fact that i i dozed a bit and caused the car to roll over and my son or my father died because of this then i am obliged to give blood money which is the value of a hundred camels to the heirs of the deceased i'm one of the heirs but i am excluded from the blood money because this is a penalty and i cannot be involved in it so it's given to my mom my siblings my this and that who are legitimate heirs i don't take anything of it but everything else i am like the other heirs so i do inherit my father's estate i do inherit my father's wealth property etc but not the blood money that i had given as an expiation as a deer for killing him by mistake the second blockage comes from slavery and in slavery a slave does not possess does not have his own wealth and we spoke about that before in one of the classes so if i see a slave writing his um e63 amg gts and wearing a beautiful rolex and has a nice um versace suit and i'm interested so i go to his master and say how much would you sell me your slave and he said i'll sell it i'll sell him for you for ten thousand dollars wow you're on here's the money when i go in to collect the slave i don't see the suit i don't see the rolex and i don't see the fancy car so i go to the master and say where is the belongings of the slave he said the slave doesn't own anything in islam this is not fair this is what i bought you bought the slave i'll take you to court let's go they go to the muslim judge and the muslim judge says yes he's a slave he does not possess anything so if the slave dies and he has a free father or a free son who's not enslaved yet they cannot inherit him because all what belonged to him or all what he had actually belongs to the master so this is the second reason for blocking the inheritance likewise if the slave's father who's a rich man dies this slave's son cannot inherit his father because whatever he inherits would go directly to his master and this is not the case and not permissible finally the third reason for blocking inheritance is the difference of religion the prophet said a muslim does not inherit from a disbeliever nor does a disbeliever inherit from a muslim and this happens a lot with reverts so a sister says my father is a multi-billionaire and he's a christian and he is on his dying bed and i'm a revert would i inherit him after he dies i would say are you married hahaha no seriously would i or she inherit him the answer is no the hadith is crystal clear likewise a brother comes to me says sheikh i'm a very rich man i'm a muslim i'm a revert my son is still a christian or a hindu so if i die can i can he inherit me and i says no what about spouses my wife is christian if i die would she inherit me the answer is no and likewise if she dies i would not inherit her so this is a crystal clear issue having said that it is permissible to write a will so if your christian father writes in his will that i allocate one third of my wealth to my muslim daughter or to my muslim son there's no problem in that likewise if a muslim father dies leaving behind a will saying that one-third or one-quarter of my wealth goes to my christian son or a hindu daughter there is no problem in that because writing a will is like a gift it has nothing to do with inheritance inheritance has to do with the bond that is between you and the one inheriting you and this bond has to have islam in it it cannot be among those who are not muslims and allah azzawajal knows best i think we will take a break here and we will look at the questions as usual so we have a question from question number 61 he says you talked about the pause after al-fatiha that it is baseless but what about this hadith the hadith is narrated by qatada by hasan by samura and he said i think something like that he says narrated by samurai i remember from the prophet alaihis two periods of silence or two pauses of silence saeed said we asked patada what are those two periods of silences he said one when he began his prayer and won when he finished the recitation then added when he finished reciting the closing verse of the fatiha not of those with him and then brother zed zubair says this was graded as ba'if by sheikh al-bani in sunan abid 780 in the book the book of hadith etc so if this hadith was graded as baif as not authentic by sheikh al-bani then there's no point mentioning it is mentioned that the prophet are salatu had only two pauses in salat the first pause is after the first inauguration of takbir he would pause for a while then he receives the fatiha the second pause was after finishing the recitation not read rather the surah afterwards after finishing it before going to takbir and rukur so even mentions that the first pause is for the inaugurational dua dua what do you do when you pause before the fatiha and the prophet said i thought or i was hoping that no one would ask me about this except i say allah so this is the first pause we have no problem with that the first part the second pause is that after reading the surah he takes his breath and this was a pause so he would go [Music] online [Music] takes his breath [Music] but never ever reported that between and the surah afterwards there was a pause sufficient and enough for people to recite the fatiha as we see in al haram as we see so many uh of the imams do this is not part of the whoa this seems to be the last question i i did not prepare for that i thought that i had uh many more so let me go back to um yeah i think brother hamdi had sent us something on the 2nd of july yeah so karim says what if woman is about 60 and he she has no period does she need to wait three months as ed as well the answer is if the ida is from divorce yes if she does not have menses if she's in her monopoles uh period and she doesn't have menstruation her iddah is three months as mentioned in surah as we has have explained but if she is a widow then her edda after her husband dies is for months and 10 days david brook says i have a question to make but it is about another topic so my question is what are the major steps according to you those we can follow them for big coming spreaders of islam i mean even if i know if i now study physics so what are the steps and by what we have to start the prophet said in an authentic hadith relay from me even one verse of the quran and he said may allah azzawajal make the face of a person who hears what i say from hadith and takes it and gives it to other people to learn from it for there is a possibility that those whom he's informing them about the hadith might be wiser and more comprehensive to it than the one who reported it to them so it is a false statement to say that only those who have a degree can give dawah or to speak about islam this is a false and blatant lie you're studying physics good for you it's not at all difficult to speak to a christian about the oneness of allah azzawajal and again you can get all the information from where you get the material you need to speak to an atheist to a christian in their language how to logic them you don't need to be a rocket scientist to tell someone who's a muslim who's a sinner that drinking wine is haram intoxicants are haram in islam and this is the verse in the quran i don't have to be a scholar to do this but when it comes to little issues such as whether to place my hand on the chest or under my navel maybe you need to have more knowledge and this is not an issue of importance that would cause me to go out of my way to address it with a brother who may not be willing to listen to me so you have to first of all try your level best to make dawah to call people according to the knowledge you have each one of us has a pay grade there are certain topics that are definitely not mildly in my league so i would say i don't know this is too high for me but when someone tells me what is the ruling on listening to music sheikh what's the ruling on skipping salat i have knowledge in this i can give dawah likewise you maybe someone comes to you and says why is gold prohibited for men and not for women i said i don't know and there's nothing wrong with saying i don't know but if he tells you okay is working in a bar permissible or not you definitely know the answer is no because selling it manufacturing it carrying it whatever is totally prohibited and this is the hadith of the prophet sam so you don't need a lot of knowledge to spread the word of islam but you need to have the correct info without transgressing and saying or talking in things that you don't have knowledge in rasheed says i heard sometime before missile marriage what is it and is it can you please explain on this well this is a long topic rashid mission marriage is a contemporary name given to a marriage where the wife wavers and gives up some of her rights as a wife she is entitled to a home an appropriate home allowance food electricity expense expenditures for living daily livings for clothes and if i'm married to another woman she's entitled this is her right to have equal nights dividing the time equally this is a normal marriage if a woman decides to waiver to let go to pardon to cancel some or all of her rights this is up to her and she has the cha the the choice to do that or to reverse it the evidence is in the hadith of when a woman fears that her husband may rebel against her or abandon her then there's no harm in reconciling between them and reconciliation is good some scholars said that this was revealed due to the fact that mother saud bent with her and she is the prophet's second wife we know after khadijah had died hakeem may allah be pleased with her went to the prophet allah saw someone said to him why don't you get married so the prophet said who do you have in mind she said an old woman and a young woman as for the old woman seldevin zema who was married to his cousin and her husband died after both of them migrated to abyssinia while they were living there they heard false news or as he says fake news and they heard that quraish has accepted islam and now it's a muslim country so they came back only to found that that to find that this was only a hoax and not true so her husband died and she was alone her father was a kafir her brother was a kafir she was the only muslim so the prophet has some proposed and married her she was his age she was in her 50s when the prophet married her alice also so after 10 years or so after migrating to medina after being with the prophet hassam and then the prophet married so many other women like ayesha zainab um etc she feared that the prophet salaam might see her as an old woman and he may divorce her the prophet would never ever do such a thing ali salsa but this is her own feeling so she came to the prophet isaiah and said oh prophet of allah don't divorce me i know i don't want anything from this dunya i want to be resurrected on the day of judgment as one of your wives so i give my night because you love her most and this is smart of soda if she were to give her night to the prophet salaam he would be compelled to be equal and fair to all of his wives so one week here and one week here and one week here the night of saudi but now by her giving her night to aisha this meant that the prophet would go two nights to aisha and one night to all the others then two nights again to aisha and one night to all the others so she gave up her right in dividing the days and the nights as a wife from this the the scholar said that missy marriage is the same thing and usually it has a noble cause a woman who's a doctor and she works during the day and stays with her sick mother or sick father who do not have anyone else to take care of them so she's getting old she has her own natural needs and she cannot fulfill that by getting married to a normal person while being her parents nurse entei and and caregiver so she finds that the best solution to stay away from haram is to marry someone who would not be forced to open a house or to spend and inject money she's rich she doesn't want his money she wants his presence once or twice a week and he doesn't have to spend the night if they just have lunch together and have good time for a few hours and then he goes back to his wife and children she's more than happy with this it is totally permissible and halal insha allah azzawajal because this is the way of win-win situation providing that the man is not someone who is just playing around wiggling his tail like a bad dog no the man is unable to get married again financially but he needs to get married or he knows that if he gets married that his wife would take the children and demand divorce and he needs a second wife so this is allah but it is not something that is general to all so you take it and say oh says let's go and look for a girl for a couple of months and divorce her and then get married again and for a couple of months no this is haram this is to be judged case by case scenario and allah azzawajal knows best and with this we come to the end of today's lesson until we meet next thursday will be"
