  "transcript": "what a cartoon um so a relative of mine got this shirt for me five years ago from the UK it's a gray shirt with the British flag on the front with the name of a rock band The Beatles on the bottom so Sheikh my question to you is would it be permissible for any Muslim to wear a shirt with a cop or fly on it regardless of whether or not that copper flag has any crosses on it would it also be permissible for a Muslim to wear a shirt with the name of a rock band on it as well I hope you have a good one shake just off left heading first of all wearing the flag of a kaffir country is inappropriate is it something that invalidates your Islam no it's not the flag of Japan or of uh um whatever country is a Flac it has no symbols I don't have to dig in and say no this represents the Sun and they worship the Son and the emperor the son of the the Sun Etc this is not Yani something that has any value but is it appropriate for a Muslim to show his Allegiance or being proud of such a flag of course not a Muslim has his own identity and his identity is Islam but when it comes to a flag that has a cross and we know that this cross is representing Christianity this is not permissible and one has to put a a tape on it or a cloth dye to change it so that it is not there as for the rock band The Beatles maybe they're referring to the Volkswagen car I don't know if they're representing a a musical band or the name of a cafe celebrity Etc again this is inappropriate but I wouldn't say it mounts to kufur or takes a person out of the fold of Islam it can be sinful because people would look into it and probably think that let me listen to their songs or who are The Beatles they don't know who they are and they would like to uh investigate and that would make the person wearing it sinful for assisting them to do that Allah knows best I mean from the"
