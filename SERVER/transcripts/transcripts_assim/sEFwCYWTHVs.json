  "title": "Per Your Request: The Full Upload Q&A || Ask Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "so the first question is uh if my parents get a dinner initation and I don't know the family but I know my parents friend Circle 99% of them usually backbite can I disobey them and not go for the dinner a lot of the youth ask these hypothetical questions and when you ask such a question it's not an isolated Halal Haram yes or no you are asking about a lifestyle with your parents who provide for you whom you live under their roof who you anticipate that will'll send you to college and you have to know how to lick their boots in a way because they're providing for you but when you come and say sh my my parents want me to go with them to a gathering and 99% there will be bike biting free mixing can I say no so I said okay say no because you can't participate in Haram so the guys go and confront their parents as if they have conquered Al and and freed it no I will not go with you this is Haram free mixing what will you do I'll sit home and what Netflix did this what was this the Sheikh told you to do no but I asked the she one plus 1 equals 2 and he said two alhamdulillah there is diplomacy there is wisdom there is kindness and dutiful and being obedient so many of the youngsters are Professionals in diverting and repelling their parents away from Islam your parents hate Islam because of you and you're the reason because you don't have the diplomacy yeah you know how much it means to your father that you go with him yes there might be Haram don't sit when it's Haram so I don't go she no no go but show your father that you're going for his sake and to honor him in front of his Rel and friends when there is Haram take yourself out go to another room go outside do anything put your iPods try your level best to have a win-win yes you're not allowed to sit where there is backbiting or free mixing but improvise don't make it a clash it's not either black or white they're always can be a room for innovation in a Halal way not Innovation and Innovation to make things softer your father would appreciate though he knows where you're coming from because you came and honored him and you show him that I'm coming just to honor you my father and Allah knows best the next question is if I listen to the Quran instead of reading it will I get the same reward and will it count as not abandoning the Quran this is an of dispute but with the majority of Scholars say that reading the Quran is more rewarding than listening to it why number one this was what the prophet used to do most of the time rarely he used to ask people to recite the Quran to him as per the Hadith of Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him he said the prophet came to me and said read the Quran so I said how can I read the Quran and it to you it was revealed he says I like to listen to it from someone else so he read until chapter 4 until he reached Ayah number 40 and then he said and the prophet was weeping but this is rare the majority of that he was the one reading the Quran and offering night prayer and and and the likes so listen listening to the Quran no doubt it's rewarding but is it more uh attentative to than reading it no when you read you combine all your senses looking and contemplating and watching visually but listening is rewarding and inshallah those who listen to it are rewarded for it but definitely not as much as reading it and Allah knows best the next question is can meah be in forms of other than many money like property or education the scholars say that Mahar can be of anything that has a value so in the Hadith the prophet when a man wanted to marry a woman who displayed herself to the prophet Alam she offered herself to the Prophet The Prophet had no interest in her and she was standing there and the prophet was looking elsewhere he did not show any interest so a man stood up and said oh prophet of Allah if you don't have any interest in her give her to me in marriage so the prophet ask him what do you have any money the guy was Stone broke so the prophet said even even if you get a ring of iron yeah what what is iron nothing not silver iron said Allah there's nothing I have nothing so the prophet said do you memorize the Quran said yes I memorize Surah so and so and so so he said I give her to you so that you make her memorize these suras of the Quran as a wage as a Mah and they got because of this so anything that has value can be a form of Mahar we always appreciate something that is tangible because it so happens that years later maybe there is a difference of opinion or they can't live together and they have to divorce the woman asks for the man says okay give me back my Mah so they come to the judge what was your Mahar she says a trip to Haj okay did you go no or she says yes I went so how much this is a problem we don't have the value so many times they divorce and the woman says he did not give me my Mahar the judge says true he says yes it's true okay give her her Mahar what is your Mahar I said a trip to Hajj from where from Los Angeles long way okay how much the guy says the approximate cost is $9,000 the woman says no it's $25,000 why I was first class and staying in the Clock Tower or and she's going for five star package and he's going for no package so which one they start to dispute but when it's written Haj Journey costs 7,000 there is a dispute there is a divorce he has to pay the $7,000 this is why we say it has to be tangible and fixed so that they would not become a issue of dispute in in the future and Allah knows best the next question is I've had a difficult marriage in the past 10 years and now I have decided to get separated my dad agreed initially but as I'm not independent at the moment he wants me to either get independent or back to go back to my husband I used to work earlier and gave every single penny to my dad and now I have no savings or Investments I'm actively looking for a job but my dad keeps on abusing me is it okay for me to leave my house and my father do what if you don't want to go to your husband and if you don't have a job and if you don't want to say in in your husband in your in Father's House excuse me what are you going to do work as a prostitute any where be logical either you stay in your husband's house tolerate his abuse and be a decent wife or trash him and ditch him and force yourself upon your father without working and and tolerate his abuse but to go and live live elsewhere where with what income and who would take you in this is not logical some women are impulsive they take decisions they shoot and then they ask questions and they say oh what should I do now you ask ask before you make such a decision so that you know what your options are and this is why it is important to insult Elders people of wisdom in your family people of experience and to make before making any decision not the opposite so you have a choice stay with your husband I can't in this case file for divorce without the approval and the help of your father and once you're divorced force yourself upon your father he will not kick you out of the house and if he does then you've done your duty diligence because if you stay with your husband without fulfilling his rights the Angels curse you every day until F this is a lot of sins so either you stay with him try to convince yourself of fulfilling his rights and asking Allah Asel for yours or file for divorce and bear your father's abuse and Allah knows rest the next question is please can you detail some important points on upbringing of adolescent daughters please do what adolescent daughters do what bringing them can you just raising some points no not interested I have 13 daughters but I'm not I have not done anything to them it's their mothers that did all the work all the dirty work I just provide put food on the table put a roof on their heads and tell them what's right and what's wrong and advise them when they seek advice I am an awful father alhamdulillah so no this requires a lecture okay the next question is my family members believe that TZ or the amulet is giving them protection against Gins they tie it around their waist and keep it under their pillow can you please explain if this is shik and what are the consequences wearing amulets or they call it telman I think or or uh the likes this is either minor shik or major shik it is minor shik when you believe that if I wear this on my head Allah will protect me now why is it minor sh because Allah did not make this means of cure or protection and this is why she explains the remedies and the healing process in Islam he says number one remedies and healing through the Quran number one doing Rya from the Quran or doing what Allah mentioned in the Quran using honey or using what the prophet Salli wasallam directed us to black seat cupping um and the likes these are healing processes mentioned in the Quran and Sunnah this is number two healing process through medication known through experiment and science so you have an infection this infection is cured with the grace of Allah through antibodies produced by this medicine you have headache you take Tylenol aspirin Panadol whatever it relieves it in six you have fever you take this it would scientists doctors experiment says all good number three something that is used as healing but neither the Quran or Sunnah proves of it nor the science scientists say it is good such as Lots in in the '90s people used to wear a copper bracelet and it looks nice you know oh that's cool H sophisticated what is this oh this is for joint pain romantism I have back pain when I wear this mashallah it's gone H interesting Quran Sunnah not mentioned I don't know okay sheh says I don't know it's not in the Sunnah go to the scientists go to Cleveland Clinic Mayo Clinic go to John Hopkins do Harvard huh doctors what do you think oh this is bogus this is nonsense it has no power no nothing this is shik minor shik because you believe that Allah would heal you through something that is not proven neither by Quran Sunnah nor by science if you believe that this by itself is a cure or a protection it has nothing to do with Allah by itself it cures you or protects you this is Major sh takes you out of the fold of Islam most people who wear think this because they know when they open the they see Tim taes and crosses and crescents and weird symbols and it's not Quran it's not Sunnah it's nothing and they know that Sorcerers wrote this but they say I have to wear it I can't sleep without it I will not be able to eat without it it will uh uh leave dire consequences if I drive without it I will die because of an accident this is shik that takes a person out of Islam the next question is what is the ruling on homeopathic medicine because I'm confused on whether it is halal or not some homeopathic doctors even claim that allopathic medicines contain alcohol and other impure substances can you please advise herbal medicine has been used since the beginning of time we believe in herbal medicine which is experimental it's from nature and scientists and doctors and generally speaking say it's good now homopathic hop what is it homeopathic homopathic I usually call it medicine that is greatly found in the subcontinent they use a lot of alcohol in it some of it is 70% 80% alcohol and of course when you have alcohol in such substances how will you feel oh great very good so definitely it's going to work this is by default but it is not permissible to use medication that contains alcohol openly like this because it causes people to go intoxicated so if this kind of medicine does not have alcohol and it does not have Haram ingredients it's fine as long as it's experimented and it's natural and it does not have any negative side effects it's Hal whether it's coming from the Hindus or it's coming from the s or it's coming from XY Z no problem we have no problem in terms of the healing process if it is proven to be medically safe and correct and there's nothing Haram in it but if it has a huge or big amount of alcohol that would intoxicate you if consumed in large quantities no this is not permissible and Allah Knows Best the next question is my husband hits me when he forces me to do a household task immediately which I can do sometime later I feel humiliated by this and I cry is him hitting me Justified is he what is him hitting me Justified of course not he's a beast he's not a real man because he is beating a woman you think you're man enough come beat someone your size he would never dare beat another man Even smaller than his size because he knows he's going to get his backside whipped so the problem is the Prophet saidat The Best of You are those best to their wives and I am the best to his wives he mother AA said never laid the hand on a woman or a child and yeah be a real man for not doing home Shores you beat your wife what kind of a man are you seriously a man who beats a woman is's not a real man W and if she was not a decent wife she would have told her brothers and father and they will beat the hell out of you seriously then you would know now you know huh now you recognize but because she's a decent woman she's a afraid for her house for her marriage for her husband reputation for her children she's not doing this sometimes you have to put an end to it a psycho like this must not be tolerated yes if it's once every blue moon and he apologizes and he takes you to the Maldives to compensate for it yeah it's okay no problem I agree but if it's on monthly basis or weekly basis Allah you have to do something before he kills you or harms you or uh breaks a bone in you such a man is not a real man and Allah knows rest the next question is do Muslims and Christians worship the same God of course but their understanding of Allah is distorted because we believe in Allah we believe in Allah subhah waala who does not beget it is not begotten they believe that Allah has a son has a wife subhanahu waala and they attribute to him so many negative things but they believe he is the creator the provider the sustainer and any Christian Unfortunately they don't think they're blind followers they say Jesus Christ is the Son of God so okay when did he come to existence 2,000 BC how what are we 20 24 okay 20 24 years ago okay 20 25 years where was he huh where was Jesus 20 25 years ago um he wasn't oh so he came to existence 20 224 years ago before that he was not existing it cannot be a God that exists after not being existed so when someone says to you can God create another God yes or no no no this is a stupid question question it's not to be answered why because if I say no they would say ah God cannot create and if said yes he said okay then God can be created so damn if you do damn if you don't you do not entertain such impossible questions one of the criteria of being a God is that you are there you do not all of a sudden exist exist this is why Allah is the first without a beginning and the last without an end nothing was before Allah he was always there subhah wa tala and nothing with him so when you say that Jesus came to existence 2024 years ago he cannot be a god number one number two when they say that Jesus is God they said okay what did he create nothing no one on earth says there is a Creator other than Allah not even Fon could not say I create Nam could not say I create Nam said I give life and death how he brought two prisoners from the prison sentenced to death the first one he shot him between the eyes he said see I killed him the second one he said I said free see I gave him life this is this is the most he could do he said but okay anyone on Earth since Allah created this universe did anyone claim to be able to create not a single being only Allah but they don't see this they don't open their eyes to know that only God can create and if Jesus was God he could create he could not do anything s Al so yes we do worship the same God and this is why we follow the scriptures and they're called we can marry there women whether Jews or Christians we can eat whatever meat they slaughter and we can consider this to be Halal for us this is differentiating them from others and Allah knows best the next question is do we need to do forgetful frustration if we make any mistake in reciting any Dua during some Scholars say or the forgetfulness prostration can be done for any mistake you do even in Sunnah so even if you forgot to raise your hands y but this is not true the most authentic opinion is that forgetfulness prostration can be offered if you make a mistake in Pillars or in mandatory acts Sunan acts no you don't offer them mistakes in uh recitation of the Quran is as well not part of the things you make uh for and Allah knows best the next question is a musafir or traveler prayed behind behind a m IM but he joined at the last ra should he pray two or four ra when a traveler prays behind a resident Imam he must complete his prayer even if he attained the last ra only IB Abbas the cousin of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam may Allah be pleased with him was asked I Abbas why is it when a traveler prays behind a resident he completes he said this is the of the Prophet so he attributed this to the prophet Sunnah yes I'm supposed to pray two ra as a traveler if I came in the last ra of the IM and he's a resident he prayed three before me now he's in the fourth I join him in one he offers Salam I stand up logically I should pray the second no I my my second and offer Salam I'm a traveler no according Tob Abbas may Allah be pleased with him I have to continue three Ras to complete four rakas as my IM the resident and Allah knows best the next question is is it permissible to forecast and calculate interest payments on Excel for valuation purposes of a company if you are helping and assisting or bookkeeping this is not permissible if you're auditing this is not permissible but if you're just evaluating the value of a company and this is part of the evaluation how much it costs regardless of it's Halal or Haram what they're doing you're just evaluating inshallah this is permissible the next question is I have been performing Salah irregularly for many years like sometimes I would read only I would pray only M and ass and the rest I would not from the past few months I have been regular in my Salah and asking repentance from Allah what should I do about the Salah I have missed in the past years the prophet sallallah alai Al wasam said this is Hadith huh this is why always we try our level best to refer everything to Quran and Sunnah after that we stem the conclusion not the opposite people say Halal the evidence let me look let me look let me look and they try to find evidence supporting what they have just gave a ruling on uh she what's the ruling on smoking cigarettes Hal the okay if it's Haram we're burning it if it's Halal we're smoking it haha this is not a Del you can't do this you have to go the other way around what's the ruling on smoking cigarettes let me search read the Quran read the Sunnah H Allah says that and this is so the prophet would make things that are uh uh abhor and and this is one of it and this would kill you okay and this would kill you all doctors say that it kills you then it's and this is the data sheet so when we come what was the question uh can we repent for what we have not prayed okay so now he's saying about prayer that was missed prayers that were missed the prophet said whoever over sleeps on a Prayer or forgets it two reasons two causes sleep and forgetfulness he must pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no experation other than that meaning praying it as soon as you wake up or remember now scholar said hm experation but he overslept and the pen of accountability is uplifted from a person asleep until he wakes up so he's not sinful and forgetfulness H if a person forgets Allah forgives Muslim Allah says I've done so so Allah forgave us if we forget then why did the prophet said there is no experation this means that if you miss the prayer for any other than these two reasons sleeping or forgetfulness you cannot make them up these are the only two reasons as says and great number of Scholars say if you miss a prayer deliberately intentionally it's gone how imagine when do we go to Hajj when do we stand Ina on the 9th of the day of is on the 9th of if I come wearing my to perform Hajj and in the airport they say your Visa is not valid you have to come and they detain me for 4 days on the 13th of they set me for free I'm in myam I go TOA where am I going TOA I stand Ina alone the the police comes in you crazy everybody's in meca what are you doing he said W they detained me and they prevented me from standing in in araa but alhamdulillah I'm making it up now what do we say to him is his Haj valid why because the time is limited from this time and it expires this time another example someone has a flight and he's boarding the flight M time is due in 2 minutes in 2 minutes the sun sets so he said well on the flight I will not be able allahar he prays m is his prayer accepted if it's 1 minute Before Sunset 15 seconds before Sunset there is a beginning and an end likewise if you don't pray ass and the Sun is going down going down going down going down disappeared so I'm going to pray ass huh same thing beginning and end if you pray within good for you if you miss deliberately no sleeping no forgetfulness no valid reason it's gone forever till the day of judgment what should I do commit suicide you will go to hell forever ask Allah for forgiveness yeah do not despair from Allah's Mercy some people overthink oh Allah will kill me oh Allah will put me in Hell Allah will never accept anything I'm I'm this I've lost 10 kg in my counseling sessions I meet these people I'm afraid of this and I've lost 10 kg are you using OIC I'm using OIC I've lost a lot so why no no I'm afraid that Allah will do this what are you afraid of are you crazy what are Allah's beautiful names all these beautiful names of forgiveness of repentance of compassion all of this you forget and you just remember that Allah will throw me in hell this is negative thinking Which is far worse than your original sin thinking bad of Allah like this is much worse than drinking alcohol and drinking Haram stuff because you're thinking bad of Allah what do you think of Allah the lord of the world I think positive of him I think that he will forgive me I think he loves me that he guided me and I will do my level best to please him think this way all of your previous prayers and sins will be forgiven with the grace of Allah the next question is I believe I'm mature enough to get married at a young age I I did not a 16-year-old boy is asking the question yeah what's the question I believe I'm mature enough to get married at a young age but my parents and the girl parents don't agree we are going to go to college together so would it be better if we do nikah now and I start working soon so by the time I'm 19 or 20 I could support her and live with her if they don't approve of the marriage and you want to do nikah this shows you that you're not mature how can you marry someone whose Guardian whose father is not approving of your marriage you want to do love marriage or you want to do movie Marriage you run away get married in some other foreign country go to bahin maybe and get married there and come back what is this this is not Bollywood the prophet saidat there is no marriage valid without the consent and approval of the guardian in another Hadith any woman woman who marries without a guardian and her father her marriage is invalid her marriage is invalid her marriage is invalid so the qu the answer is maturity is by following Quran and Sunnah by knowing how to take the right decision and to make the right choice falling in love with this woman and willing to disobey Allah and to go against the Shar and to break the norms and to break Family Ties and to marry her against her father's will tarnish her reputation and her father's reputation is the biggest sign that you're not mature enough besides she's not the last woman on earth no no she I love her okay this is your maturity huh this is look at you look at the mirror have some shame in you be a man move on so no sh I love her you were going to weep now you're going to cry people get on my nerves and you what do you want me to do for these guys I get those every single day in counseling sessions and this is why I'm getting white by the day W they get on my nerves I start to shout and scream My Wife and Kids Come Baba what I'm not I'm counseling said no we can hear you from the end of the house I cannot not tolerate this it's too much people they're not using their heads their logic their Dean their religion Shan is playing with them like a football when children play with football wah so be a man be mature and work earn then propose to whomever you want inshallah and Allah will make things easy for you the next question is is it okay to accept dinner invitation from a non-muslim family the prophet am as in theith the was invited to a sheep that a Jewish woman invited him and his companions to come and eat from and he came and answered it this is a clear example that it is permissible now it is also permissible for us to invite them but what is the reason is it just to be friends and to be buddies and besties no my intention when I answer such invitations is to represent Islam to give dawa directly or indirectly likewise when I invite them to break the ice because they think oh this Muslim family is a terrorist they're going to blow us up no come to some sambusa some shba you know and eat together and and and try to show them what Islam is but not to be best friends and to hang out together and to invite their Christmas Eve turkey uh food and and and and wear Halloween costumes like I think it's soon Halloween and Trick and Treat and what is Halloween Devil's birthday huh Devil's birthday no no Halloween when is it 31st 31st alhamdulillah we can't someone anyhow so this is problem either you are so rigid that people hate Islam because of you or you're too soft and mashallah we besties I have a Christmas tree in my home and I will invite you to a turkey and Thanksgiving and no we're Muslims we're proud of who we are but when we invite or answer the invitation it's for the sake of Allah to give dawa and Allah knows best the next question is uh I'm a Bangladeshi student and planning to study in Bangladesh there I follow the veil properly but there are no educational institutions which have separate boys and girls can I study in an only girls institution with male teachers yes no problem as long as all the students are females and the teachers are male this is done I I teach male and female with Partition with proper hijab there's no free mixing the problem is when you have free mixing with the students sitting next to each other and and you know flirting or socializing and chitchatting this is problematic but when the teacher is a male teacher and just giving his material and the women are properly covered or some of them are properly covered you are definitely properly covered and you don't flirt or mix or socialize with the teacher there's no no problem in that in the next question is as for the Sunnah I have left my beard as it is and it is now three fish length but my whole family keeps on telling me to trim it as it is rough and doesn't look good what should I do don't look at what people say even if you keep it 1 mm long you will find people saying shave it every time I kiss you on the cheek it's perks what is nobody is going to be happy as long as you follow the Quran and the Sunnah you're fine a three fist mallah this is quite long as long as it is not hampering your life it's not threatening to your life keep it it's a form of Pride this is the sunah of the Prophet Alat wasam who had a big beard and this is not not an exaggeration the asked the companions may Allah be pleased with them when the prophet prayed and did he recite the Quran they said yes the said how did you know how do you know that he used to recite the Quran they said we used to see the trembling of his beard from behind his back we're standing at the back but we can see his beard how can you see his beard if it's not really wide and big in the description it used to fill his chest his beard so this is the way of the Prophet Alam yes sometimes people who have long beards that are maybe reaching their belly button and they work at machines and factories this is hazardous dangerous or sometimes it is a means of becoming nuisance every time you eat you find hair of your beard in your mouth it's it happens it's not something to make fun of no this is what happens sometimes if you're driving a scooter or a car and it comes in your face it becomes if it's no I'm not again making fun this is one of the beautiful sunnas of the Prophet Alat if it is endangering your livelihood yes you can I I feel that you can shorten it to the appropriate length that would not harm you now the opinion of a fist length is adopted by Omar may Allah be pleased with him when he used to make Haj interpreting the Ayah at the end ofah the Ayah is referred ing to how to end youram by either shaving your head or clipping your head no he understood it as shaving your head and clipping your beard so only in Haj he used to do this so even if we follow this which is not the most authentic opinion it's a fist length now most people do this it's a fist L from the bottom not from the top so they do it the other way around and this is not right this is not right so leave and so many people are so nosy and they poke their noses in where it should not be your beard is too long why don't you shorten it's not of your business why are you asking me these questions or interfering in my life this is my beard why are you so tired of me wearing it so yeah the prophet said it is a sign of a man's real good Islam that he leaves that is what is not of his business anything that's none of your business don't ask about it and Allah knows best the next question is what is my responsibility as an ordinary Muslim who has no influence in society at hard times like this when there is genocide against the Muslims will I be punished on the day of judgment and what can I do to ease the pain or just be a keyboard Warrior what are your options when you have a question the best way to solve problems is to examine and explore your options and put six or seven options on the table and then evaluate the brother gave one option which is keyboard Warrior and I used to call them keyboard knights with a K what are the keyboard Knights someone who hides behind the screen and starts slandering people and these are cowards these are traitors the ruler of this country is this they're being paid and they're all this and they're Jews and they're who are you Anonymous be brave and show us your face Reveal Your Name no i' I'd rather fight from behind the lines no this is cowardice and this is not from Islam we do not have many options because we're ordered to follow the Quran and the Sunnah and to obey our Muslim rulers so what we have in our possession is quite limited number one Dua now seriously seriously seriously those who always yeah excuse my French  and wine about what's genocides happening what amount of Dua do they do per day seriously a lot of the people I ask they said well we don't you should devote your night prayer if you fear Allah and feel sorry for your brothers and sisters to make Dua every single night before F raise your hands in your sujud but if you don't and all what you want is fighting and blowing up people no this is not Islam so Dua is number one priority and Allah will eventually make a way out for them the same genocides was in the 1989s you remember those most of you don't yeah only the old guys remember 1990s when Bosnia heroa was under attack by the serbs and gen this was real genocide she slaughtering and we made Dua day and night and Allah Asel satisfied us to see them Victorious and liberated and we anticipate the same to happen inshallah number two financial aid alhamdulillah here you're capable of donating and there are real sincere Muslims who will go an extra mile to deliver your donations to the needy and to those who are unprivileged so alhamdulillah Allah gave you some give number three make their plight alive on social media to the best of your ability send messages within the Islamic parameters don't send shots of Muslim men women children being named injured uh suffering this is not Halal how dare you send my picture when my guts are all out and I'm dying and you say oh look at what they're doing to our Muslim Sheikh this is not halan I have my respect I have my honor and dignity to be protected not just because they're being bombarded like this you make it easy to send these pictures no make their flight alive show the atrocities nowadays alhamdulillah there are so many people online some of them we do not approve of their Islamic way of refuting the zionists but they come they make fun of them they give facts they show that these are terrorists and these are uhuh occupiers and they are inhumane and they're famous on on the we they're intellectuals lawyers or comedians or but they make a good point so if it's Islamic if it's Halal spread the word make the whole world notice so that alhamdulillah we gain momentum and there are many many ways you can help but you have to be sincere and seek Allah's help and guidance and Allah will guide you the last two questions inshallah uh sh what is the ruling of giving aan to a newborn and shaving head on the seventh day is this part of the the most authentic opinion among Scholars is that there is not a Hadith that is authentic in the aan in the right ear of a newborn and death definitely the the in the left ear is totally fabricated I don't know about the two afterward if you do might as well pray let's get it over with so thean is not authentic if it's authentic why wouldn't we do it and the problem is that the Hadith is not authentic yet people justify oh Subhan Allah do you know why do we give aan to the ear of the new born huh enlighten me oh Einstein says because when he dies and we pray funeral prayer we don't give a done H that's very interesting what is this where do you get this nonsense from if the Hadith is authentic do it the vast majority of Scholars even those who say do it they say it's not authentic but it's the word of Allah do it no don't do it shaving the head of the newborn on the seventh day is authentic it's part of the Sunnah and to name him on the seventh day is also part of the Sunnah but you can do it before because the prophet did it on the 7th and in before and the circumcision can be done any day according to to the convenience and when it is appropriate and Allah knows best and also the it is Sunnah to be done on the seventh day but they're not interl she I shaved my son's hair on the 7th but I did not offer except after one year because I did not have money so now my child is one year old and I will Slaughter two sheep should I shave his head again why because no they're not interl these are different sunnas to be done alone and Allah knows best okay the last question I am 22 22 years old and the eldest and my family I have a lot of responsibilities including supporting my parents financially and physically I want to seek Islamic knowledge which I have been unable to do in my country as there is lot of misguidance around I also wanted to join Madina University but I could not because of my responsibilities please can you guide me how I can learn proper Islamic knowledge with the correct AKA how old is he 22 22 alhamdulillah as long as you are supporting your parents financially this is one of the greatest doors and Gates of jihad your father your mother have suffered a lot to make you reach where you are payback is very sweet alhamdulillah Allah has blessed you to be able to do that Islamic knowledge is not isolated or limited to Medina University or to Imam University or to University people think that oh there's no Islamic knowy except in Saudi alhamdulillah there are so many places where you can seek knowledge from nowadays alhamdulillah Allah has blessed us in zad Academy which we have online to do a diploma four semesters two years teaching Islamic Sciences both in Arabic or in English and with the grace of Allah it is so successful that we have hundreds of thousands of people benefiting from it the best part is it's free 100% it's online the best part is it's under the umbrella of islamqa donino so the founder of Islam q&a. info and zad Academy and the TV channel I always bring ask zad on is zad company and one of the best things about Z Academy is I teach there so of course this is a to some an advantage to some it's an a disadvantage but depends on how you look at it so alhamdulillah you can and if you study two years in that Academy this I guarantee you you will be having the preliminary Foundation to be a student of knowledge you from there can move on expand on your own with different schools and different sh because you have the right correct Foundation our problem is our knowledge is based on Tik Tok clips from here and there YouTube random shakes and we are confused Subhan Allah for 5 years I thought that the aan in the ear of the newborn is Sunnah because I've heard it from XYZ now shim told me it's not so many things are clashing because you don't have the right foundation with that Academy you'll have the right foundation to know how to pursue knowledge how to you go and fish for correc AA correct knowledge correct and learn without limiting it to what do you think of she so and so I don't speak ill about sh I don't sit

differentiate what is right and what is wrong and to pursue the correct way of knowledge and Allah knows best for this really really important reminder as well as answering all these questions to you
