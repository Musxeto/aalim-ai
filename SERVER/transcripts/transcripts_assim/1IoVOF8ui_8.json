  "transcript": "question what is the ruling on working as an accountant in a company that deals with River the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said may Allah curse the one who takes riba the banks and gives riba the debtor or the one who took the loan and writes down the river the clerk or the accountant and the two witnesses who testify they don't earn they are all the same in the curse of Allah this shows you that this is one of the major sins in Islam and it's not something to be taken lightly so an accountant who registers these loans and the interests and he calls the bank where is our interest we have a hundred thousand dollars in your account and you did not uh deposit the interest on the loan or we borrowed 400 000 from you and we gave you the interest of last month why are you asking for another one so he's the one who is facilitating and registering definitely it is Haram for him to work in such a position and job and the income is also Haram and Allah Knows Best"
