  "title": "Why are Muslim Countries not United against Israel? - Dr Zakir Naik",
  "transcript": "question posed by is Basham is from Kashmir why Muslim countries not unite against Israel that's a very good question but that question should not be posed to me it should be posed to the leaders of the country if you heard my talk on the 15o action plan for the Muslim umah in relation to to Palestine and my last two points I mentioned that if all the Muslim countries unite and if they stand unitedly then inshallah no non-muslim will try and interfere with us and how the non-muslims have a NATO North Atlantic Alliance North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO where there are about 30 31 countries are member and according to their treaty if anyone attacks any one of the 31 country it is as though you have attacked all the 31 countries so if all the Muslim majority countries all the 57 countries they gathered together and they unite and if they made metto Muslim Alliance T organization or Muslim country T organization metto Muslim country Tre organization and if you have the same rule that if you attack any one of the 57 country it is as though you have attacked all the country then we'll not have the problem what we having today regarding the genocide that Israel is doing in Palestine you're asking me this is the solution I give so we should ask the rulers of the Muslim countries why are they not uniting and we have to realize that I'm aware that the non-muslims have got lot of arms and ammunition they have got nuclear power they have got wealth they have got they have got the military but we failed to realize that we have Allah with us and Allah with us is more important than all the power that they have but unfortunately Muslims are weak and this remind me of the Hadith of prophet wasallam that there'll be a time when Muslim will be attacked so the one of the sahabas they'll look down upon they'll be ill treated so the sahabas asked that will the Muslim be less in numbers the prophet said no they will be in large numbers but they'll be like fro fro large number but useless they'll not be United Allah says in the Quran in Imran chapter 3 verse 103 hold strong to the Rope of Allah and we not divided so my solution that to have this problem what is having see anything imagine if if Israel was alone and if Muslim Palestinian alone fighting them inshallah they would have won them lock St in battle even though they are very weak they are less equipped but if it's a war own only between Israel and Palestine I'm sure that the Muslims even if they're less equipped even if they have lesser Army lesser equipment yet according to me they will win them lock talk and battle but you have the huge superpowers in the world America supporting them you have UK supporting them and what are the Muslim countries doing nothing it's a shame on us that imagine all the superpowers are gathering together and they attacking a Muslim country who gave Refuge to the Jews inviting them to stay and now they're kicking them out of the house and these people who are terrorist are now calling the Muslim Palestinian are terrorist and what are we doing nothing so we Muslims should unite and there are Alliance you can do and profited Alliance if you want to do Alliance surely the Muslim countries get together and do alliance with Russia or with China if Muslim countries join hand with Russia and China and then make an alliance I'm sure no of none of these non-muslim countries like like USA like UK like France they have history UK has a history and France and Germany they have a history that they ruled about two3 of the world they came and they ruled India they came and they ruled Malaysia many countries in the world World they have habit of interfering with other people and they say we are doing it for the benefit what we should do we should join hands make alliance with countes like Russia like country like China and have an alliance Allah has given us the Black Gold we have control of the petrol so if the Muslim countries get together and we know the major oil producing country is the Muslim the major export of the oil is Muslim and oil is required even for Weaponry even for fighting if all the Muslim countries get together Allah has given us resources palm oil 90% of the palm oil is with Indonesia and Malaysia 60% Indonesia 30% Malaysia so all theour Allah has given us if we have Alliance of the Muslim countries for trade for business for military like if they have the interpool international police we should have the Islam Pole Islamic police why should we be dependent on them so if we collaborate and join hands together not to bully others they are doing it to bully others they go and kill tens of thousands of Muslims in Afghanistan in Iraq now in Palestine what are we doing if we join hands together and unite on the basis of Quran and Allah says in Surah Imran CH 3: 103 that hold all the Muslims hold strongly to the of Allah and be not divided hold strongly to the Quran and sayth so inshallah I feel this is the only solution of course there are Hadith and predictions of the Prophet that before the end of the world Muslims inshallah will rule the world there will a Time come even irrespective whether the Muslims follow or not there'll be a time towards the end of the world before the end of the world the signs are coming there are minor signs and major sign most of the minor signs have already come few are remaining but before the end of the world according to say had the Muslims will rule the world for seven years for seven years there'll be peace and prosperity in the full world where Muslims will rule the world as for the Quran and Sunnah and later on a sweet wind will come all the Muslim will be will will be put to death very peacefully and then the signs of will start so we pray to Allah subhana ta'ala we don't know whether will be alive during that time or not but at least we have to now support our Muslim brothers and sisters in Palestine and we see that what's happening the genocide that the Israelis are doing and the so-called human right Champions whether it be USA whether it be UK whether it be France whether it be Germany these so-called human rights Champion they are doing a genocide they are doing the same thing what was done on them but but inshallah Allah subhana taala is with us whether some of the Muslims join us or not inshallah inshallah a time will come that Allah subhana give us Victory and we as individuals should strictly follow the Quran and Sunnah if we don't have the ability see to it that we are prepared to follow the instructions given by Allah and hiso in the Quran and sayth so that we get the best in this world and hope the answer the question"
