  "transcript": "she I saw on the internet that if a woman during mation makes the in intention not to perform Salah because if she does it it would be um as a sin then she receives a reward from this is it permissible or not again please if a woman prays while in her menses uh like I saw on the internet that if a woman during mination makes the intention not to perform Salah because if she does it it would be as a sin then she receives a reward from this is it permissible no this is not permissible she is refraining because her prayer is invalid if she prays she's sinful so she's not praying because it's Haram it's defying Shar to pray while in the state of mensis so I don't have to go to that extent which is I'm intending not to pray so that I am rewarded rather I just stop praying because Allah told me not to pray as simple as that but to go to the extreme of making intentions and then breaking your intention and this confuses people my intention is I don't pray because Allah ordered me not to pray full stop and you will be rewarded for that"
