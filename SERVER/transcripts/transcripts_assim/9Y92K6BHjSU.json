  "transcript": "Nazreen from Bangladesh. I'm experiencing a new kind of liquid discharge which I can't recognize. My question is very long because I need to provide proper details. I can't, we cannot Nazreen, we cannot entertain long questions. So just give me what is your question. If I need details I'll ask you. Sheikh, I have, generally I have two types of regular discharge outside period. Wide or off-white normal discharge, nothing accompanied with feet, which is a norm from my puberty. I do not, I do not understand a word of what you said. Sheikh, outside period I generally... I don't understand what you said. Use proper English if you please because you're talking too fast and I don't understand what you're saying. Okay Sheikh, I'm trying to make you understand. Sheikh, I experience two types of regular discharge outside period. Nowadays, I used to have wide or off-white normal discharge, nothing accompanied with feet, which is a norm from my puberty. But nowadays, I am also experiencing normal discharge accompanied with some liquid water-like discharge, which is new and happening for more than five months and increasing day by day. Sheikh, the liquid discharge leaves an ashy to blackish brownish stain around the normal wide or off-white discharge on cloth. The stain is not mixed with the normal discharge. It is around the normal discharge and what I have found that on... I sometimes keep cotton inside for hours to get rid of the stain on cloth and once I have found that on white cotton there is no stain, although I got stain of the liquid discharge on my cloth before inserting cotton and after removing it on the same day. But it may also happen that I haven't experienced the liquid discharge on the cotton then as I have... Nazreen, Nazreen, Nazreen, these issues cannot be resolved on live TV, let alone between a man and a woman. First of all, I'll give you the general directions and you have to check with the womenfolk of your family, the elders, and ask them. The normal vaginal discharges have no colour. If there is colour, as you were describing black or dark colours, you have to check with your doctor and ask her to do some lab tests and see if there are any infections or not. If she says that these are regular things, there is no infection, such colour discharges would be treated as an istihadah, which means that every time the adhan is called, you are, if you want to pray, obliged to clean yourself, change the soiled clothes, wash your private part, make wudu, and you can pray the whole time between the beginning of the salat until the time ends, regardless of what comes out of you. It doesn't matter if this discharge continues to come, it doesn't nullify your wudu. Once the time is over, you want to pray the following prayer, and the time is due, you repeat the same process, and Allah knows best."
