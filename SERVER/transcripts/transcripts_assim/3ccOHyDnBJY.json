  "title": "Woke up late for Fajr, realised later in the day - what should I do?",
  "transcript": "The next question is, what should I do at the end of the day for Fajr and the rest of the day for the next Fajr? You pray it. What do you want me to do? The Prophet ï·º said in the authentic hadith, whoever sleeps or skips a prayer or forgets it, must pray it as soon as he remembers it or wakes up. There is no expiation other than that. So whether it's Fajr or any other Salat, you totally forgot. And this happens, by the way. It happens with me. Sometimes we go off-roading or camping. Isha time is prayed in the masjid. So we go shower, clean, etc. It's nine o'clock, ten o'clock, eleven o'clock. Go to bed, wake up in the morning. Zuhr time, oops! We didn't pray Isha because we're like clockwork. We're used to praying in the masjid. This particular day, we didn't pray in the masjid. So we took it for granted. Pray it immediately. Likewise, he who overslept and woke up to make up the Fajr, which is very, very difficult to imagine. But the moment you remember or the moment you wake up, you immediately pray. And this, there is no expiation, as the Prophet had said, Alayhi Salaam, except other than that. The next question is, if I miss Maghrib and I'm stuck at work and the time of Isha came, can I pray Maghrib after the Adhan of Isha or after the Salat of Isha? No, you've skipped it intentionally. Salat is time bound. It has a beginning. It has an end. Agree? Can I pray it one minute before the Adhan? 30 seconds? Five seconds? It has to be exactly at the time of the Salat. Likewise, I cannot pray it after the time expires. Intentionally, unless I have a legitimate reason, such as. I just mentioned it. 20 minutes later. Come on, guys. What are you doing? Forgetfulness or sleep. So these are two legitimate reasons. Of course, necessity. I am in the ambulance with my mom going to the ICU. An accident. I'm drowning, struggling. These are exceptional cases. But I'm at work, coming for prayer. Yes, yes, I'm going to finish this email. Come for prayer. Well, I have a meeting with the CEO. No, Akhi, I have to finish my latte. No, no, go and sleep. Don't make it up. Khalas, it's gone. It's like someone who's coming for Hajj. So he comes on the seventh day of Dhul Hijjah. Wearing his Ihram, comes to Jeddah Airport. The customs officer stops him. Let me see. Oh, your visa is not valid. Please step aside. And they put him in detention. Five days later, they say, sorry, you had a problem with your visa. It was not signed properly. The stamp was not done. Now you can go. So the guy on the 15th or 16th of Dhul Hijjah, in his Ihram, where are you going? I'm going to Arafah. Arafah? People are back from Hajj, Akhi. Yeah, but I was detained. What would I do? I had a legitimate reason. Can he go to Arafah and stand alone? Why? Because the time has expired. I hope this answers the question."
