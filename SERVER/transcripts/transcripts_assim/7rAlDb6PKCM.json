  "title": "Can we watch a Halal Video but the person is doing haram by eating with their LEFT hand? assim al",
  "transcript": "Binta from Italy Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh So I didn't understand how to know if a video that like have halal content but there is a person in the video that is doing haram like eating with the left how to know if it's permissible to watch or not? The content of the video if it is all and all halal and it is not propagating or endorsing anything haram it's okay to watch so someone who is presenting the news and telling us what is happening in Gaza and while doing this he's clean-shaven he doesn't have a beard this is a sin but his sin is on him not on me so I can benefit from the content which is halal to watch and learn and benefit from if someone is giving a cooking show and showing me how to cook salmon with this sauce or with that and in the process he eats with his left it is haram for him not for me but if he is for example drinking wine and saying that we have to drink wine with emmental cheese after dinner or whatever whoa we have to stop here because this is a major sin and he's endorsing it he's calling us to do it so I hope this makes sense"
