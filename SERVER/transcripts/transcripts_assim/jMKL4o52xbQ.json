  "transcript": "what is the ruling on being 45 degrees off from the qibla what is the qibla the qibla is the direction of the ka'ba what is the kaaba it's the black structure found in mecca in the sacred masjid al-haram in mesid al-haram where all muslims when they pray five times a day they face whether they're in china in the u.s in europe in the middle east no matter where they are it's an obligation it's one of the conditions for accepting their prayers that they face the direction of the qiblah and it's a sign of unity and the muslims don't worship of course this structure because it's made of stones and we rise and climb on top of it and walk all over it with our feet without any problem but it is a symbolic struct structure that was originally built by adam peace be upon him and then uh renovated and rebuilt again by ibrahim peace be upon him and prophet ismail peace be upon him as well and it's been there since the beginning of time and even when we bury our dead if you go to muslim cemeteries you'll find that the corpse of a muslim deceased is laid in the grave lying on its right side facing the direction of the qibla so it is our qibla to be directed to when we are alive and also after our death so the question again is it okay to be diverted 45 degrees off from the qibla this is an issue that was answered by the prophet as you know medina is up north of mecca so when the people of medina want to pray they're obliged to face the south this is where mecca is so they asked the prophet allah once about this diversion in direction and the prophet said what's between the east and the west is qibla so now you're talking about this variation the prophet says it's a qibla so as long as you are if you're privileged to your south as in the case of the people of medina if you're facing east or west or north your prayer is invalid but if you're facing the direction though there's a small negligible diversion that would be accepted and the scholars say if you are inside of the masjid inside of al-haram the sanctuary and you can see the qibla you can see the kaaba you must be in its direction face to face so if the qibla is there and you go a little bit to the left or the right your prayer is invalid because you can see it so no matter where you are in the masjid you have to be in the same exact direction of the qibla and if you're in makkah but not inside the message itself so the whole masjid is your qibla and if you're outside of makkah city now the circle is way bigger so the deviation is possible scholars say that the direction is what you have to be facing not the exact message because it's almost impossible to know exactly where it is so the direction with little deviation would be permissible to pray in that direction and scholars say below 45 degrees so 45 is like this below that it is acceptable if it goes a little bit further then that would not be between the acceptable parameters and hence you should avoid this and of course it goes without saying that you have to try your level best to face the direction uh the correct direction of the qibla to the best of your ability"
