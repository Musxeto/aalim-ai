  "transcript": "a way of life away perhaps today with our guests we can address the issues of detention or how to reduce tension at home how to make the house a calm a serene environment where you can just feel like you are in a resort as we mentioned earlier and you're just really you know relaxing and having a good time versus entering a war zone where you know you'd have to duck every now and then to make sure that you remain alive in the household because for some people it gets a little hectic a war zone is a good description of some of the houses nowadays and always attribute this back or refer back to the sunnah the prophet was asked by one of his companions to give him advice the prophet only said do not become angry so the man said okay that's good increase in advice or add me another or give me another advice don't become angry and the prophet continued to say do not become angry do not become angry do not become angry and the reason is that anger and rage are the causes of the majority of conflicts and problems all over the world not only in the in a marriage or in the house and this is so unfortunate because one would maybe say okay the prophet assam is telling us not to become angry so if someone insults me or slaps you in the face i'll just say thank you try the other one no the prophet is telling you not to do something due to your anger or rage that you would regret later on so he's actually asking us instructing us to repress our anger and if the spouses managed to do this in the house wallahi we would not have what we're having and facing of the problems between the husbands and wives repressing the anger is not an easy thing to do the so to face aggression with a smile to repress your anger and not act upon it this is something that only those fortunate would be given and favored by allah those who pardon the people overlook their mistakes those who excel and do good so i mean having this as encouragement having this quality as you mentioned will uh will you know permit someone to paradise will make them among them and the one that you mentioned was it for ability here these are the ones who have been blessed by allah and given him i want to just say about the anger it leads to two major major sins in the marriage one from the man and one from the woman anger leads the man to um to say words of divorce and anger leads the woman to say statements of curses and we know the grave sins in you know in in this person making a mockery of the marriage and we know the huge sin of the woman saying curses and the road starts the first step is the anger and when i see somebody become angry like it may allah protect us because you know we all have sins but i i feel that they weren't patient back in their early days they always let this issue go it was against the sunnah they kept getting angry and they don't care they get angry they don't care their own until it comes back and it bites them and then they say i don't have any control and then we'd say because all these years that you never held back that you come to a point where it just overtakes your life and alhamdulillah here allah reminds us by saying welcome praising those who contain their anger okay suppress it and the other hadith what the prophet saw mentioned whom do you consider the one that uh who is the strongest one among you okay then they said the one who knocks people down okay so the prophet sallallahu salaam said no it is the one who contains his his anger and in the other hadith the prophet say to the don't get angry don't get angry don't get angry and the yanna will be yours and the other hadith the prophet sallam said the one who contains and suppress his anger his anger allah will call him from the day of resurrection in front of all the people so and so get up here at the hariyath choose from among them because you used to have to control your anger many of the crimes because of anger the divorce that allah because of anger no husband will divorce his wife while sipping tea and chatting but because of anger i got angry and sometimes subhanallah sheikh i divorced my wife what should i do and when you ask him for the reason he can't tell you because it is so silly it is so silly under uh the address in the book of talaq and they categorized the anger allah in one of his books on the tower it's a tower on the tala verdicts pertain to the issue of allah he said there are three levels of divorce of talaq divorces okay two they are invalid one is valid number one he said the husband reaches such a degree of anger that he did cannot recall that he divorced his wife some people when they get angry they yes it becomes black and white they shut down if you tell them that you divorce your wife say no come on. that didn't say so this person just like one who is mad insane so that is invalid the second level of barack he said yes he recalls but he could not control his anger some people when they get angry they start shifting we have seen people like that like that and that's why we tell the sisters please fear allah and never tell him divorce me divorce me who needs anger just be calm cool down go somewhere because the shaytan here this is his chance because he wants to destroy the family so he said he recalls but he could not control his anger he said this also this talag is invalid the third level yes he was angry but his anger could be controlled and he could control himself and this type of an issue here that a lot of those who claim to be angry they come and knock on our doors and sheikh i was angry i did this i was angry i divorced my wife and some of them even justify abusing their wives battering their wives and say well i ask for forgiveness i was angry and i usually ask them okay if you were driving down the highway and someone cut over you and he came out of the car and you came angry out of the car but he was like six four a bodybuilder would you fight him he said definitely not and then your anger is selective because your wife is weak and vulnerable you beat her and allah will punish you for that in hell but when you meet a person who's who is excused due to his rage is a person who gets into a fight even if he knows he's going to be beaten up because he's unable to control himself but being selective you cannot flare or you know get angry with your boss you do not get angry with the landlord you do not get angry with someone who is much stronger than you are you only get angry with your wife and you justify this by doing this no this is selective anger it is not acceptable it's not a case of rage like in the case of the divorce of someone who does not recall someone who does something and then he finds the plates broken the windows is chattered and who did this you did it well i don't remember it's as if it's in the case of intoxication this is a different story so if we manage and the sisters are like this by the way and the sisters keep on insisting and keep on rubbing it you know it hurts she keeps on rubbing it no you have to do this and sometimes the sisters they come down to their senses and they apologize but the harm was already done and this brings us to apology which is one of the reasons for stress and fight coming back to the sisters a lot of the sisters say things out of anger that hurt the man i have brothers calling me saying that because of an incident that took place my wife keeps on reminding me that i'm not a man you did this you're not a man you don't have the qualities of a man and manhood is something precious to a man so if you you know stab him in the heart by doing this it's like exactly doing the same to a woman by saying that you're not a woman that you're not beautiful and in the hadith the prophet forbade us from saying sallallahu salaam to a woman in her face that may allah make your face ugly so you are this is a red zone that you cannot cross you cannot go in criticizing your wife's beauty or accusing her of being ugly or saying anything bad about her so this brings us back again to the issue of anger but that's after the break inshallah we'll be right back a way of life a way of life of life welcome back and you were saying that you were giving us some points of benefit on the issue yes and the issue of being angry sometimes you cannot suppress this but if you're ever angry don't neglect one of the best remedies and that is apology and there are people who may not be meant enough to apologize they think that this goes against their nature i will be humiliating myself if you go and kiss your wife's foot in apology you are the man wallahi and i'm saying this if you kiss your wife's foot you are the man because you are the best to your family i have a tip i wanted to share about uh you know giving yourself the power to apologize and that is the prophet said you know if if somebody gets angry and they they have three days to get angry then the prophet saw allah said the better of the two is the one who starts with salam excellent so i say if i'm so angry that i'm gonna make sure that this other person does not say salaam before me because i'm better than them and i'm gonna make sure that now you're talking about man's ego and now you're talking about competition and so if the man gets angry he wants to make sure he's the best one you be the first person to come and say salaam and make up and you'll be stronger and you'll be better and then inshallah there will be a competition between each person trying to say sorry faster than and this is your garment you apologize to everyone you know and this is the closest person on earth to your heart and you're unable to danny go down a little bit and just say i'm sorry and allah i'm sorry these two words open so many doors it makes life worthy of living it's like a panadol for handy i don't think so no it's more like a cure rather than something that tranquilizes yes it's more than a cure because it puts you in a mindset that listen it eradicates the disease you mean it doesn't just cause you down okay good okay i see where you're coming from i would like just to clarify that people maybe they misunderstand or misuse the fat of sheikh bin baz but alhamdulillah muslims when it comes to the issue of talaq they are very sensitive about it really okay so he will not tell you that i was angry and i could not control my anger and he would be lying because he knows that he's going to just so that's why alhamdulillah but we have to keep this in mind that some people really they sometimes the they have the first degree of anger some men they have the second degree of anger and the rest they have the third degree because sometimes as imam chavez said only the donkey doesn't get angry i think the thing is i mean listening to all of this don't get into arguments in the first place because it's this what it is it's that chain you know you start to argue and then from the argument the anger starts and then with the anger and this is the shaitaan his favorite soldier is the one who keeps on pestering the husband and the wife the shaytan sits on his throne in the water and that his soldiers come i did this you did nothing go away go away and then one comes he said i stayed with this man and his wife and i made them argue and i kept staying with making them argue until they divorced and he says come you know you did good that's another thing it's like between husband and wife when they fight you know something sometimes i would say you know what shaytaan is happy right now let's team up against shaytan and let's uh stop arguing and so on but is it possible not to argue you can avoid it it's not possible but he said probably sometimes the arguments are unnecessary i mean they're really silly things and as they say you know they make people blow things out of proportions a small thing i mean you found that your brown sock is with the black sock for the 50th time and that shouldn't be the case and so that becomes a reason for me it's done you know there was a pick the other one from the other one there was a brother who wasn't married and he said when i get married inshaallah i'm not going to have any problems with my wife that's what he thought yeah and i said okay you know i started laughing right but i said you know what's your plan he said it's going to be easy everything she wants i'm just going to say okay honey wow i'm going to say yes honey and then i started laughing because i go you so have no experience this any subhanallah disputes right now i believe that disputes and arguments are inevitable they have to happen it's not an issue by itself we can talk because it's not do this yes sir simon says stay there yes sir there has to be communication and arguments but there is a limit what i find out of my experience doing marriage counseling that a lot of the problems are what you can call old files so um i'm talking with my wife about the red and brown well i would never wear a red sock but a brown and black sock for example and why they're always mixed up and she said well sorry i forgot i didn't see it and then i opened old files 30 years ago this is what you always say you remember what you did on the wedding night you did did you see what your father did 20 years ago and look at your brother and look at your mother and look at what this and and i bring old files that she thought that we're all we're done with that and she does the same and you did this you did that you you gave the money to your family you didn't give the money to for us you took your brother to a good school your son is not in a good school and things that i thought that come on this a it's been ages so among the top reasons for problems is opening old files and digging in to the past which people should not do it's in the past move on but people love doing it and this is why it causes issues and problems with in marriages not only that it goes out of proportion when the argument is not only what's in the house stayed in the house when she goes on the phone and she says mom he did this he did that and i go on the phone or i visit my mother and i tell her that she didn't do a good job cooking she's a bad wife she always nags me and i am causing a drift between the two families so when my wife goes to visit my her mother-in-law my mother and she's happy and she's bringing her a gift my mother has been already fueled with my complaints and she is not ready to receive her in a good manner it reminds me of a story that they say i don't know how factual it is but they say that a man got in a fight with his wife and his wife went to her parents and so he went to his in-laws and he's trying to work things out and she's trying to use her family as defenders he said if you're a man meet me outside subhanallah he's telling his wife if you're a man meet me outside so he's trying to do it trying to work it out with her like he would work it out with a man like he's gonna go and knock her out and and punch her and so when sometimes when they bring their in-laws as defenders you know like a soccer match kind of thing it complicates the problem it becomes many many people get involved it could have been something very simple then it gets way more complex and then the the problems you know become more difficult to resolve so should the spouses learn to contain i think we spoke about keeping the problems at home and not not you know exposing them unless one is seeking you know some when it's reaching a dead end only in this case yes you may ask for consultation you know the part you were talking about with you know that they're bringing up old files i find another big issue is that also bringing up old gifts so the man for example or the woman they go back and forth about i did this she says you did nothing for me and he says i you know dropped the kids off at school i go to work this she said well what about me i made you food i wash your clothes and then it's a it's a manuel back and forth that's the worst situation i i tell myself that if that starts up the argument goes in that direction i immediately say that if i did any of those things i did it for allah i didn't do it so that i'm going to bring it up one day and say like i'm making a bank account of the good deeds that i did not stop i just stop it i'm like if the other person wants to go in that direction my recommendation is just like you know what you can say that you did that for me well i did my actions for allah i'm just gonna stop talking it's also by the way reminding people of your generosity yes it's one of the things that allah will not look at you and allah will not purify you on the day of just a very serious thing to recount to a person and make them feel obliged to you you know i think the other thing is that um i totally forgot what i was going to say there's a verse there's a verse where allah says in the quran we feed you for the sake of allah we don't seek from you any any um you know compensation and we don't need you to even say thanks and that's where we we wish you know somebody comes into their marriage with when they do the good things for their spouse that they do it for the sake of allah and and that's going to solve you know a big chunk of it specifically about uh that they do not follow up their savaka with reminders of goodness and harm because it does and then allah described the insincerity and sincerity as you had mentioned earlier i think one of the things that you know i tend to notice in marriage is that people often forget that your wife and your husband is still your brother and sister in islam so all the all the things that allah and his messenger have told us about the rights of a muslim still apply to your husband and your wife i find it really strange it's like that seems to go out of the window so the thing about hiding your brother's faults that whoever you know hides their brother's faults uh in this life allah i mean that really motivates me to think that you if you hide your brother's fault in this life allah will cover your fools on the day of judgment i think i need my faults to be definitely covered up on the day of judgement and isn't this true therefore with your wife i find it really strange that someone would go to tell you know the wife's family or your mother or your about your wife's faults or your husband i mean i find that extraordinary obviously you know it happens but um what happened to covering the faults of the muslims what happened to advising someone privately and you know not exposing their faults these are very important islamic etiquettes here i would like to add that a piece of advice for the sisters even when you are seeking advice don't say my husband it's better if you put it in the third person maybe i know your husband or if you want to seek the advice from your mother say mother as a sister you are not lying assistant is having this problem so the mother will give you the piece of her but the moment you tell her mom i have this problem now she will sometimes she may side with you yeah yeah we'll be in your side and she will be reacting emotionally to yourself so what is more important that you want to get this help without exposing your husband without checking this from the etiquettes of seeking advice exactly well this is the end of the episode but inshallah we'll be back for more assalamualaikum"
