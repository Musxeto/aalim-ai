  "transcript": "[Music] my question is there's a company here that's called um uber that if you're working with if you download their app to work with them the job what you do they will tell you that go to this restaurant and collect the food and deliver to this house so my question is that is um mostly haram food might involve you don't select you're not able to select with restaurants you go on with restaurant you don't go delivering this type of food um won't ask if this will be halal or not so brother um yusuf from ireland is asking about uber deliver or uber food which is a service uber company and many many other companies worldwide are making a lot of money by connecting the dots an end user who's interested in buying food and a delivery person who is a freelance working on his own on his own terms and free time and they get a percentage now the problem is that these restaurants give you a package and you do not know whether this package includes ham haram food or even intoxicants beverages so what is my role basically and generally speaking if you don't know what's inside and there is a possibility of being halal and haram the default is it's halal like a postman's job he takes letters parcels boxes and delivers them he doesn't know what's inside is he accountable the answer is no but if you knew if you knew that i'm taking a delivery from a bar or from a place that sells only uh pork chops then definitely this is totally haram for you to deliver the dilemma is i don't know what the delivery is until i accept the order there is no excuse for you once you accept the order and it says to you that this is haram you cannot accept it this may require a fine they may block me is in allah's hands you cannot assist on haram as allah azzawajal mentioned in chapter 5 collaborate on righteousness and virtue and do not collaborate on vice and transgression and allah knows best"
