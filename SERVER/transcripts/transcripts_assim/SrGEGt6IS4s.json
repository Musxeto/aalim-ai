  "transcript": "Sheikh this question keeps on coming from people. It's about homeland forex trading. Is it Haram or not Haram? Everywhere I go in Kenya, they ask me this question. And I seriously don't want to reinvent the wheel. Please go back to the lectures. You will find the answer. In my YouTube channel, I explained it. Most of forex trading is Haram. Especially if it's dealing with the margin of futures or with them giving you money and etc. Or when you're dealing with gold, silver, or currency. Totally Haram. Because these transactions, gold, silver, and currency, it has to be simultaneous. Take and give physically. Online, it's not permissible. Along other things. And Allah knows best."
