  "title": "Gathering & Eating from one plate Sunnah? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sayyid from Singapore, or sorry, yeah, well, let's say Sayyid from Singapore. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Okay. I come across a Facebook post from a fellow Muslim man in my country, expressing his discomfort with communal iftar gatherings in masjid. Despite being somewhat practicing, he admitted that he couldn't eat like that without risking a confrontation. For instance, if someone were to take his favorite mutton, chicken, or his share of rice, he might resort to slapping them hard across the face. He emphasized that eating from a shared plate with others is not his preference, and he prefers to have his own individual plate with a large portion of food. Akhi, Akhi, I don't understand what you're saying. Are you talking about eating iftar in the masjid? Basically, I'm referring to communal iftar gathering where around four to six people share one big plate in the masjid. This is not communist, this is Islamic. Where is communism in this? Muslims gather on one plate and share it. This is the sunnah. The Prophet said, alayhi salatu wa salam, do not eat dispersed. Each one eats alone like an open buffet. Rather, eat from one plate, say bismillah, so that the blessing and the barakah of Allah would fall upon it, and it would suffice all of you. And Allah knows best."
