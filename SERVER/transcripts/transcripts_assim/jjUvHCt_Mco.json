  "transcript": "our first question is from ephra and this is a frequently asked questions she says are Bridal and baby showers allowed in Islam first of all we have to understand a very important concept in Islam because you often go through so many similar cases and you might be in a dilemma whether this is halal or Haram sometimes you may even be frustrated from the amount of Haram you hear from scholars and students of knowledge every time you ask them to see how I'm Haram Haram so if you teach people how to fish it's it's much better than giving them a fish every day and therefore what is the main concept that governs our rulings in Islam number one that Islam prevails over all and number two that Islam is the origin and everything else follows and not the other way around so we don't come to Islam and try to make it fit our lives on the contrary we go to our lives and try to make it fit Islam so having said that you have to filter and scrutinize everything in your life just to make sure that it is in synchronized with Islam and not the other way around now bridal showers what are they they're definitely not from the Muslim tradition ok wearing your watch is not from the Muslim tradition riding a car is not from a Muslim tradition using your da or coming on TV is not from the Islamic tradition don't mix apples with oranges unless you're making fruit salad see the Prophet said alayhi salaatu Sam in a long hadith narrated by a beloved muhammad ali allahu anhu MA he said at the end were mentorship bhai be home in four women home and whoever imitates a people he is considered to be from them from among them and this hadith clearly states that we are not allowed to imitate people so if I'm riding a car am i imitating a people the answer is no because everybody rides a car this is not specific for the Buddhists or for the Hindus or for the Christians or for the Jews everybody rides a car so this is not something part of their tradition customs or religion likewise when it comes to using microphones using TV media technology etc but when it comes to their customs the things that they're known for and it is identifying them then we cannot mimic them or use such things I cannot wear a Texan hat because this is for disbelievers living in that region likewise if for example the Mexican sombrero the Japanese kimono anything with the chopsticks all of these are part of their customs the Muslims don't do this so why would I go out of my way to imitate them there's something wrong in my apisa likewise if someone celebrates the New Year's or celebrates their false celebrations imitating them the Muslims don't have this coming to the bridal showers and the Bay showers this is not part of our tradition our cussed customs for the bride once she gets married we have the walima this is Islamic a feast we call people to eat men and women segregated alhamdulillah they have a good time for the baby we have on the seventh day what is known as a happy huh then this is okay go ahead with it no problem now when we come to Bridal and baby showers we find that the origin is an Una's Lamech it was in the 19th century they used to compensate the bride with some gifts because of the dowry she had to pay and in Islam men pay the dowry not the other way around and there are so many things associated to it so in short this is not permissible to have Bridal or baby showers you want to visit the bride-to-be and give her gifts go ahead but don't throw a party and don't call the party bridal shower and likewise for the children newborns you want to give a gift to the parents no problem go ahead and give it to them this is halal but not to have a specific celebration and to call people to it with such a name and function and Allah surgeon knows best"
