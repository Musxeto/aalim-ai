  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (1) - What he loved - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "why speak about the role model every one of us as Muslims no that there will be three questions where we would be forced to answer in our Graves whether you're a Muslim or a non-muslim the first question who's your lord the second question what is your religion and the third question who is this man that was sent to you so in order to pass the test and in order to answer these questions correctly you need to know who is this man and in order to know you have to love him you have to know his biography you know he you need to know how he lived how he communicated what made him laugh what would what made him sad what made him cry what made him happy how he dealt with things what were the things that he loved so this isn't is an essential part of your Iman it's not something that is artificial or not essential an accessory no this is a major part of your Islam and your Iman to know your Prophet Allah so we will attempt in these few episodes in this blessed month of Ramadan to address some of these topics and I pray to Allah azzawajal that we may benefit from these series and that Allah azzawajal would grant us the highest levels in Jannah because of our love for our Prophet Allah and our attempt to be like him we will speak about few of the things that the prophet alaihissalam loved in order to love your Prophet you have to love what he loved or at least to know the things that he loved so among the men and the people in general we all know that the prophet Allah loved his long life companion and in the authentic Hadith the prophet was asked who are the most beloved people to your heart he said Isha his wife they said no no no we meant among the men he said her father Abu Bakr and the prophet Allah said that clearly to the public if I were to take a close friend an ally I would have taken Abu Bakr from among all the people on earth but I am the friend of Allah azzawajal also the prophet loved dearly His companion um to the extent that he loved Abu Bakr and Omar so much that he used to say when he sees them coming these are the hearing and the sight are like my hearing and my sight I can't live without them as for the third caliph Earthman may Allah be pleased with him the prophet loved him so much that he married him to two of his own daughters and of course we all know that the Shia they hate Abu Bakr um and they abhor them and they think of them evil stuff and they say that they are not even Muslims is it because the prophet loves them probably they hated othman to the extent that once one of them said to a scholar of Islam you are a lover of the murderer of the two daughters of the Prophet Allah so the scholar said to him if you are saying the truth and Earth man killed the prophet's daughter why would the prophet give him his second daughter to kill her as well and the roughly did not know what to reply and this is their Norm of saying lies and not being able to back it up the prophet loved him the fourth caliph his cousin and his son-in-law and he loved his own daughter the wife of Ali Al Fatima and he loved their sons al-hasan and al-hussein and the prophet Allah made that clear again to the public over and over in so many hadiths for example no one who would love Ali except a believer and those who would hate Ali are the hypocrites al-hasan and Hussein the prophet said oh Allah I love them so o Allah love them and love whoever loves them also loved he's his uncle Abu Talib but this love was a natural love he lived with his uncle for almost 40 years and his uncle defended him unfortunately he was not a Muslim and the prophet tried his level best even when he was at his Deathbed to invite him to Islam but to no avail among the women whom the prophet loved Allah where his beloved wives Khadijah went to Hawaii bakar as for Khadijah he was asked and he replied Allah has given me her love I can't do anything other than to love her as for Isha the prophet was asked Allah after the death of Khadijah and after he married his wife Aisha who among the people is most beloved to you and he said ah Isha and the Muslims knew that so whenever the prophet Assam was his in his different wives houses they would not send their gifts and Foods to the prophet Allah until he was in Aisha's house among his companions the prophet Allah used to love by his own on his own is a story to be told the prophet said to him by Allah I love you and he taught him so many things and he was among the scholars of the companions he also loved Abdullah and um Allah be pleased with them learned more than 70 surahs directly from the mouth of the Prophet Allah and he is one of the four companions whom the prophet ordered us Allah to learn the Quran from may Allah be pleased with him and with his father and with it with his mother he died while loving Amar and Abdullah as per the Hadith may Allah be pleased with him also we all know that the prophet salallahu had an adopted son before adoption was abolished And that son was he loved him like a son and he used to be called Muhammad but when adoption was abolished he was called after his father he had a son named Usama and both were beloved people to the prophet's heart to wasallam in general the prophet Allah loved a segment of the people he loved the poor and the needy because loving them does not require any effort in the sense that there are no strings attached I don't love them because of their wealth or their power I don't have to pretend anything towards them or to kiss their boots as they say rather I love them because they are weak and vulnerable and they need compassion and care so the prophet Allah used to ask Allah azzawajal the love of the poor and the needy so that one is way down to earth and feeling the humbleness in his heart the prophet salallahu used to also love those with High ethical standards and moral conduct the prophet said that is for Simon authentic Hadith the most beloved to me among you are those with moral conduct and good ethics and this is narrated or reported by Imam bukhari if we come to the foods what kind or types of food did the prophet like unlike vegetarians the prophet saws used to love meat which makes us as Muslims by default love meat because our Prophet loved it and when one of his companions that is presented him with food the prophet salallahu notice that there is meat in it he said to him jabber as if you knew that we love meat and the prophet specifically Allah used to love the shoulder of a sheep or a ram in this it was the most beloved part of an animal to him due to its tenderness the prophet also used to love vinegar and he used to dip the bread and vinegar and eat it and nowadays medical reports are coming to tell us how beneficial that is he used to love pumpkins and there are different types and categories that fall under uh the pumpkin but he used to love it and he used to choose it whenever he finds it in food and it says since that day where the Prophet used to pick pumpkins from the food since that day I fell in love with it and I would always eat it and like it like most of us the prophet saws used to love sweet things and he used to love honey and he used to mix a small portion of Honey with water and drink that which is very healthy he used to love butter and dates and he used to encourage people to ate to eat dates and he used to say that a house that does not have dates the people living in it are starving are hungry and we all know the benefits of eating dates he also used to love to drink sweet and cold drinks so the companions used to try and make his drinks a little bit colder than room temperature did not have refrigerators but they tried the level best with whatever means they had because the prophet used to enjoy it was Salaam which all indicates that it is not Haram to seek the pleasure of this Dunya some people when they see us eat something that might be lavish or expensive or fear Allah don't do this don't do that subhanallah what am I doing wrong the prophet used to love Allah to eat meat to eat sweet things to eat cold or to drink or cold drinks and this did not tarnish his trust in Allah or his in his love for the this does not impact the level of your Iman on the contrary this boosts your Iman when you praise Allah azzawajal for what he has bestowed upon you from the favors and the blessings what about locations the prophet loved mostly of all locations Mecca and he once came to the outskirts of McCann addressed it by saying how sweet and pure and beloved to my heart you are omaka had your people not made me leave you I would never have lived anywhere else than you but he was forced to migrate where did he migrate to to Medina and he sallallahu adored Medina adored the people of Medina and he used to give it beautiful nicknamese Baba for Medina and whenever he was coming home from a travel or an Expedition and he would see the outskirts of Medina he would make his ride hasten towards Medina for the love in his heart to it not only Medina but also mount the prophet salallahu once came next to mount uhud and he said this is a mountain that we love and he loves us as well all of these show you that the prophet saws was filled with compassion and love to people to things to locations even to times the prophet sallallahu whenever he wanted to travel he used to select a Thursday because he rarely traveled out of Medina on other days than Thursday he used to love the month of Shaban to the extent that he used to fast most of it if not all of it and he used to say that this is the most beloved month to my heart to fast after Ramadan as for his clothes he used to love the color white in his clothes and he used to instruct the Muslims by saying wear white it's purer it's better and Shred or shroud that is not shred hopefully shroud your deceased in white so the color is preferred and loved by the prophet is not that you limit yourself to it you can wear any color you like as a matter of the As a matter of the fact the prophet Islam used to also love uh wearing the green and he used to sallallahu prefer green as anas may Allah be pleased with him said the most beloved color to the prophet assalam was Green so this is something that relaxes your eye when you look and it's beautiful to see Greenery when you go to a landscape that is filled with green trees and grass it's comforting it's soothing for the soul also the prophet salallahu used to love perfumes and ask may Allah be pleased with him he said I never touched a hand softer than the prophet assalam nor better in in smell and perfumes than him never ever anyone could find an offensive order from the prophet Allah he was always beautifully ordered and the fragrance coming from him was unique even his sweat some of the companions used to collect to put with their perfumes so that it would make it much better than the perfume itself the prophet Allah used to love horses because they are animals of Pride strength and Power most Expeditions and battles and Wars where one on horseback and at the end of the time when oil will Ex will disappear will all types of electricity would vanish and there would be no sources of power as we have them today people would go back to horseback where they be commuting from one place to the other and fighting Wars on horses among the things that the prophet used to love he used to love being optimistic so whenever he hears a good name he would like that whenever he would hear a good statement he would feel that this is a glad Tiding and feel optimistic and he used to abhor being pessimistic or being superstitious and used to say that being superstitious is prohibited in Islam because this is thinking badly about Allah while being optimistic is thinking positively of Allah the Almighty the prophet salallahu used to love when his companions come to him with a good dream a good vision and he would interpret it for them in a good fashion because this is part of being optimistic and also the prophet salallahu used to love among the things he loved using the right hand in everything that is positive and good so he used to eat with his right drink with his right give with his right receive with his right he used to calm his hair with his right begin wearing his shoes and clothes starting with the right hand side entering the Masjid with the right foot first sleeping on his right side so all good things the prophet used to love to begin with the right hand side and the prophet saws used to love consistency so he would not do something once every blue moon if he begins to do something whether it's night prayer whether it's giving charity whether it's this or that he would be consistent because he says Allah the almighty loves the Deeds that are consistent even if little and this is something that Allah loves and this is what the prophet saws also loves it goes without saying that the prophet used to love prayer and he used to find the comfort of his heart in his prayer and he would love that the wise and the Learned of his companions be behind him and next to him so that they would learn from him and copy and imitate and convey how he prayed to the other Muslims and the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam used to love to make Dua repeatedly and he used to make Dua three times asks Allah azzawajal for forgiveness three times and all of this because he was given the concise of Dua his Dua was never too long short but powerful and he used to love to make such Dua has three phrases but profound meaning that Encompass everything in this world and in the here after and finally the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam used to love to hear the Quran from others he said to him recite the Quran said you want me to recite the Quran and it was revealed to you and the prophet said I love to hear it from someone else so this is a preview of some of the things that our Prophet is loved and we as Muslims have to compare ourselves do we love these things are we close to the prophet Allah did we know these things about him so that once we are asked about who is this man who was sent to you in our Graves we insha Allah would be equipped with the knowledge and the know-how and we would have walked the talk by implementing it in our lives knows best we have"
