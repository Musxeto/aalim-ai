  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m [Music] [Music] [Music] alhamd after ab and Abu jandel took their Refuge near the coastal city of sa bah and everyone who escaped the politics of qur joined them they started threatening the commercial roots of quray and they they did not leave any Caravan passing by without intercepting it and taking all what they had with them and killing their Fighters that caused quray to cancel one of the items that the Muslims did not like and were not uh uh easy with and that was whoever accepts Islam from the people of quray and comes to the Muslims in Medina must be returned back to Mecca after quray suffered from the attacks of Abu bu and Abu jandel and those who were with them they sent to the prophet Sall wasallam notifying him that they've agreed to cancel this unjust and unfair condition or item which meant that anyone who accepted Islam from Mecca could travel in peace to Medina and migrate and this indeed was a victory to the Muslims uh praise be to Allah few months later came the great leader and Warrior khed and T they all accepted Islam and migrated to Medina these were among the elite of Mecca and they came without any force and no one could prevent them from migrating the minute the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam saw them he told his companions Mecca has given you its eyeballs in the sense that it has given you its most precious people and KH who was a great Army leader came to the prophet am and told him oh prophet of Allah I've stood against you in so many battles ask Allah for me for forgiveness and he told him KH didn't you know that Allah the almighty forgives all the sins of those who revert to Islam likewise the prophet Sall wasallam put his hand forward for him to shake hands and give him the Pledge of Allegiance but withheld his hand back and said I'd like to uh uh have conditions in the sense that I'll give you the Pledge of Allegiance on one condition is that Allah forgives my sins so the prophet s wasallam talked to him again and told him didn't you know that Islam erases anything that was before it and this by the grace of Allah is a gift from Allah the almighty to those who accept Islam now this treaty and this agreement of hudia allowed the Muslims and specifically allowed the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam to have enough time to focus on other issues and among these issues were to perform dawa to call non-muslims to ISL Islam in Arabia and outside of Arabia the prophet had problems with three fronts the Jews the tribes of N and poist of quray now with this side secured with this agreement signed and implemented he had more things and better things to do so the prophet alhat started a diplomatic tour he started calling the leaders of powers and countries and uh kingdoms to Islam and he was advised by his companions to take a seal and that is why the prophet Salli wasallam used to wear a ring this ring is not part of decoration or just to look nice it was a seal that had engraved on it Allah rasool Muhammad the word the prophet of Allah is the messenger of Allah Muhammad the messenger of Allah but of course the name of Allah came on top because it cannot come below the name of the Prophet sallallah alhi wasallam Allah's name is always on top and they told him that you have to take this seal because the Kings and Emperors would not accept any letter that was not sealed so he started sending his envoys sallallahu alai wasallam to the countries around him he began with sending a letter to the the the cizar of the Rome of the Romans the head of the Romans Hercules or uh uh Caesar whatever he was called he sent a message to him with may Allah be pleased with him he went to him and he was at the time in the northern of part of Arabia in a sham and he honored he uh hosted him he took the letter he read it and he requested his company to seek anyone who is related to our Prophet Muhammad alhat wasam and by luck and chance nothing is by luck or chance it's all pre-ordained by Allah there was Abu sufyan har the leader of qur and it was a truce so he was going to the northern part of Arabia for trade he was brought in front of her or Caesar and he brought a translator and he made his companions who were with Abu sufyan to stand behind him and he told them I'm going to ask him questions and if he tells a lie you have to indicate this to me and he will not see you and he started asking him questions and why did he choose Abu sufyan because he was the only one related to the prophet sallallah wasallam from the same family they they join uh uh in in the fourth yes uh great-grandfather so it's the same lineage the others were from different tribes and he asked ABA sufyan few questions that indicated that he was smart he asked him what about his lineage in you and then he he still told him he had a very good lineage in us he's among the most prominent families of uh our city city of Mecca so he also asked him did he have any of his ancestors a king a ruling King so he told him no he he had no Kings in his lineage so he told him what about his ethics and behavior with you did you ever accuse him of lying they told he told him no he was known to be the honest and the one that says the truth so again he asked him who follows him the dignitaries or the weak ones and the poor so he told him no he's followed by the weak and those who are uh poor poor so again he asked him are they are be are they being increased in number or they're being reduced so he said no every day they get more and more and more and of course Abu sufyan was not easy with that so his question was does anyone of his followers reject his faith does anyone abandons Islam for one reason or the other and again abuan said unfortunately no whoever Embraces Islam remains a Muslim again he asks him have you ever fought with him he said yes and sometimes we win sometimes we lose said okay now uh uh does he break any promises whenever he gives you a promise does he break break it does he break agreements and does not honor them he said no well Norm no and now we have a truce between him and ourselves and we don't know what he might do through this 10 years period abuan tells us that this was the only possible negative thing that I could say against the prophet he wasn't a Muslim and he was afraid that his people would indicate to the uh uh Roman leader that he was telling a lie otherwise he he said that if it weren't for my people I would have fed the whole way but I had people covering me so again he asked him the final question had anyone before him claimed that he's being re revealed from the heavens had any one before him brought something similar to that so again Abu sufyan said no and then this Roman leader started to analyze his questions and he told him I ask you these questions to analiz the character of this messenger if he had a king in his ancestors then he was asking for the power of his family if he uh uh uh was a liar then maybe he could have lied but if he does not lie to humans he would not lie to the lord of the heavens claiming that he is revealing things to him I asked you about those who follow him and you told me that it was the weak and the poor and this is exactly what happens with prophets and messengers of Allah they're always followed by the weak and the poor and they shall inherit the earth and I've asked you about wars between you and you told me he wins some and he loses some and this is the custom uh of this life life that the world is not stable for one the whole time it's ups and downs and I ask you about does anyone reject his religion and you told me no and this is faith and belief once it is inside your heart it is never out again whenever one is a Believer and this by itself today is a clear example of the truthness of Islam Islam look at Muslims worldwide how many of the Muslims convert to Christianity or to or to Judaism or how many Muslims reject Islam completely it is negligible one would claim yes if you change your religion you'll be executed and this claim is not true simply because there is no country on Earth that does this except one country and it's very difficult to implement it if you have Muslims in Indonesia we have more than 200 million Muslims you have Muslims in India and so on and no one is rejecting alhamdulillah the religion of Islam we have a short break stay tuned we will be back [Music] so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize God and enjoy his blessings in this life and his Mercy in this life and in the Hereafter as well Allah Alman Al each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of Allah the Almighty which no one shares or is compared to Allah in it [Music] alayum and welcome back so the question and answer session was over then the leader of the Romans told his verdict and swore by Allah that if this man is EXA L as you describe him then I believe that it will not be long before he owns the land that I'm standing on at the moment and by Allah I swear if I knew that they would let me I would go to him and I would wash his feet with my own hands and accept the religion that he is bringing with him as he said this the whole Court was in shouting and Chaos because they did not like what they heard from their leader and Abu sufyan with his company left and he told his companions that by Allah Muhammad's matter is so high that the king of the yellows because the Romans used to be known as the yellows not as in cowards but their color and their skin fair skin and blonde hair that the king of the yellows feared him we were told that he again gathered his priests and the dignitaries of Rome and he introduced to them Islam and he instructed that all the doors to be locked and no one to leave and once they heard this from him from their leader inviting them to Islam they started shouting and wanting to escape to so that they can get their arms and fight and he calmed them down and said to them I was just testing you and he did not accept Islam because he wanted his throne more than Islam though he believed in Islam as we were told one of the other messengers of our Prophet was abdah he was sent with a message from the prophet alhat wasam to the leader of Persia to to whom was known as KRA and this is the name of whoever took position on top of the of the uh uh Throne of Persia some narrations say that he gave the letter himself others say no he gave it to uh another man whose name was Al Sawa and he was the ruler and the king of bahin and bahin was the region east of Arabia it was not the country bahin as we know it now it was the whole Eastern province of Arabia Abdullah was a companion of the Prophet Alat wasam and he was a very funny funny man he Lo liked practical jokes we were told that once the prophet Sall wasallam made him the Amir the leader of his company his companions and they went in a military expedition in a small Detachment and it was very cold they built a very big fire and they were close to it warming up because it was very very cold and they did something that he did not like so he told them that I'm your Amir and our Prophet Alam ordered you to obey me isn't that right he said yes so he told them I order you to throw yourselves in this fire and some of them felt like doing it in obedience to the prophet Sall wasallam but then they came back to their senses and said by Allah we came out in obedience to the prophet Alam to escape Hellfire and now you want us to go into it this is not logical and he told him I was just fooling around sit down when they went back to the prophet wasallam and told him about this practical joke that almost caused them to throw themselves in fire he told them a very important Hadith that became a condition and a rule to be followed and that is there is no obedience to any person in committing sin or in harming yourself so no matter who instructs you to do something have it be your ruler your king your Amir your father your mother your husband if if you're a wife of course you are not allowed to obey in sin you can only obey if it's something that is permissible or of course if it's obligatory abdah may Allah be pleased with him who was sent to the Persian leader he was later on arrested and caught and held captive by the Romans in one of the wars between them and the ruler of the Romans at that area the king of the Romans wanted to test him especially when he came to know that he was the companion of the Prophet Alam so he was a very precious catch so he told them to to torture him so that he would reject Islam and he would not comply so he told them to starve him almost close to death and they kept him without food or water for so many days and then they put pork meat in front of him so that he could eat and survive and he wouldn't so the king brought him and told him why don't you eat so that you don't die Abdullah the companion of the Prophet Alam said by Allah it's mentioned in our Quran in our holy book that if you are afraid of dying it is permissible for you to eat dead meat it's permissible for you to eat swine but I didn't want I did not want to satisfy you in seeing me weak and eating eating this forbidden meat for me though it's now permissible for me to eat I just want they didn't want to give you the pleasure of this and their King was Furious he ordered him to be crucified just to put on to be put on the cross and tied and then he instructed one of his archers to throw his arrows very close to him but not to hit him and he did not even blink may Allah be pleased with him again again this made their King madder and madder so he instructed his people to bring a big bowl and he filled it up with water and he boiled that water after building a very big fire under it and then brought one of the prisoners of the Muslims and he threw him in that boiling water until it you can see the bones of the flesh it all went down and in this incident Abdullah cried because they were taking him to throw him in the same uh uh boiling water and the King was happy so he told them bring him they brought him and he told him what why are you crying you're afraid right you're you're scared right he said by Allah I'm not afraid of death I just wish that I had 100 Souls that would be sacrificed in the sake of Allah and that you would throw me on and on and on for a hundred times the King was astonished of this strength and belief of that man he thought for a second and ask Abdullah would you kiss my head and I'll set you free what kind of defiance are you in state of defiance just kiss my head and I'll set you free you're not a prisoner anymore Abdallah thought it over and said I'll kiss your head but you set me free and all the Muslim prisoners and there were about 80 or 100 of them the king said okay I'll do that so Abdullah went to this Roman King and he kissed his head and the pis and and and the King honored his promise and he set all the prisoners free they all went to Allah be pleased with him who was the khif at the time and Abdullah told him about what happened with him Omar felt so proud of what Abdullah did by Saving these companions these uh uh uh prisoners of War Muslim prisoners of war and he said to those who were around him by Allah it's a duty upon everyone among you to kiss abdullah's head in honoring him as he kissed the the head of the Roman ruler and they all stood and kissed his head in appreciation to what he had done me Allah be pleased with him going back to the letter abdah Allah be pleased with him gave the letter to the head of the Persian Empire and out of arrogance the man did not like what he read because it was an invitation from the the prophet Alat wasam that accept Islam and you will be safe those you and those who are under you and you will be rewarded by Allah asael and if you do not accept Islam then the burden of your followers will be upon you so imagine if this comes to you and you are the leader of a great Empire such as Persia and at the time they had only two empires the Roman the Romans and the Persians so if a small country a small tribe sends you a letter such as this how would you feel out of arrogance he tore the letter and he said a slave of mine comes and introduces his religion wants me to follow him this is unacceptable and once the prophet wasallam knew of his is tearing his letter he prayed to Allah that Allah would tear his kingdom kisra sent to his agent to his ruler of Yemen his name was ban he told him send two men look at the arrogance send two men to Muhammad and capture him and send him back to me in Persia so the ruler of ban sent two men to our Prophet they came to the prophet Alat and the minute the prophet saw them he was angry because they they were shaven and they had big mustaches and and this is you know one of the customs in some tribes they have big mustaches and and they claim that Eagles uh uh step and stand on these mustache because they're too big and it's form of you know showing your that you matal man and so on what did the prophet Alat say I believe we have to postpone this until we meet next time and until then [Music] [Music] m m [Music] [Music]"
