  "title": "Does skipping the Takbeer of movement behind the imam require sujood as sahu? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "rayan says if a person skipped a takbir of movement in prayer in congregation so to go to roku i have to say allahu akbar i'm following the imam the imam said allah i went into raku i forgot to say allahu akbar i forgot to utter it if i prayed with the imam the full prayer i don't have to offer prostration of forgetfulness because this is mandatory but because i forgot it or it was a mistake the imam covers me for it so i don't have to offer to you the sahu or prostration of forgetfulness if i skip to raqqa or more this means that when the imam offers salaam i'll stand up and be on my own in this case yes i have to offer to you the sahu"
