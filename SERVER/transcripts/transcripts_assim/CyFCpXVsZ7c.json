  "transcript": "Khan from India So a person is traveling from Saudi to India, if he doesn't fast one day due to travel, but he still completed 30 days due to the date difference, will he have to make up the one less day? And because he will complete 30 days, can he deliberately leave the fast on the day he's traveling, even though it's not difficult for him? Khan, regardless of the days you miss or you fast, if you skipped one day of Ramadan, it doesn't matter how many days you fasted as a total, whether 29, 30 or even 31, because there are different countries and different moon sightings. So just because you did manage to fast 29 days, but while traveling during the month of Ramadan, you skipped fasting one day due to that which is legitimate, you can't say, okay the total is 29 or 30 days I fasted, I don't have to make up for that day. No, you must make up for that day which you skipped during the month of Ramadan."
