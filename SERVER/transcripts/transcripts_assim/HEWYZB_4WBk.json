  "transcript": "Farhan from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sir, my question is, is there any concept of what goes around and comes around in Islam? For example, if I bully someone or if I judge someone or if I hurt someone, will I also get the same kind of treatment? Jazak Allah Khair. The concept of karma and what goes around, comes around, is not an Islamic concept. Yes, we believe that if you make a sin, you'll be held accountable for it and you'll be punished for it, if not in this life, in your grave, if not in your grave, then in the hereafter, on the day of judgment. But not necessarily if you bully someone, someone else would bully you. This might happen and this might not happen. It depends on Allah's judgment, Azza wa Jal."
