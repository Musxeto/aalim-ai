  "transcript": "Afzaan from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is my mom has a dog and the dog drinks from a bucket of water and my mom uses the same bucket of water to bathe the dog so the water in the bucket is najis hence the hair of the dog so what should I do Sheikh? This is the third time you asked me about this question Afzaan isn't it? I didn't clarify my question. Yahi you spoke about the question you asked me about the hair of the dog and I answered you only the saliva so now you're saying that he drinks from the bucket then he is bathed in the bucket and so what about the ruling of the hair well I'll ask you another question the dog licks its own skin and cleans its own skin what's the ruling on the hair the ruling is the same the hair is pure until proven otherwise and you don't have any proof move on leave the dog alone leave your mom alone don't make this an obsession don't ask me tomorrow about something that the dog enters the refrigerator and I don't know what happens afterwards don't make this an OCD"
