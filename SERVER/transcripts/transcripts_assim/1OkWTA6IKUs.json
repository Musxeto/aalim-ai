  "title": "\"A woman robs a man's intelligence\", \"No greater fitnah for men than women\" - Hadith assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "there is a Hadith that says that a woman can take a man's intelligence away and another one that says there is no great FNA for men than women what is the interpretation of these hadiths as for the Hadith they referred to in the beginning the prophet saysat wasam I have not seen any lacking in reason and religious commitment but at the same time more able to Rob wisdom of the wise except one of you women so when they complained and inquired why would we be lacking in reason and in religious commitment the prophet Alam explained by saying you're lacking um of reason is Allah mentioned in the Quran that the testimony of one man is equal to two women so you are half of the man's testimony and the lacking of religious commitment is that a woman has her monthly cycle which prevents her from praying and fasting for about a week every month and that would reduce her religious commitment not that she's sinful of course but because of that which Allah is testing her with she she is lower in religious commitment than a man is and the prophet saidat but at the same time women are more able to rob the wisdom of a wise man they have this wit this ability to do such a thing with a man so what does this mean it means that the prophet Alat wasam is highlighting to us the FNA and the test which women impose upon men due to their nature due to their character due to what Allah has installed in men where men are known to be fond of women so women with their charm and their ways can deprive a wise man from his intellect and they can play with him like children play with a toy and we see this in real life someone who's wise who's knowledgeable who is sought after for his advice all of a sudden trips and flips when a woman captivates his heart and mind he's wrapped around her finger and she has full control over him and we wonder Subhan Allah what's wrong with this guy he's known to have a sound reasoning but now look at him this happens now we cannot sugarcoat this this is part of a religion whether you like it or not who cares it is part of what Allah mentioned in the Quran it is part of what the prophet mentioned in the Hadith that men have a higher level than women men have a higher step over women and men are Guardians and protectors as mentioned in Ayah 34 chapter 4 men are Guardians and Protectors of over women for two reasons number one because Allah favored men over women end of the story we we can't sugarcoat this we can't beat the Bush this is how it is in Islam you like it you're more than welcome you don't no problem however this does not degrade women it doesn't mean that women are worthless as so many men use such Hadith to look down at their wives or their daughters and sisters imbecile ignorance they do this all the time this does not change the subject that Allah had favored men over women nevertheless the prophet highlighted the aspects that women lack some competencies when it comes to men and that is the lacking of memory sometimes s in the case of testimony so many women could be much more intelligent than men they can be higher in education and in degree they can be professors in mathematics in physics and men can be deficient can be ignorant don't have the capacity yet what the prophet was is referring to was an aspect of Shar which is related to testimony and being a witness over a specific thing likewise their religious commitment their inability to pray for seven or eight days a month or fast this is a test from Allah something that Allah pre-ordained upon women women have no control over it and there's no sin on them nevertheless this is how Allah mandated it never but there are so many women who exceed men in religious commitment they pray more night prayer they fast more voluntary fasting they read more Quran they can be more knowledgeable in Islam and in in does not me mean anything that they are of a lower grade that we look down upon them but this is how Allah made things so that the ship of Life Could Sail on with one captain and lots of uh um assistants and helpers and Allah Asel Knows Best"
