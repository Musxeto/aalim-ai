  "transcript": "Abrar says he's looking after parents exclusive for sons if the husband or in-laws of the daughters do not permit them to bring their parents at the daughters home what should the daughters do can they go against their husbands the go against their husbands will and bring home their mother if sons are unwilling to keep their old mother a bra the responsibility of the parents is not exclusive to a gender it is to be shared equally by all their offspring so if I have three boys and three girls when I'm old I am NOT the responsibility of my eldest son as so many families think or my wife the mother is old she's not a responsibility of the girls rather all of my children share my responsibility having said that my son is not obliged to take me in his house because if his wife says no I do not want to serve your father and it's not my responsibility to do so and I'd like to have my privacy in my own home this is her god-given right as for the daughters if my wife says I'd like to bring my mother to live with us she's old she's senile and she needs people to take care of her it is my god-given right to say no this is my house I'm the man of the house I do not allow you to do so because I don't want anyone in my house now is it this is this the ideal thing no of course not if I as a husband if my wife says this I would say deaf she's more than welcome to stay for ten years your mother is my mother let's come in but people differ and I cannot blame someone for demanding his own right so as a girl as a wife you have no right in allowing or admitting anyone to enter your husband's house without his permission let alone stay long-term he has all the right to do so now your in-laws have no say in this but most likely you are living in their homes so again you cannot do that without their permission and most likely they would not permit this because you're living with them so how would they introduce someone who's none muharram to them a total stranger and a burden to their health to their house this is not logical having said that the responsibility lies among them all they should contribute financially to get a decent home for their parents for the mother for the father with an adequate servant that would serve them take care of them to the best of their ability now this is a shared responsibility but let us assume that the three boys are evil they're not willing to contribute a penny and they're not willing to take care of their old father or mother and the three girls are also poor they are dependent on their husbands and their husbands are not approving of them to move in or to take in their mother-in-law for example so now the mother is stranded no one is to take is taking care of her financially and no one is helping her and she needs help what to do in this case this becomes an obligation upon individuals so if two of the girls for example refuse and three of the boys totally refuse and you are the only girl a bra who is caring for her mom you tried everything in your possession to care for her and allocate a place for a decent remaining days of her life to be spent in but without a veil in this case it becomes an obligation upon you even if you have to divorce your husband and take care of your mother this is a must because this responsibility cannot be shared by anyone else no one is willing to take the responsibility except you and you know the great punishment awaiting for those who fail and the great reward awaiting those who do in this case it becomes an obligation upon you and Allah knows best"
