  "title": "Awrah was exposed during salah, is the prayer valid? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "says he was praying and while he was in record or in sujud he felt some breeze hitting his back and he was afraid that part of his aura his t-shirt was raised a bit and part of his backside was exposed but he wasn't certain when he raised up it was clear to him that it was exposed so he's saying is my prayer valid the answer is yes when aura that is between the navel and your knees is exposed temporarily unintentionally and you do what is needed to cover it once you are certain of it then your prayer is valid because this is not intended and it did not last for a long time unlike someone who prayed for example and after finishing four raka's he discovered that his whole backside aura thighs and buttocks and the whole nine yards was exposed said whoa your prayer is invalid even if you did not know it you have to go and pray because it was explode for a long period of time the of the salat but to expose a part of it and this happens a lot with women so she's praying and then she sees a strand of her hair this is aura so does she need to break her prayer and restart it all over again that says no she can just simply fix it and cover it and that does the job"
