  "transcript": "is asking if a person it cannot produce he is Sarah and he doesn't have the ability to have children so is it permissible for him to get married and the scholars have commented on this and said that this is totally permissible if the woman knows of his case and she's fine with that see marriage is not only about reproduction having children it's not all about intimacy there are there are so many things more to marriage than this however this is the core of marriage so if a person is unable to have children or even worse if a person is impotent and he's unable to have intimacy with his wife he needs someone to share the house with him he needs someone to talk to he needs someone to take care of him if he's sick so there is no problem anything getting married to a woman who knows his condition is she's fine with that maybe another woman who does not bear children maybe a woman who already has children and doesn't want anymore from another person maybe there's so many possibilities and in short yes but the most important condition is that you do not deceive people you come out clean and tell those you're proposing to that this is my medical condition or this is the way I am"
