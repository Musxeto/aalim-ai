  "transcript": "uh blood blood is one of the NES but uh the sahabas to said that they prayed together after theat while blood was oing out of them what's your opinion the vast majority of Scholars of Islam consider human blood to be n based on but the scholars such as and the likes they consider it not to be NIS based on what Al IM reported that said the people since the time of the companions whenever they had wounds in battles they used to pray with their wounds and Omar may Allah be pleased with him when he was stabbed in fer prayer he prayed while his wound was gushing with blood so this is an indication that the human blood is not NIS because there is no clear evidence from the Quran the Quran referring to gushing blood of a slaughtered animal not from humans so human blood is pure except if it comes out of the private part if it comes out from the private parts it's NIS and this is the most authentic opinion and Allah Knows Best"
