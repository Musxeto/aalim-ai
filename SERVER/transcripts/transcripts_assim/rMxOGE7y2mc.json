  "transcript": "Muhammad says, \"Is it allowed to personify countries by an image as a woman?\" For example, back in India, there is a famous slogan which says victory to mother India where the country is shown as an ugly dressed Hindu goddess. I don't feel comfortable while saying such things. Uh moreover recently a Muslim politician said that no Muslim should say this. Is uh he right? I have no knowledge of what you are referring to Muhammad. Nevertheless, to have an image of a woman claiming she's a goddess, this is total blasphemy. And for us as Muslims, we don't believe in this, let alone repeat it or sing it or even respect it. This is not part of our religion and our conviction and no one can force you to believe in something that you don't want to believe and India is well known for its freedom of religion and I don't know if this is applicable now or not but definitely you are not permitted to repeat such uh sayings or slogans if they have in their national anthem where you bow to something of the the the sort a goddess or a flag or a country. We don't bow except to Allahawel. We don't prostrate except to Allahawel. Not even to the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam. We do not bow or prostrate. Therefore, what you're asking about is totally uh uh not permissible for a Muslim to do. And it is important to acknowledge the fact that we are Muslims initially. Then we are citizens of the country we live in. So I'm a Muslim, then I'm a Saudi. It's not the other way around. I'm a Muslim, then I'm an Indian. I'm a Muslim, then I'm an American. But it is totally unacceptable to be a citizen of a country and give the priority to your country over your religion. This is totally un uh acceptable in Islam."
