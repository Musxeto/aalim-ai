  "transcript": "Muhammad from the UK Salam alikum Salam uh please explain what we should do when the time of the the remaining time of the current prayer is too short to meet the conditions such as doing avolution or covering the body or the major ritual bath an Islam kway uh they quoted IB from his explanation of as saying that it's more important to fulfill the condition of praying on time than any other condition but he said it but he said if a person purposely delays then he has to fulfill the condition even if it means missing the time so I'd like to know what each of the following people should do the one with an excuse the one who delayed but would have made it on time but then something occurred out of their control and the one who delayed with no excuse until they knew there wasn't enough time time to meet the conditions such as doing apption okay basically basically Muhammad this requires a long explanation in a nutshell if you wake up late and there is one minute for the sun to rise and you have to answer the call of Nature and you have to put on your clothes and you have to face the and pray you have to do this even if the sun rises and you're excused because you have a reason you have a legitimate reason you were asleep if you deliberately delayed the prayer until there was a minute left and then you want to do so that you would catch one ra before the sun rises no this is not valid it's your mistake it's your sin and your prayer is invalid because you delayed it purposely if it was beyond your ability and unintentionally it takes the same ruling as waking up late and Allah Knows Best"
