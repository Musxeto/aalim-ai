  "transcript": "[Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] dear brothers and sisters and welcome to a new segment of Youth talk today's topic inshallah we're going to talk about the influence of the [Music] peers as you know the peer has a great influence over his friend or those that talk and intermingle with and the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam has gave us an example of a good friend a good peer and a bad one he said that the good peer is like a person that sells perfumes so either you buy from him and you get this nice fragrance or he gives it to you or he just gives you a trial of it so in all cases eventually you're going to get something that is good while a back Pier is like a blacksmith who works with coal and iron and if it does not burn your clothes if it does not hurt you then the least you get is a bad smell that sticks to your body and clothes just because you've been with him and of course we all have friends no one can live alone without friends and peers and people that socialize with him but what does Islam say about this does Islam tell us to go with certain friends and avoid others this is what we try we will what we'll try to explain and uh elaborate on and I'd like to hear your questions and inquiries and if you have anything to comment on so does anybody have a question okay yeah uh I wanted to ask about um uh throughout uh my years I've developed u a relationship with with with several female female companions uh and uh basically uh I mean uh I mean I'll talk to them on campus or or or we'll go out together to a to a coffee shop or whatever uh like like I mean will be maybe me and me and a female friend alone in my car or will be me and a female friend in the Library talking or wherever on campus talking and I've been uh criticized quite a bit uh you know peers have been saying I should not I should not be just me and another female alone in my car or I should not just be me and a female sitting together uh in the library alone or and although my intentions my intentions might be uh clean I mean uh no dirty intentions whatsoever I still been criticized and I wanted to get your some feedback maybe on that uh topic the problem is do we really have clean intentions now this is a controversial issue a lot of the guys in in the west or at least in societies that have uh that that mix between females and males they would say they would uh claim that they have clean intentions that they don't have any uh uh bad intentions or sexual uh implications from their relationship this might be true true in a small portion because if you know 100 females of course you'll be clean in tension with 99 of them one of them it has to click you could work with a secretary you could study with your classmate which is which which happens to be a female for let's say a year or two 5 years 10 years what somewhere down the line it will click but Islam comes to hold this clicking to stop it to prevent it now if you have acquaintances if you have friends female friends okay let's assume that you don't have any feelings towards them although I doubt this but if you do you should check your physician because the hormones you have there's something wrong in the home it's natural it's natural for a man to be attracted to a woman and it's natural for a woman to be attracted to a male a man otherwise there's something wrong so but presumingly presumingly that there is no affection there's no attraction yet from your side you cannot guarantee that there is no affection from her side okay you you you you may not have a crush on her but she might have a crush on you and then you will the sin of tempting that poor girl also you have to bear in mind that we follow the Quran and the Sunnah and in the Quran and in the Sunnah we are given few instructions that governs our relationship with the other sex so for being alone with a woman in a car or in a room that is is a complete stranger to me she's not a sister she's not my daughter she's not my wife she's not my aunt she's not my mother-in-law these uh ladies I can talk and and be alone with because I cannot marry them by law by Islam but to be alone with someone that does not fall under that category is forbidden because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said that if a man sits or stays in a one place with a woman without anybody else with them then the third party in that place is the shitan Satan and what do you expect Satan is going to tell him teach your Quran he's not going to tell you that he's going to try his best for you to sin and as I mentioned earlier Allah said in the Quran do not follow the footsteps of Satan and he doesn't come to you all of a sudden says commit adultery no he doesn't nobody would he never go into anyone and tell him to do so uh on the spot but he will come in steps he will tell you there's nothing wrong in gazing looking at her okay I looked at her an honest look but then well go down and go up and go sideways you know look me really look and see the configurations of the thing in front of me and and and then there's nothing wrong in talking and there's nothing wrong in smiling the prophet said smiling in your brother's face is a is a good reward so whenever I go I see my friend Ali I do this but when I see my friend Janet I said hi what are you doing said well the prophet said I said I have to smile and I'm smiling and afterwards he said there's nothing wrong in talking taking a homework you know she she needs help help I have to do give it to her you know I'm the only savior here I have to save her from uh the problem she's in there's nothing wrong in shaking hands what do you think think I'm nuts this girl comes to me in front of everybody else and and puts her hat out and I just say I can't shake hands my heart is clean my intention is okay it's a sin yes but my intention is clean and you shake hands and then there's nothing wrong in uh uh inviting invite her for a cup of coffee and maybe have lunch together and maybe chat on the phone for half an hour or an hour maybe go see a movie maybe you know go for a picnic or so go for a drive or so and so on until the inevitable happens now this no one can claim that does not happen this is the typical uh uh story that takes place wherever you have mixes between uh the Sexes whether in school whether in college whether at work no one not even in the states even those or in the west generally even those who are married if they work in a a workplace with uh females eventually they're going to have to fall in sin and and if you make a a survey you would find that about 70% of the people that work in mixed uh areas and working places have uh cheated on their wives and there are so many movies that tell you about this and you don't have to go to the movies to find out about this you can see it in real life and that it's just a one night stand why did he do that he was I was under pressure you know I had to work in some other city and she was there and well and kiss a makeup so I'm sorry so she does the same and this is what Allah does not want to happen that why that is why he puts these restrictions now if you still insist that you not have any bad intentions then you have the only thing you have to do is to stick to the Quran and Sunnah in the Quran and Sunnah we are told you're not allowed to intermingle with females you are not allowed to uh uh mix with them because their temptation is so great that Allah wants to protect you and to protect her so you must not have any friendship with the opposite sex because it does influence your heart maybe it doesn't influence it now but eventually when it clicks you're going to have sleepless nights you're going to keep on thinking and contemplating and and not being able to focus on your studies because of that particular girl and definitely it's not not going to be the right way of you know proposing and getting married and this does never h it never happens the all all what you see is a boyfriend taking a girlfriend going out together for uh couple of months couple of year it's adultery it's not you know they say they make it sound nice you know well well I'm going I'm going out with uh my girl I have a girlfriend we go out together but don't say we go go out you say we we do adultery which is a major major sin and and you may not if you accept it for yourself you may not accept it for your mom you would not accept it for your sister definitely you would not accept it for your daughter and if you do then that's a big problem as in in non-muslim countries that is a big problem but even in non-muslim countries still males husbands fathers Brothers do possess some sort of jealousy and they do not accept this to happen to their loved ones a sister a daughter or uh a wife uh I think this answers your question we will take a short pause here and we will be back [Music] inshallah I'm RI Ansari from the United States and you're watching peace tvam alayum and welcome back to youth talk we are talking about the uh peer influence and we the the floor is open for any uh suggestions or questions yes sir my name is Aon I have a question also about criticism I get criticized you know of course I have a lot of friends from school time and very close friends and they're very good people but the problem is by time when we entered College some of them who start drinking some of them who start actually went in doing drugs but basically they're very good people and I and I know them for a very long time I don't know should I continue with them or what's the situation what should I do in this is a common problem but to bring it from the very beginning you've said that they are good friends how do you define good see it's an elastic word so I could have uh someone that does everything that I ask from him and and classify him as good although he helps me in getting my drugs he helps me skip school he helps me do the bad things that I want to do and won't be able to do it without his help so I would classify him as a good friend and at the same time if someone tells me come and pray or let's go for om or there's a poor man that needs money let's help him I would classify him as bad news because he's boring he's not a good friend every time I sit with him he says hell and heaven do this don't do that Allah says in the Quran the prophet said in the Hadith every time I sit with him whenever I want to say a good joke well that good good to me back to him uh if I want to say a good joke he says no this is Haram you're mocking of people this is it has sexual implications it's it's forbidden for you to say such such a thing so we have to know who is your good friend and how do I determine if this friend is good or bad but I think I understand what you mean because you mean by saying a good friend is a person although away from his religious uh uh belief he is a is a person that stands by you when you need him that gives you a helping hand whenever you need one that a person that you could trust with your secrets so if this is your classification of a good friend assuming that it is if they do sin in front of you if they abuse drugs or if they drink or if they fornicate or if they do any of these major s sins you are not allowed to stay with them while they are performing these sins I know a lot of people that do not drink but whenever they go out with the friends and the friends drink they sit with them and they don't drink they only take soft drinks now they think that by doing this they have not committed anything that is Haram on the contrary they have done a major sin because the prophet Alat wasam said that it is not lawful for a person who believes in Allah in the day of judgment to sit on a table where wine and form of of alcoholic drinks is turned around though he's not drinking I have a comment like uh in one of the previous episodes we said that uh that Allah is most merciful and uh there's a saying also and once I asked you about this I guess and and you said that if I'm sitting in a place and my intentions are good like I'm there I'm not because you know I'm not there because of the drinking and and you know all that I'm just there to have a good time or I'm there to sit with my friends so he said that Allah is most merciful so I was just wondering about your feedback or what do you think of this did I ever say that guys then you misunderstood me and I hope the brothers there that watching this program did not misunderstand me I said you cannot have good intention with bad deeds and I gave you an example I think and I guess as you did uh I gave you an example of someone going into the discotek to dance drink socialize with the intention of calling that nice blonde girl to Islam I told you this is this is not acceptable at all even if this gu H has the clearest intentions of all it does not justify you falling in sin so this is not acceptable at all you may have the best time of your life provid you do not sin but to go out with people that drink and you know party and they're having fun and you don't drink but you're partying with them being there is a a reason for curse and doom from Allah and it's it's it's the same thing as being with the good guys so as in the Hadith the prophet told us that the Angels come back to Allah after visiting a place of Vick of remembering and calling Allah a group of people calling Allah studying like we're doing now studying the Hadith the Quran so Allah asked them where have you been and he knows but he is asking them just to show the the his creatures about this this situation so they told him that we passed by a group of people calling you and remembering you so he said okay bear witness that I have forgiven that I have for forgiven all of their sins so they say but there is this person among them who did not come for calling you or remembering you he just came for a reason you know he had he wants to borrow some money from this guy so he just said sat there and said yes he's just faking it you know he just want the money from that guy so Allah Almighty says that include him with them include him forgive his sins because the that group and that place they're sitting in is a blessed one so whoever comes in that place will be governed in that uh uh blessing of Allah this is an honor a gift from Allah but if you reverse this the same thing applies if you go in a place of sin and you sit there and maybe you're not having a good time you're just sitting there you know I'm there why don't why don't you leave well they're my friends you know they're my buddies and my you know I I can't leave them if you stay there the curse the dam of ofel will be on top of that person along with the others who are doing that sin so again I reiterate I did not say that I did not say that you may have good time with good intention and sin or uh uh be in a place of sin and and say that Allah is merciful Allah is definitely most merciful but that doesn't mean that he will let people go without punishment for making sin so if a person kills someone and say well I know you're merciful boom blow his head off what did you do say Allah Kim Allah is merciful yes but he will hold you accountable for what you have done to go back to your question if I remember and and recall it correctly uh now you must not stay with the bad guys while they are doing their sin now what about if they're not doing their sin can I still you know go out with them and again if you don't draw the line if you don't influence them they will influence you you can not have it you know split and saying no no they have their own sins and they have their own bad habits and I have my own good habits if you bring drink a very healthy and beautiful apple and you throw it in a box full of rotten apples you think that the rotten apples will become good again definitely not it will rot with the rotten apples and this would what would happen to you if you that's why we you know trim plants when they we have bad SE weeds around it we have to take it because it's going to affect it and you can sense this in water if you have a corpse if if you have a dead animal like for six seven days near uh a lake or something it will affect the taste and smell of the water and that is the peer if you go out with someone that is a good person he will eventually affect you whether you like it or not because whenever he talks to you he recalls Allah and remembers Allah whenever he seees something on the street you know people when when they see an accident they have this four lter word on on their mouths you know the the minute they see an accident accident whether it starts with an F or with an S this is typical now remember that if you say ill and this is the last thing you say you will enter Paradise now what happens is in 99% of the accidents you know when you're driving down the road and this trp comes to you the minute you see it you swear you curse you don't say why because of the influence of your peers and who is your peer at the moment TV set video cables movies and you see this 24 hours and it affects you so the minute you are in a in trouble you don't say Ya Allah while if you were uh uh to accompany good guys when whenever they see something they would say say Subhan Allah this sticks into your mind so whenever you see something you always say Subhan Allah how are you yeah May okay but when you when you are the good guy you say alhamdulillah even if he's not not Arab it is it sticks to you so by being with them I definitely think that this is not a good thing for you to do because they will influence you therefore you should try your best to change them don't you know abandon them try your best to give them da give them books give them leaflets uh bring them to good Gatherings teach them whatever you can with an open heart and with honesty let them sense your honesty that you love them it's not just because you want to dominate them or be on top of them just let them feel that you really love them and want the goodness to be for them as it is for you if you succeed alhamdulillah if you don't if you don't succeed then you should look for another group that uh does this and I think this is all the time we have for today's program I hope we have learned something extra and until we meet next time"
