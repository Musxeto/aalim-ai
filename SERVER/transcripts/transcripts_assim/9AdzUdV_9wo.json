  "transcript": "uh child is 17 years old and her mensis is not punctual she gets 13 year days of Menses and then she is clean for eight days and then she gets the 13 days again this is uh uh uh punctual it seems to me and therefore Allah told us that and the prophet told us that when the mensis is there a woman should stop praying and fasting once the menis is gone on she can resume that and it seems to me that she gets her menis for 13 days and then she's pure for 8 days this is uh um on time and she has to stop praying the 13 Days however she's instructed to analyze because we know that when the flow of blood comes then this is her menis the spotting before that is not counted so if a spot or two is are noticed then they have no value she should continue to pray the minute the blood flows and gushes in this case yes she has to consider this to be her menis and she has to stop once she sees her Purity and the Purity is recognized by one of two either by seeing the white thread like discharge that women see that is completely white no brownish no yellowish discharges with it or by the complete dryness so she is dry for a whole day 24 hours for example no no discharges at all nothing no colors once she see she once she sees this that is the sign of Purity she has to take herul and uh pray afterwards if she sees any type of discharge brownish or yellowish discharge she should ignore that because may Allah have Merc may Allah be pleased with her the companion of the prophet said we used to disregard any brownish or yellowish uh discharges after seeing the Purity so once you see your Purity kalas disregarded and for the8 days alhamdulillah uh um"
