  "transcript": "Hey what you know the brothers and sisters departed on the Sunnah he gave he be screaming after the maroney's well say no to me assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatu welcome to another episode of contemporary Islamic issues and concepts on her the TV I'm your host our commercial in this episode we will continue our discussion on the importance of seeking knowledge in Islam if you recall just to give you a recap from last episode the share had divided knowledge into three categories or what we can put into three categories the first category is knowledge that is compulsory for every single Muslim to seek and the these things relate to his daily needs and his personal religious needs after that the second category is communal knowledge which is knowledge that somebody or a group of people from the community have to seek and these things could be religious such as inheritance you know who gets what after a person passes away or such as medicine and engineering somebody in the community has to seek knowledge in this category as well the third category is knowledge which is prohibited not because of it being knowledge by Islam but because of those actions being prohibited in Islam so I'm gonna start off by welcoming our wonderful guest yeah awesome and hacking listen Ahmad echo and welcome to the show Ronnie comes salaam the lawyer what a casul sure so I want to start you off with a small question do you think that it's important or going to an Islamic University is important for you to be an Islamic scholar or for anybody who wants to seek Islamic education does he have to do it through an Islamic University or can you just go to any share he wants I know Haman hamdulillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa salam ala carte Abdul you are a Saudi in Edina mohamed anwar do Sophia's Reina my bad knowledge is not limited to a university as many people think nowadays it's a convenient place to have a collection of Sciences and scholars per se in one place where you can access knowledge through the however is not the ideal way of seeking knowledge because we've seen this through the academic process that out of a hundred students who go and seek knowledge in Islamic Sciences maybe you get one or two maybe less who are qualified to be scholars so you end up with people with bachelor degrees in Islamic studies but poly Sharia or in a solid Dean or in hadith or in Quran but they don't have the essence of the knowledge because the only took the very little of everything where is needed to Pastor yes and usually once they pass the exam if you come couple of weeks later and ask them about what they had examined they had the exams in they would fail like 70% of giving you the right answer because it's gone this type of knowledge is not concrete it's not solid while going to a sheikh as we see in the message in the halacha in the circles who is a real proper Sheikh who has knowledge in most if not all Sciences related to Islam going there as the set of explained and described and bending your knees in front of the share when he is giving his course or lecture noting down revising what you have noted down in the evening having a set of questions going the following day asking to share your questions clarifying your doubts and noting it down this is the proper way of seeking knowledge because this is both systematic and solid in a classroom in a university you're sitting there for an hour maybe you doze a bit when this when the the doctor or the teacher is teaching maybe you skip a class or two but at the end the result what counts is the examination paper so if you do well in it you pass you may be also an honor student but this does not mean that you are a good students of knowledge or a scholar so what would you say it makes a person a religious scholar if not phd's if not any paper certificate how could you recognize this person as a religious scholar whereas this person is not I mean both of them could have been a graduate of the same ph.d program but how do we know this one is a scholar and this was not you see this many times people say oh he's not a scholar but sometimes he has the same degree as somebody who everybody considered as a scholar houses done well you have to look into his credentials yeah the greatest scholars of all times with a university graduates no course not but at the same time they graduated from the messages which was itself more of a university so if you look at those who teach in universities they are either doctors or assistant professors or professors but not necessarily they are scholars they are good in their papers they write the research researchers they produce but it is not necessarily that they are scholars look at event a Mia look at him in Hawaii look at him in kaffir look at that half of the van Hodja look at the four Imams of Islam none of them was a university graduate but they traveled the world acquiring the knowledge they have like Sheikh al-islam Ali Mohammed the Imam of the Hamburg school of thought he went from Baalbek Iraq to Syria to Egypt to Horus on where it is north east of Iran and so on it was all suddenly you had nothing of Shia hamdullah at the time and he went to Yemen and heard from the reserve and and the compiler of whom son he went to Makkah and Madinah and they didn't have any cars or airplanes they had to do this on foot mostly and until he was about 40 years of age he used to travel on foot and he used to work to earn food while he is traveling so these people did not graduate from universities abdul-aziz even bad Hermann I they mean he didn't graduate from though he used to teach in universities as well so it is important to know that there are characteristics of such scholars that you should learn from and that it is not specifically limited to university that would qualify you to be a scholar so if it's if it's not limited to university and obviously they're sure you that you can attend class in the Masjid now the issue is what we face nowadays to relate it to you know a contemporary issue is that almost every mustard has some sort of share sitting giving this lecture you know he has classes going on routinely how do we know this is the person who take from and do we just attend any classes there steps to learning Islamic knowledge is there level 1 level 2 level 3 like laid out format that we need to follow or you know or do we just sit in any class and just benefit at hunger and how do we do this you've asked me two questions yes one is about the first one being about which share do we take from because there's so many nowadays and the second is which classes do we attend of the issue take it easy on me because so much information it makes me you know a little kid so let's start let's start with the first one I can it sure do we take from there's many circles which one do we go to this is something that you have to make a research in first of all not everyone who has a PhD is qualified he's not a shake in the sense because being a scholar requires that you have recommendations from other scholars who are true real scholars we nowadays have a lot of wannabe scholars and they probably get recommendations from other wannabe scholars as well and you can judge by their features by their characteristics by their art either that they're not real scholars so if someone is teaching in a Masjid what's your name ah hey my name is abu do Janna assume yeah what's your real name this is my real name he looks around you so you know in a dubious matter what's your background I'm a student of Shu who are your sure hamad al Masri and abdullah al beb√© yes I don't know these guys what are you talking about these are Shu of Islam yeah I don't know what you're talking about give me names I know so these are the names I have so what do you preach I preach Khilafah Mike reach that Islam will rise over the bodies of the infidels of the kafir and we have to kill and you have to blow up people and we have whoa I think you're in the wrong message get the heck outta here before someone arrests you this is not a scholar though he has a long beard though maybe he wears a turban black blue whatever color though his robe is short so a proper scholar has to be acknowledged by proper scholars worldwide they know that this guy yeah we have no objection to his teachings mashallah his sound he has to have a good Ikeda so even if he has like six or seven PhDs and Phil and si etc but he says Allah is everywhere what do you mean by everywhere logical is above his throne as mentioned in seven places in the Quran so no no no no he's not above his from this is metaphorical Allah is everywhere this guy's a kid is corrupt whether he's a Shari his maturity his Marta silly now with the distinction between the four extremes but still he's not appropriate for you to learn from because you're still fresh you're like a doe he may he may make you a cross on me make you a big loaf of toast depending on how he deals with you but you must not go to such a person who has a corrupt Ikeda who doesn't know the attributes of allah azza wajal who does not recognize the beautiful attributes of allah subhanaw taala he has to be well-versed in the sciences different Sciences so he has to be fluent in Arabic which is very important because imagine a scholar who does not speak Arabic mm-hmm and he gives the fear of Quran speak everybody did you get this knowledge masha'Allah you can't be a computer how do you know that women Sharia law either what does the rusick mean what does what mean and this is one of the shortest sewers of the Quran we read it every Salah he says I don't know look if you don't know how are you gonna interpret it so I'm gonna read the commentary who wrote the commentary I don't know sorry international or someone so you're relying on someone's interpretation so you're interpreting somebody else's interpretation and you're commenting and you becoming a scholar you cannot be a scholar Sheikh before you continue the the list of qualities to look for in a teacher we're gonna go for a short break so dear viewers just to recap the ship has told us the first point that he mentioned was that the person that we are taking from has to be approved by the other scholars around him not just hold a PhD or dress in a way that looks like a scholar but rather approved by true scholars around the world or around his community that approved him of being a scholar before you actually go seek knowledge from him so stay tuned as soon as we come back we will speak about the other qualities to look for in a scholar stay tuned Oh welcome back to contemporary Islamic issues on her the TV now before we took that short break we were discussing the importance of seeking knowledge in Islam Schiff so far you've told us couple of points or a couple of things to look for when we search for a scholar to study from just to recap for the viewer some of them were he has to be approved by the scholars around him it's not that he just has a PhD or he dresses in a certain way that he can go to a circle and start preaching rather people need to acknowledge him as a scholar for him to be an Islamic scholar the the second thing that you mentioned was his leader has to be correct so especially for the beginners because they don't know which LP that's correct so you have to go to somebody who you can trust in all aspects the third is that he needs to know Arabic if he's going to translate Islamic knowledge from Arabic he can't be just giving it from a commentary in English you know translated by God knows who you know takes a book and says ok I'm reading the English translation of the corner I'm giving you my thoughts on this rather he needs to know Arabic check if you can mention a couple of more points I know there's many characteristics that you need to look for a couple of vital points that you think are very important for the viewers and then we can move on to a different question in chawla in our conversation ok as you've mentioned the sky is the limit but one of the most important characteristic that need to be found in a scholar is clearly displayed in a statement that the seller fused to say and described those who attend the gathering and the classes of imam ahmed they say that his huge class he's an imam he's not a scholar he is the scholars of Islam they used to attend about 5,000 people in his class imagine this huge number attending his class scholars say that 500 only of them were students of knowledge writing down his hadith writing down his verdicts and statements the rest the 4500 were only there to learn from the way he speak the way he looks his etiquette his model conduct so it is extremely essential to learn from a scholar who has such qualities because scholars say that beginners in seeking knowledge must not read in it Ben hasn't books an anomaly but Haslam is an imam but of the very school why do they prevent people from studying his books at the beginning they say because he had a very sharp tongue and he spoke ill about all four schools of thought and all other scholars who went in his opinion against the Quran and Sunna or used pious or analogy and he was very very rough on them so scholars say if you begin reading his books and learn from the way he debates and communicates you end up being like him likewise nowadays we have a group of Muslims who have excellent knowledge in up either in hadith in Quran in Arabic the good students of knowledge however they are ill-mannered so whoever is not following there four or five she or they are not in accordance to the main hatch and they are not part of the Salafi Nia and they take out all scholars of Islam except a handful that they are still dodgy about and they don't have the guts to speak ill about because Muslims accept them but the others have no problem in discrediting them in talking ill about them this is not dour dour is to communicate is to point out mistakes in a nice and kind fashion a rift is essential in such things therefore such people we tell the students of knowledge or the beginners not to go to them because going to them corrupts their way of learning and makes them think high of themselves low of every single one else okay and then if if you remember from the beginning of the episode I threw the two questions at you at once so we've dealt with the first question the second one was which classes should he start with how does he know which books to start how does he know should you just enter to see Durbin can see right away or is there something he needs to do before is there steps like the university you know they introduced you to have classes like Vic 101 is it the same way when it comes to studying with you or is it different okay it's human nature that you have to crawl before you walk and you have to walk before you run you can't simply hit the road running as they say but you have to do it gradually and this is human nature if you eat a good meal and it's not yet digested fully and you put another meal onto it you will get a stomach ache and you have to do something about it people differ some people can eat a real big meal and have no problem others can only eat an apple and therefore people differ in their digestion whether to food whether to information whether to knowledge so I find people being able to memorize 10 paper 10 pages a day and others struggle to memorize one page per week we have children going to school finishing the Quran remember in memorization in no time one of my nephew's mashallah memorized the whole Quran Kitab at O heed the agile Romania and different texts books when he was 10 years of age and he was given a certificate by sheer heaven as a meat for his achievement and that was normal for him kids my kids go to taffy the Quran it's a public school but by grade 9 they memorize the whole Quran so they people differ people find it easy to digest such such amount of information people find it difficult therefore you cannot have it all at once I often get the question share should I start with memorizing the Quran or learning books of art EDA or learning or learning Arabic this differs the most essential thing as we've started our episodes with is to know what is mandatory upon you so share should I amirite short al-baqarah or learn how to pray definitely learn a tray should I recite this amount or should I learn Arabic or do I have to know what is Haram for me to do know definitely you have to know that intoxicants Haram fornication is Haram etc before you learn Arabic because these are the essentials of your legend sure I've got this all covered up I know what is mandatory upon me I know how to pray so what should I do now well you have to take a bit from every place a flower from every garden so that you wouldn't be so pressured in one science and you may not get bored of it so go ahead and memorizing the Quran but don't do it in a year take your time like memorize one page a day and try to revise two or three pages of previous memorization at the same time you have to try and understand what you're memorizing so it helps you to understand what page I'm memorizing what is that F seer of it and it adds a lot of value to learn books of al Qaeda basic books of updater basic books of different fatwas on certain things and to take classes in Arabic because you must master Arabic to be a student for knowledge not just knowing Arabic you have to understand and master the language I remember once I was reading in a website of an imam in America so he was writing a translation of a hadith that the martyrs are seven other than the one who dies in the battlefield and he was saying that the person who dies in a burning building collapsed building who drowns and the one who is stabbed and this was shocking to me because I know the hadith and stabbing with the knife he's not included so I went to the Arabic version and found out that the word he's referring to is macaron and Moon is also means to be stabbed but this was not the intended intended thing in the hadith the intended thing in the hadith was from the word par une which is the plague so not own is the person who dies by the plague he's a martyr now such translation the brother knows Arabic but he is not fluent in Arabic that's why he made this mistake and imagine people in America reading this hadith and being mugged in the middle of the night or by a thug with a knife and he says give me your money or I'll kill you go ahead I want to be a martyr why are you doing this well the chef explained to us that the martyr is the one who's being stalked I want to die like a martyr no you're not die like a martyr it's a wrong interpretation so he has to master Arabic now when we talk about al-qaeda there are so many books in happy de and you cannot go and dive all of a sudden you first have to learn how to swim in shallow water so you have to take the basics such as get a batter head or a little are about this is one of the early books for the Muslims to learn Allah Allah ferrata get a bit of heat and then catch fish you had for example for Imam Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah have these books give you a sneak peek of our teaser and how to purify it from all innovated stuff from things that are not according to the Quran and Sunnah maybe if you finish them and thoroughly understand them you go to Allah P that was sutiya of Sheikh 17 years old afterwards you can go to Allah P de Italia and and so on so many books but this is a very beginning in fact you can start with the basic books such as under that I come from the tram is a very good book because it's based on hideki so you learn already and you understand the fact of it then you have local maram also it is good or to study short Metin of one of the four schools of thought not because you are doing taqlid but rather that you have to be focused and studying a specific text on foot covering it all then go back to purify it with the authentic ID and know what is right and what is wrong tips here you have to read a simple book of tafseer that gives you concrete knowledge in a simple language such as taste of society this book of acidity is one of the easiest and most contemporary tafseer and it's very nice after you can go to Edmund kefir and in Arabic you have to go to a specialist to teach you for example the as your Amir or if you are more fluent in Arabic you can go for the Alfia and so on so there's within Islamic knowledge there are levels and steps that need to be learned like you explained very well that you know you give us a general idea of each subject how to start and where to move on to afterwards I share who at the end of this episode so I want to thank you very much for joining us here and given us a wonderful conversation and a wonderful explanation of the concept of seeking knowledge in Islam thank you very much yeah exactly dear viewers I hope you benefited from today's episode and may allah subhanho wa taala help us in our endeavor to seek knowledge and until then may allah subhanho wa taala bless us all assalamu alaykum warahmatullahi wa barakaatuh Oh Mohamed Salah male you were selling was here today what you know the brothers and sisters departed on the Sony gay you hear it screaming after no Murali's well say no to me return to the guidance o Allah I will set you free"
