  "transcript": "zane says is using vpn permissible in countries where it is not allowed by the government if it is not allowed by the government if it is illegal and you will face penalties or jail time or fines in this case this is not permissible but if it's not illegal in the sense that you can download it you can use it and no one would hold you accountable for that then i see no reason why not to use it especially in countries where they restrict you from using free internet calls so expats who need to call their home countries through skype or whatsapp video or email or facetime or whatever yet everything is blocked and the only way they can call is through normal phone calls which cost an arm and a leg i see no problem in using this vpn as long as it's not illegal you're not held accountable you don't you won't face any uh jail time or be prosecuted for that or fines i see no reason why not to use it"
