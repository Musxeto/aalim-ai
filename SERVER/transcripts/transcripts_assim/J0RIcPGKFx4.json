  "title": "I think I’m ugly, I am not fair & have acne, I’m depressed & cry, will I be beautiful in Jannah?",
  "transcript": "A sister says, I cry everyday \nseeing myself in the mirror I'm not - also I have some \nor so many acne on my face   i'm in depression, it makes me feel worthless. In Jannah, will I be having acne? \nCan I look good? First of all,   those who are admitted to Jannah, \nthey are all perfect, in every sense. So they are all of the age of 33 years, not \nolder, not younger, and they are perfect in   their physical form. They are the most \nbeautiful anyone could have set eyes on. And they would have no defects, none whatsoever.   So this is something you have \nto rest assured, and know about. Secondly, why be depressed? The most common reason \nis that people who do not have strong belief in   the Divine Decree, which \nis the 6th pillar of Iman, which 99% of the Muslims don't know \nof. They know the 5 pillars of Islam.   But when you ask them about the \n6 pillars of Iman, they say, Huh? We don't know. Though it's an essential part \nof the Islam, without it they can't be Muslims.   Let me reiterate. They can't be Muslims if they don't fulfill \nthese 6 pillars of Iman. To believe in Allah,   to believe in the Day of Judgment, to believe \nin the Angels, to believe in the Messengers,   to believe in the Scriptures, and to believe \nin the Divine Decree, whether good or bad. So, to believe that Allah \nhas predestined everything,   and wrote it down 50,000 years \nbefore Allah created the Universe. This belief makes you content. So if I fall sick, \nand I'm tired, if I have a very bad sore throat,   and I cannot speak, and I cough, and I \nhave bad chest pain, how would I feel? I'd feel bad, I can't speak, I can't do \nthings, I can't behave normally, I'm sick.   But if I believe that this is something that Allah \nAlmighty preordained upon me, I feel content. This is what Allah chose for me. So who am I \nto know better? This is the best. Allah chose   that for me, for a reason, for a wisdom that \nhe only knows about. I'm content with that. Now, to have low self esteem, to look \ndown upon yourself, you're the most   miserable person on Earth, and you need to \nbe depressed. And this might be a punishment. For not looking at the many favors and blessings \nof Allah upon you. So I have acne on my skin,   I'm not fair, I'm dark, I'm this, I'm that. \nIs it the end of the world? Definitely not. Can you see, yes Shaykh, I have two eyes. How do \nyou feel if we were to take your sight away? Oh,   I'll be blind, I can't live. Can \nyou hear? Yes, I have two ears. Can you walk? Yes, Alhamdulillah, I'm not \nparalyzed. Can you use both hands? Oh,   with the grace of Allah, they're all functional. So, can you understand people when \nthey talk to you? Can you read? Can   you do things? You're a normal human being. \nAll these blessings and so many, many more. You've neglected, ignored. You've shown your \ningratitude to Allah simply because you're   not fair, in colour, simply because you have a \nskin disease that many people have even worse. But you fail to express your gratitude and   gratefulness to Allah, \nAzzawajal. You have a problem. So, you need to fix this problem. How?   I feel depressed, I feel sad, I look at myself \nin the mirror, look beyond how you look. Look at your heart, look at the greatest favour \nof all upon you that Allah has bestowed upon you. What is the greatest favour that you are a Muslim?   Look around you, how many non-Muslims are \nthere? Would you like to be like them? Would you like to be a Miss Universe   but a non-Muslim? The most beautiful and \ngorgeous woman on Earth, but you're a Kaffir. You have no boundaries.   You don't know the Qur'an, you don't know Allah. \nWould you like to be like that? Of course not. Even if they gave me the whole wealth of the \nworld, I wouldn't buy this. So, be grateful. Look in the mirror and look at the favours and \nblessings that Allah has bestowed upon you. Show your gratitude to Allah, don't \ncare about what people say or think,   it counts what you think of yourself."
