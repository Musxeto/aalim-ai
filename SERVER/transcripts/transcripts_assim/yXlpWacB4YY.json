  "transcript": "sarah from saudi i wanted to ask about the trading thing a friend of mine works in a trading company where she makes a team and we deal with buying and selling of certain things and it also seems to be a university that also trains the person for the set job so the thing is you're supposed to sell when uh you're instructed by the leader and you're supposed to buy when you're instructed by them i was concerned about it being haram or halal because i'm not sure of it so they told me that if you're just randomly blindly buying anything that equates to gambling so that is haram but we monitor the trade and everything so it comes under halal category i'm still not clear on it sarah sarah let me ask you this question you're an employee yes or no no i have not yet joined i just got the offer no no if you were to join are you an employee or an investor i'm an employee you don't pay anything to get this job i do i have to pay them some 600 reals or something like that this is not permissible immediately this is called pyramid scheme this is a scheme where a ponzi scheme where they make money so they come to the base of the pyramid and they tell a thousand people pay us 600 reals and you'll be enrolled in a program where you sell like you managed to buy and sell this program of 600 reals you go and market it and sell it to others or you do these tasks for us random tasks and we'll give you a commission and the more you recruit people the more the commission rises so the pyramid goes up up up those the more you go up the more money you make those in the base they pay this is a pyramid scheme that is haram now if you tell me i don't pay anything they recruited me i work on a call center they tell me sell this pad sell this pen sell this mug and i sell it with the price they give me and they do this there's no problem in that i'm getting paid for work i'm doing but to enroll in such a program by paying them 600 or 1000 or 200 this is totally haram and allah azza knows best you"
