  "transcript": "motivating yourself to study requires from you conviction so if i motivate you from today until allah knows when you will not be motivated and unless you are convinced yourself of the importance of pursuing your studies it appears to me that if your parent had sent you abroad to study medicine or engineering or something that is not related to islam however you are spending your time mostly in attending lectures and listening to things that are considered to be beneficial for you in the hereafter and in this life as well yet it does not put the bread on the table as they say and it seems to me that if okay studying medicine which is a very noble it appears to me that you have a problem with that and this is a common problem with all humans all of us they fail to have the balance in their life and those who are blessed by allah these are the people who can manage their time quite extraordinary and this is what you should do yourself now first of all you have to know the importance of pleasing your parents and whatever you do in your university in pursuing your career and getting the high grades if you do this for the sake of pleasing your parents you are rewarded by every minute you are studying secondly medicine by itself is one of the greatest sciences of making dawah for the sake of allah look at me i'm not a doctor i'm not an engineer i'm not someone who is influential with lots of money or lots of power but if i wear one of the previously mentioned i would have had a bigger impact on people it's different when someone says something in islam and when that person who says this is a doctor he's a physician he's a surgeon is a great engineer is a prince or a minister in the government or a multi-millionaire when he says something you have lots of ears and eyes looking up and listening to whatever he has to say why because he is a celebrity if you are a doctor imagine the impact on the patients you see when they come into your clinic and you say before uh checking them up you say bismillah oh masha allah with the grace of allah we will insha allah write you the proper medicine and allah would cure you even if they are muslims they will be impressed and if they're not muslims it will intrigue them to ask what are what are these bumbling you're saying and you explain to them about islam imagine about the charity work the amount of charity work you can provide anywhere in the world if you have a doctor that is feeding a lot and he designates time from his own time out of work out of clinic hours and he checks on 20 people a day just for the sake of allah to give them leaflets about islam they don't have to pay anything imagine if this happens in the uk or it happens in the u.s or it happens in somewhere in the middle east someone doing that for the sake of allah azzawajal how would that leave an impact on people now if you put all of this in mind and add to that that this science would allow you would give you the chance to have a decent life to have a good salary to be able to get married and have a bright future for yourself and for your children this adds value to yourself but unfortunately not everyone is able to balance so you have people a uh graders people that are masha allah um doing so well in school that they neglect prayers they neglect their mandatory things and things in their religion they do not attend um circles of knowledge they do not visit their relatives and connect to the next of kin they do not give charity why because they're only focused on one thing and one thing are alone and that is their studies so if they've lost actually they have lost they did not do anything good on the contrary you have a students and these a students instead of studying math physics and medicine they are listening to islamic tapes and attending islamic lectures which is good we want asians to do this but they could utilize their knowledge far more better in medicine and in engineering while still acquiring islamic studies and going somewhere because if you are not 100 percent ready to be a scholar to be an alim then you are not going to do a lot of good being in the middle of the way instead of completing the whole process therefore my advice for you my friend is to balance your time designate time per day for example two hours three hours of structuring your knowledge seeking process by knowing what to listen to what you read and when to read it for two hours a day and devote the majority of your time to your studies so that you would excel in them and become a famous strong doctor and at the same time do not neglect your health so devote also time to go and work out in the gym and burn some of the calories you're gaining through sitting and reading your books now this is exactly what the salman and pharisees with him said to abu dhabi may allah be pleased with him and the prophet confirmed this when he said your body has rights over you your guests have rights of you your wife has rights over you and allah the almighty has rights over you so give each one its new rights and when the prophet heard this he said salman had said the truth you have to balance so that your your life would be inshallah perfect and allah"
