  "title": "After 2 rakats of Salatul Tawba, do I make dua for forgiveness or say Sayyidul Istighfar?",
  "transcript": "Tezwar from Bangladesh Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Barakatuhu I'm asking this question for a brother and he said we know that Salat at Tawbah is normally two rakahs with intention for repentance of a sin. His question is the hadith says to seek forgiveness after these two rakahs. What does this repentance constitute? Do I have to say O Allah by praying Salat at Tawbah to forgive my sin and repent over? Or do I have to say Sayyiduna Al-Istighfar and then you make a dua for him? It is a generic instruction so if you pray the two rakahs from other than the Fareedah with the intention of repentance and then you just ask Allah for forgiveness, Allahumma Ghafirli, that would be sufficient and if you say Sayyiduna Al-Istighfar that is also better because it's the best form of Istighfar. May Allah Azza wa Jal forgive his sins and yours and ours and make him steadfast on Islam."
