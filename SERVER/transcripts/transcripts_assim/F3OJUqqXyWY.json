  "transcript": "brother farad from the Emirates was asking about the length of the trousers out of the garment generally speaking and is this only especially for prayer or is it 24/7 well it is not only for prayer it is 24/7 you always have to keep your garment your soap your trousers your wizra above the ankles now a lot of the Muslims have neglected this and they are dragging their trousers under their ankles this is forbidden the Prophet tells us as Salaam whatever exceeds or goes below the ankle is in hell so if this is your ankle and this much goes down this will is punishable in fire this is providing that you don't have any arrogance in you and you don't boast about it but if you have adding and added to that then there are four punishments that the Prophet Ison told us that a large L would not look at you would not speak out to you and would not purify your soul and would have a grave and serious and painful punishment for you now the sooner and a lot of the Muslims don't know this the Sunnah of the Prophet Isaac is to wear your garment to the middle of the leg and in an authentic hadith the Prophet Adam saw a man dragging his garments and he told him uplift your garment and the man said o prophet of Allah this is an old garment it's torn it's dirty and the Prophet told him don't you have a role model in me am I not your example and the man says the companion says I looked at the Prophet a list of Saddam's garment and it was to the middle of his leg and the hadith of Imam Ali peace with him that the Prophet told him Ali saw some the dress of a man the garment of a man should be here and the Prophet hit four fingers under than me and then he said if you don't like this then you may add to this and he added another four so eight fingers under your knee this is the garment of a believer man now this opposite women are wearing this four fingers under the knee and they call it maxi and the men are dragging their thumbs and their garments and their Mishler as if they are in a wedding as if they are a bride or what they need is couple of children holding the garments behind them maybe some background music music is haram so this is the issue and the dilemma that everybody looks around said I'm not the only one dragging my trousers so it's okay that well it's not okay you have to keep it for I'm not asking you to have it to the middle of their leg this is a Sunnah nowadays if you practice it maybe they will put you in a the lunatics wards they will consider it to be mentally a disabled or something unfortunately and this is a shame this is a Sunnah and we are unable to practice it because people don't like it the minimum you have is that the bones of your ankle just have it on top of it and that is it it's very normal especially if you're wearing shoes and socks on that"
