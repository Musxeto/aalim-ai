  "title": "Ruling on possessing materialistic things, should you sell expensive things & give it to charity?",
  "transcript": "Ahmad from Australia my question is on possessing materialistic things if Allah has blessed you with wealth and um what is the ruling on possessing materialistic things so for example if you own a hundred thousand dollar car is it permissible to keep that car if it is within your means or is the right thing to do to sell that car for example and buy a two three thousand dollar car to get you from A to B and look at donating the rest of the money towards charity for example has blessed us with so many things and he in the Quran told us that he made these things lawful for us as long as there is no extravagance and you're not spendthrift and you're giving zakat on time and you're not showing off or boasting about it and you're not feeling arrogant when doing or owning or possessing such things alhamdulillah what prevents you from enjoying life if your income is extremely high and you'd give sadaqaha you give zakat nobody tells you not to buy a 100 000 or 200 000 or 300 000 car nobody tells you to live in a condo or an apartment of two rooms when you can manage a mansion of 10 rooms for your big family not to show off what's wrong in having a tennis court in your Villa there's nothing wrong I telling you as long as the conditions I mentioned earlier are fulfilled the concept of you're driving a hundred thousand dollars car sell it and buy a two thousand or three thousand dollar car why two thousand three thousand can feed families why not take the bus why not exercise and walk this is ridiculous the prophet salallahu used to enjoy life though he wasn't into such luxuries but he used to enjoy eating sweet food drinking Sweet Water he used to send some of his companions for a journey for two days to bring him Sweet Water because the water in Medina wasn't sweet so there is nothing wrong in enjoying life and enjoying Allah's favors and blessing upon you providing you do not go into being extravagant or spendthrift or arrogant if you feel that when I'm in my a Bugatti Sharon or Veron I'm different when I'm driving my Hyundai Accent he said whoops okay there's something wrong in your heart don't do that but if it's the same to you it doesn't matter it's a four-wheel car but this one is a little bit faster I enjoy it more and I can afford it although the price is a little bit Way Beyond logical and the car itself is beyond logical if you put the pedal to the metal your gas tank won't last you more than 15 to 20 minutes at most so this is ridiculous what's the point and you get 100 tickets in the process nevertheless this is not our topic yes you can enjoy life you can buy a Harley-Davidson bike and enjoy riding in the afternoons you can buy a convertible you can buy a small boat or a small yacht and enjoy it providing that these conditions are fulfilled and Allah Knows Best foreign"
