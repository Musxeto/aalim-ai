  "transcript": "first question what is the order of the four great Imams of Islam imam abu hanifa now man then America bananas then after him came in Mohammad Reza Shah 3 then came an imam muhammad even humble these are the four great scholars of Islam now when Abu Hanifa died and then came a man Malik did he erase everything that Imam Abu Hanifa said definitely not when Imam Muhammad came at the very end did he neglect everything that their previously great Imams before him brought no see this is part of the human sciences you have a text and your understanding might be correct most of the time but there are times that you may fail to understand it correctly and this is why if you look at the four schools of thought you will find that each one is correct between 85% to 90% everything that they've said up to 90% is exactly fits as a glove with the Quran and the Sunnah and you have like 10 to 15% human error where you find that they made a mistake they misunderstood they did not know that there was another hadith abrogating the one that they are working with and hence it is caused them to not know exactly the right ruling and they give their HT had which was wrong so you cannot just simply scratch the first three and say no I follow only a herdsman humble he's a great Imam but he's a human being he has mistakes and shortcomings as the previously free Imams had and this is why Allah social clearly orders us and says that whenever you dispute refer back to the Quran and the Sunnah so we respect all these great scholars of Islam but we do not follow them blindly because for example if the Prophet says Allah has salatu was-salam to a person who asks him should I perform Ubu after eating camel's meat and says yes this is anyone in the street would understand that this is one of the things that nullify you would because the Prophet ordered him Allah salatu salam while when he asked him again should I perform wouldl from eating mutton meat the Prophet says if you wish and both meat is cooked on fire so you cannot say that this was abrogated because anything that was cooked with fire in the past this did that no the hadith is Muslim when we come to the hadith and find it inside him a Muslim and we find that Abu Hanifa Malik and ash after he say that it does not nullify you will do and I'm a Muhammad says yes it it nullifies you will do because of the hadith who should we follow the majority no we follow the authentic hadith if you're a Muslim sure why didn't they follow the authentic hadith themself maybe they did not know it existed maybe they had another idea such as being abrogated with allowing as in the hadith of Jabbar Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father allowing people to eat whatever was cooked by fire without performing moodle and they thought that this was referring to that but he is not so this is how we think of things available Marouf and Allah knows best"
