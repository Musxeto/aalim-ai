  "title": "Raising the Shahada finger for a SELFIE? assimalhakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "I get people, when I was the past three weeks in Malaysia, people come to me and they would like to have a selfie. Okay. So they come and everybody's doing this. I said, Akhi, what is this? He said, oh, this is Shahada. I said, who said that you have to do this when you're taking a selfie? And who said that this is for Shahada? This is, I don't know. And one brother came and he did this. So when he did this, I did this in the selfie. Sheikh, what are you doing? You did this, I did this. So what is the point? This is crazy. And people keep innovating, doing bid'ah, masjids all over the world. After Fajr, doing dhikr, goes and makes sujood. Whoa. What are you doing? He said, oh, sujood al shukr. Every day? I said, yeah, Allah blesses me every day. Okay, this is a clear cut bid'ah. Big time. No, Sheikh, you're extremist. I'm extremist. The Prophet never done such a thing. Companions had never done such a thing. Yeah, but it's good. So you know more than all of them. So coming back to your question, Ya Abdurrahman, ignore these ignorant imbeciles. Don't follow them. They don't have a clue what they're doing. And unfortunately, the vast majority, if you don't have proper knowledge and diplomacy to know how to tackle them, they would ridicule you when you speak to them. Give it a shot and tell them, can I have the authentic hadith supporting what you're doing? Once they know they can't, if Allah guides them, they will acknowledge that this is a bid'ah and Allah knows best."
