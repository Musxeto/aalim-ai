  "title": "My dad shaves his beard, what to do if he asks for clipper? Is it assisting in sin? #assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um so um so my dad my dad is doesn't keep bed he clean Shi and I've tried to give him d a few times he said um it's so it's not recommended soon but my question is um is coming to stay with me for a few weeks and and would I be sinful if he ask me for my CER that he wants to use it to shave his Beed or perhaps maybe facilitate him I mean helping him to get maybe his own Clipper or shaving powder to shave his bed just what just that yes it is not permissible for you to assist your father or anyone else in committing such a sin such as shaving the beard but if he asks for a shaving kit and we know that Muslims use such shaving kits for pubic hair for their armpit and uh different areas of the body so this is probable yeah I know he's going to most likely use it to shave his beard but probably he's going to use it to do something else which is part of the Sunnah I see no problem in doing that but if it's a particular thing that can only be used with the beard like after shavee for example definitely not you cannot assist him on that and Allah Knows Best"
