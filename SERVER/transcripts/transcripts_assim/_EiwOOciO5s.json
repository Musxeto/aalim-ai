  "transcript": "Z from Kashmir sh in one of your videos on YouTube you told that it is not necessary that falls on the same date every year it can change its date but in the Quran Allah says we revealed or we started revealing it that is the Quran on so if the we assume that the Quran got started revealing on the 27 night shouldn't the 27th night every year be the so is the Quran is the Quran being revealed every year no so it was it was talking about a specific night at that year when it started to be revealed on the 27th assume but after that the prophet explained it himself he said that I used to know what night the night of is but now you go and detect it in the last 10 nights of Ramadan then he said in the Witter the odd number nights of the last 10 nights of Ramadan so the prophet himself wasam forgot which night it was and he was not told which night it is every single year afterwards how would we claim that nope it's fixed on the 27th which the prophet didn't know that is not logical kill at all"
