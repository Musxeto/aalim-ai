  "title": "Is he a Martyr who died as a result of getting hit by a train?",
  "transcript": "so brother Islam is talking about a person a friend a brother a relative who was hit by a train and he died instantly so is this considered to be martyrdom in the hadith the Prophet Alistair Larson told us that the marchers other than those who died on the battlefield will the enemies of Islam are seven and among them the Prophet said is a person who dies under a falling building that the roof collapses on over on his head so such a person is a martyr a person who dies in a fire while drowning a person who dies in stomach illness disease such as cancer or the likes etc therefore we cannot say that your friend or brother or relative who was hit by a train is a martyr but we hope in sha Allah that he would be in the same category as those who have a collapsed building over their heads because there is a resemblance but we cannot be sure all what we can be is hopeful that Allah forgiveness and mercy would surround him and that Allah so JAL would forgive his sins by that accident and Allah knows best"
