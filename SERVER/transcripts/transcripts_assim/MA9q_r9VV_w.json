  "transcript": "is asking about alwa Cielo and usually people when they ask for about in wasilla they are from the subcontinent usually and they're referring to asking allah azza wajal through the prophet aerosol so as he is our wasilla as he is our wait for intercession and unfortunately this concept has there has any it did not evolve it caused them to go astray in their relationship with the Prophet or a sorcerer in the sense that they started calling the Prophet Isis on to give us intercession or to intercede for us they started asking Allah through the prophet so they swear oh Allah I swear upon you through the right of our prophet Sam upon you and this is an innovation no-one has rights over a large division not even the Prophet as of Salaam so you cannot swear through him so this concept of Vasya is an innovated concept the Islamic legitimate vasila that is based over or through or from Quran Sunnah is divided into three types are the scholars said the first one is to ask Allah through his beautiful names and attributes oh Allah I ask you because you are the wealthy the rich the most powerful grant me money pay off my debts Allah ask you because you are the most forgiving the most merciful forgive my sins have mercy on my father etc the second type is the type where you ask Allah through your good deeds as in the hadith well-known hadith where three were sheltering in a cave and a big croc came and blocked their exit way so they started asking Allah through their good deeds one of them wanted to fornicate with his cousin and then he refrained from that and feared Allah so Allah opened the gate a little bit but not enough for them to come through the third one asked Allah because of his kindness and being dutiful to his parents and not feeding his children before his parents illogical a little bit the third one asked Allah by his giving the money and the fair that developed and grew so much to a laborer who worked for peanuts but he did not take his wage he do not hit take his money and he came few years later and the man invested that little amount and became herds of cows and camels and sheep and he gave it to that and then Allah so you asked a lot by a good deed so say or Allah I ask you because I pray fetcher on time every single day for your sake o Allah I ask you to do this in that oh Allah I ask you because I love our prophet Isis Salam and I follow his Sunnah that you make my child pass the exams etc so this is a second type the third and final type is to ask Allah through their Waseda through the way of the supplication and or an invocation of righteous living be a people so I have a problem I go to a share an imam a scholar share make dua for me that my son is killed he has an illness and he's hospitalized and the chef says or a logical cure his son this is permissible only to be a living and to be righteous"
