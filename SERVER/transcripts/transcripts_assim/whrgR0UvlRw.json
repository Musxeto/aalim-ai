  "transcript": "at a time but never give up even when raheem handle al-balad I mean Solano Solano barkhad Abdi hustling I mean the Vienna muhammadin wa alihi wa sahbihi ajma'in Sarah Mary come follow he or barakato our prophet salallahu alayhi wa sallam used to be known before he was revealed to among the disbelievers as the truthful and the honest so our prophet alayhi salat wa salam was known to say the truth and nothing but the truth as Muslims we are instructed we are commanded by Allah to follow his footsteps and to be truthful as well lying was the most hatred characteristic in a person that the prophet alayhi salatu salam would ever wanted to find it was known that wherever the prophet alayhi salat wa salam knew that one of his family member said a lie the Prophet Allison would ignore and neglect this person until he repents to Allah Azza WA JAL he would not look at him he would not speak to him because he had committed a sin and this was the punishment from our prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam to this person who lied Romar even hotpot may allah be pleased with him said that a believer does not say a lie and a Muslim does not lie always keeps his mrs. always is punctual on time when he sets a date he comes on time when he sets an hour he always comes on time this is a proper Muslim he respects human dignity in so many places we find people ignoring this dignity ignoring that others have things to do they tell you to come on a particular time and they fail to show up or they neglect your timings these people do not have respect to others and they cannot be proper Muslims a real Muslim comes on time and when he tells a person that you should expect me on that particular time he is truthful because he is fearful from Allah Azza WA JAL Allah Almighty who says verily it is those who do not believe that lie and that is why saying the truth is one of the most noble characteristic a person could ever have and if we look at the definition of being truthful it is to say something that is in line of the truth and it's also in line with what you believe it has to be in line with what you believe otherwise it is not truth and that is why when the hypocrites said to the prophet alayhi salatu salam we believe we testify that you are the messenger of allah on the surface this sentence is truth but it is not true because it did not go in line with what they believed and that is why allah azza wajal concluded the verse by saying and Allah testifies that the hypocrites are liars they say something and they do not believe in it and that is why in so many cases a person is instructed or is required to swear to give an oath someone says that you took my wallet or you did not come yesterday and you want to get out of the situation just so that you are not embarrassed with your friend and some of us may go to the extreme in the sense that they may lie and they justify this lie by saying I did this so that I would not embarrass my friend or embarrass myself and some of them even swear so if he was to be put in such a position he would not have any problem in saying what law he I came yesterday or well I he I don't have your pen or I did not take the wallet and he intends something else so he says that I did not take the pen and he is intending that I did not take our friends pen not your pen and he's asking about his pen so they think that this is not lying because they're intending something else while the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam said your oath is according to what your companion believes so if someone asks you to swear upon something that you have either done or not then the intention is not yours the intention is your companion so he tells you swear by Allah that you came yesterday and you intend that well la he I came yesterday and I intend that I came to my mother's house not to his house this is not acceptable it has to be in compliance with his own intention being truthful is one of the things that a person could be a happy man in this life if he does this if you're truthful Allah will make you a happy man in this life and Allah will also reward you on the day of judgment the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said that four characteristics if you have them in you then it would not harm you to miss anything of this life anything that you do not attain or get in this life would not harm you as long you have these four characteristics in you and what are they the Prophet says RA salat wa salam fulfilling your obligations and being trustworthy to being truthful when you speak three only earning halal money and only eating something that is halal and finally for the Prophet says at a hostel at was Salaam being in the best of moral conduct and good manners if you have these four things in you then you have gained the glory in this life and nothing would harm you if you miss any other things such as Fame wealth health etc all of these things are not essential as the four characteristics the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam had mentioned by being truthful a Muslim would attain and get the blessing of Allah Azza WA JAL because lying takes the blessing away and it's a very important topic to have the blessing of Allah Azza WA JAL in so many times we seem to ignore or neglect knowingly or unknowingly the benefits of Allah's blessing without it you will have no value of your life of your wealth nor of your time if Eliezer del deprives you from his blessing nothing works and that is why the prophet said salallahu alaihe wasalam whoever cheats whoever cheats us is not among us whoever cheats the Muslim he is not among them because Allah Azza WA JAL will deprive him from his blessing we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we will be right back salamati correct Allah and welcome back the Prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam told us that the blessing of Allah can be achieved by being truthful by avoiding saying lies and this is a proper Muslim the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam to parties to a deal have the option of changing their minds until they part which means that if you are buying something or selling it and the both of you are in the same location and you're negotiating and you make a deal by saying I will sell you this thing for a thousand dollars and he says I accept Islamic Lee speaking the deal has been concluded and it's done whether the item was there to be delivered or not and whether the money was paid or not as long as he said I sold you and you say I accept the deal is done but the Prophet is telling a solid solid wa sallam that both of us can change our minds as long as we did not depart so as long as we're in the same location I can go to the door of the room and then come back and say listen I changed my mind I'm not selling or I'd like to change your price this is up to me and he can do the same but the minute we depart and leave then the deal is final and done the Prophet goes on to say salallahu alaihe why do you sell them if they are transparent if they're honest truthful and open they do not hide anything their deal will be blessed and this is why I brought this hadith you would like to achieve the blessing of allah azza wajal especially in trade when you buy and sell be honest be truthful be transparent show what you have and what you see some of us may sell a car and the man buying the car from you maybe he takes it to a garage and checks it out and he is satisfied and he will take it but you know that there is something wrong in that car that no mechanic could find out unless he drives it for a while and you hide this and you can see this deficiency well Allah Azza WA JAL will hold you accountable for this Allah Azza WA JAL will punish you on the day of judgment and Allah so L will take the blessing away from this transaction but if you disclose what you have and you tell it to your companion who's buying or selling you then Allah Azza WA JAL as the hadith says their deal will be blessed and if they conceal and tell lies the blessing of their deal will be demolished and diminished it will go away and you can ask yourself and you can check among us Muslims who claim to be truthful and honest how many people sell by swearing and how many people deceive others by swearing so that they could sell their products a lot unfortunately and this is a dangerous sign that they are not true believers with being truthful a Muslim could achieve the highest levels in paradise so it's not only this world that Allah will bless your wealth and bless your life and grant you happiness with being truthful but also on the day of judgement the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam said you must be truthful for truthfulness leads to righteousness and righteousness leads to paradise a man will keep speaking the truth and striving to speak the truth until he will be recorded with Allah as I said before the man who speaks of truth so this hadith tells us clearly that being truthful leads you to paradise and that is why Allah ordered the believers to be truthful by saying yeah you holla Dena Amenhotep allaha wa kunu ma saw the pain oh you believe fear Allah and be among those who tell the truth this verse was revealed when three of the companions of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam failed to join him in the Battle of Tabuk which was the last battle the prophet alayhi salat wa salam went for and he was going to fight the Byzantium's or the romans up north who had already encountered the fierce army of the Muslims and managed to kill three of the Muslims leaders and they all went away they did not finalize the battle thinking that the Muslims had lots of reinforcements and three of the best companions who led that army and the army was composed of only three thousand men while the disbelieving army was composed of more than 200,000 men yet subhanAllah they fought in the beginning and they'd even Haditha may allah be pleased with him was martyred followed by Jaffa even ABI talib the cousin of the Prophet is salatu salam and then by Abdullah Huebner ilaha the poet of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam three of the companions among them was carbon numeric did not go with the Prophet arrazolo Salam on that year to fight the Byzantium's they were one of the best companions of the Prophet s salatu salam and two of them we're from the people who participated in the Battle of better Carboni Malik was a close companion of the Prophet Ali salatu salam he was one of the three poets one of the poets died in the battle of Mata Abdullah raha the second one was a silent rabbit and the third was carbon pneumatic camp amino Malik he explains to us that he had no excuse every time he wanted to go out Satan comes him says travel tomorrow or the day after make it in the afternoon and he started postponing traveling to join the prophets are Marisol Salaam until it was too late and the Prophet already had gone for a long time it was almost impossible to reach him on time when the Prophet came at him back and he was received by the people of Medina or those who remained the men who did not go out with him on this battle which is known as las with Tabuk those who did not go with him we're hypocrites and this is what carbon Malik said when I realized that I was too late I looked around and I found only hypocrites around me so the hypocrites started coming to the Prophet RA salatu salam giving their excuses lame excuses excuses that were not true but the Prophet RA salatu salam being who he was he accepted what seemed to be a legitimate excuse so when when someone said o prophet of allah i was sick he wasn't sick when he was lying the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not interrogate him as long as the man said that he was sick he accepted that so la la la sanam and they all gave their false excuses because they were hypocrites Campagna Malik may Allah be pleased with him he went and said the truth and he said Oh prophet of Allah I am an articulate person I could say beautiful words and you will believe me but Allah the Almighty will reveal to you that I have said a lie and then I would become a hypocrite and I do not want to become a hypocrite I'll tell you the truth by Allah I had no excuse it's just happened so the prophet alayhi salatu salam said to him because you have said the truth then people will not speak to you and we will wait until Allah will reveal something in your case as for my part I have nothing to say more to you so Gabriel Mallick tells us that because he said the truth his companions his tribesmen members of his family came to him and said are you insane are you crazy go to the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam tell him give him any excuse like anyone else and he'll accept that from you and he kept on saying that i will say nothing but the truth and may allah choose for me whatever is best but i will live in truth i believed in the truth and i'll die saying the truth and subhanAllah he was left alone abandoned by every single person in Medina whatever he came and said assalamualaikum nobody replied he would not talk to anyone and no one would talk to him even if he tried to talk to people they would not answer him back and the calamities grow and it is a breeding ground for Satan and his soldiers while he was in this situation neglected by all the prophet alayhi salatu salam even last 10 days instructed his wife to leave the house and leave him so he was completely abandoned by every single person at that time the king or the ruler of Al Hara or whatever a place in the north of Arabia who was a disbeliever sent him a message stating that listen you are not a person of a calibre to be humiliated like this come to us and we will give you your proper position you're a poet you're a man of literature and you're someone to be respected therefore come to us and we will honor you as a Muslim he said la la la la this is a test from Allah and he took the letter and he threw it in the oven or in the furnace or whatever and he burnt it otherwise if he was not a strong woman he would have found it a chance to immigrate to get the nationality of that country to be a citizen of a big superpower he didn't do this and with the grace of Allah after these fifty days were over Allah Azza WA JAL revealed their innocence and he repentant subhana WA Ta'ala upon them and gave them his forgiveness and that was the best day of his life as the story goes after a large surgeon had mentioned this in chapter 9 - Rattata he concluded their story by saying ya ayyuhal Adina Amma knew it Nicola vicuna Masada people fear Allah and be with the truthful people be with those who say only the truth and this is a lesson to us that we should not lie to avoid a problem we must not lie to protect ourselves in every single case this companion of the prophet may allah be pleased with him knew that what he had done was wrong but he also knew that to be a proper believer and a Muslim you should say the truth it caused you your job even if it caused you problems or being embarrassed because this or that a proper Muslim says the truth lives in truth and dies by truth I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time via Manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
