  "transcript": "the prophet stated that there is no obedience to any creature in dis obeying Allah so anyone who instructs you to disobey Allah you have to go against him there is a beautiful Hadith where the Prophet Alat wasam appointed a man as a a ruler or as the Amir of an expedition and they traveled you know that whenever people travel they have to appoint one as their Amir so the man was angry because they have done something that made him angry one night so he instructed them as their Amir to collect wood fire uh uh fire wood fire and uh they did this and then he instructed them to light up the wood and they made a big fire and then he said the prophet instructed you to obey their and this is his instruction to them before they left and they said yes so he told them I order you to go into that fire and throw yourself in it the companions looked at each other and they said this is not right and they did not obey him when they went back to the prophet of course the man cooled down and they told him that he we did this and this to him and he got angry and he did this and that to us and he instructed us to enter the the fire stating that you instructed us to obey him the prophet smiled and said by Allah had you entered that fire you would have never gotten out of it meaning it would have led you to Hellfire eternally and permanently because you've committed something that Allah does not approve of and this teaches us that if your parents instruct you to disobey Allah or to go against the of the Prophet you have to evaluate if they are instructing you to leave something that is not mandatory that it is volunt then and they have some benefit in it then you have to leave it if they instruct you to leave something that is mandatory you do not obey them go down a little one level if they instruct you to leave something that is voluntary that is Sunnah not mandatory but it is Sunnah and there is benefit for them by you leaving it you have to obey them example if you want to pray night prayer or after Isa you would like to perform the Sunnah of the ISA and your parents tell you don't pray the sunah come we want you to be with us or we need you to do this for us and you say well I want to do theah I want to pray then I'll obey them no this is the wrong thing to do because they have something that they need you in and they have benefit and you not doing theah but if they for example tell you don't fast Mondays and Thursdays why father and mother they said because we don't want you to do this yes but is there anything for me to do that fasting is preventing me from doing so no but we don't want you to fast and that's it well in this case you do not obey them because there is no benefit in it for them but if they want you to work at the farm and fasting makes you uh hesitant or tired or unable to finish the work and they need this work from you then yes you should obey them and abandon these voluntary things I hope this clarifies it a little bit but having said that you have to disobey them when it is necessary without challenging them without irritating them or provoking them to do things that you don't want them to do try to disobey them when you have to but by showing them your your love your respect and that you um want the best for them and Allah Knows Best"
