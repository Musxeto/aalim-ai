  "transcript": "so if uh someone starts uh to be a practicing Muslim but he remembers uh that he did um acts if he remembers that he did acts ofur um and will to repent to be able to uh repent for them will he have to say the Shah again uh even though he says it multiple times in the prayer or would he just have to repent from it or and if he doesn't repent from it um knowing that he did it is he a c first of all why do Muslims tend to make life difficult I don't have a clue whenever someone has zero knowledge of a of Islam of what is Shan plays with him hockey he plays with him Cricket he plays with him whatever game he wants because you are so vulnerable all your defense are down and low so he messes up with your head now first of all how difficult is it to announce the shahada boom end of story so if I remembered something that wasur or I'm doubtful H that was like 10 years ago I prayed so many times I went for Hajj I did Ramadan I read the Quran every day should I say the shahada or no it's enough if you say the shahada how long is it going to take you couple of seconds asking this question took you half a minute so feasibly it's no brainer to say the shahada number two if you don't say the shahada and you continue because remorse is filling your heart you've repented you pray so be it move on there's no need to say the shahada so either way why do you complicate things answer because you've opened the Pandora box for Shan he's messing up with your head you gave him leeway he has the opportunity because you allowed him to do so read and learn about your religion properly and you will never have these Whispers again"
