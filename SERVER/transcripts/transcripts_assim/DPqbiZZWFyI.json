  "transcript": "she I wanted to ask if it's uh permissible to keep photographs in the house as long as they're not hanged because of the Hadith that the Angels don't enter the house that has a Surah and is a photograph a Surah to hang a photograph it's totally prohibited if this photograph is in an album and it's concealed and closed and put in a drawer or in a cup word or in a wardrobe or whatever in a box there's no problem this would not prevent the angels from entering and Allah Knows Best"
