  "title": "Can a son inherit a father whose earning was Haram & he said kufr things?",
  "transcript": "Asaf from Bangladesh. I think his \nquestion is is not about the islamic will,   rather it is about inheritance. So his question \nwas, 'can a son inherit his father whose   wealth was generated from haram, such as riba \nand bribes etc.,?' It's an issue of dispute and   the most authentic opinion is that, the sin is on \nthe earner. As long as he earned the money through   haram means - not stolen - rather, he took it \nthrough haram means. Selling haram products, using   riba, etc., then the sin is on the deceased. \nThose who inherit him would take the money   and it's halal for them. Then he asked a another \nquestion or, added a condition. If he says, 'if he   used to commit acts of blasphemy and swear against \nAllah, curse Allah, or say blasphemous things.'   No, in this case, if it was proven that he died as \na disbeliever, because cursing Allah is an act of   apostasy. A man who curses Allah is a kafir. You \ndon't have to be a rocket scientist to know this.   A man who mocks islam and makes \nfun of the Prophet, or the quran,   ('alayhi salatu wa salam), then this guy is an \napostate, a kafir. If he died in such a condition,   then he is not a muslim and you \ncannot inherit him if this was proven."
