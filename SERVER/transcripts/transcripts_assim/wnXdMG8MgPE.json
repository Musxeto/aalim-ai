  "transcript": "Insreem from Australia. He says; 'Is ʿUzayr and \nDhu al-Qarnayn Prophets?' 'Uzayr was mentioned   in Surah At-Tawbah, Chapter 9, where Allah, Azza \nwa Jal, was condemning what the Jews said that,   'Uzayr - and not all the Jews, a faction of the \nJews - said that, 'Uzayr was the son of Allah.   And the Christians said that, Jesus, 'Isa, \npeace be upon him, is the son of Allah. But   in the Qur'an they did not.. it did not mention \nanything that 'Uzayr was a Messenger or a Prophet.   So, we do not say that the Qur'an said something \nlike that. If there is an authentic hadith   where the Prophet, 'alayhi salatu wa salam, \napproves of him being a Prophet, so be it. Other   than that, we refrain from saying that he was a \nProphet until we have evidence that backs it up.   As for Dhu al-Qarnayn, the most authentic \nopinion was that, he is not a Prophet,   he's a king. And a righteous, noble \nperson. Some say that, he was contemporary   of Prophet Ibrahim, peace be upon him. \nSome say that he was after Prophet Ibrahim   and Allah, Azza wa Jal, knows best. But \nhe was not a Prophet nor a Messenger."
