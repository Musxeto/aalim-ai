  "transcript": "what's the ruling on investing Haram money in halal projects if a person earned Haram money whether through bribery or selling uh Haram items like cigarettes or issues related to entertainment or toxicants and the likes this Haram wealth Scholars have disputed whether he has to get rid of it all and regardless if he remains broke or not or whether he can benefit from it so that he would maintain a decent standard of living and this is the choice of may Allah have mercy on their souls that if a person repented and he gathered all of his wealth from selling drugs for example that's a heinous sin and a crime but now he's repented if we were to ask him to throw your mansions and your cars and your cash deposits and everything and be a stone broke flat uh uh without a penny that may not help him to repent or it would cause him to go to do worse things so the most authentic opinion is that he may keep what maintains a decent standard of living or to be given he of course he has the money to take what enables him to have a capital to start a good business Halal business and insha Allah that would be a win-win and Allah Knows Best"
