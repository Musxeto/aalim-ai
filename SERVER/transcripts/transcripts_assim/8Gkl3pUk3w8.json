  "transcript": "[Music] my question is on the day of priyamah all women will be called by their father's name or by their mother's name no men and women will be called on the day of judgment by their father's name a person is called by his mother named huge woody is when he's born out of wedlock i say usually sometimes a person may be praised by being called after his mother because his mother is more famous more important more honorable than his father ahmad niyasi his mother was sumayyah the prophet said no sumayyah so sumiya was known to be the first martyr woman in islam the prophet said alais assam learned the quran from ibn this is his nickname the son of the mother of abdullah so we we just mentioned his name but this is a form of nicknaming him so on the day of judgment men and women will be called after their fathers not their mothers"
