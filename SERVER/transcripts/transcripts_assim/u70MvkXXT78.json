  "transcript": "says sheikh my son is seven and i started to ask him to pray but sometimes he told me that he doesn't want to what should i do in this situation the prophet alaihis salat was ordered us to instruct and to order our children to pray when they're seven years of age and he tell and he told us that we should spank them if they do not pray that is when they're ten meaning from seven to ten these are three years 360 days five times a day you do the math every single prayer you should order him to pray now it's not gonna be an easy right some children are stubborn they have to be motivated but you can not by any chance lay a hand on the child when he's seven eight nine years of age until he reaches 10 and believe me if you order your son every or daughter every single prayer five times a day to pray they will eventually pray when they see you pray when they see the father or the mother pray in front of them when they see that their siblings pray and they see that the focus on prayer is so great and we tell them about the reward and we tell them how many houses allah would build for them and i would tell them about the punishment for those who do not pray you have to try your level best to win their hearts and do not spank them by no means for not praying now you have to adapt a number of different strategies strategies maybe preventing them from uh ice cream after lunch or dinner if they did not pray on time giving them incentives so if they pray for a whole week on time without you telling them and you see that the prayer is good you take them to the fun fairs or you buy them a book or do something useful that they want and enjoy all of these things are good insha allah and would make the child love salah but remember you do not do anything except ask them gently try to give them incentives try to yani show them the importance of salah and take your time allah the prophet gave us hashem three years huh he didn't tell us that okay within a week if he doesn't pray you smack him no the prophet said three years order them from seven and spank them when they're 10 if this did not work analyzer knows best and"
