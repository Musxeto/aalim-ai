  "transcript": "Nur from Malaysia. Yes, I'm here. I want to ask, from my understanding, if you have committed a sin, it's best that you go and take wudu and pray to Raka'ah. But let's say if a Fardu prayer is approaching, do you have to pray separately or you can, you know, ask for forgiveness in the Fardu prayer? For example, if someone committed a sin and then Zuhur is coming, so do I have to pray two Raka'ah first and then Zuhur, or Zuhur and then two Raka'ah, or I can just combine? Thank you Sheikh. First of all, you cannot combine. This is a given. Because the two Raka'ah of repentance are separate than the Fard of Zuhur or Asr or any other Fard. And you cannot combine them with Fard prayers. So they have to be separate. And it is highly recommended that you pray them as soon as you do your sin and not wait for a couple of hours or do it a few days later. That wouldn't work. The moment you repent from that sin, you offer them and then you can offer Zuhur prayers afterwards. And Allah knows best."
