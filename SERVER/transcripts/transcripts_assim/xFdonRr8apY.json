  "transcript": "rahim from australia my question is about drawing so i've made a drawing of our upper body from a non-existent person i know the rulings and opinions of drawing of living beings and so i left many details like the eyes which mike is just a white spot a white white spot we've got pills noses mouths and there is absolutely no detail to resemble it is a realistic or even irrealistic human does this imitate the creation of allah okay i will answer inshallah rahim from australia he says he draws a character a figure from the waist up and he leaves out details that would make that character or figure human so is it permissible now the description he gave wasn't very clear to me it was a bit vivid he said that there are no eyes but there are dots well if there are dots this is facial features if you draw from the waist up a human figure without a face totally faceless this is okay the moment you put facial features that indicate that this is a human being whether dots of the eyes or even hearts or whatever a nose and mouth etc then this falls under the category of being haram and allah azzawajal knows best you"
