  "title": "My wife has clogged valves in her heart, will 7 Ajwa dates help? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mansoor from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum, Sheikh. How are you? Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Barakatuh. My question is my wife has an issue with her heart. A couple of her valves are clogged up. So I've heard of eating ajwa dates. It might help if you eat seven ajwa dates a day. I don't know if it's a cultural kind of thing. I heard it from Pakistan. Or is anything similar to that? And have you spent anything? It might help if you eat ajwa dates. Okay, Mansoor. Regarding your wife's heart condition, I pray to Allah Azza Wa Jal that He cures her and restores her health to be better than before. You should consult a cardiologist or a heart surgeon. Maybe they have to intervene and change the valves or substance or I don't know. As for ajwa, it is an authentic hadith where the Prophet said, whoever eats seven pieces of ajwa in the early morning, so it's the first thing you consume in the morning, Allah will protect him from black magic and from poison. We believe in this hadith and it's authentic. Whether this ajwa is from Medina or not, it can be from anywhere else, this is an issue of dispute among scholars. But the hadith is authentic. Is it related to your wife's heart problem? I don't personally believe so. So this is to answer your question. Allah knows best."
