  "transcript": "my question is if non-muslim invite us for barbecue and they buy halal meat for us can we still have it as their grill had already been used for pork and other inhaler meat if you are 100% certain of that the answer's no you cannot eat a meat that was cooked through contaminated grills or utensils but if you're not sure then the default is that it is halal inshallah for you to eat"
