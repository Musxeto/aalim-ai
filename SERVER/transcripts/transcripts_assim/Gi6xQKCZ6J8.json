  "transcript": "uh my question is if someone is mentally not okay and didn't fat for two days uh is that counting for sickness or not so if a woman has menses for two days is this counted as sickness or not yes it is mentally not okay too much problem uh has no no um no power too fast okay this is different if it's not menses you're talking about mental problems mental problems is a vague terminology why simply because i could be depressed this is a mental problem does it prevent me from going to work no because i go to work even if i'm depressed because my salary depends on it does it prevent me from eating and drinking no because i'm hungry and i'm thirsty does it prevent me from doing so many things the answer is no why would it prevent me from praying that would not be an excuse why would it prevent me from fasting that is not an excuse the only time mental problems can be considered to be an excuse is when a person is graded as insane or that he has no control as stated and proven by the physicians and the psychiatrists over his emotions over his actions in this case he's exempted and allah azza knows best"
