  "transcript": "I mean says he's taking a scholarship from a non Muslim or non-muslim organization halal or Haram well this depends on the conditions if a non-muslim if a gentleman comes to me and says sir Hassan I would like to donate this amount of money for you to go and study Spanish because you love Spanish and I'd like you to start to give Dawa in Spanish so I said that's weird you're a non-muslim said yeah but I'd like you to spread this lamp in Spanish so here's X Y Z euros for you to study for three to six months in Madrid so whoa that's nice what's that what's the catch here so nothing say okay this amount of money do you want it back in installments or says no no this is a grant this is a gift so do you want me to advertise for your company or do you want me to pay you interested no nothing no strings attached here is a lump sum go and study is this permissible well he's a nun Muslim so the Prophet Alice or some accepted gifts from non-muslims so is this a gift yes no strings attached it's permissible same thing if it's from a government same thing it's if it's from an organisation even if they are not Muslim this is totally halal as long as it is not an interest-based loan and as long as there is no endorsing of their evil for example if the Vatican comes and gives me a grant and tells me that I have to write underneath that it's a gift from the Holy Vatican it is a grant from the Vatican I have to appear in posters and in adverts for the Vatican showing how nice and kind they are no this is not permissible these are strings attached but if it's a grant it has no strings attached to it none whatsoever this is legit insha'Allah"
