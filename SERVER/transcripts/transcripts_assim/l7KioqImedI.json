  "transcript": "what is the ruling when teachers at school show videos that contain haram things including music first of all the basic answer to this is it is prohibited for a muslim to watch or to listen to any haram stuff full stop okay sheikh i have this excuse i have that excuse i have um this justification the short answer is that as muslims we must not disobey allah full stop now is there any room for maneuver this depends on the intention of the person on the situation and circumstances and on the possibility of change or improvement meaning if a person is studying in a college or a school and his passing is dependent on listening to something that is haram or watching a video because this english course requires me to watch a dialogue between a man and a woman and maybe something is inappropriate is shown or something that is inappropriate is said and there is background music and i cannot pass my test or do my degree without this in this case it falls under the category of allah's to the best of your ability so for a person to be in such a situation there is a difference between hearing and listening when i'm in my car and somebody somebody next to me in his car blowing music to the highest level and i'm not listening i'm heeding it because it's something that comes in without my permission or intention to listen to am i sinful the answer is no he's the one who's sinful there is a difference between this and between when i'm driving and i stop at the traffic light and the guy is blowing a song and i do this on the steering wheel i'm happy i'm enjoying it i'm i'm going with the beat now this is listening and i'm sinful so likewise when i go to a mall and they're playing music i'm not listening to it so i try my level best to avoid such situations for a person in a class it might be difficult if not impossible sometimes it is possible i've been in situations where i told the instructor listen i don't listen to music either you lower the volume totally or let me out and they would lower the volume and just be content with what is shown uh in there if there's something inappropriate as a muslim i lower my gaze and move on and allah you"
