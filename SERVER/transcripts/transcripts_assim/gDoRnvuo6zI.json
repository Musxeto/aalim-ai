  "title": "Sunnah Of Sacrifice",
  "transcript": "uh Nal from Saudi Arabia she says that now we know that a person and this is similar to um the question of Muhammad and also similar to other questions so I will say it in brief the Sunnah for the people who intend to sacrifice is that when the first day of is due they should refrain from clipping their nails or cutting any part of the hair of the body uh until they slaughter the Sheep this is the um Sunnah of the prophet sallallah he told us not to do so now this is only for the people who are going to slaughter so if I'm going to slaughter my wife my children those who live under my roof do not abide by the prohibition of clipping and cutting the the hair because they're not slaughtering I am the one who's slaughtering so in this case they can do whatever they want as long as it is permissible only me the one who is going to do the slaughtering now we have a a question from uh tuba and she had also a a misunderstanding of the answer let's say that I am going to slaughter a cow and this is also similar to the question of Muhammad from Saudi Arabia a cow is equivalent to seven sheep a camel is equivalent to seven sheep and this is what the prophet told usam so if seven families participate and they both share in a cow and they slaughter it this does for the sacrifice otherwise each one would buy a sheep for his own family now let's assume that I am wealthy and I'd like to sacrifice a cow from for my whole uh uh family so does my wife fall under the prohibition of clipping the nails and cutting the hair if she requested me to do this and I'm volunteering to do that yes she has to refrain but if she didn't it's only me who is doing this as a form of getting closer to Allah Asel by slaughtering this sacrifice they're not obliged to refrain from that and I hope this answers the question"
