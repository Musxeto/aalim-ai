  "transcript": "[Music] does saliva mucus traces of blood if we swallow it would it break once fast a lot of the people who are OCD obsessive-compulsive disorder always keep on spinning their saliva and this is totally Haram it's totally prohibited saliva is part of your own body so to swallow your own saliva is no problem even the mucus it's not healthy but it's something inside your body swallowing it does not have impact on your prayer or your fasting but it's healthier to take it out but if you swallow it there's no problem in that as for the blood and this is understood when a person visits a dentist for example and he does some work and his gum bleeds so is it permissible to swallow that the answer is no swallowing your own blood of course other people blood unless you're on a vampire is totally prohibited so you have to refrain from that to the best of your ability because again sometimes you're unable to do this it's your saliva and you have to swallow it you tried your level best to not to if you do it unintentionally there's no problem in that but doing it intentionally this affects your fasting and one should not do that at all [Music] you [Applause]"
