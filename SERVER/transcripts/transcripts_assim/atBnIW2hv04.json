  "transcript": "Sana from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu, Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, a few days ago I joined Maghreb prayer and the Imam was in the second rakah. So I joined him as well. When the Imam ended the prayer, I also ended because I didn't have the knowledge that I should have raised back and offered my first rakah. So should I bring back the whole three rakahs of Maghreb again or no? Is it accepted? No, it's not accepted at all. You have to pray it immediately now as three rakahs because you've missed a pillar of the Salat and the Salat is invalid."
