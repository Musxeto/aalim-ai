  "title": "Can a woman correct the Imam mahram if he made a mistake in prayer",
  "transcript": "says can a woman correct from behind if the imam makes mistake in recitation of the quran during salah what if there are only women praying behind their mahram imam in this condition can one of them correct him the general rule is that the prophet alaihissalat was once was leading the congregational prayer and one of the companions spoke out of ignorance he did not know that speaking is not allowed and he started saying things so the companions started clapping on their thighs after the prayer was over the prophet corrected the situation taught the man who needed teaching and then addressed the companions that if anything happens in the salat you should say subhanallah to draw attention for clapping is for women so if a woman during the salat notices that the imam did not sit for the first time hadn't stood up she claps to bring his attention that you made a mistake why because she's not allowed to talk during salat now this differs when women or a woman pray with a group of mahrams or one mahram so in this case if you are praying in the house with your mahrams your father your brothers and maybe your sons all of them are there your none of them is if the imam makes a mistake there's no problem none whatsoever for a woman to speak out and correct the mistake of the imam and if he makes a mistake in movement she can say subhan allah not clap because the reason for not speaking is that nan mahram may be affected by her voice how soft it is and shaitan could come and mess up with the minds during salat but mahram's brothers fathers uncles sons they all know her voice and they know her there's no problem in her to speak but if there is a single man with them who's an mahram this is a no-go"
