  "transcript": "what is the qiblah the qibla is the direction of the kaaba what is the kaaba it's the black structure found in mecca in the sacred masjid al-haram in mesid al-haram where all muslims when they pray five times a day they face whether they're in china in the u.s in europe in the middle east no matter where they are it's an obligation it's one of the conditions for accepting their prayers that they face the direction of the qiblah and it's a sign of unity and the muslims don't worship of course this structure because it's made of stones and we rise and climb on top of it and walk all over it with our feet without any problem but it is a symbolic struct structure that was originally built by adam peace be upon him and then renovated and rebuilt again by ibrahim peace be upon him and prophet ismail peace be upon him as well and it's been there since the beginning of time and even when we bury our dead if you go to muslim cemeteries you'll find that the corpse of a muslim deceased is laid in the grave lying on its right side facing the direction of the qibla so it is our qibla to be directed to when we are alive and also after our death"
