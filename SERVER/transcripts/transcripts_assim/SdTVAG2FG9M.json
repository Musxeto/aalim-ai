  "transcript": "Faris from the UK Excuse me Sheikh, could you give me just one minute? Okay, we take Adekanel from Nigeria Hello, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh With regards to selecting a spouse, concerning that one can only look at the spouse once, Jazakumullah Khairan No legitimate reason, it's not permissible This is the first sight, I didn't blink, no, this is haram It is not permissible for you to look and to check her out, she's not a book in a library Secondly, there is an exception, where there is a necessity So she has pain in her pinky, I would say, ok, take off your clothes Woah, hey, what are you doing? Oh it's a legitimacy No it's not, she has a problem with her pinky, look at her pinky only The rest of the arm should be covered, let alone her body Ah, I didn't know that So you can only look at what is required for you to look, at times of necessity Similarly, someone's proposing, the Prophet said, alayhi salam, who's ever interested in a woman for marriage He may look at her so that it would encourage him to marry her Ah, this is an exception So when I go and propose, I'm allowed to sit with this potential woman that I'm interested in marrying And I'm allowed to look at her face, check her out, see her height is ok, and the likes And to see whether there's chemistry or not I'm not buying a product The reason is, the Prophet said in another hadith, when a man proposed And he told the Prophet, sallallahu alayhi wa sallam, I propose to this woman The Prophet said, alayhi salam, did you look at her face, did you look into her eyes The man said, no The Prophet said, alayhi salam, go and check her out Meaning, go and look in her face, because the eyes of the Ansar has some deficiencies in them Maybe they crossed the eye, or something wrong in it So that you wouldn't regret your decision after marriage when it's too late Go and check out how she looks If you're happy and satisfied, go ahead with it So this is the exception, not the norm So you saw her, you sat with her, you spoke with her And a couple of days later said, I'd like to do it again Maybe this time, let me invite her to a candlelight dinner And maybe some violin music in the background What are you doing, this is dating Yeah, but I'd like to look at it again No, no, this is not fine You looked at her, you saw what you are getting into, that's sufficient Now you make a decision, or move on"
