  "transcript": "And the second question is, do you have any recommendation for like a psychologist, a Muslim woman psychologist that you can recommend? Because I have a sister that I've tried so many psychologists and therapists, but the advice they're giving to her is not really the best Islamically advised as to what to do because she's having like a mental issue. So if you can recommend someone, we'll really appreciate it. As for your second question in regards to a female psychiatrist, unfortunately I do not know of any personally. You have to look around and look for someone who is a practicing Muslimah. See, there are so many psychiatrists and so many people dealing in psychology and they have Muslim names. But when you come to their treatment, you find that it has nothing to do with Islam. On the contrary, they may ask you to do things that are prohibited according to what they have learned in school, which is not necessarily Islamic. Therefore, one has to be really careful when it comes to such professionals that you don't fall in the wrong hands, bi-idhnillah azza wa jal. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
