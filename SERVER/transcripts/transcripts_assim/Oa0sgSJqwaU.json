  "transcript": "[Music] in today's world the majority of Muslims do not have any savings they are living from hand to mouth what is the amount in this situation that one can call savings for example a person started his savings with five hundred dirham and within six months his savings went up to two thousand but by the end of the year he has only 100 left in the in his savings what should the person do in this case what is the zakat applied to well such a person should look for a better job definitely because come on what is this what are you doing the whole year in and nothing is in your savings we need to improve your income if you remember we said that you have to possess threshold minimum and the full lunar year not 11 months and 20 days a full lunar year should pass over this threshold so if I get in the first of Muharram this is the first lunar year a hundred thousand dirhams and throughout 11 coming months I spent rent school tuition food car repairs etc by the month of the Higa I've consumed the whole hundred thousand so first of Muharram the following one I have zero in my bank account how much do I have to pay zakat zero if I have ten thousand only left okay ten thousand is above the threshold yes then I pay only ten thousand because this remained with me from first Muharram to first Muharram ninety thousand has been consumed if it goes up and down so a hundred thousand I reach Ramadan it's zero the month of Shawwal I get twenty thousand then my lunar year begins on so while I have to wait until the other shower and check the twenty thousand that I have whether it's there or it has been spent or not [Music] [Applause]"
