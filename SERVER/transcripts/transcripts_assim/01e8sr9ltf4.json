  "transcript": "oh alhamd and welcome to lessons in we started last time uh with the manners related to answering the call of Nature and we have Hadith number 79 I presume uh who will be reading it Zaki go ahead please narrated by an whenever Allah's Prophet s Al wasam went to the to answer the call of nature I and a small boy used to carry a letter Container full of water and a spearheaded stick and the meaning is the prophet will clean his private parts with the water okay first of all you have to pay attention and I know you all do this but it's just a reminder now whenever you hear the name of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam you should pray on The Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam by saying peace and praise of Allah be upon Him Sall wasam and this is not a thing that one gets tired of because the more you say it the the closer you are to the to our Prophet sallallahu alaihi ali wasallam uh uh on the day of judgment and he told us that those who do not pray on him whenever his name is mentioned are one of the stingiest of all because a a generous person pays money and also a generous person always prays on the prophet or uh uh uh gives his salute to the prophet Sall now this Hadith this chapter that deals with the maners of answering the call of nature we spoke about not allowing things that has the name of Allah to be entered into uh uh the Laboratories or to be entered into the bathrooms while answering the call of Nature and we gave the justification uh towards that we also talked about the supplication one says when he enters the Laboratories Mustafa uh which foot should I uh put forward whenever I enter uh uh bathroom the left foot okay so now because I'm doing something that is not honorable I am relieving myself whenever I enter a bathroom I use my left foot while entering and whenever I'm exiting I use my right foot so this is the Sunnah of the Prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam now the Hadith tells us that uh uhb Abbas or it tells us that anas IB Malik the servant of the Prophet Alam whenever the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam wanted to answer the call of Nature anas and a young boy another servant would accompany the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam assist him in carrying this leather container that contained water and a short or small spearheaded stick it's called Ana and what is the use of Ana the prophet used to carry it most of the time either to uh uh uh um have the assistant of it such as using it as a cane or to use it in anything else it it becomes handy whenever you want to pray for example you uh uh erect it in front of you so that nobody passes between you it becomes the border for your prayer area and for many other reasons it can be used while answering the call of nature to hang your thob to hang a piece of cloth on it so it becomes as a v it protects you from people gazing at you so it has many usages uh now the water or the leather container contains water and why does the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasam when answering the call of nature takes water with him islamically we when we urinate or defecate we have to clean the P this NASA came out of this impurity came out of which is either uh which is your private parts so whenever you urinate or defecate after finishing you have to clean the area so you can clean it through three ways one using a heart substance such as stones and 15 centuries ago they didn't have toilet papers so they only had stones and this is the first means or way to C to clean oneself after answering the call of nature the second type of form is by washing it with water and the third type of form is doing both that is using a hard substance stone or or toilet paper then following it with washing it with water and in this Hadith it states that the prophet sallallah alai wasallam whenever answering the call of nature used to wash his private parts with water this is called using liquid is called using hard substances such as stones uh uh toilet papers wood whatever it is called and this is not a Sunnah in the sense that you can pick it or leave it it is a must because as we've mentioned before inable for in order for you to pray you have to be and tah is is divided into two main groups does anybody remember these groups two types Tara the definition of tar tells it tells us the meaning uh f a major toara and a minor toara no this is one of the divisions of one of the parts Mustafa um spiritual tahara and physical tahara again this is one part now pay attention to this what does the mean islamically according to the Sharia law tar means removing the filth and lifting the state of had so it it it goes both ways removing the impurities the filth that is you have to clean the area you're praying on you have to clean your clothings you have to clean your body if any stain of impurities were to be on any of the three mentioned earlier then your prayer is invalid you have to pray it again if the area you're praying on has an impurity NASA if there's a stain of urine on my clothings it's a NASA if I have it on my body it's a NASA This Is Lifting the impurities or the filth removing the impurities and the filth and the other part is uh lifting the state of had whether it is Major impurity or uh uh minor impurity so going back if you answer the call of nature it is a must for you to clean your private parts whether by washing it sprinkling it with water or with by wiping uh the private parts with using something that is not uh um not uh with a smooth surface so can we use for example glass we cannot use glass because nothing sticks to it so it has it doesn't do any any good for us it has to have a hard and rough surface so that it would clean such as Stones toilet paper clothings wood whatever so this Hadith tells us that it is a must and why is it a must because if you don't do this then then your underwear your body would still be filthy and impure and then this means that subsequently your prayer is not accepted uh the following Hadith narrated by Al may Allah be pleased with him Allah's messenger sallallah alai wasallam told me take the leather water container he then went forward till he disappeared from me and then relieved himself again this Hadith follows the same sequence of the manners for answering the call of nature Al was one of the Companions and the prophet Sall alhi wasallam requested that he brings him a water container a leather water container so he did so and he knew that the prophet Salli wasallam wanted to answer the call of nature remember that they did not have bathrooms or toilets they had to go as far as possible from the the the the people and this is exactly what the prophet sallallahu alaih Al wasallam did he went as far as possible he disappeared M could not see him why because this this is one of the manners of answering the call of nature that you do not do that in the presence of people so that they would not find any bad smell and they would not hear any noise coming out out of you any sound coming out of you and it shows you how polite the prophet sallallahu alaih alhi wasallam was and how shy he was from showing these things to others and and this is how we should be and maybe the word shy is not the proper term to use because shyness is uh usually associated with weakness more likely it it's polite you know is something that prevents you from doing things that are wrong or mis discredit you and the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam definitely was among the best in such good behavior and Manner and that is why he used to go away far away until he disappeared now if you compare this to how the people are answering the call of nature nowadays you'd find strange things happening for example if you go to a public toilet there are these I don't know what they call them they call them stools or whatever where they urinate in while standing up and everybody's doing it and they're looking at each other each other and say hi how you doing no that's that's nice this is awful you what what are they doing to he's a man and I'm a man so what what's wrong in that the this is unacceptable at all one should preserve and keep his and what is the meaning of there isn't any uh English word that describes or translates to a but it is the part of your body that no one is allowed to see except your wife and for women it's the same thing it's the part of the body that no one is supposed to see except her relatives not only the husband but also her uh uh blood relatives such as the brothers and so on and the the the the issue of is a big one and and this is not definitely the time to go uh uh into it uh nevertheless we have a short break so stay tuned you live and ask questions please would like she to um comment on that and to give me how can I answer listening to thean and repeating after the MU is similarly a highly recommended act of worship so how does he reply to her this is what we call it an invalid analogy uh because simply there is no comparison between answering four out of five in any exam and skipping a such as or pill such as a prayer no one is exempt from praying except women during the Menses sister also wants to know if a woman has to cover her feet when she's praying the four the the great representatives of the schools are in agreement it is Haram alayum and welcome back before the break we were talking about and we said that a is the part of the body that is not supposed to be seen except by your wife and the part of the body of the woman that is notos suppos to be seen except by her uh blood relatives such as aunt aunt okay well she's a female talking about males Brothers Brothers fathers uh uh sons and so on uncles and so on unfortunately this has changed a lot in in uh nowadays if you go to the beaches if you go to uh uh uh the clubs you would find that nudity is prevailing in these places Islam tells us you should preserve your you should contain it you should not share it with others it's not something that you uh uh show off with remember that Adam and Eve descended from Heavens from Jenna when their was exposed because of eating from the uh uh forbidden fruit and this is something that's common between those primitive people in the jungles of Africa and those primitive people in the West and East they all share nudity so if you go to the jungles of Africa you see them nude but they're primitive yet if you go to nightclubs if you go to strip bars don't go to that and if you go to uh places in the west you find them also nude if you watch their fashion shows and they try to show as much flesh as possible and it tells you that the only one prevailing and the only one controlling this issue is Shan Satan he is Lu he is the one controlling them and trying to uh uh get them off the right and correct path Muslims are completely opposite to this they are discreet they are modest and honest and they try to preserve themselves and to keep their and not to show it to every everybody or to anyone else and that is why you have a very high rate of H homosexuality in the West and East you have a very high rate of homosexuality because they show their flesh and accordingly their sexual desire transforms from here to there and it it it reaches stages that cannot be controlled Islam does not allow this to happen unfortunately we see this also in sports clubs in shower rooms it's it's very normal in in in a lot of countries to find men showering together naked nude completely and this is completely out of the question it's against Islam and those who do this are considered to be weak Muslims and are considered to be not Believers of Allah and the day of judgment women also are not allowed to expose themselves in front of other women so women going to swimming pools or going to the beaches wearing pikinis or swimming suits just because there are only women around her this is not allowed in Islam she should cover herself she wants to swim in a swimming pool in a club or whatever she's allowed to do this she's allowed to do whatever she wants providing no males are watching providing that she's not exposing any of her I I think that this gives us a a glimpse of how a Muslim should behave and how Islam wants us to keep our integrity and modesty preserved at all times uh the following Hadith narrated by Abu Allah's messenger sallu alaihi wasallam said Safeguard yourselves from the two matters that can cause cursing that befalls the one who releves himself on the people's Pathways and under their places of shade reported by Muslim again this is one of the manners that one should follow when you're in ating or defecating when you're answering the call of nature do not do this in anywhere do it in specific places places that are far away from the passage way of people and that are far away from their shade and where are where do we usually Find Shades under trees under trees next to buildings so the prophet says Safeguard yourself from the two things that cause cursing first of all is cursing uh preferred thing in Islam No is it a preferred thing in Islam No the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us that a Believer does not curse and does not backbite the person that talks about others this is a Believer if you compare this to our current situation you would find that the only thing we're good at doing is cursing and swearing this is not a believer's way of living now nevertheless the prophet says Alam Safeguard yourself from being cursed and how do I Safeguard myself from being cursed he says that if you answer the call of Nature and in the passageway of people or in their Shades under the a tree if a person is passing by and steps on your dropping on your uh uh uh things that you've done you know 101 or one two 2011 whatever you've done the first thing that would rise to his mind is God damn it whoever did this so it will go directly to you and and you deserve it because you've made his uh uh way filthy and dirty you had the whole world for you to answer the call of nature there you only chose the passage way of people you only chose the the the Sha their Shades especially in summer if you're traveling or if you're moving from one place to the other and it's hot and you would like to sit and rest for about 10 minutes and you pick up a tree pick a tree and go to the shade to sit and you find this guy has defecated him you curse that who did this and this tells us that Islam tells you that you should keep cleanliness all the time and it tells you to keep away from the things that harm people that may cause them to be disgusted or uh uh that may filth their clothings or their bodies fatty I have a question so when the prophet took the water containing leather s wasallam and the spear he did so he didn't and he he went away from the boy or from the other companion he was not hiding behind a tree or like how how wasn't he be seen like if if you can't go underneath a tree we don't know if he did it be behind the tree or not we know that he disappeared so if he disappeared this means that he went really far until they could not see him and you can hide you can hide behind a rock behind a hill behind a place that is not related to not necessarily a tree and one reason for not allowing us to uh uh uh answer the call of nature under trees because sometimes trees are fruitful and you get fruits falling from a tree to the ground and if it falls on the wrong place nobody's going to use it and then it's going to be a waste of something that is halal and for us uh to use Does this answer your question okay we go on to uh the following Hadith narrated by jab may God be pleased with him Allah's messenger sallallahu alaihi wasallam said when two people go together to relieve themselves each one of them should conceal himself from the other and do not talk for detests that this Hadith is not a strong Hadith it's a weak Hadith yet the meaning is correct in the sense that one of the manners of answering the call of nature is that you do not speak now you are in this position for a very short period of time you want to relieve yourself and move on but if you go on and start chatting to the one next to you this is not respectful especially if he's next to you in in in these public uh toilets nowadays and he listens to what you do and you listen to what he does and you start talking about Finance about politics and so on though it's the right place to talk about politics because politics stinks usually but nevertheless it's not permissible it's it's not honorable for you to talk while answering the call of nature except in case that it's a necessity such as if you are answering the call of Nature and one way or the other you see a child is about to fall from a building or a child is about to someone a blind man is about to fall into a well or harm would may happen to him then you have to talk you have it's okay to speak but when you are asking the call of Nature and you the mobile rings and you start communicating and and and and sending SMS messages you are not there to stay you have to relieve yourself and leave as we said uh a couple of programs ago toilets and bathrooms are occupied by the Devils the gin and that is why we supplicate we say to protect our from that and we also say I seek Refuge inel from the Gin females and males so it's not proper for a Muslim to go and sit there and chitchat and read books or or magazines like uh some people do and it tells us that you should be discreet don't show yourself stay away as as far as possible from the eyes and and and hearing the sight and hearing of of people when you are answering the call of nature one would argue and say this is natural and because it's natural you should conceal yourself now once a a one in the presence of the Prophet Alat wasam passed wind and he made a sound so the other companion laugh and the prophet s wasallam was very angry with him he was very angry with them not with him what he did nobody does this intentionally of course unless he is a  but normal people don't do it intentionally so it was a mistake and it popped out but the companions laughing the prophet was very angry with them sallallah alhi wasallam he said how come one of you how come you laugh out of something that everyone does so what's where where where is the catch why are you guys laughing you shouldn't be laughing this is something one should conceal and hide from others if it came to be visible or or audable then you should not you should ignore it you should not comment on it so that it would not make uh your personality down and would not make you humilate each other by doing this I'm afraid that this this is all the time we have for today's program and until we meet next time as"
