  "transcript": "heÂ´ll says what is the ruling on short selling in stock market is it permissible this is a long issue first of all the stocks that you buy must be halal stocks and they must not finance their projects in RIBA like most of the companies now whatever they have a project they financed it through banks through RIBA and this is prohibited for you to buy because you're a partner then when you give get a share you become a partner and they're dealing with River and you're dealing with River secondly short selling is actually not buying you it this is gambling you do not buy the stocks with your own money then I would have no problem because if you buy it it's yours if the prices went down you're not forced to sell it if the prices go up you're not forced to sell it but most people would sell it short selling is borrowing someone's else stocks and hoping to sell it at the end of the day and make a profit hoping that the prices would go down so you would be making profit or goes up but you will be in deep trouble if you buy the stocks and 5 or 10 minutes later the price goes eight hundred percent or seven hundred percent how are you going to repay this this is clear gambling and it's totally prohibited and not allowed"
