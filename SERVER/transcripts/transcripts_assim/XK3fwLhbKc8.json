  "title": "Collective Dua for the Deceased by Imam and Congregation  | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "first question was regarding a habit that people have in their messages where I come to the amendment say ah he my cousin died in Egypt my uncle died in Morocco my nephew died in Pakistan so please make dua for them they died yesterday so the Imams habit is to take hold of the microphone and say brother so-and-so had died yesterday and he is a relative of our friend so-and-so may allah azzawajal expand his grave may allah azza wajal put light in it may Allah make it a garden of paradise may allah azza we shall make it easy for him when he's questioned and everybody says I mean I mean I mean so is this a problem well first of all did the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam ever announced this no when he used to go with his companions to burial he would not even do congregational door what would he do after burying him he would say to them seek forgiveness for your brother and ask Allah so jail for him to be steadfast because now he's being questioned end of story the Prophet did not make dua and the companion said a me secondly the prophet sallahu salaam in some hadith prohibited and this is the vast majority of scholars opinion that it is not permissible to announce the death of individuals in public places meaning that we hold the microphone and say that Prince so-and-so had died the ruler so-and-so had died scholars own saw had died just to announce it to people publicly in this fashion is not permissible and likewise doing it in the Masjid this is not permissible maybe the the justification of the Imam is that a fee I'm using this incident to remind people of death and to draw them closer to a large audience but your intention though is good the means is not and you are innovating because the Prophet had not done this are they solid awesome so annoying people every single week about this is not permissible now another trend in some messages is that they offer the funeral prayer for an absence see someone who's absent so they say my uncle died in London and I can't go to witness the funeral he was buried last week so please can we make a city area after Asia shall we make funeral prayer on a person who's absent this is not permissible why she isn't it is not permissible well don't you know shake that the Prophet Isis am performed the funeral a prayer on the Najah she the Abyssinian ruler and he wasn't there yes this was true it was a single incident and the scholars said that the prophet alayhi salatu salam offered the funeral prayer because anna jaw she did not have any muslim around him so when he died though he is a Muslim he was buried by non-muslims there were no other Muslim around him so nobody offered the salat to begin with and hence scholars say that whenever a deceased corpse has been preyed upon by Muslims we cannot pray in other countries for that deceased but if he was to die in a country and to be buried without the presence of any Muslim to give him his rights funeral rites in this case yes we can do that and I hope this answers your question"
