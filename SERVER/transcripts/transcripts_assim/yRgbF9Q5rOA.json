  "transcript": "[Questioner] is back with us last time I asked   question if i come to salat al janazah and before \ni take ablution they will finish the prayer   can i join then and take taymum that's the \nlast question I asked if you come to janaza and   you performed while there was a possibility for you to make wudu   meaning that the water is maybe five ten \nminutes away then your prayer is invalid is a substitute when there is an inability \nto use water either because it does not   exist within the vicinity and the time \nof the prayer would be over by the time   I reach it or because my inability to \nuse it due to severe cold that would   harm me or kill me or due to an injury \nthat would harm me or delay my recovery   but if neither reasons uh um is there then I \ncannot perform tayammum and the prayer is invalid and have you ever taken a counseling session with \nme go to my website and you will find counseling   sessions and apply for one if you can afford it \nthat's good for you if you cannot you're entitled   for one free session and this is for everybody \nif they can affirm by Allah that they cannot   afford it because they're poor I'll give them \none free session without a problem a full half   an hour so come to me and let's speak about \nit inshallah within the following two days   or three days I will uh try and seek Allah's \nguidance to solve the problem once and for All thank you foreign"
