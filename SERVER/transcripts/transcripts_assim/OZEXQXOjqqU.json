  "transcript": "Oh rahmani rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil alameen o solo la jolla mubarak on ab de Veloso de la mean nabina muhammad in la da de aur sahi a Jemaine a man assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh we begin into another direction and that is the tisha hood that we say in prayer and also the siltation we offer to the prophet salallahu re you re he was a lamb with us hadith 119 and are she will give us the honor of reading in ashalla abdullah bin Masood said the prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam taught me at the Shah hood my hands between his hands as he used to teach me in the surah of the Quran all compliments prayers and pure words are due to Allah peace be upon you o prophet and the mercy of Allah and His blessings peace be upon us and all the righteous slaves of Allah I bear witness that none has a right to be worshipped except Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is a slave and messenger in another narration when one of you sits let him say a tahia duly leahy till the end in another narration for when he says this it reaches every upright servant in heaven and earth and also he may choose what pleases him of doha now this great hadith of a blonde miss Road we recited in the first asha hood and in the last a shout meaning we recited in maghrib twice and asia twice and for once because mallory benicia and all four raka units have to tisha hood the first shahed is mandatory the last Asha hood is a pillar of prayer and mms road may allah be pleased with him he said that the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam taught me this dish a hood while my hands were between his hands and this is the way when you want someone to be one hundred percent alert I can teach you from a distance but if I hold your hands in your close to me and I look you into the eyes and you are repeating behind me this sticks in your head of course it is not advisable for a teacher to teach his students like this because this would consume the whole year just to teach them one chapter of the Quran if you have to do this with every person but this shows us how knowledgeable even miss Road was how close to the Prophet he was even miss road may allah be pleased with him up the love in the road usually is known as even miss road like a beloved on what is known as a beaner omar abdullah black bass the cousin of the prophetess m even a bass they don't have to say the full name the first name so even master road was so close to the Prophet al-assad salam to the extent that he said I have learned 70-plus shooters from the prophets mouth had a solid wassalam directly and when you say 70-plus sewers and this means that this is more than two third of the Quran he took it directly from the prophets mouth as soon as it was revealed and that is why the prophet alayhi salaatu Sam instructed us to learn the quran from for one of them was of the law mms wrote his name in the hadith a blue Oh me abid his nickname Abdullah miss wrote his name is even know me apt ohm his mother rabbit is the short for at the LA or even the Sun so he is the son of the mother of habit so this is a nickname that the prophet used with him not only that it was reported in the authentic hadith that the Prophet erase errata salam said to Abdullah was rude or of the law recite the Quran for me and he said o prophet of allah i recite the Quran and it was revealed to you he said yes I love to hear it from someone else so the Prophet did not choose abu bakr umar he chose to be miss road every master says so i recited Surat Annisa until I reached ayah number 40 40 which talks about allah saying how is it o muhammad when we bring all the nations and we bring you a witness on them all so the Prophet Sam said that is enough in this road and he stopped and he said i looked at the prophet and i saw him weeping I saw the tears in his eyes so this man is not any other man of the lovers road if you go to his biography you'll be shocked he was the one known to carry the sandals of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and his poodle so this was his job his name Sahib ooh and now meaning that he is the one who was responsible to take care of the prophets shoes and sandals which means that he was always with him it was reported once that he climbed the tree and while he was up at the tree on top getting something from for the Prophet the Companions fell on their backs laughing and the Prophet said why are you laughing and this is prophet of Allah look at his legs they are like cue sticks you know the billiards they're like the miswak is so thin it is so funny look at that and the Prophet said Alice Oh Sam by Allah they are heavier at the side of Allah than Mount Hood these skinny little feet or legs of his and we all know that the one who chopped the head of abuja hell the fierce enemy of Islam and of the prophetess am on the battle of butter was it will miss wrote the two why then why would the sons of afrah they managed to injure him and get him out all raw off his mount or camel and then they were occupied and defending themselves but he was there injured Abdullah miss Ruth came and finished him off and brought his head to the Prophet item or as a narration say so Abdullah Mossad was very close to the prophet alaihi wasallam and that is why the Prophet chose him to teach him at the Shah hood and he said that the prophet taught it to me as he teaches me the Quran Joe word by word and we all know the hadith attitude alayhi wassalam to what playback assalamu alayka I you hanabi warahmatullahi wabarakatuh a ceremony nuh voila I badilla huzzah Dean ashhadu an la illaha illallah wash Elena Mohammedan a blue water so low and there are a number of narrations different versions of this hadith other than Abdullah was rude however the majority of scholars say that this is the most authentic the most famous and the most reliable yet the others are acceptable but this is that most of the companions have agreed upon in another narration the Prophet say that is a lot some when you come to the position where you say assalamo Elena that is us while I ba de la sala hain and upon all the righteous servants of Allah the prophet said ilysm whoever says this his salam would reach every righteous servant of Allah whether in the heavens are on the earth and subhanAllah since i've read this hadith long time ago whenever I off da hood when I say assalamo Elena while I by the last other hand I always imagined one of my scholars one of my shoe one of my people whom I love and to be righteous in different parts of the world it comes to me and this is because I believe in what the Prophet said had a he isola to a cinema now I stated before the first Ishod is mandatory if you leave it deliberately your prayer is invalid if you leave it because you forgot you make up for that by offering to prostrations of forgetfulness in the last asha hood this is a pillar if you leave it your prayer is invalid and you have to repeat the prayer if you forgot that and it was a long period of time before you remembered this hadith is the well-known virgin which Omaha Bob may allah be pleased with him used to teach the people however even must wrote himself as in sahih al-bukhari stated that we used to offer that Asha hood by saying assalamu alayka a you hannah be when the Prophet was alive when he passed away when he died we used to say acid my Nana be ye warahmatullah wabarakatuh and this made the scholars differ what to use would we use the first hadith or virgin where it seemed as if we are addressing the Prophet dog we are not Alice asaram it seems as if we're giving him the Silla tation speaking to him face to face or should we use the Virgin of M&MS road which he stated that the Companions used after the prophets death it's an issue of dispute some say no we stick with the same virgin salaamu alaika au hanabi which mms road initially taught us and drama may allah be pleased with him used to teach the people after the death of of the Prophet ocean others say no we stick with the other version the latest the final of M&MS road because he knows his hadith more than the others so he knows the implication of saying assalamu alayka when the Prophet was alive and after his death he changed it into a salaamu Island nebi instead of assalamu alayka I you honda be a salam o Islander be addressing a third party and whatever you do it is inshallah acceptable and no problem and saying it because both hadith are authentic on the contrary the idea of a venomous Road he's more authentic than the hadith of Rama because it's in the sahi and the other one is not in the sahi however i personally would go with the latest version of mms road there is to say assalamo i dinnae be warahmatullahi wabarakatuh just to be on the safe side we have a short break stay tuned inshallah we'll be right back assalamu alaikum and welcome back cream would you please read the hadith a diff number 120 Abdul Rahman evening Abby Leila said garbh√°n Oh Dora Roddy Allah one who met me he said shall I not give you a present the prophet salallahu re wuz hella once came out to us and we said o prophet of Allah we know how to greet you but how do we send blessings of Allah upon you he said say o Allah praise muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you had praised Abraham and the family of Abraham rarely you're the praise the glorious oh Allah bless Muhammad and on the family of Muhammad as you had blessed Abraham and on the family of Abraham readily you other praised the glorious the second law here on this is known as a solid on an Emmy sallallahu are you are you seldom and the first one was known as a Tasha hood and a solid Allan levy sallallahu alehiwassallaam is divided into two types the full version and the short version the Prophet said that is lobster I'm among those closest to me on the day of judgment are those who offer salaam to me as much as possible Aloha Mahalo sallim ala muhammad saw the shorter version is a llama sao luis el Muhammad this is offering salat ation to the Prophet elsenham the longer version is what is known as a solitude Ibrahim iya and why do we say a solitude Ebrahimi because the name of the messenger of allah Ibrahim is mentioned and it goes it has a number of different variations among them is this one and it's the most famous so you say allahumma salli ala muhammad wanna anna muhammad camisole Atallah rahimahullah Ibrahim in the kameda majeed some versions has follada mean anaka hameed imagine a llama barik ala muhammad Mohamed Kamel al ibrahim r-rahim indica Hamida majeed some virgins does not mention the Navy braheem aloma saleh ali mohamed mohamed camisole later a la libre he made the Camino machine and it goes on with different editions here and there they're all inshaallah acceptable but this is the most authentic and accepted version now what is the ruling on reading this salam or this solitary brahimi ax in prayer Imam Shafi analy man I met said that it is mandatory and those who do not offer the prayer is invalid element malik anil imam abu hanifa and a lot of the scholars said that it is a sunnah and it is not mandatory and this is the most authentic opinion that it is the sooner if you don't do it your prayer is valid however would there be a Muslim in his sound state of mind preferring not to offer a solitary brahimi to the Prophet arista la tercera preparing not to send the blessings of Allah to the Prophet Elisha no one would do this and anyone who would think of doing it probably does not love the properly audience lots alone because we know the more you offer salat and Salam to the our prophet is awesome the closer you are to him and the more you do this the more Allah would answer your calls and that is why the Prophet says are a solid rosellen every supplication is blocked from reaching allah azzawajal unless you offer salam to me so imagine you're sitting in the middle of the night you raise your hands you praise Allah and say oh Allah give me this all I give me that but you don't say Allah my Allah Muhammad Allah will not answer you're drunk that is why you have to say bismillah al hamdulillah then a cilantro salam ala rasulillah then o Allah pay my debts o Allah make me pass my exams or Allah grant me a child etc and a lot of the Muslims neglect this however do we do this when we are doing general dois in the sense that i want to say say you dude is still far what is say you do is surf are the master of asking allah for forgiveness aloma telugu laya highland jalapeno and abdul kannada digo rd come on so talk i would be becoming shuddering Masonic to the end of the drum do I say and handle Oh salatu salam out of Allah and I say this scholarship you have to be careful there are to us that are prescribed and the prescribed to us you do not start them with a handle a lot of servers Willem and there are general I'd like to make door to allah azzawajal to make me pass the exam tomorrow this is general door so i raised my hand i praise allah azzawajal and I offer salutation to the Prophet RSS and then I go for my door likewise in salat if I want to make du'a in my prostration do I proceed that by saying at hamdillah lot o servants of Allah answer is no because we're instructed to make du'a without that in frustration or before concluding the prayer with a salam and from this hadith also we learn that the cell of the people of our righteous predecessors used to consider the most expensive and the most valuable gift the things of knowledge the things related to Islam a brahmana vanilla is one of the greatest tavien he himself says I have witnessed a hundred and twenty of the companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam each one of them wishes when asked a question that his brother took the liability and answered the question instead of him this is when in issues of fatwa he said I met a hundred and twenty companions from the unsub nitron mahadji read from the Hegelian he met more and each one of them wishes and hopes that when someone comes and asks him about an incident that his brother would say I'll answer that for you how is it do we find the people nowadays if anyone asks a question what's the ruling on this you will get 10 or 20 people volunteering to answer the ruling is this no I think it's hella no i think is haram without knowledge yet the Companions of the Prophet I system as a drama Raveena Leila this one the stability great tabbing says they all tried to dodge to stay away from these fat words or answering questions because they did not want to speak without any knowledge so kaboo juror may allah be pleased with him also if i recall correctly he's the one who came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam while in the state of ephraim with buds and lays coming out of his head and that is why allah revealed in surat al-baqara the vidya for those who have to shave their heads if they are forced to do this due to an pneus and the video as we know is to slaughter a sheep or to feed six poor people have us are each or too fast three days cayuga ajara met a drama named layla and what did he say shall I give you a gift do you want me to give you a gift if someone today tells you this is say yes I do he says okay the Prophet said hey what the Prophet said give me a gift give me a wallet to give me a watch give me a pen give me a car this is the gift I'm looking for hadith Subhan Allah the difference of the hearts makes the difference of evaluating things a Brahmin was extremely happy with this gift what was the gift the prophet alayhi salatu salam told them that when he came out they told him we know how to greet you so how can we send the blessings to you and he taught them how to do that so this has indicated before it is asuna to recite but it is a highly recommended sunnah and no one in his sound state of mind would skip it just because it is asuna one or some of the scholar said how is it that allah tells us o Allah praise muhammad and the family of Muhammad as you have pressed the family of Ibrahim though we know that Ibrahim is lower than Muhammad Ali salatu salam so how can it be usually when you want something you say oh allah make me as strong as X Y Z because he's stronger than me if I but if I say oh allah make me as strong as a two-year-old child this would not be logical so how is it Danny happening this way there are a number of answers to that and scholars say the best of answers is that the prophet alayhi salatu salam is a descendant of Ibrahim because his son is a smile and the Prophet is the descendant of his marriage so Ibrahim is his great-grandfather and there were so many messengers and prophets of the descendants of Ibraheem because he had his hack and all the prophets of the Jews we're from the descendants of his half so allah azzawajal is telling us or the Prophet awesome is teaching us to praise and to send the blessings on the Prophet re salatu salam as it was to all the messengers and prophets that we're descending from ibrahim peace and blessing be upon them all this is all the time we have until we meet next time fee amanillah o sanam re Kumar fallahi mobarak Otto Oh"
