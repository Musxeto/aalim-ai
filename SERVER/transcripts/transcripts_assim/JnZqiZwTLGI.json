middle path the prophet he told us whoever chooses a path other than mine is not considered to be from my followers asalamu May the peace mercy and blessings of Allah subhana tala be on all of you brothers and sisters we have brother aim Alim from Saudi Arabia with the ba in linguistics from King abdulaziz University in jeda and a high diploma in Islamic Studies from the umul University in Makkah brother aim al-hakim has taught English as a foreign language for 15 years in public schools he's currently a manager in a leading Global Industrial company as a public relations officer he has been an Imam for the past 19 years delivering Friday speeches and a variety of lectures in Arabic and English he has presented TV programs for Saudi English TV Channel radio channel al- Maad to TV channel and Huda TV channel as well as participated in many radio and TV programs worldwide an articulate and balanced orator to speak on the two extremes and the middle part brothers and sisters please welcome brother aim alakim Al today's topic as you have heard is about the two extremes and the middle path Allah the almighty the creator of this universe has praised us as Muslims in the Holy Quran by saying you are the best of peoples Ever Raised up for mankind and Allah also talks about us in the Holy Quran Quran saying thus we have made you a just a balanced Nation so this is what a Muslim should be you have to be balanced and you have to be on the middle path if you look at the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam he told us that his followers his umah will be divided into 73 factions 73 sects all of it will be in hell with the exception of one and I pray to Allah Asel that he makes me and you among this particular one only one will be in Jah so the companion said which one who are they and the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam said it is the JAMA it is the unity and not in the sense of numbers because if you look at us Muslims we are great in numbers but we are not a Unity we are not aama the of the Prophet Alat who used to carry his Evolution all the time and he used to carry the sandals of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam who took more than 70 chapters of the Quran direct from The Prophet's mouth he says Jama the unity is whatever corresponds to truth even if this meant you were to be alone and look at the time of Abraham peace and blessing be upon Him prophet Abraham was alone and the whole population of Earth was against him but at that particular time he was the he was doing what Allah told him to do he was worshiping Allah alone and that made him theama therefore for us to know and analyze whether we are from the JAMA or from the remaining 72 factions and sects we have to know we have very limited time life is too short look at the years that have passed and look at the remaining years life is too short for us we have to identify which faction is the one on the correct and middle path the middle is usually a point in the center with equal lengths from all sides that is why when you have a center of a circle this means that you are in the middle of it and this means that if there's a fire it's going to eat and consume the outskirts of the circle and to reach at the very end to the center so by you being in the center you'll be away from all calamities from all problems from all bad things that may happen if you look at Islam you will find that it is a religion that deals with f with nature proper nature that is it deals with balance because it addresses your body body and it also addresses your soul and whoever takes care of his soul will Elevate to the level of angels and whoever descends like an animal following his desires and lust he will be next to the level of animal world it was reported and this is in theah of Muslim that Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him once met a companion of prophet called and he is different than by the way was a companion who died as a martyr on the day of his wedding night the following day and the prophet saw himat being washed from sexual imp impurity from janabah between the heavens and the Earth by the Angels the prophet was astonished what is this so they went to his house they asked his bride it was his first night she said that last night was our wedding night and when it was morning it was called for Jihad to defend Medina he went and he died as a martyr in the Battle of UD defending Islam and defending Medina so the Angels washed him he's a different person this guy is or and this man when he met Abu Bakr Abu Bakr is checking him out what's happening says I have become a hypocrite Abu Bakr said this is a great offense being a hypocrite meaning that you are rejecting Islam you'll be in hell hell forever why is that he said Abu Bakr when we are with the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam masallah we hear the Quran we hear theck we hear the knowledge we see the prophet we feel as if we are next to the angels in faith and belief but the minute we go back to our homes and we sit with the wives we play with the children we look after our farms and afid we do not recognize our hearts it's not the same heart Abu Bakr paused for a while and said well if this is the case I believe I have become a hypocrite like you tell you what we have big problems let's go and meet the prophet Alat wasam imagine this Abu Bakr the second in command the second best man after the prophets sallallahu alaihi wasallam whoever walked on Earth Abu Bakr sik may Allah be pleased with him and join us in Paradise with him Abu Bakr andah went to the prophet they went in and the prophet looked at H what's going on what's Happening H said oh prophet of Allah I've become a hypocrite and he repeated the same allegation the prophet Salli wasallam smiled and told him if you were in the same status at your home with your wife and children with your farms and tray as you are with me by Allah on the streets of Medina you will see the Angels shaking hands with you eye to eye it's an elevation it's a level it's a status of belief that once you reached it and it's possible if you reached it you would see the Angels because you're so pure that they will shake hands with you but the prophet says an hour and an hour which means an hour to your lord In Worship in thck and remembering Allah and an hour to your heart you have to have some sort of relief permissible relief nowadays the brothers and sisters have an hour for your lord for Allah and an hour for your Satan it's this way and a lot of the brothers I know have an hour for Allah and 23 hours for Satan may Allah have mercy on us our religion is a religion of balance it's the middle way it was reported in an authentic Hadith that Salman Al fari may Allah be pleased with him the truth seeker and he is a topic by his own may Allah be pleased with him but Salman Ali when he came to Medina the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam joined him and a companion by the name of Abu D they made them Brothers they were so close that was at the very beginning of the Hijra of migration that they could have inherited each other to that extent as if they were from the same flesh and blood so Salman went to his brother's house and he saw his wife not wearing properly in the sense that she's not taking care of herself she didn't do any makeup she didn't do her hair and she didn't do any well this was as the very beginning at the very beginning of Medina era where hijab was not enforced so women had the power had the right to go without wearing the hijab so Salman looked at his sister-in-law and said why are you doing this why aren't you taking good care of yourself she said look at your brother Abu D he's useless he prays to Allah all night and he fasted in the daytime time what time is left so he said okay no problem when Abu D came he saw his brother Salman so he brought food to him as a gesture of Goodwill you know when you have guests coming you feed them so Salman said to his brother eat Abu D said I'm fasting I can't eat he told him by Allah you will eat otherwise I'm not going to eat I'm your guest so Abu D said okay this is voluntary fast I'll make it some other day and he broke his fast after Isa prayer when they were supposed to sleep and they didn't have a guest chamber and another one for those who are coming from abroad and a third and the fourth they had only one room to stay in Abu D stood up and wanted to pray a night prayer aftera this is his usual routine from 9:00 until 5:00 or 6:00 in the morning morning it's all standing in prayer this is the norm for Companions and for righteous people so Salman told him go to bed but I want to pray go to bed so he left he went to sleep an hour later he looked his night he wanted to go and pray Salman told him go to bed not now and just before F prayer about half an hour an hour Salman told him now we pray and they stood up and prayed until fer prayer after they finished he gave an advice to his brother he told him Abu D Allah the almighty has rights over you your wife has rights over you your friends or your visitors have rights over you and your body has rights over you therefore give each one his own rights this is the balance in Islam Abu D did not buy this said what is Salman talking about he went to the prophet Alat wasam to check things out and the prophet told him this is exactly the truth and you have to follow what Salman may Allah be pleased with him told you if you look at the imbalance in our life it's overwhelming you find people and this is the majority of Muslims spent almost their entire enire life as if there is no as if there is no Hereafter they work for this life they live and die for this life they spend all of the times trying to make a decent an honest or not honest real dollar rupee or whatever this is all what they care about they live and die for their lust and desires and then on the opposite side you'll find people who think that they are being good at the side of Allah so what they do is they stay in their Masjid they stay in their houses of worship praying to Allah fasting doing good things on the surface but they don't work they depend entirely on people to support them so this farmer comes a end of the day and give them two three rupees five6 and they say yes this is their right because I'm worshiping Allah I'm devoting my time to Allah and this again is UN Islamic nowhere in Islam that tells you devote yourself to Allah in the sense that you don't work you don't have a family you don't flourish this Earth that Allah has given us there was a man by the name of s but he was known as alab the liar this man thought that he was very close to Allah that he is fully devoted to Allah so he once was praying he said oh Allah test me try me do whatever you want with me you'll find me a okay you'll find that I'm a strong believer and I'm patient to whatever you test me with so tested him with a urinary retention he could not urinate he drinks water but he could not urinate it's an illness it makes people you know squeeze inside of them so the guy used to walk and whever he finds children he would go to them and say oh children pray for your uncle the liar I've prayed for something and I was lying I'm not able to test to withhold or withstand what Allah is testing me with and this is true never ever test Allah be humble be submissive but never ever test the power of Allah the almighty if you look at Islam Islam is a religion of balance between this life and the Hereafter but it tells you clearly that whenever there's a conflict you should choose the Hereafter and this is something that a lot of us don't understand we're good Muslims as long as my salary is in my bank account at the end of the month I'm a good Muslim as long as my wife is okay and my children are doing fine or doing well but if there's a Calamity if I had to make the choice between this life and what pleases Allah Asel well Allah he is most forgiving and most merciful but my boss is not so I have to please my boss Allah the almighty says but seek with that wealth which Allah has bestowed on you the home of the Hereafter and forget not your portion of lawful enjoyment in this world and do good as Allah has been good to you as stated earlier this umah the followers of the Prophet will be divided into 73 factions or sects but which one is on the winning end which one is the one to go into Paradise Islam came to change the convictions of people it came to change the perspectives how you look at things yet this is something that not a lot of the Muslims are at good terms with in the sense that I'll give you an example Our Lives we considered it to be a big picture I have the wife I have the children I have my desires I have my hobbies I have my house I have lots of things it's a big picture Islam is a frame that we should not look look at anything except through it so if you're a proper Muslim if you are a real Muslim a balanced one you come to this Frame and you put it on the picture and you start cutting the edges from your life so girlfriends no this is not lawful in this Frame whiskey intoxicants No gambling no riba no being unfair to people no all of this is not accepted so this at the end of the day you'll have a frame that fits the picture 100% like a glove fits a hand beautiful you're a proper Muslim what a lot of us do nowadays we bring the picture mashallah it's very big we bring the frame it's too small so what do you do I'll break this Edge a little bit I'll try to put some plastic he here I'll extend that age a little bit and I'll put super glue here at the end of the day I have a frame that is not a proper frame your life and mine is exactly the same we are not proper Muslims in the sense that Allah wants us to be because our priorities are far different what they are supposed to be now to be a balanced Nation to be on the medal path this is something you cannot know without looking through the Quran and the Sunnah why is that because every one of us has his own logic his own means of measurement for example if I meet someone from Scandinavia a guy that is 7 feet tall and I tell him did you see XY Z he said which one the tall person or the short one his way of identifying tall and short differs from a man coming from for example Japan who is 5 feet tall if you bring someone from the NBA a basketball player he would look at me and say look at this I consider myself to be a little bit tall and if I look at someone who is 4 fe8 I would say oh look at this m it goes on and on and on so what is the logic the origin of all of this is the Hadith of the Prophet Alat wasam where three men visited his houses and checked about how he used to pray and worship fast so they asked the mother of the Believers the other mother of the Believers the wives of the Prophet what's the prophet's conduct so they told them so the three of them said down and said listen I believe that he is the prophet of Allah because Allah has forgiven all of his previous sins and the coming sins he has nothing to worry about so let's do something really strong in Islam so one of them said okay I'll never marry he's the lucky one he said I'll never marry he doesn't want to marry women at all he wants to live a life without any marriage or having sex the other one said well I will never sleep at night immediately after Isa prayer I'll pray until it's fer prayer and the third one said well for me I'll never break my fasting I'll fast every single day this way we believe that Allah will forgive our sins the prophet heard about thisat he was Furious he was angry he came on the member and praised Allah and said why do I hear people from my followers from my companions say so and so and so by Allah I pray the night and I sleep I fast the day and I break my fast and I marry women this is human nature whoever chooses a path other than mine is not considered to be from my followers look at this balance this is how we should look at things one would say no I want to kill myself doing this or that I want to go to the extreme no if you're not following the prophet's patham you are not considered to be among his followers and what is the cause of this imbalance why do people go to the extremes it's very simple who do you think is among the best to know the human soul Soul other than Allah of course the creator of human Souls who do you think the best who knows the human soul one would say the prophet Alat others would say well Freud no the best person that knows the human soul more than any other is Satan what yes Satan Satan knows you quite well to the extent that if you ask me for my CV I would give you a 21 years long experience while Satan has thousands of years of experience in luring people and in seducing them Satan comes to one of us and he tests our faith if he sees that I'm strong in faith he'll make me go to the extreme and if he sees that my faith is weak speak and I'm lenient he will take me to the extreme in leniency take the woodoo for example every Muslim performs woodo the minimum is once for every limb the maximum is three so Satan looks at me if he sees that I'm a strong Muslim I'm a very tough person he says listen three maybe you've missed something make it five and I go on washing my limbs five times every time I perform ation 3 4 weeks later on he said listen alhamdulillah water is free why not take a total bath for every prayer it's cleaner it's better Allah loves cleaniness alhamdulillah and somewhere down the line he comes to him and says listen when you pray in the Masjid this man coughs and that one's socks smell and this guy moves a lot next to you and this is causing me to not to con concentrate so close your eyes and pray closing your eyes I'll fall asleep it's okay but you try to concentrate two 3 weeks later he tells him why not pray home if you pray home you're on your own alhamdulillah you're concentrating you're contemplating your submissiveness is to the max 3 or four weeks later why not close turn off the lights turn off the air conditioning no fan so that you don't hear any noise and pray alone and four or five weeks later he will abandon prayer and the happy one is Satan on the extreme Satan comes to those who are not strong in faith and belief and tell them once is enough okay but there's a spot I didn't wash yeah Allah is Kim Allah is generous Allah is most forgiving this you think Allah will punish me for this spot that I didn't wash come on instead of praying on time I delay the prayer just before Asser prayer and even if prayer prays alhamdulillah I'll pray them after and if there's not enough time I'll pray them at the end of the night and if I forget and sleep and I don't pray any of those oh it's a new day tomorrow and he keeps on until the brother abandons Islam through this imbalance Islam is a religion of balance even in your fear of Allah there is balance because you wish and hope for paradise and you fear the Hellfire but even in that there has to be balance Omar may Allah be pleased with him the second KH and the father-in-law of the Prophet Alat wasam his daughter was ha he said if someone calls over the Earth that all the population of Earth are in Paradise except one this one is in hell I would be afraid that I might be that one but if someone calls that everybody is in Hell except one in Paradise I would have wished and hoped that I would be the one so it's a matter of balance balance in your belief balance in your ways of following the Quran and the Sunnah we have people who go to the extreme in saying that you have have to follow one maab one school of thought even if it's different to the Quran and Sunnah even if it's still clear that it is against the Quran and Sunnah follow it with all its good and bad and if you don't you're sinful and in The Other Extreme we have people saying it is forbidden to follow any school of thought you have to follow the Quran and Sunnah but I'm not able I'm not qualified to understand the Quran and Sunnah on my own regardless you have to follow it right or wrong so this is again extreme one of the characteristics of the balanced way the middle way is the easiness of Islam our religion is a religion of easiness the Prophet Alat sent two of his companions to Yemen and Abu mus may Allah be pleased with them all and he gave them a word of advice he told them try to make things easy and do not make things difficult to people try to give the Glad Tidings and do not turn people away from Islam try to cooperate and do not disagree because disagreement is evil when it comes among Muslims and a great misconception amongst Muslims where I come from the always coat the first half and they leave away the second half a famous Hadith by mother may Allah be pleased with her she said that the prophet wasam whenever he was given the choice between two things he would always take the easy thing among the two one of them is more difficult than the other he would always take the easy thing this is what we usually quote so whenever there is a need to make a choice people tell you take the easy way why because of this Hadith they never complete the Hadith whenever the prophet Alam had the choice between two things he would have always chosen the easy thing providing there was no sin no ethm involved because if there was sin in it he would have been the furthest person from it and a lot of the brothers and sisters usually quote Scholars saying so and so though it is in opposition to the Quran and Sunnah so when you tell someone Allah the almighty says so and so he tells you well she so and so says the other thing the other way yes but Allah says this in the Quran you can read this he does not like that he says well I follow the shikh rather than follow the Quran or the crystal clear Sunnah and it is part of being imbalance to apply things to you that may harm you even if you love this religion even if you love worshiping Allah if this leads to harming you Allah says do not kill yourself Allah is most forgiving and merciful to you so if someone is sick and he fasts knowing that this would harm him he is sinful if someone has an injury a wound or some form of illness in his body and he has to make a total bath and this would harm him or kill him if he does take a total bath he is sinful he should perform tum this is part of the easiness of Islam we're told to be balanced even in expenditure when we spend money so don't spend all of your money and become poor and needy but don't be a miser and tie your hand to your neck be in between and some would say doesn't this conflict with Abu bakr's way of life Abu Bakr came out from his wealth three times at the time of the Prophet alhat wasam Omar said once every time I raise Abu Bakr in Good Deeds mallah he always comes first now this time I'm going to be the first he went to the prophet with a large sum of money and said this is for the prophet Alat and for Allah and for the prophet he told him what did you leave for your children he said half of it exact so he took 50% of what he owns and gave it to Allah and to the prophet Alam so the prophet said may Allah bless you Abu Bakr came with a larger amount and he put it in front of the prophet and said this is for Allah and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam so the prophet told him what did you leave for your children he said I left Allah and the prophet alhat wasam he gave away 100% of what he owns everything do you imagine just leaving yourself with what you're wearing all your wardrobe all your cards if you have cars all your belongings all your bank accounts all your possessions to the side of Allah now this does not contrad ICT with this balance because Abu Bakr was a merchant and he knows that he'll be getting more and more he's healthy he can work and double that what he gave at the side of Allah but this applies to us who have a fixed income and if you spend everything a week or two later you say I'm begging people for money this is completely unacceptable we have to also balance when we make when we enforce virtue and deter and prevent evil this is one of the signs of the Believers whenever they see a reason to enforce virtue they advise people but you have to be balanced in the sense that if you can enforce it it's legal for you to enforce it it's a must if you are a law enforcer if you a ruler if it's in your house and your kids are doing something wrong you have to enforce virtue and prevent evil but if it's in a public place or it's with a co-worker and you can't do that with your own Force it's nobody will accept this then you have to do it by talking and speaking advising and if you can't do it neither by force nor by rhetoric then you have to do it with your heart as is in case if you go to a place and you find someone drinking alcohol who's got this he's drinking booze and he he's drunk and he's got a 45 loaded on the table with a hay trigger and you say it have fear of Allah intoxicant is Haram and you know if you do this he's going to shoot you between the eyes Allah tells you don't say this because this will add or will lead to more Vice so just deny this and prevent this by Heart by not accepting this is also part of the balance in advising people some of the brothers go to the extreme in wanting to enforce their own opinions among others you have your right to believe what you want and I have my right to believe in what I want but if I come to the conclusion that you have to be in the same way that I am this is imbalance Imam Sha may Allah have mercy on him says my opinion is correct with the possibility that it might be wrong and my opponent's opinion is wrong with a possibility that it might be right so there is always a room for discussion without cutting the edges and saying No this is here is where we stop and you're definitely wrong and I'm definitely right even when you teach someone sometimes you have to teach people in a different way than you teach others a person who is ignorant is different than a person who is arrogant for example the prophet Alat wasam was with his companions a man came to the Masjid the most holy place in Medina the Masjid of Medina and this Nomad he came he lift His Garment and started to urinate in the Masid in front of the prophet in front of the companions the companions are Hot Blooded so they immediately stood up and wanted to beat this man the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told him leave him leave him till he finishes and this is wise of the Prophet because if they would have frightened him the guy would have splattered urine all over the Masjid running away from them and he would have got this on his body and his clothes so they left him until he finished then he ordered them to pour water over it he brought the man and he told him my son my brother my nephew these mosques are not made for such filth they're made for prayer for remembering Allah for reciting the Quran and the man was so happy he said oh Allah have mercy on me and on Muhammad and deprive all those here from that Mercy to that extent because he was overwhelmed with his kindness so the prophet told himam come on Allah's Mercy is much wider and bigger than this it should accompany it should acquire it should take all of us but in another Hadith the prophet wasn't so lenient he wasn't so soft especially with those who had knowledge once he came to his companions and he found one of them wearing a golden ring and for men it's forbidden to wear anything that has gold in it have it be a ring a pen a key hold or whatever so he was Furious and angry he went to his companion he took the ring of gold from his finger and he tossed it on Earth and he says Subhan Allah praise be Allah one of you goes to a fiery Stone a stone of fire and puts it in his finger what is this and he left the companions went to that man and said pick up the ring and sell it give it to your wife he said by Allah I would never ever take something the prophet tossed it the prophet didn't tell him it's Haram to use but the man out of complete Obedience of the Prophet left it he doesn't need it anymore there are lots and lots of things to be talked about but I believe that if we are fair to Muslims we can be Balan without fairness we will never be a balanced umah an um on the middle we have to be fair with the non-muslims before that we have to be fair with our wives with our children with our neighbors with our co-workers whenever you see a Muslim being unfair to someone on the road and this is what they call road rage just because he did a mistake I want to stop him and beat him I want to harm him this means that you are not among the balanced umah the more we try and strive the more Allah Asel will make us among this balanced umah and finally is it a choice for us to be balanced is it something that we can say well I'd like to be balanced and one would say no I'd like to be an extremist no it is not a choice it's an instruction from Allah the almighty for us to be balanced and to be on the middle path otherwise we would not qualify to be from that sect that is following the prophet and his companions that would be salvaged and saved from Hell Fire And I pray to Allah Asel that he would benefit us from what we have heard and that he would join us on the day of judgment with the prophet and his companions brother for your elucd sa and uh clear to we have short time just 4 to 5 minutes we'll allow one question quickly on the mic in the front and one question from the sister's side before we wind up the session yes brother quickly asalam alaykum my name is Khan Abel and I'm graduate from science I would like to ask you a question in our society everyone says we are on true path then how can we realize that which one is on true path and which one is follow the true religion well this is again coming back to the Quran and Sunnah you're talking about Muslims or are you generally speaking generally speaking generally speaking you have what is known as the acid test everyone claims so you bring their claim and put it to the acid test you can tell by the fruits of each religion you can tell by the teachings of each religion and Believe Me Brother only one religion will stand the acid test if you are an objective person if you are not biased if you are a logical person you will find that Islam is the ultimate and the only solution and look at the amount of people accepting Islam with all the accusation of terrorism of extremism with all the poverty worldwide yet people are accepting Islam in the millions and those rejecting Islam are negligible they you cannot see them even with a microscope so there are so many ways and ways to prove this but I don't know this is the only way that I believe in it that you have to scrutinize and test each and every religion and compare it to the other holistically and then you will come to the conclusion we came to brother what does Islam have to say about abandoning faith if a person does not have faith and he does not have belief then what is the difference between him and an animal they all eat they all drink and they all mate and reproduce but without belief where are you we have a wisdom of us being created here those who do not have a belief they say we don't have a wisdom we just created like this and then we leave and we come back again and we leave and we never remember anything from the past if an atheist says that we don't have any wisdom we ask this atheist the shoe you're waiting does it have a wisdom said yes it protects my feet Subhan Allah a Sho has a wisdom of being there and you in this vast huge Universe with this perfection in you and your body without any logical reason I fail to see the wisdom behind this brother"
