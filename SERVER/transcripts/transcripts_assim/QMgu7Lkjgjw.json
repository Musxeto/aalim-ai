  "transcript": "says you said about kneeling that it is haram but what about the incident where umar knelt before the prophet i do not know of any such incident what we know of is the hadith of muradin may allah be pleased with him when he was sent by the prophet alaihis was salaam to yemen to teach them and to judge between them and he came back and the moment he came back he fell and prostrated to the prophet salallahu the prophet was said what are you doing so mahath said i saw this where the jews and christians used to do it to their masters and i thought that you're more worthy of them so the prophet said that if i were to order a person to prostrate to another i would have ordered the wife to prostrate to her husband meaning that prostration to humans or to other than allah to be any precise prostration to other than allah is totally prohibited so i don't know where you got this story about kneeling but it is not true"
