  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] m m [Music] mhd dear brothers and sisters in Islam Alay and welcome to Mercy to Mankind last time we met we discussed how the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam was sent to the countryside for breastfeeding and we talked about the blessings that the family that took the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam for breastfeeding found through him such as the prosperity uh uh uh the things that they've seen though they were in drought and almost famine but they had all these blessings through the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam the mother being able to breastfeed though she was hungry and was not able to do so before taking the prophet Salli wasall the camel became healthy the Sheep became fat and the air area itself became green all of this through the blessing of the Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam after two years concluded the woman who was breastfeeding the prophet Hala took him back to his maternal mother and to Amina and she wanted to keep him more because she was emotionally attached to this child who was not like any other she saw the blessings that Allah bestowed upon her and her husband and his family of course this was not the only reason because you cannot help but to love this child it is nothing that you can do about it Muhammad sallallah alaih wasallam was the mercy to all mankind and he was himself a blessing so though they realized the blessings that they have been touching with their own hands through the prophet sallallah wasallam yet they still loved him as a child who was like no other so she tried to convince his mother and the mother conceded and accepted that he stays with her for few more years so that in order for him to become stronger fitter and more you know uh more fluent and the language and uh uh um better minded do Arabs were the people of eloquence or rhetoric speech though they were literate the majority of Arabs were illiterate they could not read or write and the prophet sallallah Al wasallam was among them there were only a handful of people who had the ability to read and write they only spoke one language which is Arabic and the majority of the people were illiterate yet this illiteracy added value to their clearance of Mind in the sense that they were the best poets they were the the the the the best in uh uh uh the art of construction of words they had this beautiful ability of saying nice things in very limited number of words so uh uh Hala went back to her tribe B and the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam remained there for a few more years just when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was about 5 years old an incident took place and we are are told that as he was playing with the children though he was not like any uh other child he was quiet he was deep in thought he was not Reckless yet he was a child so as he was playing with the child Allah Asel sent the Archangel Gabriel to him who took him and laid him on the floor on the ground while everybody was scared and he opened his chest surgically of course he was not a surgeon but this is the power of Allah given to Gabriel he made the first open heart surgery we are told that he opened his chest he took his heart and from it took a black uh blood clot and told the prophet s wasallam who was astonished of what what's taking place imagine a 5 years old child being operated on while he's still awake no uh anesthesia nothing so he told him this is the part of Satan in you now your heart is clear and clean your heart is pure Satan has no way or will over you and then he returned the heart back again and Su his chest back an Malik one of the companions of the Prophet said and told us that he used to see the traces of this split in the prophet Sall alam's chest in order to operate on him and we realize that the Satan's part of the Prophet Sall wasallam was taken out when we read about his biography about his and discover that he had never ever committed a major sin and that he had never ever told a lie and that he had never ever prostrated or bowed to any of the idols at that time he never ate anything that was slaughtered to their Idols all of this he did not know why simply because Allah has protected him from this by this operation now he was about years old Hala was scared because the boys came the children came to her and told her that your son has been killed so she went and rushed with her husband to the location and they found Muhammad with a very pale face and this is normal after undergoing an operation of such magnitude and she embraced him and took him back back to his mother because she did not want to take any further responsibity responsibility that may affect her the prophet Alat stayed with his mother for a period of time some say he stayed there with her 6 months others say he stayed for a whole year no matter how long he stayed there a year or a little bit more or less the prophet said with his mother and he again was an orphan for another time by his mother mother passing away and this took place when the prophet s wasallam and his mother went to Medina to visit the grave of his father Abdullah as some stories say they stayed there for a month and on her way back she fell sick and she died again this is an indication from Allah the almighty that no one should have any influence over this Messenger to be no father and no mother it is only Allah who will take care of his messenger Muhammad sallallahu alaih wasallam a six-year-old child no father and no mother immediately it was his grandfather Abdul mutalib who took care of his grandson Abdul mutalib as we know was not on his own he had nine other sons who had children of their own who had children of their own so his family was a very huge and big family we did not mention of course the girls he had only we're talking about the the male the boys only and beside he was the leader of his tribe he was one of the dignitaries of Mecca so he was not like any other he had so many things to do yet once he heard about his grandson and the death of his mother he felt so soft towards his grandson he was touched by the death death of his mother that he took it as his own responsibility to look after his grandson though he could have given him to any one of his sons to take care of yet he res res assumed the responsibility on his own by himself Abdul mutalib treated his grandson Muhammad Alam in a very delicate and generous way and Muhammad as you remember was 6 years old old he was a kid he was a child Abdul mutalib was a who used to come as a child walking until he comes to that mat and sits in the middle of it his uncles the Great Men of qur used to try to prevent him from doing that and try to take him away from it ABD mutalib would say leave my son it's okay leave my son and they were astonished we are your sons and none of us dare to do this and this grandson you allow him to do this and he's a child and he used to sit beside him put his hand on his back and embrace him to him and say this son of mine will have a great role in the future he's not like any others they can see they know he's different he's intelligent he's honest it's not something within him but they can tell and they can sense that it is there is some something very special about Muhammad s but don't you think that there is a wisdom behind having Muhammad sah wasallam being raised up as an orphan can you elaborate a little bit more yeah um I think that Allah wants him himself the almighty want us to raise Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam so he had him he had his father and his mother dead yes well I I I think I mentioned this a little a bit earlier saying that that Allah wanted to be responsible over Muhammad alham not to be influenced by any of his parents not his mother nor his father and that is why he was raised as an orphan sallallahu alaih wasallam and even his great-grandfather that is his grandfather Abdul mutalib who was great and honored by all the people of Mecca even him it was only a year or two before he died and passed away so the grandfather that the prophet s wasallam was standing tall next to also it was only two years and he passed away when the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was about 8 years ago 8 years old but just before he died he asked his son his son ABD ask his son Abu Talib to care for his Grand son

our prophet's Uncle sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam was not a rich man yet he took his nephew Muhammad sallallahu alaih wasallam and considered him to be one of his sons and he loved him dearly more than his sons and this was the pattern with every person who met the prophet sallallah alaih wasallam he was not a magician and he was not a tyrant people loved him because of his characteristics and this is a very important thing for us to know among all the Great Men Who Came throughout history the prophet sallallahu alaih Ali wasallam is the perfect human being in the sense that he ruled yet he was not a king he preached yes he yet he was not a monk and he was a human being in all what this word may contain people loved him people respected him people would pay their lives cheaply just for the sake of his pleasure they would not think twice before giving their lives away in protection and in his pleasure sallallahu alai and he is he was indeed the perfect human being he had ruled a country a kingdom a nation but was himself a Pious person he owned the treasures that were available worldwide it was all at his fingertips yet when he died he left nothing well as he lived he left nothing once went to his house and looked around and he could see only a mat made of hay with a pillow filled with some material that is rough and tough and only a a water container made of skin hanging in the house that was the furniture the prophet was lying down in his side and the mat made of hay affected his skin you can see traces of it because it was harsh and not uh comfortable om Omar could not help it but weep so the prophet looked at him and said Omar why are you weeping he told him oh prophet of Allah I see the rulers of Persia and banan I see the Zar I see the Caesar or heras uh are enjoying the gold the silver the mansions and the power and you who Allah has sent to all mankind are sleeping sleeping on this why don't you want me to weep he said oh Omar wouldn't it be satisfying to you that to know that this is what they're going to enjoy in this life and then all of this will be ours in the Hereafter the prophet if he wanted he could have had all of this and he had the money he had the wealth but he was not a king he was a servant of Allah he distributed all what he had to his people and to the poor he gave money so much of it to people just to embrace Islam in one incident he was once in a valley filled with sheep and a nomad came who was not a Muslim and the man was looking at the sheep in astonishment so much so many of them so the prophet looked at him and said do you like it so the man said yes so the prophet said it's yours now if you look and contemplate on this story personally speaking if I had two sheep two sheep I would not give one of them away to anyone my God this cost so much and much dollars I want I want this to to keep but if I have to I may give half of it now for the prophet sallallah alhi wasallam to do this and give the whole valley which is minimum of 5,000 sheep to a nomad to a no one he's nobody which this shows you how generous he was and it shows you that he could care less about this world nothing he had nothing uh uh uh connected or attached to it so he had the whole world at his fingertips yet he did not enjoy it because he was not a tyrant he was not a king he was a servant of Allah and at the same time he did not isolate himself in worship as a monk no he mixed with everyone else he went here and there and he talked to everybody and that is why was The Benchmark of generosity he was known to be the most generous person uh uh ever came and his son was the leader of his tribe or and he was a Christian and when he saw the prophet Sall wasallam he says that well the amount of respect and love that the followers of the Prophet sallam are giving him means that this guy is a king he he's not a prophet it can't he can't be he said until a young mate servant came to the prophet wasallam and told him him oh prophet of Allah I have something to talk to you in private please so the prophet told her choose any streets of Medina and I'll meet you there and she took the prophet s wasallam and walked the street of Medina this young maid she's a servant she's a slave talking to him about her own personal problem with no guards with nothing said the minute I saw this I recognized I realized that he is not a king these are this is not the behavior of a king he is indeed the messenger of Allah and he embrac Islam immediately even before the time of Revelation when uh Khadijah may Allah be blessed her um when she talked with the prophet Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam after trembling after the Revelation she said um you are generous with the guests and um uh carrying the burden and so on and so on uh that proved that he was sitting with others um interacting with others helping the the poor the needy and mhm indeed uh uh we will come to this inshallah on a later uh stage but what I wanted to at the point I wanted to get to was that no one could help but love the prophet so whoever met him with all these attributes with all these characteristics you couldn't help it so Abu Talib once he took the prophet wasallam among his sons he considered him one of his most favorite because he could not help not to as we said that Abu Talib was not rich which meant that with all the kids he has he had he had to have a source of income and that is what made Muhammad sallallahu alaih wasallam grow up and work as a shepherd and in one instance uh uh the companions of the Prophet Sall wasallam were with him at one time and he was telling them about certain type of fruit and grass so they and and this type only is known to those who uh uh uh take care of their sheep uh uh in the fields so they told him oh prophet of Allah you sound as if you have cared for cattle and you were a Shepherd before he said yes no prophet of Allah becomes a prophet except after caring for sheep and after working as a Shepherd so this is an indication that all Messengers and Prophets of Allah had at one stage of the times uh uh uh cared for the cattle or have been working as a Shepherd Scholars say that this is because caring for Shepherd for for sheep and and being with them for a long times teaches the individual to take care of the followers of the people and we have a Hadith where the Prophet saysat that those who care and uh keep camels are people of arrogance and pride and those who keep and care for the Sheep are people of uh uh tranquility and of calmness and this shows because it depends on what you keep and and and care for the people that are associating themselves with camels usually are arrogant like the bedwin arrogant and and proud of themselves like their camels if you look at a camel you'll find always the camel is a proud animal but those who stay with the Sheep all are always calm and peaceful and that is why all the The Messengers of Allah have been uh Shepherds at one stage of their lifetime it was very quiet as the prophet was growing up at one stage it's reported in the books of that Abu Talib took him to a sham when he was 11 or or 12 years old to on trade on a caravan for trade or or in a business trip was Abu Talib Trader also he was he was a jack of all trades all of the people of Mecca were Traders because as you remember they did not have any far farming and they did not have any industry so their only means of income was through trade especially when the pilgrims come to perform pilgrimage so they had to have something to sell for these pilgrims and as it is it's the same thing in Mecca if you go to Mecca or medina you would find that a lot of the people depend on the pilgrim uh pilgrims who come to perform pilgrimage I'm afraid that this is the time we have for today's program inshallah until we meet again we will try to uh uh elaborate a little bit more on how the prophet wasam grew up and until [Music] then [Music] m"
