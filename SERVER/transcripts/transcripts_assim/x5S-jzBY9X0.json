  "title": "Is the concept of saving others while killing yourself from Islam",
  "transcript": "fausan from indonesia he says that the concept of saving others while killing yourself well this is not logical and he's insisting on saving a christian woman i don't know why why isn't she a buddhist why isn't she jew why isn't she a hindu so he's saying i have one parachute the companions and the salaf whenever they were faced with hypothetical questions like this they would answer the question or by saying did this happen and the question said no they would say to him once it happens give us a call so likewise when people call and say if i am orbiting the earth how would i pray maghrib and where should what what should i face i said okay once you're up there in the orbit use your cellular phone and give me a call and ask me i'll give you an answer but not now therefore the concept itself whether she's a muslim woman or a man or a christian muslim or a man doesn't change a thing it is not permissible to put yourself in harm's way to save others because allah would ask you for this why did you commit suicide you should save yourself but this is again hypothetical and hypothetical questions you could say okay what about if this what about if that and it keeps on generating doubts and whispers in your head that do not relate to islam focus on learning the quran focus on learning the hadith focus on learning your akida and the in your religion and after that you may look into such things"
