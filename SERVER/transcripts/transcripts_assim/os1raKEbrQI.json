  "title": "How to fight OCD with Shirk",
  "transcript": "Abdul Mateen from India. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh, how do I do Shirk or Shirk? Thank you. Okay, this is a topic that requires a lot of give and take and this is what we do in counselling sessions. We simply show people and open their eyes of the steps of Shaytan where he manages to infiltrate their thinking process and change it where they have this OCD. The default is, and if anyone asks you, are you a Muslim? You will definitely say, yes, because this is the default. Now, if I ask you, are you a human being? The default is that you say, yes. So, problem solved. What do you mean Sheikh? If I were to say, if I were to say, you have these doubts that you are a bird, would you buy it and start flying? You say, no Sheikh, these are doubts, these are just whispers of Shaytan. Why? Because it goes against the default which is certain that I'm a human being. Likewise, when I get these OCD thoughts of Shirk, I say to it, this is nothing because the default is I'm a Muslim. Nothing can get me out of the state of Islam except concrete and solid evidence of Shirk or Kufr, which there is no evidence to back it up. So, the default is I'm a Muslim and this is how you should go about it."
