  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Emirates. So I just have a question about \ngiving Zakah to someone that I know. He sells alcohol, he has a shop where he sells   alcohol. Because he doesn't have \nmoney, he's poverty streaking. I have talked to so many people to talk to \nhim and give him money for my family member   or anything like that to advise him not to \nsell alcohol anymore but he's in Africa. But because you know there's so much you \ncan do to someone that needs money so can I   give him Zakah or can I make it contingent upon \nhim to stop selling alcohol and give him money? Okay first of all selling alcohol or \nconsuming it or buying it or carrying it   or making it or whatever, all those \ninvolved are cursed by Allah Azza Wa Jal Secondly, if he has a shop that sells alcohol this \nmeans that he's supposed to be self-sufficient. If he's not self-sufficient this \nmeans that when I give him Zakat money   most likely he will invest it \nby buying bottles of whiskey   so that he can make profit out of it, \nand by this, I would be also sinning. so if he's a Muslim, but a bad, evil, sinful \nMuslim and I know that he's in need he's poor   he's below poverty line and he needs financial \nassistance yet he's doing sins and most likely   he would utilize my money, my Zakat to \nenlarge his sins and expand upon it. What to do? Don't give him financial \nassistance in the form of cash. Rather tell him I have zakat money, I will give it to you in the form that   benefits you without giving you \ncash because you sell Haram. What do you want me to do? Pay your rent, \npay your electricity bill, or buy you food   and provision for your family? Whatever he chooses you do that with the \nZakat money and it's a done deal Insha Allah."
