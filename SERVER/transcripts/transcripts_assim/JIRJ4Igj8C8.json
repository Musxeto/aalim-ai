  "transcript": "Um we know that it is recommended to read before going to sleep. Should we recite it from the mus or uh from the memory? Would it will we get the same reward as well? It is best to recite it from memory and to memorize this because this is a blessed surah that would prevent you from being tormented in your grave and it will intercede for you as well. But if you don't memorize it and you read it from the musf, it is totally fine."
