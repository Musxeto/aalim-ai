  "title": "Unbraid Hair for Ghusl if I have Oil in My Hair? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Sumeyya from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is, so 24 hours before I made ghusl, which was mandatory, I oiled my hair and usually I did a lot of hair, a lot of oil in my hair because my hair is dry usually and I braided them. So 24 hours after that, I had to make ghusl. I didn't unbraid my hair and I didn't do any shampoo, I just did ghusl and it came out. And then hours after that when my hair dried and I was touching my braids, I found oil in my fingers, so did I invalidate my ghusl? First of all, the most authentic opinion is that we do not have to unbraid our hair when we perform ghusl. Whether it is a mandatory ghusl for a woman after being pure from menses or post-natal bleeding, or it's a ghusl for uplifting a major racial impurity resulting from nocturnal emission or sexual intercourse. This is the most authentic opinion. And as long as you have soaked your scalp and hair with water, as per the sunnah, and ensured that the water had reached your scalp and you washed thoroughly your braids, then your ghusl is valid, even if you find traces of oil, because oil is not a layer that prevents water from reaching the desired area and usually it's absorbed by the hair, by the skin and the likes, and only this feeling remains, but it does not prevent water and Allah Azza wa Jal knows best."
