  "transcript": "Okay, Susanna from India. Hello, Assalamu Alaikum. Wa Alaikumussalam wa Rahmatullah. Sir, my question was like some people have their name like Mujib or Rahim or something like this. So like these are the names of Allah, so if we call them by their name, are we sinful? The names of Allah Azza Wa Jal are divided into two types. Names that are only to be used with Allah Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala such as Al-Khaliq, such as Al-Razzaq, such as Al-Muhyi, Al-Mumit, Al-Rahman, Allah. These are only names that Allah can be called with, you cannot share it with anyone. Other names can also be adjectives to other creatures such as Kareem, Rahim, Mujib, Hakeem and the likes. And there's no problem in calling people with such names and Allah knows best."
