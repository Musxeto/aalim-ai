  "title": "Is it sinful to MIX different Riwayat when reciting Quran? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Yasin from Mali Yasin Wa Alaikumussalam, you're speaking from within a well. Try to get out of this well What about now? Okay, give it a shot So Sheikh, my question is Concerning about Riwayat when one is reciting the Quran and he recites different Riwayat in one ayah, like he doesn't do it deliberately, but Is it sinful and if it's permissible up to which extent can he mix the Riwayat with the second part of the Zakat? Which is then? First of all, there are seven Ahruf as we know of that were revealed to our Prophet ï·º and these Ahruf are Found in the ten Riwayat or forms of recitations we have the being the most prominent and well-known is Hafs An-Asim There is Warsh An-Nafi, there are many ten of them, but this is the most famous one. Now if a person is a Scholar or a knowledgeable person of the different Riwayat He knows what Riwayat this one is and this one is and this one is Then he may as a form of Reciting with it Give heads up to the people and tell them listen I'm gonna recite in Salatul Isha with this Riwayat so that people would not be confused and Chaos would not be Shown And This is permissible for someone of knowledge To mix between the Riwayat is not permissible because this goes against the etiquette of the Qiraat and the scholars of the Quran Say that this is not Befitting and it is causing confusion to the people praying behind you If a person is not a student of knowledge and he does not have knowledge in Qiraat But he heard this part of the ayah and he likes it and he wants to administrate it. No, this is not permissible at All and Allah knows best"
