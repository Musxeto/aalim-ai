  "title": "How to deal with splashes after urinating & flushing | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says I want to ask if someone urinates and then flushes and then starts to clean their private parts there is a chance the water inside the toilet touches them while cleaning does that have any impact on your purity what if we had not flushed a lot of these issues cleansing yourself washing yourself after urinating defecating a lot of these issues are a fertile ground for Shaitaan to mess up with your mind the devil comes and it's his playground to mess up with you so what to do first of all today's toilet seats are not designed in a way that could be helpful to ensure that nothing comes back to you but generally speaking we have guidelines we have rules in Islam the default that everything is pure until proven otherwise so if you flush the water that remains inside is clean it's pure there's no Najah salda√±a Jassa all the impurities have gone down the drain so this is pure what about if I did not flush I'm using a lot of water to wash myself and I sometimes feel that there might have been some splashes might have as long as it is might have this means that the possibility that it might not have so it's a 50/50 whenever there is doubt always implement the rule of certainty what is certain that this is pure this is pure that this is pure unless proven otherwise what do you mean proven otherwise there's a brown stain on my throat yeah but is it nikasha or is it a root and perfume well I don't know you don't know it's pure it might be as long as it's not 100% certain that it is an ijazah it is pure take a smell wow these things this is Natasha because now you are certain because of one of the characteristics which is the smell of Anna Jessa and the story so if you are the OCD type a person will upset obsessive compulsive disorder and everything around you you feel is impure in this case apply the rule of certainty but if you or not you're a normal person and usually you never get these thoughts and once every blue moon you have a strong feeling that you've might have splashed ajasa back back to you well are you sure that the water itself is not just if it was flushed then it's not nauseous and whatever whenever you clean yourself and wash your private part the amount of water that goes in with the amount of water in the toilet seat makes then ajasa dissolve and not apparent so the splashes are pure but if you're doubtful just wash it wash whatever area in your body feel that water might have spoiled it or soiled it or splashed Natasa onto it and this is does the job but the default is no it is pure and don't work your mind a lot on this"
