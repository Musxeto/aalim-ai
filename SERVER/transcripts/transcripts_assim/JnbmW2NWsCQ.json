  "title": "Everytime I find job I find something haram in it (Ocd) Everything halal by default Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so I would like to know how what are the rules guidelines to choose the job islamically correct in accordance with the Quran and the sunah so I can disc independently in the future whatever the job is each time I feel I found a correct job I figure out some things ARS to me in it and give up undoing it the question by itself is very generic and when a person does not have the proper knowledge Shan Whispers in his ears and makes him think that can I speak in the phone because the phone may distort my voice and the voice goes across seas and the Sheikh hears me and then maybe he thinks blah blah blah and Shan throws things in like this in your ear in your head one of the biggest reason reasons for people to have OCD or to Whispers of shatan is overthinking we have certain rules and regulations in Islam that governs our lives and the default everything is halal is that the default she yep everything is halal until proven otherwise so can I drink tea from this cup yes maybe the water is not pure maybe the people who made and collected this tea were using children maybe this maybe that the default it's halalah it's hot it's nice until proven otherwise without any proof move on don't Don't Look Back we come to jobs and many jobs are there for display but shaan comes and says oh maybe this job is Haram the French don't pronounce the h when it comes in the beginning of the word so they don't say hotel they say hotel so is it haram or not the default it is halal until proven otherwise what makes a job Haram the existence of Haram elements that are made by choice so I sell bottles of water oh my job is Haram why he says because someone can take the bottle and make ice cubes and drinks it with his uh Martini or with his vodka so this is illogical you're selling something Halal and you don't know about his intention there's nothing wrong in your work or job see how shatan makes you overthink the job has free mixing I live in a cafir country I'm a Muslim I have to earn I am the bread winner so what can I do work but have these barriers that Islam tells you about lowering your gaze don't communicate unless it is necessary no physical contact and do not socialize or  shat do your job you have a job description do it nowhere says you have to go for lunch with your colleagues of the opposite gender or you have to sayour it's it's not of your business to socialize work is work so in order for you to know what is halal and what Isam you have to go to be to the basics if you're doubtful you have to call the Sheikh go to the of the Masjid tell him I have this particular job and these are the concerns that I have whether it's Oram and he will tell you inshallah and Allah Knows Best"
