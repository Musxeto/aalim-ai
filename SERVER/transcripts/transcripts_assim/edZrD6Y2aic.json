  "transcript": "Juwayriya from France Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa Alaikumussalam I have a question So we know that a practicing Muslim is someone who reads the Quran and completes it every single month So I've been doing this for a long time now But however I'm also memorizing the Quran and taking other Islamic courses And in my day to day life I have other activities It's starting to become overwhelming because my memorization workload is increasing Which requires a lot of revision So revising one whole Juz and reading another Juz daily is getting so overwhelming So I was wondering what should I do in this situation Should I continue reading the entire Quran every month Or would I be excused in this case Barak Allah Wafiq Wafiq Barak Allah So by what you said you are doing the memorization of one Juz and revising one Juz So you're finishing the Quran by quantity every 15 days And this is definitely better than reciting one Juz and moving on So Alhamdulillah you're doing more than what you're supposed to You can skip that and make your revision of the Quran in your night prayer So that you can compensate this and it would be a win-win And Allah knows best"
