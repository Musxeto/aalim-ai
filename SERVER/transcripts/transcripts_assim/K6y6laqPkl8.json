  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] now this chapter deals with things or stuff related to Iman and Alabama Buhari wanted to tell us through this chapter how to respond to different sects and cults in Islam and how is that if we look at two big sects in Islam who have affected it negatively throughout time and they came quite early we will find that we have al how our age and we have a loggia how our age their main attributes or characteristics is that they say any Muslim who commits a major sin is a kafir and he is in Hell fire for eternity so if you drink wine if you fornicate if you steal if you even lie this is a major sin your cover all of your deeds are void and of course they add to that the killing of Muslims going against the Muslim rulers and so many other things on the other side we have the far extreme who say that you are a Muslim despite anything you do as long as you have the Eman in your heart so if you commit adultery if you commit any sin on earth other than associating others with Allah you're still a Muslim not only that your belief is as strong as the belief of Abu Bakr Omar Othman oh yes this why both of them made the same mistake although they are far extreme to each other they share the same concept wrong understanding of Iman they all believe that a man is one single entity that cannot be reduced or increased so the Huaraz said you are a believer the moment you commit a major sin your belief is gone call us you're a kafir while the more gia said Eman is a hole like the college it's one unit no matter what you do it does not affect it it cannot be increased and this is why they used to say that my Eman is the same as the a man of Jabril and Micahel there is no difference while even though ABI Malaika one of the terrain he said I met thirty of the prophet's companions ali in salat wa salam and none of them used to say my Eman is equivalent to Eman of gibreel and Mecca so Albahari with his knowledge comes to us and this is the best way of Darwin I could spend hours here just speaking and talking and lecturing and there is no benefit out of it while if I say one hadith all of you will believe true this is the best form of Dawa Allah Allah other Rasul people would immediately accept and relate because we're Muslims but when we keep on just you know giving talk and talk and talk and talk without relating you to the hadith without relating you to the evidence this is the way of Albahari he doesn't speak a lot he just gives you the hadith he tells you in the beginning this is my understanding of it and you go to the hadith hollis it's over so now we come to the hadith the Prophet says erase also sur le mano Bill Doran was it to Neshoba well hiya ooh sure button min al-iman my translation to that is I don't know why the line is cutting maybe the batter here mmm battery okay my battery order so the Prophet says Allah his salat WA Salam Eman is 60 plus branches and bashfulness is a branch of Eman this is my translation of the hadith now the extra is from the translator so understand it in this way when we look at the hadith and we understand that Eman is composed of branches and divisions this means that if i attain 60% then I'm still a movement but I'm lacking 40% now this refers to it is the battery voila I'm a dream I need batteries then a moderator MC need need batteries and I think transmission what should i do then and then okay give us a try uh-huh maybe so that the reception would be higher anyhow so a man is composed of three main components your belief very essential and there are a number of riba that even L AM L hey jerk may Allah have mercy on him stated infidel body that the deeds of the heart includes your appeal your intention there are twenty-four branches so he's classifying the 60-plus branches he says there are twenty-four branches related to the deeds of the heart and there are seven branches related to what you say verbally and there are 38 branches to the deeds that we do by our bodies this is his classification the is it any necessarily to know but we know that the vast majority of it is so when when we say that there are sixty plus branches of a man such as one I am asking you one Shahadah else to wherever you see the hadith man can you me novella he William will are her ha Feli Apple hyerin olya smooth whoever believes in allah that the objective must say good or refrain keep silent - Makani oh my noble area will add value cream - you should honor your guests and you keep on the menu a hadouken you will not believe until you love for your brother what you love for yourself all of these hadees mean that these are the branches of Eman and there's so many of them like Hillel Umbra a teen took me noble aji William L ahem it is not permissible for a woman who believes in am on the day of judgment to travel without a Muharram hadith so this is also part of the branch of the 'man which means if you manage to achieve all these branches of Emad then you are a full-fledged movement if you fail you know Muslim and you're a movement but you have discrepancies that you have to fix and this is why it is essential for us to understand the meaning of Eman because I can see someone who is a government official and he lies and he betrays and he steals and he embezzled and he does all hideous and bad things but he still what he seen a Muslim what do we think of him the vast majority would think he's a kafir why he made so many sins he did many wrongdoings so I will take him out of the fold of Islam ah wait be careful this is the doing of the Hawaii while you go to him and ask him he said I'm a believer I'm a Muslim I can do anything because I have a man in my heart now you're following the Mooji huh so you the best way is the way of the cell of the best way is the way of the Prophet that is thought to somewhere we can understand and relate to his religion okay this hadith defines a Muslim so part of Iman is you have to be a Muslim so what is Islam we spoke about the pillars is that Islam alone no Buhari tells us don't be confused in principle what appears to the Muslims there are five pillars we've mentioned in hadith diploma which took us the first period of this session in practical Islam is a number of different things as well essentially that a proper real Muslim has to do what is in the hadith Islam comes from the word submission it's this lamb to surrender your will to allah azzawajal it also comes from Salam which is peace so a Muslim who does not transmit peace to others especially and specifically to Muslims and this is not does the pointer have laser beam whatever so I can burn this yes I always wanted one like this so I cannot they tell me I have to stay here because beyond that I'll burn so Muslims is it intended only for Muslims so one says okay a Muslim is the one who avoids harming only Muslims but covered I can step on them I can take their money no be careful this is given as a scholar state as a liberal the majority but it does not exclude non-muslims even the non-muslims you have to refrain from harming or doing things back to them so a proper Muslim is the one who does not harm others and the means of harming others either verbally or through actions the one in your heart is between you and Allah Azza WA JAL can i harm people with my heart maybe yes such as envy if I'm envious and I envy people to know although he doesn't deserve this beautiful car he has it's she he shouldn't then or give him a evil eye all of a sudden he's having an accident this is Haram although I did not say anything but it's in my heart hatred grudges all of these negative feelings are harmful but what concerns the Muslims most is what you say and what you do so what harm can I give people with my tongue oh I can burn buildings with my tongue I can destroy marriages I can cause enmity I can make wars between countries by a single word this tongue has great weight with this tank you can enter paradise by saying la ilaha illa ma and with it you can enter hell by saying the word of blasphemy with it I can get married when I say to the father of the girl when he says I give you my daughter in marriage I say I accept and I can separate from my wife when I say to her I divorce you one word that's the job so the Prophet is telling us alehissalaam in order for you to be a true real practicing Muslim to fulfill your Islam to reach the highest levels of Eman you must refrain from swearing at people cursing them backbiting them causing the Mima between the lying breaking your promises all the things that are done with your tongue when you talk and this is why the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam when teaching were either by a german and he told them you have to do jihad you have to do a prayer you have to do this you have to do that at the conclusion he said shall I tell you something that some summarizes all the previous yes of course said refrain this and the Prophet held his tongue stop this from doing harm so my heart said o prophet of Allah are we accountable for what we say because we think that chit-chatting is it's okay no there's no sin in it we just sit for 6-7 hours talking about people backbiting what's the problem in Arabic we call it al Kalam mahalia Jim Rock John rock is the customs you pay when you get imports from abroad it's the taxes you pay so we have a saying in Arabic that speech has no taxes you can speak as much as you do nowadays yes you do they'll take a little put you in jail if you speak something bad so that's why we always refrain so the Prophet said alayhi salatu was-salam I felt the heat the Prophet said Allah is Allah to serve tequila Mo Kaya Murad may Allah make your mother lose you and this is not intended literally the Prophet is not saying me you die this is something that is said in Arabic and it's not intended may Allah make your mother lose you and make you die and she loses you what throws people on their faces in Hellfire except what they say it is very very dangerous thing to do and we have so many things about that what I think that we do not have time so we move on to the hands is it literally the hands or your actions no what is meant is your actions so in Islam anything you do or act whether you do it by hands or by your feet or by your gesture someone is telling me share do you know shares also and I say this is action it's sufficient I don't have to do anything mother has shed may Allah be pleased with her the Prophet was talking to her and saying Sofia which is other wife who was very beautiful she was you and became Muslim so he was mentioning her name out of jealousy I said o prophet of Allah yeah because she was short but she just did this this is action or not this is action the Prophet said that Islam you have said a word if it were to be mixed with the oceans it would have spoiled it only this gesture and how many times do we make gestures with our hands the scholars say that if someone was mentioned and you just did this with your hand this is RIBA if someone says used you know this daddy so and so he's a great scholar of Islam isn't this is RIBA by itself so it is not only your hands any act of transgression you do would count as not fulfilling your true Islam so you beat people you take their money you transgress against their property you maybe add to that harming them with your tongue the Prophet said that a his salat WA Salam it is part and a sign of your true Islam to mind your own business we do not mind where do you work sometimes I sit with people and they start interrogating me I'm waiting for my turn with the hospital and a man comes on up what do you do I work and so-and-so masha'Allah what's your salary well I seriously are you well paid so the ham dinner do you have housing car allowance overtime you married how many wives how many children boys and girls are they married he starts interrogating me i hate's around it is sign of your Islam to leave what is not concerning you to mind your own business otherwise you're not a real Muslim if you start asking about this and one of the great manifestation of this hadith is that the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam to his companions once do you know who is a limb off list do you know who is broke so they said o prophet evil lawyers who does not have ring gets no dollars said no the Mullis is the man who comes or a woman who comes on the day of judgment with prayer fasting and Sulaco sure is a good muslim but he had beaten that person shed his blood he had a back bit him he had cursed him he had done this and that on the day of judgment they the victims will come and they will take from his good deeds in accordance to his transgression if his good deeds ran out he will take from their sins and then he will be thrown in hell even though he used to pray fast and give charity and therefore when you look at this you understand that this is one of the signs of being a true Muslim and being a believer but the third part which is and the Mahajan Hedra what is his Europe Hilla immigration the Prophet made he juror from Makkah to Madinah so he has two meanings Hedra of location which is well known you're in a Catholic country you make Hitler you migrate to a Muslim country and there is Hedra of actions and this is what is meant here is the one who gives up all what Allah has forbidden so you abandoned sins and this type of Ezra is mandatory upon us all as for the Hitler of location this is dependent if you're able to practice your Islam freely then you're not obliged but if you are in a country that is a kafir country and you're unable to practice Islam you're forced to leave some parts of your Islam you can leave and migrate it becomes mandatory you must you don't have a choice but if you are unable you don't have financial means you don't have a country that will receive you then you have to fear Allah to the best of your ability and this type of Hegira that is abandoning your sins is this bound to time or is it continuous it is continuous till the day of judgement the Prophet said alayhi salat wa sallam hijra does not stop until the Sun rises from the West so this kind of hijra is continuous but there is a hadith where the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam lotta bad l-fatiha there is no Hedra after the conquest of Makkah and this relates only to Makkah so before the eighth year of hijra when the prophet Isum conquered Mecca it was mandatory upon every Muslim in Mecca to leave to Medina when the Prophet came with ten thousands of his men to conquer Mecca and open it then he said this hadith meaning the Muslims in Mecca now will not go to Medina because it's a Muslim country it's a Muslim city so you remain in Mecca as you wear okay chapter 4 is the first hadith and then this hadith relates totally with the one we had just gone through and the hadith in Arabic is all we are a soul Allah ie Islam of which Islam is the best of course they're not asking about Islam itself because Islam is what they're asking about the characteristics of Islam and instead of the Prophet Allison listening to them the characteristics of Islam he is diverting them to the person himself so there is a divergent and this diversion happens a lot in the Quran and in the Sunna when you ask something that is irrelevant for you the Prophet tells you what is relevant when it's more needed so when you ask which Islam is the best meaning which are the characteristics of Islam you could say being truthful being fair air being on time doing this rather the profit diverted them to what they need because the Prophet Azzam was often asked by people Oh prophet of Allah which Islam is the best which characteristics of Islam I should follow which are the best deeds of all and he gives different answers why because it depends on the person asking him so each person the Prophet gives him what is best for him if someone asks the Prophet isin about the best deeds and he knows that this person is stingy he prays night prayers he would not tell him tonight prayer he would tell him to give some baba while someone else asks him which deeds are the best and he knows that he gives sadaqa a lot but he doesn't pray on time he would say to pray on time and this is how you combine between the different many hadiths where the Prophet s son gives different answers because he gives it according to the situation each one has a separate situation to the other to the others okay um what are the beaks or what qualities of a some are good the topics of the why they were selling red light and light this hadith is just as I have mentioned to you what part of Islam is best so the Prophet says to feed the food and to read or to greet those who you know and those whom you do not know feeding the food is the very basics because what people essentially need is to eat and from there you go up so clothing them sheltering them providing them with education all of these are good things but the basics what I need at the moment not in the future what is my essential need now food I want to eat this is what makes me live if you promise me that you will take me to do my masters and PhD as it's like a lot here but now feed my mouth or I will die to tell ya but I'm giving you PhD in the bestial yeah not now I want to eat this is the basics that I need so it is LOM when Allah tells us about something that is basic it means that whatever you do afterwards you reward it for it and whatever Allah tells you not to do as sinful anything that is graver and more serious is also more Haram so Allah tells us in the Quran where a Kakuna human oh what a turn har Homa Oklahoma : carry me do not say to your parents and do not say bad words to them and say soft an honorable way of talking so one looks at this and says okay Allah says do not say oof but I can curse them I can beat them Allah didn't say that in the Quran do not beat them what do you say to that no this is logical Allah speaks to us in the very least so that you can know whatever goes up or goes now depending so feeding the food is the basics you can do this which means that charity in general is highly recommended in the deen of allah azza wajal part of the things that the good believers do and Allah praise them for that why or a moon of paramah Anna who behemoth Kenan way a teaming what a cor Allah says in the Quran and they give food inspite of love for it to the needy the orphan and the captive saying we feed you only for the countenance of Allah we wish not from your reward or gratitude so the concept of charity is part of Islam and it is part of the branches of Eman and you display this by giving to those who are in need the Prophet said RA his salat WA Salam keep a shield between you and Hellfire even by half a date not a full date even half a day this is the minimum so people in their homes making 1kg of dates splitting it into halves and going to the pours that have a date half a date what is this then I'm keeping a chilled from Hellfire okay this is the minimum not the maximum or the optimum what you're doing is wrong you should do more than that the Prophet said alayhi salatu wassalam who gives us the ideal way of spending who is our role model he said if I had Mount Hood of gold I would not like a third night to pass with anything of it remaining with me three nights a whole mountain of gold is spent in the cause of allah azza wajal with the exception of something i reserved for my debt so that i would not have any debts on me so this is part one which is to feed the poor and we can go on and on speak about the benefits of it the rewards at the side of Allah but you all know it is sha Allah however to greet those whom you know and those whom you do not know this is part of Islam the Prophet said alayhi salatu salam you will not enter jannah until you believe and you will not believe until you love one another shall I tell you about something if you do it you will love one another spread a salam spread the greetings of salam between one another
