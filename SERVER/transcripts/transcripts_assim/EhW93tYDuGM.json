  "transcript": "[Music] brother Hussein from Nigeria now he asked a question about the status of celebrating birthdays for his children his own birthday you wanted part of that it's a cultural problem really because when you do live especially in the West for example and it's creeping into the to the east as well birthdays are something uh if you don't celebrate it there's something wrong with you okay brother again we as Muslims are denied from following the cultures of non-muslims so let's look at the origin of celebrating birthdays if the companions of the Prophet wasallam celebrated it then it's okay for you to to celebrate but if they didn't and unfortunately this is the case then it's forbidden for us to imitate the non-muslims in carrying these celebrations into our own life Muslims have their identity we have our own personality we cannot imitate people you can pinpoint us anywhere in the world you can tell that this is a Muslim by the way he looks by the the clothes he's wearing not that he's a freak or he's he's you know a marchan from outer space no but because of his behavior because of his uh uh um dress code and because of the things that he does not allow to corrupt and pollute his own civilization and culture therefore birthdays are not acceptable in Islam and this is is the the the verdict of Scholars of Islam"
