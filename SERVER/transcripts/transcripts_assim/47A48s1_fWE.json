  "title": "Is it permissible to give Morphine to lessen pain of a dying person #Assim #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so my question is um in if in the Senor livings uh there is a thing that um when some of the old residents above to die they give them a medicine called uh Morphin so like what is basically does is that uh they believe that it reduces the uh their pain of death and it brings them a a very peace moment at the time of death so um if someone works as a uh Medtech care is it would it be per permissible for him to apply this medicine to the residence and would his income be for this Morphin is a form of anesthesia which is a painkiller and it is not permissible to give to a patient or a dying person unless it was prescribed by The Physician or by the doctor just the request of the family does not permit such pain relief um substance to be given if we know that this could also lead to hallucination and intoxication so this is to totally prohibited unless it is called for and instructed by the uh resident physici and Allah Knows Best"
