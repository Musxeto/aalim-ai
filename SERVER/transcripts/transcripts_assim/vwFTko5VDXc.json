  "transcript": "m alhamd and welcome to Mercy to the worlds s we talked about the battles the military Expeditions the detachments of the Prophet Alat wasam and one of the greatest battles of Islam was the Battle of Badr which was on the second year of Hijra in Ramadan now the posts the idol worshippers were on the offensive side one year after the battle of Bader it is the month of shaal the 10th month of the Islamic calendar and they came from Mecca with 3,000 men Warriors fully armed with 200 horse riders and knights and with 700 men in armor to attack and invade Medina the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam knew about this from Abbas he got his people ready they went all in an army of 1,000 men and only two horse riders compared to 200 and 100 men in armor compared to 700 so they were underpowered yet their hearts were full of Iman and belief and they were so eager to die in the cause of Allah that the numbers did not mean anything to them I heard that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was planning to fight in Medina so what happened well we came to discuss this previously and we said that the prophet Sall wasallam wanted to fight in Medina but the youngsters and the brave ones who were deprived from fighting in bad because they were not ready and they did not think that there were to be any battle in bad they wanted to go out and meet the enemy as this would be a sign of bravery and only gallon people would do this instead of waiting so the prophet Salli wasallam agreed to the majority and he went out the prophet Alat wasam went around the people of Mecca without them feeling so he was behind them when they turned around they were facing the mountain of uhud the valley and they were facing the muslim's Army and behind them to their back was Medina the prophet alhat wasam encouraged his people to fight and so did Abu sufyan he encouraged his people to show bravery and not to retreat by any means and he emphasized this point to the people who were carrying the flag and the Habit was that Banu are the ones to carry the flag and in the Battle of Badr the flag was with one of them who was executed by the prophet Alat but he let go of the flag and that's why the Army lost the battle and they ran in defeat so Abu sufyan went to B ABD and he in a sense provoked them by saying that listen b ABD Mana are ready to take the flag the cousins of B abdar so if you're not men enough to hold the flag just say so and we will do the arrest and they cursed him they said bad words to him and they told him that you will see what we will do on the battle field and they were right because 10 of them died protecting the flag the first to start the fighting was talb ABB ABD who was holding the flag he was known to be the ram of the Detachment he was so strong and fierce that people were afraid of him he's so brave and strong so he went holding the flag and asking for a duel any man Brave of you any man brave enough to come and fight me and the Muslims held back because he was very strong and brave and only a zuw in a matter of second he jumped in front of him and he looked at him in the eyes and he turned around quickly and rode his camel behind him and got him to the ground and slaughtered him so in matter of seconds the flag was on the ground and the bravest man among them was on the ground and five of his own Brothers came and held the flag because they were from ab and they wanted to defend the family uh uh uh tradition of holding the flag and the fives the five the other five were ABAB and Al or jalas they all came out held the flag and each one of them was killed four of their cousins but also from B abdar came and held the flag and all the whole 10 were killed by by by Talib by hamd mutb and and all of these were from they're all from Mecca and one man called he killed two of them that's all that happened before the battle started yes because it's in the very beginning the the the battle was revolving around the flag there were skirmishes here and there people were fighting not watching but the the the the essence of the battle was there may Allah be pleased with him aamit killed two of them and he was an excellent Archer and whenever he killed one he would say take it and I am the son of Al he's one of his ancestors so sh we can say that this is the tradition of the world at that time to fight each other before the the war started yes the duel was there it's always there that to show uh uh signs of bravery and it would add value to the a winning part so if your army your your soldier Your brave man wins The Duel this means that it's a good sign your army would do this so it it was tradition and just a side question sure um when he bragged about his lineage is that permissible to do in Islam it's not bragging he's saying that it's me who's doing it and by stating his name this is like a trademark so even Sal may Allah be pleased with him and and this might come on a later on uh uh story inshallah he also whenever he approached theend enemy or attack them he would say take it and I'm the son of and the prophet himself on the Battle of alab he used on the Battle of uh uhab or in another battle which was H yes not in in h he would call the people and say I am the prophet there's no lie about it I am the son of abdb so that they would know his name was Muhammad Abdullah yet his grandfather was Abdul mutalib so he's calling the people so it's form of it doesn't have anything to do with the lineage it's it only has to do with bravery and showing the people it's me I'm not doing it in hiding and that is why these two men the sons of Abu tal when they were just about to die each of them was dying he went to his mother who was on the battlefield her name was suafa and she used to ask or she asked her sons who did this to you and each one of them said I don't know I heard someone hitting me saying take it and I'm the son of and that is why she swore that she would drink wine in his skull and she put a bounty on his head she put a price on head and this will inah discuss when the time is appropriate for that going back to the the flag it fell after 10 of those who carried it died it fell on the ground and nobody dared to come and pick it up and the Muslims were doing wonders KH who was the leader of the Riders of the polyst tried three times to come from behind the Muslims through the left side of the army to attack them and penetrate them but the archers would always return him turn him on his back three times he tried and he could not do this the Army was a strong unit the Muslim army they were penetrating the uh uh polyst they were drawing them back and back there were so many acts of heroism for example abuan if you recall samak he's the one that the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam gave him the sword and he did not give it to nor to and they were all Brave Warriors of of Islam he didn't give it to them he instead gave it to Abu dujan so Zu who was the cousin of the Prophet Alat he did not like this so he thought that's strange I'm I'm a very strong Warrior why was I deprived from this so he said I'm going to follow abujan I'm going to see what he's about to do so he did and he followed him and he said I saw people flying left right and Center in front of him the guy just went zoom straight to the mushin's Army to the politist Army and there were 3,000 of them fully armed but his sword was sweeping left right and Center people were dying and in seconds in minutes he penetrated the whole Army and he reached the back of the army abujan says himself that in I didn't find myself except at the back of the of the army penetrating it on my own killing these people and I've seen someone doing bad things to the Muslims so I put him in my mind and I went straight to him and I raised my sword to kill him and then this person cried it was a woman it was H and she was attacking also with the polyst so I wanted to kill her but then I said no this is the sword of the Prophet Alat wasam I would not make it dirty with the blood of a woman and he held himself back I believe we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize God and enjoy his blessings in this life and his Mercy in this life and in the Hereafter as well Allah Alman each name has a meaning each name signifies a nature of Allah the Almighty which no one shares or is compared to Allah in it now the battle has been established and the fighting has begun acts of Bravery is Apparent from the muslim's side and also acts of Bravery wanted to be apparent from the politic side but it soon died when they saw that the people they're fighting were sincere and were determined that the word of Allah prevails before the battle took place as we said the defeat of one-third of the army made the polytheist stronger and the Muslims a bit weaker when the Hypocrites decided to abandon the battle led by abdah not only that Abu sufyan before the battle took place shouted and announced to the ansar that it's not you that we want it's not Medina we want our cousins so leave us alone and nothing will happen to you a Defector a traitor from Medina was Abu alib the Monk and he was or the Muslims changed his name into Al instead and he also tried his best to call his people to obey him as he was the leader of the people at the time us before uh uh Islam and when Islam came he lost all his powers and then nobody cared about him and they also did not answer him or give him any attention abuan made wonders and he did not kill H when he was able to do so though she was fighting the Muslims because it is against the ethics of Islam to kill women unless they are Fighters even in that case Abu dujan did not want to stain the Prophet's Sword sallallahu alaihi wasallam with the blood of a woman that he has the right to kill it yes she he had the right to kill her but who was behind him he saw the the sword like inches away from her skull and then he held it back and Zu says now I know why the prophet sallam gave the sword to abujan because if he had he given it to me I would have not held back I would have killed her definitely Zu as we know was one of the Brave bravest Companions of the Prophet alaih wasam it was reported that when he embraced Islam he was like 12 years 13 years old he was a child and the people of Mecca heard that the prophet was killed in Mecca and they were not all ordered to fight the minute he heard this he went out of his house with His Garment not fully dressed with a sword hung on his neck and everybody saw saw him were astonished what is this child doing with this big sword until he reached the prophet Sall wasallam and said alhamdulillah that you are alive and the prophet smiled and said zuir what were you going to do with the sword said that was going to chop off the head whoever attacked you or harmed you so zuw was one of the bravest soldiers of the Prophet Alat wasam and he fought in all his of of his battle bravely going back to the issue uh to the story of abuj some who hear his story might think well um he was trying to commit a form of suicide and that in Islam this would be something uh which is impermissible so what would you say well killing yourself is not permissible but charging to the enemy even if you're on your own this is permissible because they will kill you and you will infect some harm in them but it's not your own doing if you put a bomb in yourself and you detonate the bomb you've killed yourself they did not detonate uh start the bomb to go off but if you go and charge to the enemy and they manage to kill you you're a martyr you died at the cause of Allah by their hands this is similar to what Abu may Allah be pleased with him and if you recall he was the first one to host the prophet when he came to Medina Medina and he stayed at his house Abu Ansari when they were surrounding um I think it's called IST nowan they were surrounding costan one of the Muslims with the Romans their back to the for fortresses so their back uh uh backs are covered one of the Muslims charged in to fight with them on his own and the people said Subhan Allah Subhan Allah he's throwing himself to his death and Abu aari said no you've got it all wrong the verse inah Al Bak which talks about do not throw yourselves in destruction or Doom this was revealed on us the people of Medina because at the time of the Prophet Alat wasam after everything was settled alhamdulillah and Islam prevailed we said to ourselves what about if we stay on our Farms fix our lands and try to prosper as long as Islam has been established well alhamdulillah so Allah revealed this verse of the Quran that you have to spend at the side of Allah and do not throw yourselves into destruction in the sense if if you stay an abandon Jihad if you abandon the the the cause of Allah this would be throwing yourself into destruction so the scholars say if you charge to an army this is okay Sak or Abu was not killing himself on the contrary he was killing people and he lived after that to tell which means that whenever you ask for death in the cause of Allah when the cause is right when you are fighting a just War when you're not deceiving or lying and when you're fighting under the flag of an Imam not under the flag of uh a criminal it has to be an Imam where Muslims are gathered under which is called the IM muslimin the IM or the ruler then this is a just and fair cause to fight uh under going back to the battlefield Hamza ABD mutalib and he was the uncle of the prophet alhat wasam he was also a Fierce and strong Brave Warrior of Islam he W went also to the middle of the army killing people like ants with his sword with his spear with his shield unfortunately there was an assassin who had only one mission in that battle and that was to kill the uncle of the Prophet alhat this Assassin's name was he was a slave and his owner was ju's uncle died on the Battle of bad so he brought his Abyssinian slave wahi and told him listen you go with the Army to the Battle of and if you manage to kill the killer of my uncle who was Hamza then you are a free man I'll set you free so wahi was a slave he wasn't a Muslim the only thing that he could think of was his freedom he says about himself that he was an excellent uh uh uh warrior with the spear because the people of abisinia were extremely well trained in Spears and in fighting generally so he went and he just observed what's going on so he had only one mission to kill Hamza only he did not want to kill anyone else the only thing that he was after was his freedom so he anticipated he observed until he saw Hamza he's talking describing I saw Hamza and I just saw the wind of a storm coming and the leaves of trees just flying left and right he was just like a storm and people were falling like leaves of trees he said I hid behind a big rock and as he was charging to kill one of the polyst I saw a right spot and I was as he was going to hit the man I threw my Spear and it went through his stomach out of his back he tried to charge at me but he was too weak to do so and he died may Allah be pleased with him they tried to attribute um um the act of inciting to hind so is this authentic well no it's not authentic and actually the whole story of hind of course we know the father of hind was and he was also killed in the Battle of Badr and hind was husb with the wives of Abu sufyan she was the wife of Abu sufyan and the mother of muaah may Allah be pleased with them all because they all accepted Islam afterwards but the stories say that wahi was instructed by H to kill him and she gave him a certain reward if this story is true there is no cont contradiction because jubir was the owner and H was putting a bounty over the head as a as as as a incentive but the story itself is not true where it says that hint though it's very famous came and opened his uh guts and took her his liver and tried to sh it and she couldn't then spit it out this is not true though it's quite famous but it is not authentic as Scholars say now with the fall of Hamza the normal thing would be that the lines of the Muslims would would Shake but it didn't it was so strong and firm the Muslims were sad the Muslims were unhappy for what happened but s this is life this is what they have and this is what took place so many acts of Bravery was apparent in the Battle of uhud there was this companion who known as and his father was Abu the monk or where they Chang his name his father was the greatest enemy of Islam and this man H he was one of the greatest Companions of the Prophet Alam he also known as the one that was Washed by the companions it was his wedding night and he was sleep when he heard that the the the whole Army left to he left out of his house without even taking shower the bath the bath by the Angels you mean yes well at the moment he did not take a bath and a shower of his total bath he fought at the side of the prophet alham he was so brave he was this close of killing Abu sufyan the leader of of of of uh the Army and as he was doing this a man came from his uh uh back shadad Aswad and he killed him the prophet tells us that he was washed between the heavens and the Earth and that's why he's known as or the man who was Washed by the Angels I'm afraid that this is all the time we have for today's program until we meet next time h h h"
