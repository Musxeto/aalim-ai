  "transcript": "Alhan from India. Hello, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. My question is I have recently started a startup with my friend. I am the co-founder and he is the founder. So our startup basically deals with educating students on life lessons like economics, history and all these areas. So my friend is a non-Muslim and he insists on teaching stuff such as interest and all those things and also advertise with music. So I told him I want to disassociate myself with those aspects of this startup and just teach the students economics and programming and all these knowledgeable things. Would it be permissible for me to be a part of this? If you are a co-founder, this means you're liable to anything haram that takes place because you are a co-founder. You're not an employee. But if he's the founder and you take money for the things you teach, so you're not a founder, you're not a partner. Rather you're just an employee and you get paid for the halal material that you teach. In this case there is no problem in that and Allah knows best."
