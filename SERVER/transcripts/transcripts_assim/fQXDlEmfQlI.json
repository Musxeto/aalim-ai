  "transcript": "Imad from the US. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Assalamu Alaikum. So my question is basically what like constitutes like backbiting so is it like haram to like state like oh this and this such person like did that or like can I give like a general overview of what happens? Can people know who you're talking about? No. Okay. Backbiting as defined by the Prophet ï·º is to mention something that your brother hates people to know about in his absence. So if my brother is unknown to the people I'm talking about, talking about with. For example, I come and I see my brothers or my wife and my children and I say to them, oh today I met this arrogant driver, he did not want to do this and that, he crossed a red light and he caused an accident, he was an ignorant imbecile and when people tried to speak to them he started fighting with them physically. What an imbecile. Now all of them would curse him, would say bad things about him, would make dua against him, none of them know him. Is this backbiting? Nope. There's no problem in that at all. But backbiting is when I come home and I say listen your brother did this and that yesterday when we were invited to a wedding and I'm telling my wife your brother is dumb, he's stupid, he should not have done this. Now if he were to hear this he would be angry. This is backbiting. Although he's dumb with all due respect to my brother-in-law. But stating such a fact in his absence does not change anything because backbiting is stating a fact that would anger the person in his absence and Allah knows best. you you"
