  "transcript": "Abid from the UK Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum I have a question Some of my friends on social media like posts but it contains Kufr like I mean sometimes the guy might say the F word with Allah I guess and although my friends didn't like it for that purpose they like it for other purposes so do I like tell them not to like such stuff or do I just move on? No you have to remind them of Allah Azza Wa Jal and explain to them the gravity of liking such posts that include Kufr or mocking the religion or praising anything that Allah Azza Wa Jal hates because this is part of our duty as Muslims Now I would highly recommend that you yourself unfollow these posts or these folks or these websites that post such filthy and inappropriate things to begin with just to set a role model for others and Allah knows best www.mooji.org"
