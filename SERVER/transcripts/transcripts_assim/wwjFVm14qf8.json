  "transcript": "Mu'in from Kashmir Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum I want to know really on a particular matter I sometimes suffer from frequent nosebleeds Sometimes even a slightest touch causes it Often while performing Wudu The bleeding starts midway or shortly after finishing In such cases do I need to repeat Wudu every time it happens Even if it occurs repeatedly Or deal still some blood Little blood from the nose coming First of all I pray to Allah that He cures your illness And make you have a fast recovery Second of all The issue of bleeding The majority of scholars say that this Invalidates the Wudu And also the majority of scholars say that Blood is Najis And the most authentic opinion According to the Quran and to the Sunnah Is that bleeding Does not invalidate your Wudu And the blood that comes out Is pure from a human body Unless it comes from the private parts And this is backed up by many Evidences Alhamdulillah So if you have a nosebleed You can continue with your Wudu as normal And it does not impact the validity of it You don't have to repeat it at all"
