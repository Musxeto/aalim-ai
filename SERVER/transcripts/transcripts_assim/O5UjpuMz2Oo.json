  "transcript": "Brother Hamza from Bosnia. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh may Allah forgive you and your family. Ameen and you as well. Barakallah Fika. Ameen Wa Fikum Barakallah. Sheikh my question is we know that graves should not be higher than a hand span. In my country when people dig a grave, place the deceased inside, and then refill the grave with soil, the grave becomes very tall. People use shovels to bring back the soil to the grave and a few people take turns doing this until all of the soil is put back. So Sheikh my question is am I allowed to be one of those persons who bury the deceased using a shovel knowing that at the end of this process the grave is going to be extremely tall? This is not logical because whatever is dug out of the grave, whether by your own bare hands or with a shovel or whatever, this amount of soil when put aside and then you bury the Muslim in the grave and you block it and you put the soil back again, the height it would be in relevance to the body that occupied that amount of size. Therefore, it won't be that high. It would be maybe this high which is acceptable and normal and without any problem in participating in doing that, inshaAllah."
