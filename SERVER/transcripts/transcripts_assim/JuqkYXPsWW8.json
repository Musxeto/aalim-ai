  "transcript": "brother abdullah is asking about the ruling on donating organs and we've gone through this so many times so it's one of two either your donating it before you die while you're alive or after your death as for before you die if these organs are replaceable or do not tender your life and your activities and going on doing your business such as if you have an extra kidney and you would like to donate it to a father a mother a spouse a son etc and it would not harm your life afterwards you can live a normal life without it then this is permissible if it's something that is hazardous to your life like donating one of your eyes this is totally prohibited donating part of your liver as they say that the liver grows later on this is totally prohibit permissible donating your blood and that is capable of regenerating again this is totally legit now if you go to donating your organs after death before the break we spoke about respecting the privacy of the deceased and the Prophet said a little some the breaking of the bone of a deceased is like breaking the bone of a living person so it is totally prohibited to donate any of your organs after death first of all this is not your body to donate or to write a will to cremate me for example can I can I do this I'd like to ask my heirs to cremate me and throw my ashes over the ocean no likewise I cannot donate my body parts like people do you know the kearney are the eyes and the kidneys liver the heart the joints etc this is not a spar spare parts shop so this is not permissible one would argue and say okay but if we don't do this other people would would die so eventually they're going to die if not today maybe a couple of years later on but they're going to die this does not justify violating the Muslims corpse by donating parts of it"
