  "transcript": "a brother says what should we do if we are alone in an elevator and a person of the opposite gender comes in this happens a lot when you are in a office building or in a hotel or in a residential building you happen to be going from the 20th floor to the ground floor and you're alone in the elevator it stops in the 15th floor and in comes a woman if you're a man or a man if you're a woman so now before the doors closed you think quickly should I leave should I stay it's only like a minute until the ground floor and most likely chiffon would prevail or confuse you the doors are closed and lift the elevator goes down now let's analyze what is sinful in what you're doing it's only a one minute share true but the prophet alayhi salaatu sana said no man is in seclusion with a woman except the third one with them is Satan himself so is this a recommendation or a prohibition definitely a prohibition so are you doing something sinful at the moment or not the answer is without any doubt yes but what harm would there be regardless maybe there is no harm and maybe 99.99 percent nothing would happen yet you failed in complying with the instruction of the Prophet that is awesome and you hence sinful not only that imagine if and this is possible the lift gets broken or bad or dysfunctional or it doesn't work it stops for one reason or the other you call the maintenance people you call the emergency button and they say ok we will look into it and you're stuck there for an hour or two people say mmm that's good that's nice no it's not nice it's sinful imagine your wife is in the same position would you allow this to happen imagine your sister to be in the same position would you think that this is okay so this is prohibited what to do shake simple once it stops in the fifteenth floor or whatever floor and a woman comes in you leave it simple you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure this out then what share then call the elevator so that you take the next one but this is a waste of time it's better to waste your time rather than to waste your good deeds and Allah knows best"
