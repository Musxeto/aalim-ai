  "transcript": "Ahmad from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Wa Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, if any masjid there is a set prayer time for any prayer, and let's say we're busy during that time, but we still attend the masjid and, you know, make a jama'at, but not at that set prayer time, let's say we miss it or we do it early, is that fine or reasonable for that? Now, in the masjid, let's say it's dhuhr, and they say that prayer time is at one. And it starts at twelve-thirty, and you want to pray it at twelve-fifteen, my understanding is correct? No, no, the time is still valid, so let's say like twelve-forty-five, but it's not with like the jama'at that they set. So you want to pray after the jama'at, another jama'at? Yeah, not intentionally, but like let's say something comes up, like it's once or there's something during that time that I can't make like the jama'at that they have. No problem, you can pray afterwards insha'Allah. This is not something that is usual, it's a necessity, and alhamdulillah, Allah Azza wa Jal did not make things difficult for us. If there comes a reason, I'm at a doctor's appointment, or doing something for the car, and I miss the jama'at, I can pray it, providing that the time of the prayer has not expired. Because you have to pray it before the time expires, otherwise that would be sinful from your part."
