  "transcript": "tarek sent a question saying what is an ijazah each other in Arabic can mean a holiday but I don't think he is referring to that in technical terms et Ossa is a sort of an authorization or a permission that earlier scholars used to grant and give to their students who were highly decorated as a form of appreciation that now you are entitled you're authorized to what I have taught you to go and relay that on my behalf so a share an imam comes and says o people this student of mine let's assume his name is Ahmed Ahmed is authorized by me I have given him the permission the ajasa to read all the books of mine on my behalf he has heard the sahih al-bukhari from me so I met now can't say I heard my share awesome saying that he heard his sheikh abdulla heard his Sheikh Muhammad so until a mammal Buhari Mohammed even smile and he heard from him what I'm gonna narrate to you of the books of Sahel bhai so this is quite an honor to have if it were legit and real why do you say that because in the early times it was legit and real a smart student comes to his Sheikh sticks with him for 10 years hears from him all the books of hadith or if he is a reciter of the Quran 1/2 of the Quran he hears from him the Quran he decides to his Sheikh the Quran the share corrects him whether it is by the rewire of halves an awesome or by the 10 rewired or kala at and he has a chain of narrators so now the Sheikh is confident that his student is mastering his own knowledge so he gives him this each aza so the student goes and says I have memorized the Quran and people say what's your Senate what is the chain of narrators he said I've memorized it from my Shaykh so-and-so who memorized it from his Sheikh and he memorizes the people the name of the people until he reaches abdullah al masud and i'm the lamas who heard it from the Prophet Isis er this is legit later on it became as a form of prestige so a student comes stays with me for three months or six months and he serves me well and I like him and I feel that he's a good person so I say I authorize you to narrate on my behalf everything that I've written down in my library and the student may have not written read one percent but now he has a written statement giving him authorization so he goes and brags about it and says yes my sheikh said so and so and so and people asked him did you hear that from your share yourself said no but I found it in one of the books and he gave me the authorization to report it as if I heard it from him but the chef may have changed his mind may have written something else so this is not legit and this is not the real ageism however again it doesn't mean when you have any Jazza that you are a master in what you do why the person is a student of knowledge he has heard Sahih al-bukhari directly from his share and he has the chain of narrators the Senate says yes but so many people who memorize I had Bihari by heart yet they do not have the intellect to understand it and the Prophet said Alisal sallam said that when he said convey from me whatever you hear to others so you hear a hadith conveyed to others you hear an ayah you report it to others because maybe the here the one who listens to you might be more understanding to it than the bearer the one who conveyed it to you and so many times people come and say yeah the Prophet says so and so and so but I don't know what it means and a fattie a scholar comes said yes this hadith entails so and so and so and so and so and the guy is huh with Jose down I never thought all of this was in the hadith but you've opened my eyes likewise a number of people who decide the Quran perfectly I've heard some of them mashallah from Indonesia from India from Pakistan cannot even speak one single word in Arabic and do not understand a single word of what they're memorizing but when they recited to an atom and the Arab says yes this ayah means so-and-so and Allah is prohibiting so-and-so from us and this is Wow this is great so again each other doesn't mean a lot but it is definitely one way of acquiring knowledge and Allah knows best"
