  "title": "OCD with the a Gap in the Wudu, does it break my wudu if I took 40 seconds to think? assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from the UK. So I'm about to ask you a question I asked you twice earlier. Why do you waste the time? Why would you waste the time asking it twice? Either I did not give you the right answer or you did not understand. Or you have an OCD. Choose. I keep on leaving information from it. Okay. Let's hear it for the third and last time hopefully. So I was making wudu and I had to pass wind and I was about to wash my left foot and I quickly tried to wash my left foot and then I did the, I suppressed the wind and I took about like 40 seconds and then after that I thought about what to do and that thinking took more time because I didn't know if I covered the whole feet and I didn't even bother to check it because I said to myself everything is wet by now and how will I know it's from the water that I poured on it or it's the water from the sink. So after thinking I decided to wash my foot again fully and then I went and prayed so is my wudu valid? So is there any missed information? Um, no. And if I say to you yes your wudu is valid, will you call me next week and say oh but I forgot to tell you it wasn't 40 seconds it was like 49 seconds? Um, no. Okay then your prayer is valid. Full stop. Let's close this chapter and move to the following prayer inshallah. Okay? Okay, sure."
