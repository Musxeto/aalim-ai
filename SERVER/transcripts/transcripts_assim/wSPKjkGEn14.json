  "transcript": "Che I had a question regarding the acting industry so what the situation is I'm a a British South Asia Muslim from the UK I'm 22 years of age um I'm a very creative individual like um I I have a passion for creative writing and Performing I acknowledge that anything Haram anything that takes you away from Allah subhana wa tala you you should stay away from but my question is is it permissible for me to study acting or or study performing or creative writing uh if it brings someone closer towards Islam if it it raises awareness of issues such as domestic violence such as uh slavery such as um where is Majid maid not Maj sorry Naser where's Naser yeah so you want to write something about uh domestic violence slavery and what else uh studying performance you know acting okay okay let's let's be Crystal Clear when you study performance and acting in the west this usually involves dancing ballet uh improvising um sketches acting singing music all of this is Haram if you tell me that I am in an academy that teaches Halal things so they teach me how to act how to direct and there's no free mixing no women no music I would say yeah no problem you can act maybe write a play that talks about violence that talks about domestic abuse that talks about Injustice Haram things in Islam how to rectify it and fix the society without having women without having music which is very very unlikely to happen in the west but hypothetically assuming that you can do this and manage this and the content is good this is totally Halal but realistically speaking to study such science quote unquote in the west involves 95% of Haram and there's nothing that justifies this and I hope this answers your question"
