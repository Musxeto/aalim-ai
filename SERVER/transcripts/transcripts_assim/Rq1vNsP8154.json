  "transcript": "ways from the uk um she's a question regarding uh for the car so my parents have passed away and um i just want you to know because so if i want if i donate um some sadaka on behalf of my self then i heard there's an opinion um where uh when if i don't 800 pounds for example then i should make the intention not only for myself i should make the intention that this donation is also for my parents for my siblings for my neighbors the entire ummah in that way if i for example donate hundred pounds then everybody uh who in the whole ummah would be will get the equal amount of reward and i will get more obviously because i am the person who gave the charity um so obviously if that is the case then obviously that makes sense because you know i rather have everybody sharing the same reward as myself but i just wanted to find out what is uh the you know the stronger opinion or if even if that is an opinion that we should i should be considering um it will give every single time i give donation okay no this is not an opinion you should consider akhi because when you donate something let's say you're giving in charity a hundred quid so a hundred pounds is registered for you if you say oh okay i'd like to share this 100 quid with my wife this would mean that 50 pounds would go for her and 50 pounds would register to you if you include your parents then it would be 25 25 20 and the more you share the lesser you get so the issue of yeah donate 100 pounds and the entire muslim ummah in it and everybody gets a hundred pound worth of and you get also the reward of donating on others this is not valid at all and allah knows best you"
