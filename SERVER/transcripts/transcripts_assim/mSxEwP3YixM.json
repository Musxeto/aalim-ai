  "title": "Husband doesn't mind Non Mahrams coming in the house...| Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "a sister says in my house without the permission of my husband none muharram males get into private chambers what should I do if advising my husband is not working the sister is quite ambiguous if she's referring to her own bedroom and probably she is referring to in-laws creeping into her bedrooms without the knowledge or the permission of her husband but he's failing to make a stand he's failing to tell them not to do this this is problematic because your has your husband has to man up this is not something that men usually accept and shrug their shoulders and move on no one should enter your bedroom without your permission and especially if none mahomes enter and they may see something you or your wife would not like others to see this is your private chambers but if you're referring to you being out of the home and your husband is inside the home and he admits his brother his cousin and he's sitting in the bedroom and there's nothing wrong in the bedroom that you may be ashamed of nothing hanging or dangling in this case there's nothing wrong in that insha'allah but you may communicate with your husband and tell him that if you want to sit with these non muharram men I'd feel much more comfortable for you to sit with them elsewhere other than my own bedroom but this is something that you have to work out through communication"
