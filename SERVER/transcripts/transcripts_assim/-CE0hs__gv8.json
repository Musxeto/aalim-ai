  "title": "If a person's income is haram & he does shirk, will his repentance not be accepted? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh sheikh we know that the of a person whose income is wrong is not accepted so if the person who earns income commits shift and repents will his repentance not be accepted no don't mix oranges with apples these are two different things it's very wrong to cascade rules in islam and put them together as if it is mathematics because your understanding of these rules is wrong simple and and straightforward so it's like oh sheikh allah azzawajal has prohibited men from wearing gold and we know that gold is haram for men because it breaks the hearts of the poor so can we say that it is haram to wear a diamond ring for men what does this have to do with that allah prohibited gold that's it you cannot cascade this from your own winds and desires where did allah say that wearing gold breaks the hearts of the poor nowhere but this is your understanding which is totally wrong so not accepting the dua of someone's whose income is haram has nothing to do with him accepting islam after committing an act of shirk or repenting to allah it has nothing to do with his salat his fasting it has nothing to do with other things unless they're related to it so don't mix apples with origins allah knows best you"
