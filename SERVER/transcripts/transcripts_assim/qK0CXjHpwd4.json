  "transcript": "Maleeha says here in Pakistan we're taught to offer to nephal with each prayer except for Russell for Asia prayers people usually offer for nephal there is voluntary prayers what is the ruling of Islam as most people consider them as much obligatory as for prayers well first of all I have to raise my hat if I had one on my head this I cannot race but I raise my hat to the people of India Bangladesh and Pakistan for upbringing their children to abide by the voluntary prayers I am always mesmerised always shocked when I see 13 or 14 year old kids offering so many raucous before and after the prayer and they observe it religiously not just something that it's a habit they believe that it's a whole thing but my only problem is that not all of it is authentic though I appreciate how they brought up their children to appreciate salat and to observe it like that yet I would whisper in their ears to follow the Sunnah and not to confuse fault with nephal meaning the 17 raka we pray it a Tricia if you miss two Rakas then the whole Asia is invalid as so many people write to me and this is totally baseless Aisha is four Rakas if you live and die praying only for records of Asia nothing else before it or after it insha Allah you will be in paradise what level this is up to Allah soldier but no one can come and say to sooni's after Asia is mandatory no it's not the man who came to the Prophet ali salah salem and he told him tell me about the religion of Allah and the Prophet told him about the prayers sallallahu alayhi wa sallam and he said that there are five prayers that Allah had obligated upon you and the man said anything else the Prophet said listen no unless she would like to add extra meaning voluntary prayers so the man said by the one who sent you I will not add a single thing to what you have just said so he committed himself to praying only the 5 part 2 of fetcher 4 of the harasser and Asia and 3 of Muharram the Prophet said whoever wants to see a man of the residents of Jannah let him look at this man and in a narration of llaha la vie en Sabah that he has prospered if he commits to what he had said so this means that thinking that voluntary prayers are mandatory is totally out of the question now having said that we know that there are 12 records according to a hadith of Habiba may Allah be pleased with her analyst during the day and night to be prayed with the for prayers and these are highly recommended Sunnah mu Okada it's known as a relative to before fetcher for before lower - after the whole - after Maghrib and - after Asia 12 Rekha's if you'd like to add a little bit more you can add two rakahs in addition to the two records after the whole so you pray for before it and for after it and if you add a little bit more you can pray for records before or after the event before the Akama of a sir you can pray to two records these are for that is it what about the four records before Asia this is baseless the rock as before between mockery Benicia the four raka of Allah beam baseless all the hadith are not authentic so if you want to add more this is up to you but to say you have to pray 2 rakats here or two rakahs there and it's a must or it's a sunnah without evidence from the the sunnah of the prophet elisha latinum you and i how can we invent such things it's impossible this is what scholars categorize as innovation bidder so either follow the Sunnah of the Prophet a sir or don't add anything to what is mandated upon you so I hope this answers your question"
