  "title": "Must Zakat on gold (or cash, stocks etc) be paid every year or only once in a lifetime Assimalhakeem",
  "transcript": "zacker says what's the ruling on giving the cat of gold is it once in a lifetime or is it for every year for the same gold there is no dispute among scholars of islam that zakat is to be paid annually providing that there is the threshold or more that is the nisab of gold or more in your possession no one among the scholars to my knowledge had ever said it is to be paid once in a lifetime this is not hajj to be performed once in a lifetime so whether it's gold whether it's cash whether it is stocks whether it's an investment whether it is livestock whether it is crops that you farm all of these must be given zakat continuously throughout your life and i think that there is uh um someone in india who they claim to be a scholar but he's not definitely who is confusing the muslims by saying that you pay zakat once a year once in a lifetime and this is not true and this person is not known among the scholars to be a scholar and unfortunately with social media now any tom dick or harry can come and claim that he is a scholar or knowledgeable and we don't have any proof to back that up from real scholars of islam and even if he was a real scholar what he is saying goes against all what the scholars of islam say that is the cat is due once every year on your gold until you die you"
