  "transcript": "[Music] what is the best answer to someone who asks why do Muslims fast is it just to feed but to feel how the poor and miskeen means the needy feel without food is there a deeper meaning behind it see Muslims actions stem from the Quran and the Sunnah it does not come from logic because people's logic differ what you see logical I may see illogical so it is not appropriate it is not acceptable for each and every one of us to shoot from the hip and come up with a new religion with new beliefs or with something that we justify and believe it is the right thing to do then why do Muslims fast Muslims fast Muslims pray Muslims feed the poor Muslims are kind to their parents Muslim connect to their kinship Muslims do all these things as part of their religion because they worship allah azzawajal who says in the quran wama halakha tal Jinnah will insa illa liya Buddha I have not created the jinn and the human beings except to worship Me so whatever we do it has to be it has to fall under the category of worshipping allah azzawajal if we were to fulfill the purpose of our creation so why do we fast and so simple it's a form of worship Allah tells us to fast we fast and the thing is that people out of their good will they would come up with justifications now some of them are valid yet we do not have the guts to confirm that this is why allah azza wajal obligated us to fast so if we accept them as an idea as a thought but we do not relate it to islam and the notion the idea of justifying things in islam is good and bad it's good because it increases my Eman it increases my belief so when allah tells me don't eat pork i refrain from eating pork but these pork chops look delicious yet i believe when a doctor comes and tells me listen pork chops have the following illnesses heart disease high blood pressure it has a special worm that infests your intestines and bla bla bla then i believe and i'm convinced so this is good it adds value however it has a bad side to it see not everything in islam allah comes and tells us this is the reason this is the wisdom this is the justification otherwise I would be speaking to one of my peers pray why should I pray because I told you so everything you tell me I do I would have been done I'm a Muslim part of my Islam is to submit my will Allah tells me to throw myself from the window I throw myself from the window I'm a Muslim Allah doesn't do this but if Allah were to do this I would say Samir in our Aparna we here an adhere and we obey so the bad side of this is that Shaitaan opens the doors for you to go astray by justification so he tells you why do we pray you say because you have to have your heart energized and five times a day you're connected to Allah good answer why do we fast because we have to feel like the impoverished people the poor people the those who are in need so we can give from our money and wealth to contribute to them and at the same time to see the blessings of Allah upon us and at the same time because this is that good justification why do we give zakat we have to give 2.5 percent of our savings so that the whole community would feel at ease and we won't have any big differences of layers between the rich and the poor and no enmity no excellent answer so he keeps on opening this door by door why is it prohibited to consume intoxicants it wastes your mind it makes you do things that you regret good then he opens something that you cannot find the justification for and this would cause you either to doubt Islam or to maybe reject it all together so he says why is gold Haram for men to where you say because it's expensive and it it breaks the hearts of the poor you say but diamonds are halal for men and they are ten times more expensive than gold did this this doesn't make sense here you say hmm it doesn't make sense and this means that you've opened the Pandora Box upon yourself and you're close to going in to help someone comes to you and say tell me about Islam usually pray with associate what do you mean by pray sorry pray five times a day a day wash we go to church only once a week how do you pray so we perform rouble ablution we wash our limbs five times a day multiplied by three times every wash said you wash your feet fifteen times a day yes I'm a proud Muslim I wash my feet 15 times a day minimum said I wash my face only once in the morning your feet are more clean than my face what a beautiful religion you have yes and I'm proud of my religion I'm a Muslim he says if you don't have water what do you do say I just put my hands on the soil and I dust my face and hands excuse me why would you do that your religion is a religion of cleanliness you were washing your limbs 15 times a day if you don't have water the normal thing to do is just not to do anything why soil your face with dust then you start to say hmm I never thought of that doesn't make sense let me reschedule I ought to be done where is your submission see this is how Shaitaan works so to make a long story short this is not our topic but it is important for me for you to set your compass it is important to put the coordinates in your Google search or Google map or Google whatever so that you know where you will end which is destination Jenna and sha Allah you will hear that sound saying you have reached your destination but if you start to logic things why do women cover and men don't we have handsome men that make the heads of women turn they should cover a stuff for Allah or to Willie now you're questioning Allah religion you're questioning Allah you have a problem so coming back to the question why do Muslim fast simple a lot older so fast now are there any other benefits of course health benefits I'm diabetic and all doctors even non-muslims say if you fast this reduces your diabetes drastically and helps cure it those who fast help their heart problems they help their weight by reducing their obesity they save money they feel how the poor feel so they have this empathy towards them and they would like to help them whatever they can so it also gives you power over yourself and why is that when I fast from halal things from drinking water from eating apples which is halal how would I be when it comes to Haram definitely I would be much more empowered because if allah azzawajal cured my addiction to what he made halal would I be any close being addicted to Haram such as watching porn listening to music fornicating consuming intoxicants engaging in idle talk backbiting gossiping slandering etc definitely not so there are so many benefits of fasting but again this is something that we shoot from the hip is it mentioned in the Quran and the Sunnah no it doesn't have to be mentioned but we believe that Allah ordered us to fast and this is why we fast allah azza wajal mentioned the ayah of fasting in surat al-baqara chapter number 2 Allah Allah says o you who believe decreed upon you is fasting as it was decreed upon those before you that you may become righteous that you may become righteous in arabic is la allakum Teta kun so you might reach the level of taqwa so what is taqwa because if you recite the Quran you will find it filled with this expression taqwa Fattah el muta pain la Ilah homeotic hoon all of this comes from the word taqwa so what what is taqwa this is a terminology that is stemmed from protection with ayah so even if you go down the road you'll find that there are shops that would sell you films that provide you with with hiya with protection from the infrareds from the ultraviolets from the sun rays from the heat so taqwa is protection in the hadith of the Prophet and that all of you know by heart it upon our voila bishop by Tamra it took on our leave a visor leave a barrier leave a protection between you and Hellfire even with half a date meaning that if I take the half a date I would not put it in my face as a shield and enter hell out of Allah it means that if you give in charity this half a date even is so negligible it will become as a barrier between you and Hellfire so it tapenade the Prophet is telling us is also not to keep a protection a barrier between us and Hellfire so when allah orders us to fast and tells us that this will help you elevate to the level of taqwa so that you would be fit the description of Al Motta pean this is a very high level and this was mentioned in other hadith when the Prophet said la sala fusa he said a solo jhana and in another hadith he said a so much one night 1 min and now journa is a protection and he's telling us that fasting is a protection is a barrier between you and hellfire so now this adds up now fasting saves us from Hellfire not only that there are 8 gates to paradise each one has a name so this one is for salat this one is for jihad this one is for those who fast and it's called a right yawn so whenever you hear someone's son named Brian or Rayanne you understand that this is the name of the gate of Jannah that only those who fast enter from it so fasting elevates your and boosts your Eman and even Rajab says that taqwa is to leave whatever drives you to Hellfire from committing sins or from abandoning forms of worship that you are obligated to do so you're actually to fit the description of top WA you are staying away from Haram and you're doing everything that Allah has mandated upon you imam IBN taymiyah may allah have mercy on his soul says the description of tako allah fearing allah this collects under it everything that allah has ordered us to do whether it is mandatory or highly recommended and also everything that Allah had prohibited us from doing whether totally Haram or not recommended and this includes a large rites and it also includes the rights of the humans among them selves Rahman Abdul Aziz who they say is the fifth caliph used to say that taqwa is not fasting all day long and praying all night long and fooling around in between no this is not taqwa taqwa is to abandon what Allah Azza WA JAL had prohibited and to do what Allah Azza WA JAL has obligated upon you so so whomever has been given such a blessing and a favour then after that he is from goodness to goodness until he reaches the day of judgment so this is the true concept of taqwa scholars say prey in the last row of the Masjid but do not commit sin is much better than praying in the first row while you slander people back by them you harm them you do sins from all types and categories so again taqwa is to keep something between you and Hellfire and this is done by avoiding sense and by doing what Allah has mandated upon you [Applause] you"
