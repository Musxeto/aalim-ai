  "transcript": "so um I live in a non-muslim country and they gave me um time off for their holidays such as Christmas uh Thanksgiving Etc so my question is is it permissible to have Gatherings just to like take just to like take advantage of this time like on the holiday and like the time they give me off without the intention of celebrating no problem as long as your Gathering has nothing to do with their holidays so it's the only time that all of you guys our relatives are off so you gather and and and just have a good time there's no problem but when you have uh gravies and uh turkeys and the likes then you have a problem because this is not a gathering rather it's celebrating their holidays according to the disbelievers and this is totally prohibited"
