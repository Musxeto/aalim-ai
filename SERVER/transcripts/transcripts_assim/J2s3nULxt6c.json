  "title": "CLARIFICATION: Is saying to Allah “I will not do a certain thing” an Oath that I must Expiate?",
  "transcript": "from muhammad and muhammad says i watched your video on offering kaphara if you go back to a sin after telling allah you won't go back to it whenever we repent isn't it a condition that we make a commitment when making the tawbah to allah that we won't go back to the sin but sometimes we may end up doing that sin again and after watching your video i got the impression that we have to offer kaffara also kindly clarify muhammad for asking this question yes i did answer few weeks ago maybe four or five weeks ago a question saying that if a person while repenting says verbally o allah i have for example quitted smoking and it's sinful and i will never go to smoking again i answered by saying that saying this verbally is a commitment and it takes the same ruling as promising allah azzawajal taking a pledge making a covenant having a vow so if you go back on it because you verbally said it you have to expiate by feeding or clothing 10 people and then i got many questions asking me to clarify a little bit more similar to what muhammad said and to tell you the truth i'm not infallible so in the continuous effort to reassess and check the previous answers seeing so many people asking it triggered something in my mind saying that okay you gave your statement maybe you were wrong so i rechecked the answer again and i even called one of the major uh scholars of uh saudi arabia who is in the main in the permanent not permit the grand committee for major scholars and i asked him about this question specifically and he explained to me that i was wrong in my answer and hence here i am uh um refuting myself and telling you that my answer my previous answer was wrong if you simply talk to allah by saying oh allah i'm sinful i'm ashamed of myself i will never do this particular sin again and you fall into doing this sin this is not a pledge this is not a covenant this is not an oath you took upon yourself so there is no expiation for that when does the expiation become mandatory one when you say i swear by allah two when you take a covenant meaning that o allah i take a covenant with you i pledge not to do this thing using the words that indicate that this is an oath or a vow or a covenant or when you make it a conditional repentance oh allah i will never do this again and if i ever do this again then i will do so and so and so so this is conditional again this is binding you have to expiate other than that when you're just feeling remorseful and talking to allah azzawajal whether you said that verbally or is in your head there is no expiation for that and may allah forgive us all you"
