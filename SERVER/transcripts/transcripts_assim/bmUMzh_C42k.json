  "title": "Leaving the wife for more then 4 months",
  "transcript": "I've got a question here uh from a brother he says am I allowed to leave my wife for over a 4month period now he says if I keep in touch regularly by phone and the internet is this allowed he said he's heard something in Islam says that four months is the limit actually in in it there was nothing told or instructed to us by the prophet Sall wasallam regarding this issue so the prophet had never set a limit to the period of time a man can or is allowed to be away from his wife Omar may Allah be pleased with him the second khif in some narrations had put four months or six months as the maximum and the scholars say this depends on the need of both sides so if there is an urge and strong need from one of the spouses to the other and there is the fear of falling into sin because of this absence then he they have to be together what is the period it depends on their agreement so if they agree and they can't tolerate being away from each other for a year this is acceptable"
