  "transcript": "well fed with no flood all are the laws of a love a way of life of life away of life away of knife Islam he is away of al hamdu die hamden kathi lanti bono Barack invivo sallallahu wasallam ala nabina muhammad brothers and sisters in islam welcome to a new episode and a continuation of the hardest topic thus far marriage and not only marriage specifically the qualities you look for in a spouse specifically does the outer appearance have anything to do with the internal a relationship with Allah we were actually going at it particular level but then the time had run out so we will pick up where we left off and you had something to say I interrupted you so go ahead sir well I think because we're discussing the qualities that we're looking for in a woman we all know we look for the one who is religious but where we were discussing what does it mean religious really but I have done a share house and we all agree certainly I do that she's going to make khattab on son that's what she's always ready to go back to this I found this the most useful thing in my own personal life between me and my wife the fact that we're always ready to go back to the book on the soda we have a disagreement we're ready to go it's a fantastic attribute to have but I want to throw a question in into the mix so as to speak this is a student of knowledge said to me he said I don't want my wife to be a die at the f I don't want her to be a die I don't want to be sitting all night discussing fatwah and every time I do something she's going to say this is Haram and this is the delisle and this I want my wife to cook for me to clean for me to look after my house yeah should be religious Mary yeah yes he's married and I don't not his wife with her she fits this criterion but she certainly not known to be amongst the female students of knowledge and what do you have to say about this show she let him handle of sorts of sandals will on your idols I'll tell you that first of all I believe that this brother a student of knowledge is looking for a second wife so he's looking for any justification this is his first wife this was his criterion before he got married second of all this is a problematic because on one side we have Robert improbability pleased with him saying that I would love a scholar and a wise man to leave his brains out side his house when he goes to his wife and be like a child with her meaning playing and jubilant and having fun leave his scholarly manners so his wife says should I serve food he says inshallah light is permissible boy who are sure about some of the practicing brother to play football together you're playing soccer come on okay pass them Oh jazak allahu iron and he was running behind his opponent you can feel a lot give me the ball what what is this is it normal everything has to be Ashley's hell am I yet this is not the wave but unfortunately some of the brothers and we will get into this later on hopefully in this inert in this life nothing another life some of the brothers justify you know they tried to justify whatever they're doing so he has the best wife and she masha'Allah is a good cook and she takes care of him and of the children he wants he can't find a reason to marry another one except to find faults in his first wife this is what I don't know if this was the brothers criterion when he was looking for a wife this is I knew him from before from therefore he was getting married and he said after him I mean you know maybe this is simply because his experience of sisters who are involved in Dawa my wife is involved in that would handle that yes she's not like that yanny she does not say is this permissible or not no you should not do this this is not married you're talking about unless the idea it's the same sex probably marriage this will happen but and probably men just oversimplify and they just like it's just one block like this or one block like that and son it's just the male wave probably such women don't exist this is for a woman to be like a scholar at this level that everything with her is like you know baby the brother i'm speaking about the brothers I don't know what he came across a lady like that but the woman like that actually poor so scholarly in their behavior with their women argue more I think the point is very someone here's the point if you marry someone who is very committed to dower and seeking knowledge in spreading knowledge she's not going to be in your home looking after you and your family she's going to be out teaching and giving circles of knowledge and teaching the sisters and you come home and there's no one there because Marshall luscious the point needs to be clarified she can't be a diet okay but she has to to sort out a day and imbalance it okay it's not that for instance mashallah some of the system that they are very knowledgeable they are scholars you can call them and to just to look happy behind doors okay a waste okay but you can sit down and organize and this is the problem the problem some of our sisters really may Allah guide all of them they are not really expert when it comes in the terms of the marital life and they some of them they tend to neglect which is this we are going to address inshallah later on so maybe the brother had a bad experience or he heard this but a real haria sisters educated knows Islam she knows how to sort a day and how to organize herself and how to fulfill her commitment towards our children towards her husband so he can organize herself can I say something just in support of I know there's lots of sisters listening to this and it's not just us sisters with a job where scholars who are watching this and everybody needs to get married and and nowadays women are being asked to be everything right there with their jobs in the Dow uh they're being asked asked to volunteer they're asked to be the perfect wife the perfect mother the put now she has to home school and there's all these pressures coming down on her and then now she a woman's trying to get married and we're dealing with men who sometimes are so simplistic and if i can say little dumb when they when they're just like oh it's got to be like this is the one quality I want or what not I'm just I just had to say that no you can't you can't say that easily at the end of the day a woman is addressed by the horns and to do something so again we do not customized Islam to their needs we customize our lives men and women to what Islam requires so if she says that my job is a priority you tell her a lot so Joe tells you sit in your home if you cannot balance class says that in the Quran microrna pea boutique on it's in black and white so she goes out and she works then that's this is an eye isn't it no this is this is this is an issue yeah but I'm having a kind of dressage on yeah which is uh what kind of women okay because no actually I know it's it's a heated discussion but now a woman saying that if I work outside of the home does that not make me religious if she is capable of balancing between her job and her husband but if she's unable what comes first either now to gain the dollar I lose Muhammad and fatima or take care of Muhammad and Fatima whose mom Anna ok so that's it in black and white but if we can for instance and we know that the the burden financial burden of life and she is helping her husband and she is working in a decent environment that is different if you Islam is not against that Islam is always about the idol the in solve the Ballon how the problems takes place when imbalance take place shakes and that's the problem normally marital problems happens here and at the end of the day who's the blood gainer the woman share so many people living in different parts of the world they find by absolute necessity sometimes both the man and the woman have to work it it's a survival it's it's how you survive financially yes but I think I mean I think people work these things out I mean hopefully we have this may be a very monochrome viewpoint of how things are but in reality you know life is quite complex than I i think the brothers and sisters hamdullah work these things out i mean you know okay i want to go back to the river what a mans looking for man's looking for looks and i know we're being all nice and it's like it sounds good Oh Mary this one where but it the end of the day the man's just looking for by the way it's not a problem to look for looks right the Prophet said look look at what pleases you maybe the problem is though because if a woman is wearing hijab and she's dressed modestly the other woman is propping herself up with high heels with makeup and she's if they were in a lineup the woman who's dressed immodestly is stepping out and she's gathering attention so we actually have a problem here that the brother is getting mixed signals the sisters not putting on makeup she's dressed properly yet she's the better wife and the one that's out in the open who's not necessarily you know the best wife for this person she looks better sure but so what I'm no no so what I'm saying is that I think we need to give some guidelines reminders for the brothers that just that outward beauty needs some guidelines to that you shouldn't just look for that outward beauty i thought the hadees yeah no no I'm fine doctor that what the hobby says they should not be deceived that sister where's the jab is as beautiful as the one but she doesn't outwardly show it of course you doesn't display happy here we'll have to take a break but based on what on what the brother said this will be what we'll be dealing in shoulder width after the break and regards to the issue I don't know you receive emails you receive emails from what I've personally experienced because of the Islamic awakening it seems that more brothers are looking for practicing sisters then beautiful sisters nowadays the new thing is that I want a sister that fears a lot and maybe you can elaborate on on this inshallah after the break if you have shared this experience so a stay tuned we'll be right back inshallah Salam aliko away away nice salam alikum welcome back so before the break I had asked the question based on my humble experience yes there are many looking for looks but yes there are many many more now who just want a good wife that he can have a peace of mind with Shirley beauty is a preference is as a bonus but do you really think nowadays from your experience this is still the ultimate criterion beauty or religious commitment what have you experienced in your emails your contact with people you're mixing with people well I believe that it is not the only but it's a added value people put it on their priority list but definitely if you say well I FEI i met this gorilla and she is extremely righteous and practicing we said we'll all due respect so yes it is important for them to be practicing and forthcoming to towards that one and abiding with a piranha but there is something acceptable so there is nothing wrong in that but this is not the only thing that makes a good wife there are show me other things as une chambre he indicated that you might find someone who is abiding by what looks to be the quran and sunnah on the surface the way she deals with others yes tactically what what should those criteria be well for exam let's say look for this look for that I I personally aside from what externally looks like a practice person I believe that a woman has to be if I'm going to marry one if I were to marry one she has to be a person who is content and satisfied see I get a lot of tons of what does that mean I'm gonna get you that I get tons of emails from brothers saying that you no matter what I do my wife is never content and one of the reasons for women to be admitted to hell is being on content and ungrateful in the hadith authentic hadith we were told the Prophet tells us how some that Ibraheem please be upon him visited his son is married when they were in Mecca and he had not seen his son for a long time because both of them were messengers and they they do as they're told so he went into the house and he met his daughter lo who who did not know him so she hosted him as a guest an old man in his like hundred years of age and he asked her how are things he asked about his son and she told him that he's out working so he asked her how are things with you and she started complaining we have little water we have no food we don't go out it doesn't take me to dinner it's this is from my pocket huh not from daddy's but this is what she was complaining similarly about and Abraham was listening and then what did he say he she said that give him salon from this old man and tell him to change his doorstep doorman he left it's my eighth game peace be upon him said who was he and she described the manager and she told him what he instructed her to say to him and he said this was my father and he was instructing me to divorce you go and you are divorced Ibrahim came years later when his mail got married again in the same scenario took place but this time his second wife started praising Allah and saying everything is having a good we were always full will never hungry hamdillah she is praising Allah as ocean Ibrahim gave her the same advice but he told her to say to her husband to read him the Salam and tell him to keep his doorstep and when his mail came he told her that this was my father and he was telling me to keep you because you're a Good Wife so the issue of content not every one of us is capable of being financially fit not all of us can give a car to his wife or a driver or a big mansion or pocket money or to do this or take her places send his flower but not every one of us is able able to do this so a righteous wife is the one who's tolerant who is patient who knows the condition of her husband and she is always contented yeah i mean i remember advice friend of mine gave me before I married when I first converted to Islam he gave me a piece of advice about the sort of woman you should marry he said after him don't marry a woman who loves the dunya if you are married a woman who loves the world you'll be a slave all you will do is work work to buy her this and buy her that and he said marry someone who is not by someone marry someone who is sleeping in her stuff oh yeah that's it that's a beginning of the first time with a session yeah but no I mean he said marry someone who is exactly how you described she easily content she's happy with little whether you have it whether you don't have it is very tribes I've seen some brothers and misery I'll write iria that I advise brothers I say that you know when you get married you know the focus is over beauty and and you know you want some religion stuff like that when you have a child and you have a child there's no doubt that you will love your child more than you love your wife and the same goes for the women there's no doubt that the mother loves the child more than she loves her husband how come no no okay okay have to justify children here we all have children here love my wife more now leave my children okay there are different levels of love I'm too scared man I have to declare their wives are watching there are actually different levels of love okay there is love which is as you know it is a bad actor for she bluffing Allah loving the messenger this is this type of love is a bada there is love okay which is a must it is obligatory okay loving the Dean loving whatever a las Mount Olympos it is obligatory to love it even if you don't practice it even if you don't do it for example his sister she should love the hey guard even if she's not wearing it you should not hate it in her heart Su Su when she sees a sister wedding cake obviously much a lot about akala inshaa allah one day i will wear it so she will get has a nap so this type of love is obligatory there's a type of love which is haram and loving the harem and the natural love so there is love which is in a instant there's something built within so loving your wife is natural loving the children is not yet but here there is advice for the sisters which is really many brothers are complaining that the moment they start having children the husband is neglected a different type of love him because he's busy with thee with the children no here you need to also strike the balance I'm curious though how can one I reached a point where he he knows that okay I love this child more than my wife or my I mean how does one really reach the point where they can kill it will understand it if I finish the poetry are just I'm bursting to please finish the point this is what I meant okay so forget maybe I exaggerated when I said about you know loves this more than that but no doubt you love your child and you love the best guidance for your child you want your child to go to Jenna this is gonna be one of you know one of your top goals in your life this your child to go to Jenna you're the wife is going to become the teacher of this child no doubt in those beginning years so um and and the child is going to become a mirror reflection of that bad mother so what I tell people as I said when you have a child you're gonna love your child so much and in you know some cases more than your wife and your wife is going to be the one influencing the child so ask yourself when you go and search out a wife to get married this brings us back to the whole point here is what qualities do you want your child to have and go and find that in the mother so when you make your list of all I want a wife it's beautiful all of this like know what do you want your child to have as well somebody might say on my child to pray five times a day I want them to learn Arabic I want them to do this I want them to have good character and then you say now let me go find a teacher for this for my child to be and then this is even I would say that you making the intention it's a beautiful way to go that was the meaning of that idiot brother done i think i saw that what the prophets allah said let men because the word of the Prophet salah salem that a Dean is so comprehensive and this is one of the medicals of the prof salah salem it would say a small few words very concise but they covered the whole thing sir k so the sister that you marry is the sister that feels a loss of Hanuman ouattara obeys allah subhan allah ta'ala sister who will help you and facilitate the way for you to read the gonna save herself and save her family chef Hamid's point is correct because there's a hadith I just remembered that highlights importance of the wife over the children so this is a very important thing to have the Prophet said tell the size of the best of the righteous women are the women of courage the best of women to ride camels at the women of courage they are the kindest to the children and the most obedient and loving to the husbands so it is a very important point not only that she's knowledgeable that she is mashallah praying night prayer this is good but how is she with the youngsters if I propose to sister and I know I got this call couple of days ago here and a sister is crying on the phone you're with me in the car i believe and she's saying i cannot love my child i have one child I don't want I don't want any children I hate children she's crying she said I told her how many children do you have she said I have an eight month old girl and I I told you love her she said no I said some challah think again said uh yeah but I don't like children and she broke down this is Shaitaan what you look for is some a girl a woman that is known to be affectionate you have mercy on the children because this is the one who's going to take care of your capital in this life which is your children now where people are different and they have problems from but the thing is that a young man was advised 'king me advice and saying you know I want to marry this girl and you know she's nice and she's a good girl and she likes it slam and so I asked him is one question is this the woman you want to be the mother of your children this is what I said to him do you want is she going to be a good mother to your children this is the question I have to ask you and I think this is a very very important criteria to think about that what she going to be in how she is away from the perspective that's I started off with saying that how she would love his child because if you just ask is this the mother you want for your children he's not coming from the like he doesn't care really hasn't thought about how much he wants guidance for his children and that's why i put it from the child's perspective well our time is running out in fact our time ran out but it seems that there's a lot more to say in regards to the qualities which one should look for in a spouse and so we promised our audience inshallah hotela with a las facilitation and permission we will dedicate the next episode strictly for that zakuman Lochhead for tuning in Salaam alaikum warahmatullahi barakat we have life away of life the way of life away of life Islam is a way of life a complete way do you know what Islam says it says that life the greatest test it says their life sbarros space we turned up on rent just a way of life away of life away of life away of life islami"
