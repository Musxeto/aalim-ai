  "transcript": "the second question is my little sister has problems when she makes her roof she has West Was and she keeps on making o do two three times Parris nada and she prays again and again and we've tried reciting the Quran for her and taking her to miss chips to help her but it's been a very long time almost three years now and it's getting worse and worse by the day oh I was when we could help her okay I will answer in inshallah hi your second question Hayate says that her sister has an OCD obsessive compulsive disorder in Woodill and in praying and she repeats the prayer over and over again probably spends like an hour in the bathroom making woudl then making another one a third and a fourth this type of OCD is quite common among the Muslims and the reason is that Shaitaan is trying his level best to divert them from the straight path so you are a good Muslim you pray on time this doesn't go down well the throat of Shaitaan so what he comes up with he analyzes your personality if you are a person who is really easygoing careless neglectful then he will tell you to delay a prayer and pray it with the second one or combine all prayers at the end of the day if you wash half of your arm and you leave the other half he comes to you and say it's okay move on Allah is for most forgiving and slowly he will make you abandon salat if he finds after analyzing your personality and your character that you have strong Eman and you're careful in performing things according to the Sunnah and you're keen on taking religion with strength and power he makes you exaggerate things he makes you go overboard so washing your limbs three times nah this is for layman making them five it's best washing them seven times is best I finished washing my body now maybe you missed something just to be safe rather than sorry do it over again tell you what why not perform o soul instead of Oodle this is even purer and he keeps on doing this until he messes totally up with your mind you pray and just before the Salam he says maybe you forgot a seizure maybe you mispronounced the Fatiha tell you what let's do it all over again and he keeps on doing this until you reach the breaking point and you are in despair you give up and you don't pray anymore all of this is the handiwork of Shaitaan this is the blueprint of Shaitaan and I see this every single day I need so many people with such OCD an obsession about everything and I can see how Shaitaan is missing up big-time with their minds may allah azza gel cure them all so sure in a nutshell what you do well the first thing is you have to communicate see if a person is not convinced from inside that there is something wrong and that it needs help then you cannot help those people see a lot of the people have BP d which is borderline personality disorder and one of the characteristics of this disorder is that people don't think or believe that they're doing wrong or saying things that are wrong if people are like this how can you cure them you need to have counseling sessions a number of them to convince to logic and to bring them down to reality then we they will understand so Hyatt I believe you need to put your sir down speak to her in a number of sessions telling her who is having a good time who's laughing his head off when you make wudu more than once when you spend in will do more than four or five minutes the only one who's laughing and having a good time is Shaitaan so whenever someone comes and tells you or your prayer is not valid you might have missed something ask yourself is this an angel inspiring me in telling me to repeat the prayer because the angel loves me or is this Shaitaan messing up with my mind and the answer would be definitely Shaitaan is missing with you up with your mind big time and you have to avoid that analyze version knows best"
