  "transcript": "uh najiba says my friend is always asking why muslim men marry four wives are females uh weak are men superior uh than women why women can't marry four men at a time how can i answer her please answer me first of all it seems that your friend is not a muslim and because muslims simply don't ask such questions otherwise they might as well doubt the existence of allah they might as well doubt why was the prophet muhammad islam the messenger why wasn't it abu bakr or umar what kind of question is this muslims don't ask such questions they have submission they have belief and conviction non-muslims on the other hand may ask and this is their right you can't sell the sell them something without them being convinced with it however the problem is not in selling the problem is not in the details the problem is in the fundamentals this religion was given to those who believe in it so those who do not believe in it may find a lot of questions islam tells us this is not the way to answer the questions so why is it men are not allowed to wear gold while women are why is it that music is haram why is it that women must cover while handsome men don't cover why is it that women can't travel without a mahram and women inherit half of what men inherit why is it that a man is obliged and supposed to provide for his wife and to give her shelter and food and clothes even if she's a multi-billionaire this is his obligation why would i have to do this these questions can be answered through logic some of it can't be answered through logic because this is an instruction of the one who created us so we have to comply and follow even if you don't see the legitimacy or the wisdom behind it but islam tells us no no no you're not allowed to you're not supposed to answer these questions then what to do go back to the fundamentals these are all trivial issues small issues let's go to the core of the problem with all people of the book jews and christians come to a common term between us and you that we do not worship other than allah and we do not associate others with him so the first thing to do is to call such a friend najib to islam by talking to her does allah exist or not usually christians would say of course he's the creator he's this is that so many things in common then we come to the quran do you believe in the final and divine scriptures no no we have our bible we have our new testament so what do you follow kings james version or the douay virgin for the catholic or the standard revised version or what kind of version you i see a lot of bibles and they're different from one another in the quran we have one virgin 15 centuries ago the same quran did not change a single letter spoken by more than 400 million arabs who know how to read and understand what's in it and it's preserved nothing's changed so you call her to islam at least to reach a level where she says yes i believe this i believe this i believe this then afterwards things would come out naturally but hypothetically speaking this might take a lot of time to answer her questions she says why can muslim men marry for and not women marrying four men well this was the norm since allah created adam and eve that men can marry more than one woman if a man marries three women and they conceive we know who the mother is she's the pregnant one and we know who the father is he's the husband but if a woman marries three men and she conceives we know who the mother is but who can tell which one is the father this is not possible therefore this is how allah made men and women men die faster than women and this is why we always have this sort of imbalance between the number of females versus males and this is why it is easier and more logical for a man to get married to two or three in order to compensate the losses of men on earth either due to wars accidents to high blood pressure to heart attacks to diabetes which proves the point that women usually are better assassins than men they kill men much easier and we can see the results and as far as the superiority of men over women this is something that muslims believe in worldly matters not in religious matters so at the side of allah at the sight of allah they're equal men and women but on earth men are superior than women in so many fields and men women can be superior to men in other fields but in generally speaking yes men are more superior and allah knows best and this"
