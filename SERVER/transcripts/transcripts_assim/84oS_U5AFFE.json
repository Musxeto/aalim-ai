  "transcript": "sh my question is um the prophet Sall alaih wasallam said sh is the most Grievous sin before Allah but some Scholars say that kufur like not believing in Allah is wor so how to reconcile these statements all of this all of this is philosophical sh and kufur are the same so sh kufur and major sh kufur and they're all in Hell Fire and this prevents a person from entering Paradise therefore if a person believes that there is no God existing he's mus at the same time so he doesn't believe in God existing so how could he associate others with Allah because he's associating his own whims and desires and worshiping it as Allah mentioned those who takes take their whims and desires Gods beside Allah so this is sh and everyone who is a mush is a cfir disbelieving in Allah Asel since they're almost the same in conclusion"
