  "transcript": "hamza from the from bosnia uh sheikh we have a problem of unruly kids at the mosque and it's especially bad during the week children run around disturbing the worshipers and the neighbors the mosque gets frequent complaints from the neighbors and it's embarrassing for the muslim community when parents are asked to discipline the children they say they don't want the children to grow up hate in the mosque is this a valid excuse to allow them to allow them to use the mosque as their personal playground and what is the balanced approach to controlling children at the mosque some of whom are actually old enough to be praying first of all the prophet sallam ordered us to instruct children to pray when they're seven which means that below the age of seven they're not instructed to come to the masjid let alone forced to do that secondly if the harm of bringing children beyond the age of seven is far greater than the benefit they should be prevented if the harm from the children above the age of seven is far greater we have to discipline the children it's not an excuse for us to keep them home and say well they're naughty and they're hyper no we have to discipline the children to force them to behave when they are in the masjid what the parents some of the parents do they bring their children they engage in tarawih and they let the children play in the masjid and use it as a playground and you hear them shouting and screaming and crying and tossing things around while we are engaged in the prayer and the moment that imam says assalamu alaikum they don't do anything the moment he goes allahu akbar they start their ordeal no this is totally prohibited you get your child you put him next to you so you can control him and you can discipline him you can monitor in him and to claim that we don't want to make a negative impact upon the children this is not a valid reason if your children when you're visiting a friend's house or relatives misbehave or break a vase you're not going to say oh we don't want to uh reprimand them so that they aren't negatively impacted no you will reprimand them the house of allah is more worthy of being respected but we have to balance some people don't even want the child to say what is this he's a child so you can expect things of him but not to the extent of hanging on chandeliers and jumping from one pillar to the other like tarzan this is not the appropriate way of doing it and allah knows best you"
