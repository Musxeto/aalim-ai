  "title": "Broke Oath to Stop Watching Porn, Expiated By Fasting 3 days, How to Stop Porn? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "We have brother Shaaban from South Africa. I've been having a problem for four years. You've been what? I made an oath. Okay. I've been having a problem inside me for four years. I made an oath to Allah to stop the sin for a year, but in the middle of that I went to the sin. But I didn't know that it was a sin of the faith. So I continued with the sin and then I started facing depression. I didn't know that I was the sin of the faith, so I came to know that it was a kathara. So I fasted for three days, but then my situation didn't change. I think that's a punishment from Allah, but I didn't know what to do to change my situation. I've tried for four years to change my situation, but I know it's that breaking of the oath that got me into this situation. I don't know how to fix it. Are we talking about pornography or masturbation? Pornography. The first one, sir. Okay. Okay. First of all, brother, when you break an oath, there is an expiation that you have to give. This is mentioned in the Qur'an, which is one of the three you choose. Free a slave or feed or clothe ten poor people. Three choices. Either one you choose is okay. Freeing a slave is not applicable nowadays because you don't have slaves. The other two are fine. If you are unable financially to either feed or clothe ten poor Muslims, in this case, you may resort to fasting three days. Jumping to three days before when you're able to feed or clothe ten Muslim poor ones is not accepted. So the three days you fasted, these are voluntary days, would not count as an expiation for breaking an oath. Secondly, those who are doomed and tested with either watching pornography or masturbation or the likes of such heinous sins, these are their tests from Allah. And we are on this earth only to be tested. There isn't a soul on earth who's not tested. Even the richest of the richest is being tested. And the poorest of the poor is being tested. Now some may pass the test and end up in paradise. Some may fail and end up in hell. It is you who decide. There is no magical pill that would help you. No one can justify his sin by saying, I can't do anything about it. If we tell you, go to the highest building, to a high-riser, and jump, you say, you're crazy. Why would I? I would say, don't you feel compelled to jump? Don't you feel that you want to just jump and say, I believe I can fly? Of course not. You're crazy. I don't want to die. Very good. So why are you doing this sin? Oh, Sheikh, I can't help myself. No, you can. You did not jump. You can also stop watching. Now how to do this? This depends on the measures you take. You want to pass the exams and get higher grades? What are you going to do? I'm going to study hard, Sheikh. I'm going to isolate myself from my hobbies and my habits and my family to study really hard. And in the end, I would get the trophy, high, glamorous grades. Likewise, when you want to stop the sin that you are indulged in, you have to, first of all, do the preparation needed, such as blocking all means. So where do you watch this filth? Oh, on my smartphone, on my PDA, on my computer. Eliminate. What do you mean? Your smartphone that's making you stupid, substitute it with a normal Nokia, the Symbian operating system that has no internet, that has no videos that you can play. Only to text and to take and make calls. The PDA and the laptop or the computer in the house, eliminate all of this. And if you live with your family, buy a big screen with a PC where your back is not to the wall and the screen is to you, rather it's the opposite. The back of the screen is to the wall and your back is to the family, to the living room, so that everyone in the room can see, anyone passing by can see what you're watching. And you can have restriction not to watch it unless there is someone in the room not to have access to such porn. Imagine if your young sister or brother were to fall into these sites and watch them because of you. Imagine if your children do this. Imagine if Allah punishes you by cascading this to your own family. And the sad thing is, if I were in the same room with you, would you dare to watch it? No, Sheikh, you're intimidating. I'm scared from you. Never, never attempt to do this. Brother, Allah is watching you 24 hours, 7 days a week. Allah is listening to everything you're listening to. You don't have any shame? You don't have any fear after all what Allah has given you? So you have to do this as stage one. And then you have to fill your time with beneficial things. How many Juz' of the Quran do you memorize? How many Hadiths do you know? What's your knowledge in Islam? You have to start filling your time with beneficial things. Thirdly, you have to surround yourself with practicing righteous Muslims 24 hours, 7 days a week. If you check your contact list, you will find that maybe you have a handful of them, but you don't hang out with them. You prefer sitting home alone watching this filth. Or you have a lot of non-Muslims or non-practicing people who keep on putting fuel to the fire and share with you some of this haram filth. So whenever there's a will, there is always a way. But again, nobody's going to give you a magical pill. It's all in your hands. You make oath, you make promises, you do this, you do that. Nothing is going to help you unless you put it in your mind and ask Allah for guidance and really take serious steps and measures to stop this filth. And Allah knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? So go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days. And bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
