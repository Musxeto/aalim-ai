  "transcript": "Imam Mu'in. He says, whoever leaves three Friday prayers without an excuse is written as a hypocrite. Is this authentic? Please explain. The answer is, no, this is not an authentic hadith to my knowledge. The hadith says whoever leaves three Fridays, and in another narration, three consecutive Fridays in a row, in another narration, without a legitimate reason, then Allah would seal his heart. And sealing the heart means that the heart would become negligent, would become hard, would not react when reminded of the Hereafter, would not feel soft when reminded of Allah Azza Wa Jal, would not react positively when listening to the Qur'an, or not get emotional or crying when remembering one's own sins and shortcomings and flaws. This is what is meant by the heart would be sealed. Not that he's a kafir or a hypocrite, but he's on the way of being a hypocrite unfortunately, because this is step one. But as he is, he's still a Muslim. May Allah protect us."
