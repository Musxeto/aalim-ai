  "transcript": "how are you today alhamdulillah okay sh so uh we are a family of three I and my mom are three Gods but my father is a non-muslim so when I told my father that Muslims cannot inherit anything from non-muslims he said that after his death all his property belongs to me and my mother and we can use his property so he authorized us so is this statement of my father sufficient for me and my mother to inherit from him or we need to write this on a piece of paper according to my country law which is a c country I and my mom are only hires to his property legally so no one can uh legally claim anything from this property so we two are the only HS so do we need to bring male or female Witnesses or uh write this on a piece of blank paper in front of them or his saying is sufficient what actually is the process first of all the prophet saidat that a cafer does not inherit a Muslim and the Muslim cannot inherit a cafir and by this Hadith we understand that you cannot inherit your father if he is a non-muslim however Scholars say that if the non-muslim gives away as a will from his wealth the Muslims can accept this will being as a gift but providing it does not exceed onethird of his wealth so if he has $300,000 you and and your mom may share a 100,000 which is 1/3 this is what Islam allows you to do not as inheritance because you do not share the same religion rather as a will and a gift what about the remaining 200,000 the remaining 200,000 if the laws of the of the country state that you take them because you are the only heirs you may take them and dispose of them in means of Muslim uh uh charity poor uh or needy Muslims or to give it in dawa uh supporting for Islam or building a Masjid Etc in order to cleanse your wealth from it so that it would not go to this cfir government and Allah Knows Best"
