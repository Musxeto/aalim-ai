  "transcript": "ash says mom has high blood pressure we're trying to sell the land for over three years but each time they scare the customers away or say it's theirs if anyone fights back they get police to arrest the good people then they have to pay expensive bail each time though we're poor can you talk about this so the volume the transgressor can take heat and stop first of all I don't seriously believe that such individuals would spend their time watching an Islamic program like ours no one with this amount of transgression knowing that whatever they consume in this world from Haram wealth they will consume the exact amount if not more in hellfire from the stones of hell so I don't think a Muslim does this and if he does he would not be definitely watching my program it is one of the major sins in Islam to take the wealth of someone's else it is a major sin to change the parameters of the land the Prophet said that is salatu salam and allahumma Nehalem an aural art may Allah curse those who change the borders and the parameters of the land so that they would gain a couple of yards or a couple of meters more by changing it at night so what is the ruling of someone who wants to take the whole land first of all you have to make du'a sir Edom news 8 no I'm Rob no no fail may Allah be pleased with him and he was one of the ten heaven bound he's the narrator of the hadith Abubakar in general Marin generous man engine etc he's the last one sir idioms 8 the brother-in-law of Omar and his cousin he may Allah be pleased with him was called by the judge he's a companion a woman by the name of our WA claimed that he took a piece of land of hers and combined it to his land and when they complained to him he said a star for Allah how could this be when I am the one who narrated the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam whoever takes unlawfully one span fold of a hand from a land that is not his he will come with it as a necklace round his neck on the day of judgment so imagine the land if it's like an acre or two and you carry that around your neck on the day of judgment he says how could I do this as she falsely claims when I'm the one who narrated this hadith but I make you my witness that the whole land is hers she's claiming falsely that I took it I give her the whole land yet if she is lying may allah azza wajal make her death in her land so dua is accepted upon those who transgress against us the story goes to say that one day she said who turned the lights off in the middle of the day and they told her the Sun is up no there are no lights in the home she became blind and that night she went out to answer the call of nature due to her blindness she fell in the well next to her house and drowned and died so you can easily make duaa against these transgressors and Allah will not leave them alone you never know where the punishment of Allah will come from whether it can be a heart attack high blood pressure diabetes an illness with your most beloved child a crippling paralysis that attacks you something in your eyes something in your intellect or a calamity that takes all of your wealth in keeping you begging people you never know when"
