  "title": "Beginning and End Time of Dhuhr  (zuhr) & Hanafi Timing conflict? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Singapore So last month I had a trip to \nAustralia, and they're having winter now   my question is regarding the time of the prayer \nwe know that Zhuhr starts after the sun passes the   zenith, and it goes towards the west when we start \nto see a shadow but over there when it's midday or   slightly past midday the shadow is more than one \nbody length by then, and we know that according to   how the ruling is that once the shadow \npasses one body length this time is Asr   so how do we explain this because I actually \nchecked the timing on an app and as well as   the sunrise and sunset times which was at 7:00 \nam and 5 pm approximately which means midday   is about 12:00. But in this case, the shadow \nand the timing doesn't seem to line up so is   it something just for countries near the Middle \nEast or near the equator or how does it work?\n \n  According to the majority of schools of thought   in accordance to the hadith where Jibreel peace \nbe upon him taught the Prophet ﷺ the timings   of each prayer he said that in the \nfirst day the moment there was zawal.   Zawal is when an erect object is here, the sun \nrises, of course, the shade would be too long   of this erect object, as the sun rises it \ngoes to midday this object usually has no   shade the moment the sun goes to the west, there \nis a slight shade to the east this is the time   when the begins, the moment there is this slight \nshade to the east and the second-day Jibreel led   the prayer just before the length of the shade \nwas equal to the length of the erect object. This is the conclusion of Zhuhr's time and \nthe beginning of Asr time. What most likely   happened is that when you went to down \nunder, and you prayed there they were   following the Hanafi school of thought which \ntheir timing is wrong according to the hadith. I respect their school of thought but \ndefinitely I respect the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ   more and the three other schools of thought can't \nalso be wrong when they are following the Sunnah   and only the school of thought of Abu Hanifa \nis right in this issue, whenever there is a   dispute what should we do go to the Quran and to \nthe Sunnah to resolve it the Sunnah resolves it   by telling us that they're wrong so most \nlikely you were praying in a Hanafi Masjid   and the calculation of the apps was \naccording to the Hanafi school of thought."
