  "title": "Is there any sunnah prayer before Friday prayer?",
  "transcript": "and the answer is no there is no Sunnah prayer before Friday prayer the Sunnah for Friday is only after the jum is concluded and it is either to pray four raas in the Masid this is one choice or if you don't pray in the Masjid you go back home and you pray only two raat this is the way of the Prophet but he also told us that do not pray these four RA in the Masjid until you speak to someone or you get out you leave so so there is no prayer after jum until you speak with someone give him Salam so that people would know that you have broken your prayer with Salam and with talking"
