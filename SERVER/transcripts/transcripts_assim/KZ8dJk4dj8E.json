  "transcript": "Dayan from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi. So my question is, when I do sujood, is it okay to just touch the ground slightly with the tip of my nose, or do I have to press every part of my nose to the ground firmly for my sujood to be valid? The sujood is placing the forehead and the nose on the ground. The sunnah is to firmly do this, because this is the way you express your submissiveness and follow the sunnah of the Prophet ï·º. This is the way he used to do it. But if a person touches his forehead and nose to the ground slightly, we would say that he's doing sujood, but he's not doing the full, highly recommended and rewarded sujood as he's supposed to do, and Allah knows best."
