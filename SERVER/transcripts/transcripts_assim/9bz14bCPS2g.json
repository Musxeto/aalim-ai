  "transcript": "part of beauty and silent beauty service is permanent but providing it is following them Islamic culture is not a culture of the Crafar and unfortunately the issue of piercing has been so widely spread that can you end up having voice kissing their ears and putting a piece of diamond and the funniest thing I've seen people pushing their tongues and then what were the person piece is done and this is so stupid they are cultured so how do you lock on the blessing and the vapor of Islam well I would I see people that are any doing weird things I pray to Allah and thanking that I'm not an animal because these acts are hands so you have to look at the intention of such piercing of the nose if it's part of the Islamic culture in your country there is no problem gunshot"
