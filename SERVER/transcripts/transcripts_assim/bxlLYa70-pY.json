  "transcript": "Marcin says is it permissible to praise the Hara for others people in Pakistan go to professional alumns who pray SD Hara for them and tell them the result in a day or two esta Hara is something where you yourself seek Allah as guidance over something you want to do you cannot praise the Hara on behalf of others as you cannot enter the Masjid for example with a friend of yours and then tell him listen you pray to Iraq as the hatin message for yourself and then pray 2 rakaats the hatin message on my behalf for me I'm just gonna sit down immediately this is not applicable because such a bad that such forms of worship can only be done by the individual himself he cannot deputize others to pray soon that will fetcher on his behalf or ask someone to pray with her tonight because I don't feel like praying or would you fast next week in Ramadan for me this is all not possible not permissible as for the alumns who do this and make money out of it that's why some are very rich because they fool people imagine if I would charge a dime for every time someone asked me for a stay Hara so share my what my daughter is getting married next week can you press the heart for me sure thing how much this is Haram this is consuming people's money unlawfully and this is why these and have correctly described as professional items they like professional wrestlers professional lawyers and professional people who embezzle others no this is not right you can charge money for teaching people the Quran this is Holland as the Prophet said decide sir you can charge money for selling someone's property and get a commission over that this is Holland but to make Rukia too fast missed days of Ramadan on behalf of others this is not permissible and it's an innovation and a la social knows best"
