  "transcript": "foreign is involved in everything we do in all aspects of life and among the things we do every single day is when we wear clothes so when we wear a garment there is something that we have to say and it's part of the sunnah what is it to praise allah through this dua that he granted me this attire this garment without any power nor might from myself and again this is the beauty of islam look how i am expressing my poverty my weakness my vulnerability my need to allah azza even over something such as this garment i say to allah all praise is for allah who has clothed me with this shirt with these trousers and provided it for me with no power and might compare this to those who boast about their achievements how they made their fortune how they managed to make their projects successful on their own with their own power with their own intellect neglecting attributing all of this to allah azza it shows you the difference between a true muslim believer and a neglectful one then the prophet wasallam also used to say dua when he wears something new now the uldua is for something that you wear every day there is another dua for what you say when wearing a new set of clothes and this is awesome you praise allah and you acknowledge that it's him alone who made you dress in it not only that you ask allah azzawajal to provide you from whatever good this was made for and whatever good it may bring to you and you seek refuge in allah from whatever evil it was created for and it may bring to you what good and evil are we talking about evil is when i wear this attire and i feel boastful i feel arrogant i feel more important than others this arrogance takes me straight to hell the goodness of such a garment is that it protects me from cold that it covers my aura that it makes me look decent so all of these have to be incorporated they have to be at the back of your head whenever you wear such things now this is for me wearing it what about if i see someone wear a new set of clothes the prophet allah whenever he saw one of his companions wearing something new he would say this dua [Music] may you wear it out and allah will replace it with another what does that mean i want it to be worn out torn and thrown away no no no what is meant is that may this last for a long time while you are in good health and after a long time it will be worn out and you will buy another one and allah would give you another one so this is an intention for you to have a good health and a long life this hadith the following hadith was said to omar when the prophet saw umar wearing a new set of clothes so he said to him are these washed or new brand new said they're brand new so the prophet allah said this beautiful dua for him where new meaning may you always wear new things live commandably may you be always be praised while you're alive and may you die as a martyr and this is a beautiful dua because who doesn't love to die as a martyr this is the best way to die and this is exactly what happened we know that may allah be pleased with him was assassinated by the majusi assassin while he was attempting to lead the fajr prayer and final hadith is what we say before undressing why would we say something before undressing the previous hadiths were about wearing something putting something on but this hadith is what we say when taking something off what do we say we say bismillah bismillah the benefit of saying bismillah the hadith of allah be pleased with him he said that when we say bismillah before taking off our clothes this acts as a visor between our aura our private parts and the sites of jinn which means even if we are in the toilet and we say bismillah before taking off our clothes outside of the toilet or before entering the toilet and we say bismillah and then we take off our clothes the jinn would not be able to see that to see us and we know that they have the ability to see us while we don't so saying bismillah by the way is done in so many things in islam what does it mean bismillah means i begin with the name of allah any action i'm about to do i begin it with the name of allah so if i'm going to recite the quran bismillah i begin reciting the quran with the name of allah before i eat bismillah which means i begin eating with the name of allah taking off my clothes doing this doing that it's a beautiful phrase that we begin almost everything before doing it this is all the time we have until we meet next time i leave [Music]"
