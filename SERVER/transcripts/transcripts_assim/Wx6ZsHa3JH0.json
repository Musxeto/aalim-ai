  "title": "Started wearing hijab, should I ask my relatives to delete my pre hijab photos ðŸ“¸ assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "um my question is uh that um back when I didn't do hijab um I used to be part of family pictures um with my aunts and uncles and um I don't know now that which um relative of mine has a photo of me so um but there is a possibility that they may have the pictures so um what should I do should I ask them to uh check there first of all alhamdulillah that Allah has guided you to hijab and this is a blessing from Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala secondly it is acceptable for you to go and speak to your relatives and tell them listen I have uh um taken up hijab and you know that you may have pictures of me when I wasn't wearing it so I would kindly request you to to destroy all of them or to send them over for me to destroy them and that is all what you can do sometimes people are so evil when they see you approach them and ask them such a question they would circulate your picture more and more while if you pick up hijab and do not say anything about it they would probably ignore these pictures and not pay any attention to it so this is up to your judgment to look at your family relatives and evaluate what type of people they are and then take the necessary measures and Allah Knows Best"
