  "transcript": "Yasin from Germany. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. How can one maintain a high level of Iman throughout his life? Jazak Allahu Khairan. Wa Jazak. Iman, Akhi, as you know, in our Aqeedah, Ahlus Sunnah Wal Jamaah, fluctuates. It increases with good deeds, decreases with sin. So it is not possible to maintain a high level, as in the Hadith of Handhalah. Al-Asdeemi, Allah be pleased with him, is Sahih. When a Muslim, when he met Abu Bakr, and he said to him, how are you, Handhalah? And Handhalah said, I've become a hypocrite. And Abu Bakr was shocked, and when he told him the reason, Abu Bakr was confused. And he said, well, I feel the same. Let's go to the Prophet, and check it out with him. So they went both to the Prophet, and they told the Prophet, and Handhalah explained. He said, O Prophet of Allah, when we are with you, we are at a high level of Iman, that we are so satisfied that when we go back to our families, and to our businesses, and to our children, and we mix with them, we do not recognize our hearts. A few minutes ago, when we were with you, our hearts were different. Now, they're totally different. The Prophet said, Alayhis Salaam, said to Handhalah, O Handhalah, if your Iman level was the same with your families, with your businesses, with your children, then the angels would shake hands with you in broad daylight. And this is not possible. Your Iman has to go down and up. When you're with me, it's at the highest. This is logical. You're with the Prophet, Alayhis Salaam. So the Prophet said, Sa'ah wa Sa'ah. This is inevitable. This is life. You have to maintain an hour of high level of Iman, and an hour where you attend your daily needs. You have to work, you have to sleep, and rest, and mix with the kids, and have quality time with the wife, and do business, etc. So, it would fluctuate, and this is normal. But, to try and maintain a certain level of Iman that would not go beyond the red zone, the red line, yes, this is something that might be sought after. And this is not very difficult, but a lot of us don't want, because it deprives them from the desires, their hobbies, their lusts, the things that are so lucrative and beautiful, which are haram. So, maintaining yourself in the Masjid most of the time, doing your job in a halal way, not free mixing, not flirting or socializing with the opposite gender, not wasting time. Rather, utilizing your time, whether it is to get closer to Allah in forms of Ibadah, or to excel in this world, in business, in hobbies you do, in working out in the gym, in maintaining a social connectivity with your kinship, and friends, etc. You need to balance. And there is a lecture on my YouTube channel by the name of the Balance in Islam, or a number of lectures, I did a number of times. Go for the latest, because that would should have been, should be the best of them all. Inshallah, you may be lucky to benefit from that, because the happiest person on earth is the one who can balance this, and Allah Azzawajal knows best. you"
