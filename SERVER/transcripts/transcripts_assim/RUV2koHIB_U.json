  "transcript": "Jonas from Germany so um you have a problem so it's I have a feeling that many moves many Muslims here are ignorant of their of their religion and it's so bad that even I noticed with 16 year olds as six as a 16 year old sorry for my um so there's a message it's like so one Arab stands at the front he preaches in Arabic then he sits down and then one of the listeners comes to the front and delivers a translation in German he reads from piece of paper and he just delivers the translation then he goes back to his place and the art then the Arab stands again and then they play two two so it's it's basically like like Zuma is normally prayed just there are two khatibs and I already spoke to them that this is odd I send a question to Islam q a they didn't answer yet um now my question is and so I told them they should make the translation before or after rumor or they may make it with the microphone or so is is this valid if what you're saying is true and it is actually the two orations done by two men after the Imam enters the Masjid and says and sits down and then gives the Adan then he delivers his Arabic and sits and another guy comes and gives a translation and sits back and then the Imam prays to rakaz this is invalid this is not a proper khutbah it should have been as you've clearly stated either before the Imam enters and says they have half an hour he could give any hotba they wish in German or or in any other language and after the Imam comes he delivers where he sits in between then he delivers and he leads them in a prayer of turakas and then afterwards they can have a translation whatever they want this is the appropriate way but the way you describe this is invalid and you should advise him if they don't listen pray somewhere else because this is or the prayer itself is invalid foreign"
