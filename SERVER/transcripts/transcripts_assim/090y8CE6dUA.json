  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] AC [Music] alhamdulillah we begin in our lesson today with the second part of purification of the second part of purification and this is not a puzzle in the beginning we defined purification to be removing of the impurity and uplifting the ritual impurity the ritual impurity is divided into two types minor which is done by uplifting it through W or and the second part is by lifting the major ritual impurity by which we what we'll talk about or by tum as well and we will come to discuss this later on inshallah so what is the definition of linguistically means to pour water over the body while rubbing it and ensuring that it reaches there but legislatively is to pour water all over your body with the intention of intention is important with the intention of uplifting the major ritual impurity while including rining your nose and your mouth as well and this is a difference of opinion among Scholars now what are the reasons we should perform for there are mandatory obligatory reasons and there are recommended reasons among the obligatory mandatory reasons is when a person becomes in the state of janaba and this is due to ejaculation of seamen whether a person is awake or asleep so whenever Sean is emitted and the emission of Sean must be in the form of ejaculation in the gushing form not due to an illness where it comes without gushing no this does not require if it comes out in a gushing form and usually accompanied in if a person is awake and conscience accompanied by a feeling of sensation and pleasure so if this happens then the person becomes in the state of sexual impurity or major ritual impurity number two if there is penetration for either the male or the female Whenever there is the penetration of the male Gentile into the female then once this happens there is the major ritual impurity State whether ejulation takes place or not the the mere penetration requires the state of and this is mentioned in the Hadith narrated by or reported by Imam Muslim where the Prophet says when there is the act of intimacy and or sexual intercourse and the circumcised organs get get in touch meaning the head of the penis is inserted in the women's uh uh vagina then rul is mandated and obligatory the third case where R is mandated is when a woman is pure from her monthly cycle because or men or the monthly period is one of the things that prevents a woman from praying because she is in the major ritual impurity State and the prophet sallallahu alaihi Ali wasallam ordered Fatima B AB may Allah be pleased with her that when she gets her menus she should refrain from praying and the prophet sallallah Ali wasallam ordered may Allah please with her to have meaning after she is pure from her mensis and Allah mentioned this in the Quran when he says and do not approach women them until they are pure meaning when they're in the state of menstruation do not approach them until they're pure once and when they have purified themselves not once they're pure meaning the stoppage of the bleeding is not sufficient once they purify themselves then come to them meaning once they have so this is also an extra piece of information that if a man's wife stops bleeding and she doesn't have her mensis anymore she sees her Purity he cannot be intimate with her until she performs UL according to this Ayah and the fourth uh um means or reason for would be postnatal bleeding when a woman gives birth then she is also uh obliged to perform wle once the postnatal bleeding stops exactly and similarly to menus and this is the consensus of all Scholars of Islam that postnatal bleeding is treated exactly as uh the monthly cycle or a woman's menstruation and the fifth reason for obligating is death but hey I'm dead how can I be obliged no the obligation is not you on you as a deceased rather on the living if they end up with a Muslim dad in their hand between their hands or in front of them then they're obliged to wash him and give him r as per the Hadith of when one of the prophet's daughters died the prophet ordered the women to wash her three five uh or more times um and he explained to them how that should be done so his instruction and Order means that it is mandatory and also regarding that person on Hajj who was wearing and he died while in the state ofam the prophet Sall wasallam ordered the companions to wash him and give him what about if if there is an abortion a miscarriage what do we do with the fetus there is no unless the fetus is four months of age and above because the fetus is not considered to be a human being until the soul is breathed in and according to the authentic Hadith of Abdullah Mas the soul is not breathed in until the fetus is 120 days old so if this happens then yes we wash the um miscarriage and treat it as a human being the recommended forms oful one when a person reverts to Islam as per the Hadith of and may Allah please with them so this is a recommendation it's not mandatory number two after washing a corpse of a Muslim and this is also a recommendation not Mand mandatory so if I were to wash and prepare a dead Muslim after washing him it's recommended that I take aul myself thirdly someone who wakes up after losing Consciousness after being after fainting and there's a Hadith that some scholars believe that supports this though it's arguable arguably doubted why the Hadith stated that the prophet am at the end of his life in one incident fainted a number of time every time he woke up he used to ask them to help him to have aul and he did this a number of time and he performed rul but it is argued that he did this to refresh not to perform the r that we know uh um in Shar but again this is the doing of the prophet and Scholars do have the right to stem this ruling from it likewise those who lose Consciousness can also perform if a person was temporarily in the state of insanity so if a person lost his mind he he became insane for for a period of time then regained his sanity then it is recommended for him to perform uh how to perform there are two ways one way is the sufficient way and this way is simply to cover your whole body with water and renss your mouth and nose no need to to follow any particular order so if you stand under the shower and you thoroughly wash your head and hair and ensure that the water reaches every part of your body you rinse your mouth and nose that's it if you dip yourself in the water in the river or in the ocean and come out doing the same thing Rising your mouth and nose that's it but there is a sun way of doing it which the prophet used to doam by first washing your hands three times then washing your private heart private part with your left hand then washing your hands again to ensure that there's no filth on them then performing a complete woodoo in the same sequence and order then you put three scoops of water on your head and ensure that the water reaches the roots of your hair and your scalp your scalp then you pour water all over your right hand side and your left hand side of your body the whole body to ensure that it covers it and then you wash your feet and you are done this is the sun way of making be careful not to exaggerate in using water the prophet Alam did not use more than three liters of water for his people today use gallons not liters and people today take extreme time to perform rul maybe like half an hour or so and no rul should not take more than couple of minutes and rul is not related to shampooing your hair or washing your body with soap it's not related this is a different issue you want to clean yourself go ahead take your time but don't relate this to Gul rul is just to wash your body with pure water so if you want to use soap you either do this in the beginning then do the or do the then do uh use soap afterwards but don't mix the two so that Shan would not confuse you and prolong the process and Allah Knows [Music] [Music] Best [Music] for"
