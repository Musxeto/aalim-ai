  "transcript": "Dream from Kosovo Sheikh, my question is regarding the Dua that is said after the gathering, which is Subhanaka Allahumma wa bihamdik, ashhadu an la ilaha ila anta, astaghfiruka wa atubu ilaik. So now if I'm in the masjid listening to a lecture and the Imam is doing a lecturing, but he doesn't say the Dua when he's done, and he has made an unintentional mistake during the lecture, and I say this Dua when he's done, will this be an expiation for the Imam's mistake? Jazakallahu Khairan. Wa Jazak. First of all, the Dua is a highly recommended Dua to say and conclude lots of things with. Mother Aisha says the Prophet used to say this Dua whenever he concludes a Dua, whenever he concludes a gathering, and even when he concludes reading the Quran. A lot of the ignorant people say Sadaqallahu al-Azim, which is an innovation. What you should say is, la ilaha ila anta, the Dua of Kuffaratul Majlis, Subhanaka Allahumma wa alaikum, wa alhamdika ashadu an la ilaha ila anta astaghfiruka wa atubu ilaik. This is highly recommended in the Sunnah as per the Hadith of Mother Aisha. So if the Imam makes a mistake in his lecture, Allah forgives him, because this is not laghu, it's a mistake. It was unintentional. So whether he says the Dua or not, inshaAllah, he's forgiven. You saying it, I believe it does not have any value to the Imam and the congregation, but if you say it for your own sake, there's nothing wrong in that, inshaAllah. If not, you're entitled for one free session. And this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it inshaAllah within the following two days or three days and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all bi-idhnillah."
