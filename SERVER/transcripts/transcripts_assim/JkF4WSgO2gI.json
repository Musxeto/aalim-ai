  "title": "Is a Skull cap mandatory for the Salah to be valid? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "is a skullcap mandatory for the salaah to be accepted no this is a cultural thing and the biggest example and the biggest proof of that is when you are wearing your a hump and it's time to pray do you cover your head with a skullcap definitely not and if you do you have to expiate for violating your a hump so a skullcap is a cultural thing and in Arabia this is a cultural thing that I'm wearing if I take it off and pray or problem when does it become an innovation it becomes an innovation when 24/7 I have nothing on my head I wear t-shirt I wear a suit and nothing is on my head only when I come to the message I want to pray I take a handkerchief and some of the sub-continent there are professionals and tying it and doing it on their head or I take my goofy skullcap in Turkey you enter the message and you find a box where you take one I don't know if there are fleas or I don't know but this is what they do and they wear it only for the salat and when they leave they take it off this is an innovation it's not part of the religion at all but if you wear it 24/7 if this is your culture or your custom that you always wear a skullcap not for the prayer but throughout the whole day there is no problem in that"
