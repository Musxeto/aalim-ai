  "transcript": "nawaz says is it allowed to do thicker and supplications by closing eyes as we can concentrate better as long as you are not in salat as long as you're not praying I don't see any thing wrong with that yes it's not from the Sunnah but doing it would not make it an innovation because it's not during salat it's best not to do it but I don't think that there is anything how I'm in it"
