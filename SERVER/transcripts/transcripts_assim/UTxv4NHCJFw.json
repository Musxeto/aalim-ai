  "title": "Will doctors be held accountable for malpractice or medical errors resulting in death?",
  "transcript": "a Brima says chair I'm second year medical student and I was wondering if doctors will be held accountable for a life that's lost due to their error maybe a wrong prescription or something went wrong during surgery and that was the cause of death even though he was trying to save the life what's required for this sin to be forgiven that is the expiation the Kafala if it is considered to be a sin it is not a sin if there is no transgression or negligence and this is a well-known fact in in in fact if a person is qualified to be a doctor acknowledged to be a surgeon known to have knowledge in medicine and prescribing medication in this case if he did not transgress he didn't do anything or overdo anything nor neglect there was no negligence from his side he was operating the patient was willing meaning that the patient has given his consent all the circumstances are normal he did the right procedure but the patient died there was nothing from his side to cause his death then there is nothing on him none whatsoever when it when is he considered to be at fault one if he is not knowledgeable so a student of second year or third year in medical school performs an operation he's not qualified the patient dies an arm is amputated something harmful happens he is held accountable he has to give the expiation a person who claims to be knowledgable and has no knowledge he's accountable a person who's knowledgeable but he a procedure that is risky or an unknown to work so he's trying to experiment he's accountable he prescribed a medication that was not tried before or the possibilities of the side-effects were far greater than the good ones and he did not notify the patient he just gave him from his own he's accountable a qualified doctor who's well known operating or doing a procedure without the permission and the consent of the patient and the patient dies he's accountable why he was trying to do his best yes but he did not take the consent so once you take the consent and you're qualified and you do your best and the patient dies there's nothing on you so I hope this answers your question insha'Allah"
