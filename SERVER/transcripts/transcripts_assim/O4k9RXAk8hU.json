  "title": "Read Quran while passing gas or renew Wudu every time? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. So if someone passes gas a lot and they want to read the Qur'an, let's say for like 30 minutes, and can they pass gas as they're reading or do they have to do wudu all the time when they break their wudu? Wa Jazakum. So the majority of scholars say that you need to be in the state of wudu when reading the Qur'an, when you're actually holding the Mus'haf, the Arabic Mus'haf in your hands. And there are some scholars who say that this is not required and not needed as it's the opinion of Shaykh al-Albani and Ibn Hazm and others. Therefore if you are reading the Qur'an from your tablet or from your phone, in this case you are exempted and you don't have to be in the state of wudu and this is the safest way for you. So even if you pass gas you can continue to read it and you will have no problem in doing that and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
