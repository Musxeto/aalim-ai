  "transcript": "Libby from Bangladesh now the Hadith may Allah be pleased with him woman whoever imitates the people he's from them you say that wearing t-shirts and jeans is okay then why isn't celebrating uh birthdays and barbecue uh celebrations Etc won't be also halal anniversary is Mother Day New Year these are not related to religion wearing clothes is dependent on the culture and this is why the companions used to wear the same clothes that the idol worshipers used to do with the exception of a number of things that the prophet said to them don't wear pure red the prophet said to them don't wear something with zaffron because this is how they used to do it the disbelievers that's it but they used to wear the same turbans the same set of clothes without any problem so this means that clothes are more into what people accept birthdays anniversaries celebrations these are more related to their customs and traditions and it's more related to their religion and this is why a lot of the scholars when you ask them about birthdays they would say this is an innovation we tell them that this is not part of the religion yet those Christians and the Jews Etc may consider it part of the religion as in the case of Christmas so it's a celebration and this is prohibited and Allah Knows Best"
