  "transcript": "hashim from saudi okay so my question is um i know this ruling about how if the money has to pass a year so that it's uh eligible for zakat right okay so if there's a wallet that has a money that passed over a year and my dad gives me an allowance and the money then pass over here and i put it in my what that's uh some that's passed over here and another of the the money that my dad gave me did so like when it's time to pay the car what like how do i know which one passed over here and which one does it okay i will answer questions got your question uh hashem from saudi arabia says he has an amount of money that is due for zakat on the first of ramadan however six months earlier his father gave him a new amount of money so he's asking now how would i calculate zakat basically speaking every amount of money that exceeds the nisab that exceeds the threshold you have to put it in a container or a wallet and after 12 months you give zakat for it but this is not practical we cannot have 12 portfolios or 12 wallets or 12 bags or boxes and we put put our salaries in each one and one year later we see how much do we have left and we give zakat on that therefore scholars said that to make things easy and to remove any confusion or doubt let's set one date in the lunar in the history years let's assume it is the first of muharram and every first of muharram i allocate and calculate how much i have whether it came one month ago or six months ago or a full year and give whatever 2.5 percent on whatever i possess and then for the next 12 months i would not care about what comes in and what goes out in terms of wealth until the following or the coming first of muharram i do this exercise again and give zakat and this is the best way to do it you"
