  "transcript": "reliable I mean what stiletto said Mr enemy in Muhammad Ali Ali Oh Sofia shrine dear brothers and sisters assalamualaikum warahmatullah wabarakatuh and welcome to a new episode of contemporary film issues we have with us again in the studio our special guest she Hassan bin document Hakim she has some welcome news a criminal affair and thank you for having me she Hassan is one of the well known speakers and callers who has traveled extensively across the globe giving Dawa and delivering lectures to both Muslims and non-muslims alike she Hassan the we were dealing with the last episode any issues of insurance what she mentioned deals with Reba it deals with the usury deals with gambling there is another modern day phenomenon that Muslims unfortunately have become involved in and that didn't necessarily exist in its exact form in the time of the prophets of life's a time and that is the phenomenon of credit cards but before we get into that we'd like to just go over briefly the issue of borrowing what's the ruling of borrowing in Islam boring money should not have another Haman hamdu lillahi rabbil alameen wa sallahu wa sallim wa barik and Abdi who else would he I mean nabina muhammad in Wadi Xhosa be a drain borrowing in Islam generally speaking is permissible not like a lot of the Muslims may think that it is something that we should avoid and it's not permissible it's not tricky met well generally speaking it is permissible simply because the Prophet did it a little artisan and he borrowed sallallahu said I mean he died with his shield being as a guarantee with a Jew when the Prophet took in exchange of it some form of barley or food so borrowing generally speaking is permissible however it can be mandatory if you want to protect yourself defend yourself or to have a treatment that cannot be possible without money and you have to borrow so then here becomes mandatory it can be forbidden when you borrow to buy something that is Haram or do you use it in Haram it can be recommended when you want to uplift your situation by trading by engaging in transactions and you don't have the capital for it but this is something that is inshallah will generate money for you and for the welfare of your family and it can be not recommended makrooh if it is used for extravagant and just for showing off and boasting among your peers so it depends here and there unfortunately nowadays the Muslims of indulgent borrowing blindly and they have more won what they can shoot they just borrow for their houses for the cars for their travels and end up at the end of the year with debts and complex interest which is RIBA and Allah as usual made RIBA one of the most major sins in Islam which is usually which is paying interests for loans and etc therefore and and this is quite widely spread in lots of countries where they have mortgages this insist on buying a house by mortgage and they end up paying interest and involved being involved in RIBA and this is definitely something that is not permissible in Islam about Olivia come share so then you discuss with us the issue of borrowing and how in general borrowing is allowed you can borrow from people as long as you're going to pay back and you're not paying back I assume more than what you borrowed so where does greater credit cards fall in this what is a credit card exactly well a credit card is just a plastic magnetic card usually or a metal card that is issued from an institution a financial institution which is usually a bank and it is being issued either for free or for an animal fee and it gives the right to the cardholder and this right is given to him by this institution to borrow to a particular limit a ceiling where he can buy things or these things without being compelled to pay it instantly he has what is known as the grace period and afterwards he has to pay interest if he does not pay it back within this grace period which is explicitly Haram which is definitely Haram because in anything any kind of loan that draws interest is considered to be forbidden in Islam okay so you mentioned radical of a poem that credit card is just it's a piece of plastic a magnetic file but there's other types of cards around we have debit cards and so on and gift cards are these also all Haram well usually the bank's issue a different number of cards so we have the credit cards the conventional credit cards Visa MasterCard Diners Club American Express etc and then you have something that is known as debit cards and they are different than credit cards because they don't actually actually lend you money they hold your money and then whenever you purchase something they take it from what they have held for you so basically instead of running around with all this cash in your pocket you just hold one card and if you lose it you don't actually lose the money you just lose the card yes this is and this is the most safe card available because you're not borrowing so whatever fees they charge you it's not something they are charging to lend you money it is a service fee which is holid stir for the cost of having a bank or having the Machine and all this and the maintenance of the machine yeah this is true third type of cards are the ATMs which the conventional automatic teller machine cards where you just simply go with your bank account card and you insert it and you can withdraw from your own account not unlike a debit card no because this is your well it's similar in a sense but in debit card the bank has all the right to block this amount of let's say five thousand dollars which you've charged your debit card with so my debit card is good for five thousand dollars once the five thousand dollars are over then that's that is it it's blocked while in the ATM it depends on how much money I have in my actual bank account okay so I might I may have a hundred thousand I wish I do and I may have only five hundred dollars so in either case I cannot do anything except with what what is actually there okay and these this would be legitimate assuming obviously your bank account doesn't have interest in itself yes you're storing your money there because of necessity you want to keep your money safe from fire from theft so you're storing your money in the bank and this card is just facilitating access to that money that's true and there's a fourth type of credit cards and that is what is known as the Islamic credit cards and may we may have to go and elaborate a bit on that later or we might have to put the quotation marks too for some of all yes okay but now how does somebody go around to get going back to credit cards how does somebody go and get a credit card don't they have to agree to a certain terms or a contract how does one do this it there are two types of credit cards one that is awarded to you free the minute you reach a certain ceiling in your bank account so if you exceed this they give you as a complimentary gift a credit card without any fees and the other one is just to simply go and apply for one from a bank and you have to fill up of a big form with lots of fine print into it and you sign it as a form of agreement and unfortunately this agreement is stating that you allow the bank to charge you interest rates which is RIBA if you pass the drip the grace period which is 40 or 45 days so they go on the paper yeah if you don't pay back they're gonna charge you interest whether it's 4% of 7% whatever percent there is and of course this is not permissible in Islam and whoever agrees on this would be again on paying RIBA so even if somebody let's say somebody is very careful they're always gonna pay on time or they won't even use the card unless they actually have the money in their pocket so they can pay right away just to have just the agreement in itself is not permissible for the Muslim to you're agreeing on a sin mm-hmm so it's like someone says listen if you don't pay on time I'm gonna chop your right hand first so yeah I have no problem and I signed it and I know that I'm gonna pay it on time some scholars say no say yes if you know for sure or you charge your credit card ahead of time so that whenever you purchase something they're gonna take it off your what you've charged earlier some scholars say that this is permissible but unfortunately being practical nobody that's this so it seems kind of redundant to ask though but seeing how the contract itself to get a credit card is impermissible from the major opinion or for what we see as the more correct opinion then our credit card is permissible if with the following criteria no they're not but if they follow these two conditions which is you cannot issue a credit card that is uncovered and it's not permissible for you to deal with unless the bank would not take any extra percentage whether you late or not if this is the case then this is permissible secondly it must not be charged from you as a customer a good amount of money for issuing this card because again this is a credit card you're borrowing so if I and this we have this in Saudi Arabia we have banks like a rush a bank for example a blood bank they issue credit cards and they give you a grace period but if you don't pay in this period they block the cart and they stop you basically from using it until you've paid them yes but they don't charge you one extra penny over what you have borrowed from them so long this is completely legitimate now the second condition is that when you get these cards they usually give or take from you an animal feed this annual fee should be realistic in the sense that cover the expenses yes so if they tell you that I'll give you a platinum card for $200 a year and a golden card for 150 and a silver card for $100 why is the difference they should be the same because it's the same paperwork so the difference means that no they're charging more because of the ceiling and the amount you're allowed to borrow is different not a flicker ma'sha'allah we'll continue in this discussion but right after we go to the break a semi-coma warahmatullahi wabarakatuh you further TV is launching a new website for you your family and friends everyone a new look top level designs and better technology you will be able to ping Hoda TVs new website and read all our articles surf our video archives chat live on her does forum vote support our programs and give us your suggestions or criticisms we welcome your thoughts we strive to please all our viewers worldwide odor and light in every home you that what happened to life Ricardo and welcome back she has him just before the break you were discussing the issue of credit cards and their place in Islam and usury and making agreements upon Ussuri and haram what if an individual for example already owns a credit card they already got past the agreement part where they agreed to do her on but they're paying on time can they buy things with this credit card as long as they're not paying before they actually have the money can they buy anything can even buy gold and silver with it well you have to understand that if you have already gone into this agreement and you have the actual credit card and you are a hundred and ten percent sure that you'll pay on time and I know a lot of people that do pay on time and not wait for the 30 for the 40 days or 45 days grace period they pay immediately some people even before traveling they would deposit in their credit card account ten thousand reals it for example four thousand dollars knowing that they will not buy anything they will not use more than this so basically they're using it like a debit card yes and this if this is the case this is okay providing that the fee that they take annually is not exaggerated it is realistic and where I come from they charge for the credit card and will fee an amount of approximately like thirty five to fifty dollars a year a year which is not able yes what about some ATM machines though that charge like ten dollars just to take money at one time well again this is not realistic the Islamic scholars that are experts on such topics gathered and said that charging 37 reals or 10 dollars is not realistic the come that the bank is benefiting and the realistic amount they say that might go down to five to seven dollars so this is the amount that should be charged I personally that again taking cash from an ATM machine with your credit card and giving this interest or this service fee is not permissible this is my own opinion because what you're actually doing is borrowing from the bank 5,000 Egyptian pounds 3,000 Saudi Riyals or whatever and you're paying this ten dollars to the bank so you're actually borrowing because you don't have money yet and you're hoping that hopefully when I go back three four weeks later I'm gonna pay them off so the money that the money the service charge that you've paid is for the money they lent you and I feel that this is not a safe thing to do and one should not do this going back to your question can a person buy anything with credit cards providing that they're it's halal yes you can but gold and silver is the exception they are the exception why is that because it falls under the categories of RIBA the Prophet said RA salatu salam that there are six types or six categories that can fall or can be the umbrella of RIBA transactions gold silver wheat barley salt and dates things where the prices fluctuate and these are the six items that the Prophet mentioned Isis Aram listen regardless of the price scholars when looking at them they said that gold silver is a category by itself because it's monetary it's what's what people buy and sell things with and other four are things that are eaten or consumed and weighed at the same time so RIBA goes in these two categories anything that we buy and sell with is considered to be under the umbrella of gold and silver so dollars euros reals are all considered to have the same a concept because they're all basically paper representing gold and silver that should be in a deposit this was the case 20 or 30 years ago now it's not it's the value of the country that is producing this so dollars now they don't have any gold representing the the dollar banknotes it's it's just they're printing it and printing it it's the value of the the country and its economy however when I go to a shop and I buy a necklace for my wife with my credit card the necklace is gold and one of the main important conditions in buying gold is that it should be in the same transaction place so I give you the money you give me the gold it's not permissible that I tell you okay I like this bracelet how much its cost you tell me it's $100 I said okay I bought it I'll have it I'll give it to you in a couple of hours I'll just go and get my wallet this is not permissible because it has to be in the same location could that be because the price of gold may change over time so if you returned the money after a week the price of that gold is different now the justification is not mentioned in the hadith but we know that it is one of the means that the that leads to RIBA and that is why the Prophet son prevented it completely so when I buy this necklace of gold with my credit card I did not give them the man his money on the spot he has to wait two three maybe a week to get his money from the bank and main come and me it may not come yeah so this transaction is not valid Nakhla fee Commission so then what about some companies or banks or credit card companies that offer gifts if you get a card you get a gift provided you you purchase their card and you use their card are these gifts permissible I mean we know that the prophesy sign of accepted gifts from Muslims and non-muslims alike do you have to accept the gift even are you talking about credit cards as a gift or as any gift that the bank gives for opening an account for example for opening the account for using the credit card come some credit cards the more you for example to give you points like towards a free flight and give you let's say a I pod or laptop okay for the gifts that the bank gives over your usage of their credit card this is permissible because they're not borrowing from you you are borrowing from them so it's forbidden for you to give them the interest not the other way around for example if I give you a thousand dollars as a loan and I give you on top of the thousand dollars my car to use this is permissible there's nothing wrong in that the other way around is forbidden if I give you a thousand dollars as alone and you give me your car to use until you pay back the money rather they even they demand it for example they say you have to give me a gift this is complete RIBA so in the case of credit cards whatever gift gifts the cup the bank gives to you it's halal there's no harm in accepting it but in the case of opening a bank account it's different because once I open a bank account I'm actually lending the bank a hundred thousand dollars which is the amount so whatever they give me they're giving it to me on top of my loan to them which would be considered usually river rivers because they're benefiting from your money they're lending it to other people getting more money back and they're giving you that gift as a little extra for lending the money regardless whether they're benefitting or not the minute they took it it's alone they're not whether they deposit it they put it in a box they utilize it it's alone because even if the bank was burnt to the ground they will come and pay me the money that is why it's not a deposit it's they're not guardians of the money yes they're actually in in effect and Islamic point of view they're actually being lent the money so that they have to pay it back no matter what that's that's true radical efika mache so now we know that credit cards in general from MasterCard American Express Visa all these credit cards have the condition of RIBA they have the condition of Ussuri which as we know is a major sin it's it's making war with Allah and it's measure sign which is a very serious issue that you mentioned briefly for us in the beginning of the episode about Islamic credit cards and how some Islamic Institute's are actually promoting this but we know from previous talks with you Barack lefeve um that some people come under the image of Islam to take the Muslims who are sincere and try to take advantage of them how do we know what a real Islamic credit card is as opposed to a fake one this is true unfortunately that there are lots of abuse to the word Islamic and we have Islamic acting and soon we will have Islamic belly-dancing and have Islamic music yet or Islamic music like they the Nasheed people do nowadays with with guitars and and the lyrics are ok but the music is Haram likewise in credit cards they can the Islamic banks came to the idea of trying to find a way out they made HT hat they gave the effort but unfortunately it was not suitable they came up with a solution which is exactly like the conventional credit cards which is a grace period and after that if you do not pay on time they're going to charge you more but instead of charging you more bluntly they have you sign a contract at the very beginning stating that if you're late 40 days late and you have to pay them for example five thousand dollars and you didn't pay it on time you give them the authority to buy merchandise from X Y Z so they just play around with it yeah kind of thing they gave you a power of attorney to sell it to someone else and collect the money and then have it in installments over you so instead of five thousand dollars to be paid on the spot you don't have money they make this long loop transaction and then you end up by paying them six thousand five hundred on installments every month you pay a fixed amount of money sort of a sophisticated loophole that they're trying yeah but is completely forbidden because it's a trick and scholar said that it is you haven't seen the merchandise that they bought on your behalf and you haven't seen those who bought it off them on your behalf all what you've seen is money going out from your bank account and coming back again to be installed in two months and it might in that case might be even more severe because they're trying to trick a lot law definitely people that children of Israel tried to do when they were forbidden to work or fish on the day of Saturday that's true not Oklahoma shave so you mentioned then the Islamic credit card will basically be giving you a grace period and if you can't pay on time they stop you from using the card until you can pay them this is the proper way of doing it and I to my knowledge only two banks does this and it's in Saudi Arabia I don't think anyone else elsewhere does this that they have the intention of benefiting people without making money out of them may Allah correct our affairs and shala and make it easy for the Muslims and make the Islamic solutions widespread and help us rid the corruption and evil from our societies about Allah Fiona Hassan was always a pleasure having you which is about out of time join us please again next week what ceremony con la barqueta
