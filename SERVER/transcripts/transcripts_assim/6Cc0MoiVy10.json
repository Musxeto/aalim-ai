  "transcript": "if prostration was allowed to other than Allah it would have been to the husbands is this Hadith weak or authentic no the Hadith is authentic without any doubt the prophet saidat wasam if I were to order a woman to prostrate if I were to order an individual to prostrate to another I would have ordered a wife to prostrate to her husband and this is to illustrate the importance of the husband's status in his wife's life and frustration is divided into two types prostration of worship and this can only be devoted to Allah and if not then it is a form of shik made major shik and the second type of prostration is prostration of respect and this is permissible only when the Shar allows it as in the case of Allah ordering the angels to prostrate to Adam they were not worshiping him they were following Allah's commands also at the time of YF peace be upon him it was the custom and the habit and it was permissible in the religion that out of reverence they would uh uh respect their elders and their um rulers by prostrating to them as mentioned in the Quran but in our religion this is totally prohibited and this is why the prophet said if I were and this to prevent to show you that this is prevented this is prohibited because if he were to he would have but it's not permissible that's why he did not order a wife to prostrate to her husband"
