  "transcript": "for Han says does Islam allow photography orders come under image making it is an issue of dispute in the past scholars used to consider any type of a photograph to be image making and they considered it to be one of the major sins in Islam the reason is that the prophet alayhi salatu salam said that the most severely tormented people on the day of judgment are al-mussawi rune so Alma so where is the one who makes an image who draws who sculptures an image of a living human being and this word al-mussawi is also one of Allah's beautiful names which refers to a las creating and giving the image to his creation so all alone all along from the time of the Prophet Elisha Salam to our times until recently people did not have cameras so Elmo saw where to them linguistically referred to anyone who draws or sculptures now a hundred and fifty years ago or so when cameras were introduced the man who took the photograph the person who snapped these pictures was called linguistically Misawa so the scholars considered it because this was an act of taking images similar to drawing the picture of a human being or making a sculpture of or a statue of a human being so they said ok one plus one equals two and they say they share the same ruling now this might not be the right approach because the prophet salallahu alaihe wasalam prohibited men to wear gold and everyone knows that gold is the yellow metal which is expensive and well known to everyone few hundred years ago they discovered oil and they nicked named it as black gold so does any of us have the audacity to come and say using oil is Haram because it is called black gold definitely not likewise synthetic silk silk is prohibited for men which is natural but synthetic silk though it is called silk it is not real silk so wearing it and using it by managed totally legit coming back to taking photographs in later years scholars started to understand that photography is not like drawing if I take a pen and I start to draw a portrait of a human being this human being looks like brother Ahmed but is he a mat the answer is no this is my drawing this is my creation and this is what I will be tormented in hell fire by due to the sin as told by the Prophet in the hadith RA salatu salam that whatever you produce you make whatever you create it will be the thing that you will be punished and tormented on the day of judgment by but when we look at a photograph if someone takes a photo of me is this me or it's someone else is this photograph a picture of a lost creation or an imitation of it no one would say that it's an imitation this is a last creation my reflection on a mirror or over a pond of water this is Allah's creation it's just a reflection of the light so a photograph captures the light and it reflects it on a piece of paper or when it's digital you'll find it on your screen there is nothing that a man has done to intervene in creating such a reflection this is a las creation and this is why if someone brings me a contract and I sign it and they make a Xerox copy and they bring me the Xerox copy or the photocopy and they said is this your signature no one would say no it's not mine this is an imitation or this is a copy you would say yes this is my signature and this photograph is a lost creation this is whom Allah created we simply captured it on a picture and this is the most authentic opinion now having said that scholars say that it is prohibited to take and keep pictures of females women and of deceased women would object and say why are you being chauvinistic being against women it's it has nothing to do with being against women on the contrary islamically women are ordered to wear the hijab why does Islam order them to wear the hijab so that they can be protected so that their identity would not be revealed so that non muharram men would not see them by having their pictures whether under mobiles or on their cameras or on their memory sticker card or on social media this totally defies the purpose of hijab and this is why women are not allowed to snap pictures except when it is necessary necessary as in the case of your passports your ID card when it is truly needed but just for the fun of it this is not permissible as for the deceased because this is how chic began at the time of the people of Noah peace be upon him by making idols by praising the dead by looking at them and speaking to them and thinking afterwards that they can impact their lives by asking them and supplicating to them and we see in dramas and movies when a widow is overwhelmed by calamities and she goes to a portrait of her deceased husband and she says yeah I met oh yeah I li oh yeah Abdullah don't you see what's happening to us don't you see this problem these problems that you've left us to face alone and all of this is means of going astray and maybe you never know having said that taking photographs of a person and then photoshopping it to do Photoshop on it changing the features removing the pimples or the wrinkles or dyeing the hair etc all of this is totally prohibited because this is going into image making and editing allows creation and this is why we say that I think it's called the face app where you it shows you how down the line you would look adding few years on you I don't know how would I look definitely this is you where will you go but such a thing such a prediction and altering and changing education of Allah is not permissible la Sojin knows best"
