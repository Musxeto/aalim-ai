  "transcript": "i have a question how muslim to use intuition in the right place photography okay for the question so is that clear the question yes intuition is something that some people are blessed with such as may allah be pleased with him the prophet said allah if there are people who are given uh inspiration to know that what is right what is wrong then umar is one of them and it's in arabic called muhammad if there are those who are inspired and they have this intuition however intuition is a level below that is why abu bakr al-sadiq would never acted upon his intuition rather acted upon the evidence the quran and the hadith of the prophet islam so he was better may allah be pleased with him also acted upon the quran but sometimes he may get these ideas and he acts upon them and sometimes they become right as in a number of cases now this may not come except to those who are abiding by the quran and the sunnah to the extent that it becomes natural for them to know what is right what is wrong so many times people let's assume me for example though i'm not this is an example i don't say oh shikhasam has intuition he knows allah things and he has a good connection with allah no no it's not like that i have knowledge in quran in the sunnah sometimes i may come to an issue that i don't know what is the answer to it i have a gut feeling and i don't have any close scholars to ask or contact and i have to make a decision immediately what to do i follow my gut feeling and after i do that i call one of the scholars of mine and say this and this and this happened then i chose this opinion was i right and to my surprise the sheikh says you made the right decision that was correct this is intuition which follows the quran the sunnah not someone who comes and says um i think i'm gonna beat this man and punch him why i have a feeling he's not a good muslim wait wait wait wait wait this is not intuition these are whispers from shaytan so intuition like having the sixth sense sense i can predict things i can know the future i can all of this is nonsense but intuition that is like a gut feeling that tells you that most likely this decision or choice is the best and i don't know but i hope and pray to allah that he would guide me and it comes true that would be valid intuition and allah knows best you"
