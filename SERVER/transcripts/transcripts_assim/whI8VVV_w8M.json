  "transcript": "Ahmed from Italy Ahmed Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh may Allah bless you and forgive all Muslims around the world Ameen and you as well Sheikh my question is I do boxing and learn to fight for the sake of Allah Azza Wa Jal so that I can defend myself and be able to defend my future wife and family In Sha Allah Ta'ala but sometimes in training we do sparring which involves hitting each other in the face if we use a face protection like a helmet it is still like hitting him in the face Jazak Allah Khair Wa Jazak it is not permissible to strike the face even if there is a face guard or a protection gear and you're wearing gloves again hitting or striking the face is totally prohibited you can pick up this sports or the MMA without doing anything haram so striking the face is totally prohibited and haram you may do whatever you want to do you may think whatever you want to think but this is backed up by authentic hadiths and the prohibition is not from me it's from the prophet himself so you suit yourself if it is a means of defending your family your wife yourself Alhamdulillah there's so many means of doing this you can pick up judo you can pick different forms of martial arts but without with avoiding the face you can pick harness these two sticks very beautifully very efficient and effective or you can pick a Glock nine millimeter that's even the least of your worries you don't have to shower every day after working out and it's very effective and safe and Allah knows best"
