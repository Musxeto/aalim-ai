  "title": "Can 2 Friday prayers be done in 1 masjid due to social distancing & few masjids in area Assimalhakee",
  "transcript": "australia he says i've heard that you say it is not permissible to pray jumu'ah in the same masjid twice and this is not my fatwa i don't give fatwas from my own this is the fatwa of the grand committee of ifta in saudi arabia and they say that jumu'ah is designed to gather the muslims in one place so it is not permissible to have two jummahs where two imams give two separate this divides the ummah so either have one jumuah and you can pray outside of the masjid in extensions and whatever or if this is not possible then you pray afterwards if there is no place so he says his friend or relative doesn't approve of that he says this is not logical i with all due respect can't help it if your relative is a scholar or memorizes the quran or have completed reading the sunnah or have done degrees in fundamentals of or studied one school of thought the whole thing from cover to cover maybe but if your relative with all due respect can't even speak arabic and he wants to give a fatwa because the it's logical i can't help him i don't shoot from the hip this is what the scholars said about this issue on alano's best"
