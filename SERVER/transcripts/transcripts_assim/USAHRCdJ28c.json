  "transcript": "Sam from Canada. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. How are you Sheikh? Alhamdulillah. Alhamdulillah. Sheikh I don't know if this is OCD or waswas but I I know somebody he's saying that for uh for three to four months whenever he uh urinates and then he's making wudu and then a few minutes later he's feeling like a coolness in his private area and then and then he's checking and then sometimes it's there or sometimes it's not or he doesn't know what it is either it's maybe the sprinkle from the water or it's like he's just getting confused and he doesn't have medical history and so I don't know how to advise how would we advise him with this? We we well Akhi gyaani I myself when I make wudu I feel coolness but in my heart not somewhere else so this doesn't mean anything. The rule is certainty is not affected by doubt and checking upon yourself like this and checking your private part every five ten minutes would open a can of worms that you would not be able to tolerate. What you should do is you should tell your friend to urinate and after the urine flow stops there's no drips nothing coming out naturally he has to pour water and overwhelm his private part with water so now it's the whole place is soaked he doesn't he would not be able to turn uh to determine whether a drop of urine came or not it's the whole thing is wet then he has to do the sunnah the sunnah is to sprinkle his inner garment with water so his underwear he just sprinkles a little bit of water on it so the area is wet and he lifts up his clothes and moves on whenever he gets a thought he never goes and check the feeling that he gets is from shaitan the prophet told us alayhis salaam that there are two devils and he even went further to name them one is khinzab and he's responsible to mess up with our heads in issues regarded to prayer the other one is al-walhan and his job is to mess up with our heads with issues pertaining to purity wudu and the likes so al-walhan is doing a good job because he's confusing you and he's making you doubtful and checking all the time don't do this do what i tell you and move on and inshallah in a couple of days you'll be fine"
