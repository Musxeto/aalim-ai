  "transcript": "[Music] in today's lesson we will try to conclude the chapter that deals with judging disputes and testimonies so we talked about the issues pertaining to judges their conditions their characteristics etc now we begin talking about testimonies and witnesses because a judge cannot rule without evidences and looking into cases so what a judge does is to look into either proof or confession when there is a confession this is straightforward but when there are witnesses or other types of proofs this needs to be scrutinized and looked into so the judge's role is to [Music] look for proof presented by the one who is prosecuting another claiming against a defendant something so he has to either provide his proof such as a written document such as a confession such as maybe the testimony of two witnesses depending on the case but generally speaking two witnesses are required etc so the word shahada comes from seeing something shahida to testify is also used for something that you see so it is a confirmed piece of information derived from the root that means to see and some jurors defined it as telling about a right belonging to someone other than oneself against another person who is not oneself in a court of justice so this is the shahada that you testify against someone in a court of law and this someone is not yourself definitely because then that would not be testifying it is claiming but when you testify for someone else to obtain his right then this if in a court of law then this is called shahada and some say it has to have the formality of saying i give witness or i bear witness or i have seen so and so it has to be explicit clear no ambiguity in it so when you say yes abdullah did this when i say this statement it can be ambiguous did you see it no did you hear it no then how did you know that abdullah did this i heard people speak so this is not acceptable so that's why some schools of thought emphasize that it has to be declared through an ambiguous statement such as i testify or i bear witness what is the ruling of the shahada bearing witness testifying it's a collective duty if a group of people know that someone borrowed money and the person who lent the money is claiming his rights but he doesn't have any evidence so the group who know and can testify if one of them of two of them came forward and testified then no sin would be occurring to any of the this group but if they all retreated stood silent refused to testify then they're all sinful at the sight of allah azza allah says witness witnesses must not refuse when they are called in this is an obligation there's a difference between you coming forward and giving your testimony without being asked and between you being called to testify in the latter it is a must allah says you shall not withhold testimony for he that withholds testimony is sinful at heart and the prophet sallallahu salaam also told us that we have to bring a witness so when one of the companions went to the prophet hassan to solve his dispute the prophet said alaihis your two witnesses or else his oath what does that mean it means that if i claim that you took a million dollars from me as a loan and i go to court and i say this man took a million dollars and is not returning back the judge would say do you have any proof so i said i will swear by allah he said no this doesn't help you you are claiming that he took money from you so you have to have a document proving this or two witnesses yes what he took my money is it the judge says shut up and sit down if you can't provide evidences i the judge is saying will claim that you took two million dollars from me and i'll start wailing like you would that allow me to get two million dollars of you of course not otherwise everybody would be running down the streets and in courtyards claiming money and wealth and people killing their loved ones without any proof so what to do here when the person claiming does not have evidence the judge turns to the defendant and he asks him did you take anything from him he says no your honor i did not take anything from him the judge says to him are you willing to swear by allah that you did not take a penny from him here is the fork of the road if the man is lying he won't be able to swear by allah because he knows the wrath that awaits him in this life in addition to hellfire on the day of judgment so if he has a glimpse of iman he'll decline once he declines the judge allocates the one who's claiming his rights because this is evidence that he did take money if he swears by allah allah will take care of him if he says well i did not take it he's lying the guy will face his destiny sooner rather than later may allah protect us okay and then we have uh whose testimony is accepted meaning the conditions that must be fulfilled with or in a witness so the first condition is that he has to be a muslim whoa why is that well the evidence is in the quran and in the sunnah all state that he has to be from among yourselves allah says called to witness two persons of known probity from among yourselves what is among yourselves saudi nationals egyptians no it means from your your among yourselves meaning muslims and allah also says and bring to witness to witnesses from among your men so this shows you that islam is required in most cases except one which was mentioned in the quran and this is when one is on travel so if we are on a journey we're not home we're not in our hometown and we are in a journey and a person is dying and he needs to write his will allah says in the quran o you who believe let there be witnesses to what you do when death approaches you and you are about to make bequests what are these witnesses allah says two persons of property from among your own people or to other from outside meaning from other religion if the disaster of death comes to you when you are traveling through the land so the conditions to accept the testimony of other than muslims is that they're traveling and one needs witnesses while writing his will and there are no muslims to testify and the scholars like ibn abbas and others said that these two others from outside this refers to the jews and christians so not every non-muslim can testify rather it should be from the divine what is known as the divine religions christianity and judaism number two the witness has to be an adult and he also has to be sane meaning that a child no matter how smart he is cannot testify allah stated among your men and also if he is insane he cannot be accepted as a witness because a person insane can say that today is morning and it can't be night he's cuckoo he doesn't know he does not differentiate he does not segregate between right and wrong so he cannot be a witness number three the majority of scholars say that a witness has to be able to speak so a mute witness would not do and sign language they say that it is not accurate and i may beg to differ because now they communicate greatly through sign language but the issue can be in the interpreter who is interpreting it so if we have two muslim interpreters interpreting what the mute person is saying that would do inshallah or if the person can write because writing takes the place of speaking without any problem yes other schools of thought prohibited that totally and said no this is not accepted because such a testimony needs clarity and the possibility of ambiguity is still there when he is unable to speak but again this is not the strongest opinion number four accuracy and good memory what does accuracy means if someone says in a testimony yes i saw three men and they were attacking that poor person maybe they were four men i wasn't sure if that person was on the ground or he was standing maybe there were two but they were two big men so the guy is not accurate was it in the morning or in the evening i i think it was at night but yeah it could have been in the morning this guy is not suitable for testifying and if he doesn't have a good memory then this is the same thing if we ask him to testify today and come next week and we find that all the figures and the numbers he gave us in his testimony has all changed this cannot be a good uh witness or accepted witness probity so this man has to have integrity has to be honest has to be truthful and allah says call to witness to persons of known property from among yourselves so a person who is an open sinner a person who is a fornicator known to everyone that he's a playboy or that he was caught a number of times drunk or consuming drugs or has a number of felonies in his record this guy is not accepted as a witness so what are the rulings pertaining to testimony there are a number of rulings and i think they we have like nine of them here in our textbook and i think that this is the last of our classes on this book of course we have the questions inshallah maybe we will take that um later on maybe next thursday but uh this seems to be the last um of the book i have to go and check so what's the ruling pertaining to the testimony number one the witness must be fully aware of what he is testifying the issue of testifying is a very serious issue you can lead a person to his death row if you testify that he killed someone intention so if you're not sure if you're not certain then you must not testify it could lead to flogging a fornicator or stoning an adulteress or an adulterer and this is why it says that you have to witness with knowledge allah says in the quran do not pursue that of which you have no knowledge something you don't have knowledge of don't testify so what do you mean by knowledge knowledge that is acquired by sight you saw with your own eyes you heard with your own ears it is something that is public everybody knows about it and this is particularly pertaining to matters such as births and deaths so someone asks you about [Music] abdullah who do you know the man said yes do you know his parents yes abdullah's father's name is ahmed and his mother is named shahad have you ever met them no so how do you testify everybody knows this were they married or was he born out of wedlock of course he was married how do you know were you test witnessing and testifying he said no but everybody knows in the village that they were married and he's a legitimate child so these things take the place of sight and hearing because in birth and deaths you don't need to see this with your own eyes number two you need to be objective when testifying so whenever there is a conflict of interest schools of thought block such a testimony as in the case when a man testifies in favor of his father or in favor of his son or in favor of his wife or a wife testifies in favor of her husband so the scholars say that this is not permissible there are a number of jurors who say no this is permissible providing that the witness is known for their integrity and honesty and and such scholars include um with them there they all say no why would i reject the testimony of a man in favor of his son or if of his father if the man is a well-known person to be honest and truthful and this is the most authentic opinion because a muslim is expected to value the importance of testimony even if it's in favor or against his loved ones allah azza says in the quran or who you believe be ever steadfast in upholding justice bearing witness to the truth for the sake of allah even though it be against yourselves or your parents and kin thirdly a testimony against one's opponent is unacceptable and this is understood so if there's an enmity in this life between me and my neighbor we've disputed before on a piece of land between us and it took us to court three four months maybe a year so there is this enmity one against the other maybe threats maybe this or that when it comes to me testifying against him due to this enmity the judge refrains from accepting my testimony because it can be motivated and driven by my grudges and this is understand it is understood and possible jurors had made exceptions so when a muslim testifies against a non-muslim they say that the muslim is a higher entity than the non-muslims so his testimony is accepted not the other way around and likewise when a person following the sunnah testifies against someone who is an innovator or from the deviant sects his testimony is accepted as well number four a witness must give his testimony objectively without any favoritism because this is totally sinful and rejected so i would testify for a ruler or a government official because i know that you scratch my back i scratch your back and this is totally prohibited and haram and a false testimony would take the person the witness straight to hell number five sometimes a witness cannot come forward either due to his illness or to his death so what to do for example a murderer who killed someone and fled the scene two men saw him kill one of them was so ill that he was on his dying bed and he told me that i've seen on that particular day at that particular hour so and so kill and murder the victim so and so and with me was this second witness and he dies so my testimony would be accepted on behalf of that cape a person who was unable to deliver his testimony whether due to severe chronic illness or due to dying number six a false testimony is unacceptable because it implies lying so a person who does this would have committed one of the major sins in islam allah says so avoid the uncleanliness of idols and avoid false statements and in the famous well-known hadith the prophet alaihis once said to his companions shall i tell you which the gravest sins are so the companion said yes o prophet of allah so the prophet said al-islam 1 i'm counting from my side not from the hadith claiming that allah has partners two being undutiful to one's parents and the prophet alice islam was sitting or was reclining but when he came to this third sin he sat up and said and perjury and false testimony and he kept on repeating it until the companions wish that he would stop fearing feeling sorry for him because it was angering him making him angry and and anxious repeating it over and over again to highlight the fact that this is a major sin to be reckoned with number seven a witness may not be given remuneration for giving his testimony and this is important because if a witness comes forward and then he's giving a bonus especially from the defendant or from the one whom he is testifying in his favor that would be a bribe a testimony should not be paid for this is not work that i'm doing for you yes it is understandable that you pay for the expenses that a witness may uh um bear so if he's in another city and he has to fly to your city to testify and maybe stay in a hotel for a day or two yes it's his right to be given such expenses but to give him a bonus or a salary or a fee that is agreed upon in order for him to testify otherwise he won't no this is not permissible and this is a great conflict of interest number eight the number of witnesses differ and we know that the number of witnesses differ for example if it is related to fornication or sodomy we have to have four male muslim witnesses non-muslims don't work below puberty don't work insane this is not acceptable the witnesses have to be for male witnesses but when it comes to things related to theft so who saw the thief steal or break into a house things related to marriage divorce parenthood acting for someone else well wills before death in this case you require two adult men and this is an issue of dispute because some schools of thought say one adult man and two women would do and some restrict this and say no such things as marriage the prophet indicated that it must be two [Music] witnesses of probity and the word used is masculine and not feminine and this is again an issue of dispute that can be solved by the muslim judge according to his understanding now other cases such as things related to financial transactions selling renting loans mortgages deposits in other financial contracts we require two male witnesses or one male witness and two female witnesses and this is mentioned in the quran in surat al-baqarah in verse 282 this is the longest verse in the quran it's called the verse of death and allah says in it call in two of your men to act as witnesses but if two men are not available then a man and two women now in cases of financial transaction in other than these cases it's acceptable to have one male witness as the book says when it comes to financial transactions providing that he supports his claim under oath and this is something that again is dependent on the ruling of the muslim judge who whose decision is decisive whether to accept a man's claim along with his testimony with his oath swearing or not and most likely they require to to avoid any confusion or plotting any person can walk in and claim wealth and says wallahi i saw this and this would be accepted as two witnesses but again this is up to the muslim judge when it comes to issues that only women know about then only the testimony of women is accepted whether it's two women or one woman or four women different of opinion among scholars issues such as what such as proving that this girl is a virgin this requires [Music] diving deep and can only be done by women pregnancy men's menstruations when it begins when it ends whether the child when born cried or not why would i care oh yes you should care because if the child was born and died instantly without making a sound it does not inherit but if the child came out cried and died it would have a portion of his father's inheritance and this makes a lot of a difference a big difference when distributing the inheritance so a man dies leaving a boy a son and a daughter let's let's scratch the daughter a son that's even scratched the sun a man dies leaving behind a wife who's pregnant and five brothers and two sisters no mother no mother no no father so now we cannot divide the inheritance until the woman delivers if she delivers a dead child then she takes a quarter of his inheritance because it is he does not have any children no offspring she takes a quarter and the three quarters the remaining would go to his siblings brothers and sisters but if the child came out and the child just cried for few seconds made the sound cry for 2 seconds and died in this case the mother or the his wife his widow takes an eighth because he has a child and his child takes everything else now the child is dead so the wealth the remaining seventh eighth of the deceased has to be distributed to the heirs of that newborn who died who are the heirs number one his mother she takes one third number two the rest the two thirds go to his uncles not the siblings of the deceased only to the uncles to the male and he they are the closest so it makes difference in the distribution of the inheritance of allah azza knows best in some cases when a person comes and claim that he is bankrupt and asks for zakat money as in the case of people who go bankrupt because the ship that was carrying all of their merchandise drowned sank or the warehouse was set on fire and was burnt to the ground so in this case such a person when providing three witnesses testifying can take from zakat the hadith of uh yeah he said that i went to the prophet and i asked for help for assistance for aid so the prophet said alaihis salatu to me a person who suffers loss of wealth if three men of sound mind among his people say this person has suffered a grave loss so when a person has such witnesses testifying in his favor then people can believe and give him from the zakat finally it is as we mentioned in the beginning of the lesson not necessary to say i saw this i heard this i bear witness or i testify that no it is sufficient to say what without any ambiguity proves that you were a witness so when you say i saw a man kill another i heard a person testifying that he borrowed money from so and so so this is knowledge that allows a person to uh come forward and testify and allah knows best we move on a second let me see if this works no anyhow to the questions in sha allah so question number one madiha says lizard should be killed is it so the answer is yes the prophet told us to kill lizards and we were told that if we hit it with the first strike we will get 100 good deeds 100 hasanah and if we kill it in two strikes we will get less and if killing it in three strikes will get less and less tenve says is it permissible to distance in the qatar of salah in the masjid i don't know what then is referring to probably if he's talking about social distancing in the masjid i would say that this is not something that was practiced by the muslims in history to my knowledge though they had the plagues though they had pandemics but they never practiced it now one can attribute this to their lack of knowledge their lack of medical knowledge etc this is possible but we cannot simply go and say that this is part of the sunnah it is not and hence scholars some of them say that it is permissible to go and offer social distancing there's no problem in that and others may differ and say that this defies the sunnah yes as long as we have face masks and we do not touch things without sanitizers or washing our hands with soap why would i go to five or six feet depart in a masjid five of us came in the same car we were sitting next to one another so this is not logical it's not logical to have social distancing when there is none in supermarkets in malls and restaurants in parks in everywhere even in in airplanes where you sit for five six hours and there's not the same social distancing preventing people from touching the quran in the masjid this is outrageous and when you say that also we will not allow you to touch or kiss the black stone when doing tawaf now this is outrageous maybe tomorrow you'll say you're not allowed to use them swak because it's exposed and everybody can breathe into it maybe tomorrow you're going to say don't offer rookie my brother is sick i have to recite blow in him said no this is contagious who said this now we respect medicine we respect the doctors but we respect our religion more and the way it seems to me and i'm not advocating this but it seems to me that people have gone too far with this issue of social distancing with this so-called pandemic that less than one percent of the infected die what about the 99 what about the 85 percent infected who get cured by them by their own selves with the grace of allah no medical intervention so they've hyped it so much why i'm not a supporter of the conspiracy theory i would not say that it's a pharmaceutical companies that are gaining billions and billions of dollars in euros because of that i would not say it is because of influential people causing small and middle and even large businesses to collapse after five six years of six months of stagnant transactions so that they can reap it off very cheaply like they do in the stock market it's stable and all of a sudden it crashes people lose billions of money while the rich those influential they cream every lucrative share that is rock bottom and they wait for a few months a few years and they sell it gaining billions and billions i wouldn't say that i support this but this is what's happening our religion has to be up front eating from the same plate this is part of our sunnah you want to change all of our sunnah what remains covered 19 is going to disappear inshallah what about when it comes number 20 or 21 or 2010 or whatever this is it's going to continue so we have to draw the line and know when it is mandated to quarantine and when it is just a hoax and allah knows best zed says i'm asking about wild animals there is a sheikh who gave a fatwa that it's okay for one to sacrifice wild animals as is that ruling correct the answer is no this is not correct or the sacrifice for hajj can only be performed from the three categories mentioned in the quran and the sunnah behemoth camels cows sheep and goats that's it you cannot take a zebra and sacrifice it you cannot sacrifice a horse not even domestic animals can be sacrificed other than these uh categories and allah knows best yet says what about the three person mentioned earlier if they do not mention the name of allah while slaughtering this is an issue of dispute and the most authentic opinion is that we were not told to hear and listen to a muslim slaughtering a sheep so i know this sheep was slaughtered by abdullah who's a muslim is it obligatory for me to hear him say bismillah no do i have to go and ask him no likewise if a jew or a christian slaughters an animal if i did not hear them say in the name of jesus christ or in the name of hosair or in the name of our gods or saints or whatever if i do not hear that then their slaughtering is legit and halal and the issue of dispute among scholars is whether if a slaughterer the butcher forgot to say bismillah while slaughtering is it halal or haram the majority of scholars say that it is halal and his the biha is halal with the exception of imam even hasim who said that no he's the biha is dead meat because he did not mention the name of allah but again the majority's rule is different madiha says when we get meat as a gift from a muslim family but we do not know their akrida can we eat it that is yes definitely as long as there is no reason to doubt you just say bismillah eat the hadith states that the companions ask the prophet about people close to them who have recently accepted islam and they offered them food and they don't know whether they had mentioned the name of allah or not the prophet said you say bismillah and that's sufficient sierra says can i recite surat al-mukh from digital devices during menstruation the answer is yes you can touch your mobile with the quran copy in it precisely recite the whole quran if you wish while you are in on your menses without any problem in that be it nilla number seven nariman says please explain how to pray sitting as per the hadith of our prophet allah there's nothing much to explain either you're praying on a chair or you're praying on the ground if you're praying on the ground you usually sit like you sit in and if it's this is if this is too difficult for you you can sit cross-legged or in any way that is comfortable to you you start your prayer bit by takbir and normal when you come to record you put your hands on your knees and you bow a little bit like this then if you want to prostrate and you can prostrate on the ground then you go allahu akbar and prostrate normally if you're on a chair like i am on one now then you go for sujud and you make that a bit deeper than your recur so you bow a little bit more and that's it you continue your prayer as usual muhammad tarak says can i use my zakat money to pay off my father's debt i paid earlier also from my savings but now he has more debts please explain this is an issue of dispute if you remember when we spoke in zakat the chapter that deals with the zakat we said that zakat can be given to any needy poor muslim providing is not one of your ancestors nor of your offspring in arabic they call it so your father your mother your grandfather your grandmother you cannot give them from zakat because you're obliged to provide for them it's your responsibility likewise your son your daughter your grandson your granddaughter you're obliged to provide from them as they're your offspring some scholars say that this one this is when it comes to providing paying off debts is not providing it's not food and water and shelter this is something extra i'm not obliged to pay off my father's debts all my mothers that's it's not my obligation i'm obliged to give them food give them clothes and rent a house for them to stay in this is my obligation but that's it therefore shaykh al-islam eventimian and other scholars said that if they have debts on them it is permissible for you to pay off their debts so i got married to a woman and this woman lives in the uk and she has a student's loan and she is unable to pay them off can i give her from my zakat the answer is yes there's no problem because paying off the loan is permissible and allah knows best j r can i create a hajjud after one after the first and then 30 or less minutes before fajr time the answer is yes fajr time has to advance one is about 30 minutes to an hour before the actual break of dawn and this first adhan acts as a reminder to people who are praying to hajjud be careful the adhan is around the corner so if you want to offer your winter then go ahead and it also reminds those who are asleep wake up it's time for sahur because the break of dawn is round the corner so there is nothing related to fajr you can continue to pray until the second event is called this is the break of dawn the announcements of the break of dawn where your tahajud is not accepted anymore and if you're going to fast you cannot drink or eat after this moment any more the difference between the two events is the second event which is the break of dawn evan has the phrases of the day and night that does does not have these two phrases fatima says my question is what is the role uh uh the ruling not rolling what is the ruling of keep moving the finger while at the shoot hope that anyone can answer me i don't think anyone can answer you except me because the question is addressing addressed to me the sunnah is when you sit for the shahood is to wiggle your index finger like this so my middle finger and my thumb touch and my two pinky and the one next to it is a fist-like and i'm pointing the index finger like this and wiggling it in his place i'm not going up and down i'm not rotating it like some of the brothers do rather i'm just pointing and a saying and wiggling it in its place from the beginning till the end and why do i say till the end because even if i finish my teshahud and the imam is still sitting in the first sitting i will not sit idle rather i would say if he is in the second sitting and i finished the location upon the prophet saw but he still did not conclude this a lot i will go into the dura mode pay off my dad sallam my guide my children allah do this allah until he offers salah you do not sit idle just doing nothing then basirah says can you please guide me on a question that i have that i have if some enters the masjid and the salah is already started do i join the jumeirah or do i offer the torah it is totally prohibited it is totally prohibited to offer any type of salat once the congregation has been called so if the iqamah was established and the imam says allahu akbar and he begins his salat if i come to the masjid i cannot pray the haiti i cannot pray sunnah fajr i cannot pray any voluntary prayer and if i do this is invalid it's void allah does not accept it because the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam said whenever the prayer is called for the comma then there is no prayer valid other than the maktuba other than the fault so you cannot do that and if you do your prayer is invalid what is the prescribed age to keep beard for teenager boys there is no prescribed age a male must not shave his beard so even if he is a child of 10 years of age he should not run a blade across his face and he if he reaches puberty at the age of 13 or 14 he should not touch his beard at all i'm asking about divorce when does divorce count is it when immediately after the uttering you are divorced or is it after herita period if a woman is in her edda then it's cancelled is that also considered a divorce well i say this is a bit confusing but i'll try to answer it to the best of my ability says in the quran divorce takes place twice with the option of retaining the wife and living with her meaning revoking the divorce or setting her free and this depends on the reader period see see meaning to watch not see as in yes in spanish when a man marries a woman he has three divorces in his wallet that he can use so if he divorced the first divorce for any reason they are still married man and wife for the period of the da he can see her she can wear whatever clothes she wants they can communicate and talk but no intimacy at all this is prohibited without the intention of revoking the the divorce and reconciling with her so she sits so what is the edda period a pregnant woman her edda ends when she delivers a non-pregnant woman a normal woman her edda is three monthly cycles so i divorced her we lived for a couple of weeks she got her menses this is one she was pure she got the second menses this is two she got pure she got the third menses for seven days in this period i did not reconcile with her did not revoke the ma the divorce if she gets pure from the third menses if she sees her purity it's done we are no longer man and wife i have no control over her she can get married in the evening if she wishes she's a total stranger for me but if i reconcile and revoke the marriage and i revoke the divorce and i say listen i revoke the divorce you're my wife again then one down two to go if the same thing happens again he divorced her divorces her for the second time the divorce takes place the same process the ridda of three monthly cycles if she is over 55 or 60 and she doesn't have menses then her day is three months lunar months so if i revoke the divorce or reconcile with her after the second divorce two down one to go if i divorce her the third and last divorce immediately she is haram for me there's no going back no reconciliation no revoking of divorce immediately she has to leave the house where's the hijab and cut all forms of communication as i am an mahram to her okay let's get married again no she has to get married to another man a real true genuine marriage with intercourse with no intention of getting divorced from him to come back to me a full-fledged marriage if she were to be divorced then i can get married to her again and allah azza knows best i think that this brings us to the end of today's program we still have few questions left and maybe some more so inshallah we will dedicate thursday to these questions if we don't have any more material in the book i have to go and check whether there is something hidden or not so until that time i leave allah"
