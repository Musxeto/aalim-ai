  "transcript": "foreign huh with the grace of allah the almighty the truth or the agreement of hurdabia is now in effect it has been implemented and the polytheists and the muslims are now in truth this is a 10-year agreement where they would not fight or attack each other in this great agreement or truce there are so many things that were made upon the muslims by allah as obligatory for example it was the practice that if a person was waiting his that he does not commit any of the things that would nullify or would be considered to be prohibited during his haram such as shaving the head cutting the nails putting perfume and so on may allah be pleased with him who was with the prophet sallam at that time they were all wearing the clothes of iran so they were all at the state of echram had a problem with his hair he had so many fleas in it to the extent that because of the length and the long period he was suffering really bad from that they brought him to the prophet salaam carried between two men and the prophet once he looked at him he told him that i didn't think that it was that bad so he instructed him to shave his head so that he would get rid of these fleas and to pay expiation for that and that would be either to slaughter one sheep or to feed six poor people or to fast three days he may choose any of these three and likewise anyone with a legitimate excuse if he had to do one of the things that are forbidden in the state of iran he may do these things providing that he does one of these three expiations also in this uh a journey of the prophet allah in her debia they had rain one night and the prophet after praying fajr prayer told the companions that allah the almighty revealed to him that the people are divided into two divisions or parts one who woke up this morning believing in me and disbelieving in the stars and the other part woke up this morning believing in the stars and disbelieving in the allah the almighty and he explained to us that whomever said that we were reigned because of the star of so and so this is a believer of the stars and a disbeliever of allah and whoever said that allah the almighty has reigned us and blessed us with the strain then this is a person believing in me and disbelieving in the stars and this shows us a very important branch of monetism or of to heed islam is very sensitive to anything that might be associated with the pro with allah almighty in the sense that you may not do anything that would jeopardize your faith and belief or that would be considered an act of shirk that is associating others with allah and there are books that talk about the subject it's a very important subject for example if a person joins allah with another then this is considered to be verbally if he intended that this person or this thing is equivalent to allah then this becomes the major shirk that allah azza never forgives so if someone says that had it not been to the doctor my son would have died if he intends that the doctor was a mean of treatment and he was not the source of treatment he was just the cause that allah azza had put then this is considered to be a verbal form of associating with allah the almighty but if the man said that with the intention that the one who brought the cure and initiated the healing process is the doctor and did not even pay any attention to allah almighty this would be blasphemy this would be associating others with allah and it's a very critical issue that a lot of the people tend to neglect or not pay the proper attention to it and that is why islam is the only religion that preserves monetism to that extent not even not even the prophet sallallahu alaihi is to be associated with allah lots of the brothers make a common mistake they hang in their houses the name of allah and next to it the name of muhammad so you come into houses and you find allah muhammad and this is also unacceptable because it's associating the prophet saw sallam's name to the name of allah as if they are equal yes is that mean the attention is very important thing in the actions yes it it all your actions depend on your intentions but having said that your actions should also be acceptable by allah so it is not acceptable for a person to claim that his intention is for thou although he is sincere his intention is 100 for dawah but his actions are 100 against islam in the sense that if a person goes to a nightclub and sits with a beautiful woman and maybe dance with her or dine with her and his intention is to call her to islam now his intention is good but his actions are unacceptable so this is a different story we're talking about the actions that are permissible the intentions make these actions forms of worship or it nullifies islam with it going back to the treaty of hodobia or the agreement of hudaibiya one of the things that also took place in that great uh event was the establishment of the prayer of fear and what is the prayer of fear in case a person or a group of muslims are in great fear of their enemy if and this exactly what happened when khalid bin warid came with 200 riders to attack and defend so they claim uh makkah from the muslims when it was time for prayer khaled talked to his companions and told them let us wait until they pray and once they're in the midst of their prayer we come and attack them because usually they don't move they don't uh um do anything that would nullify the prayer and that is why allah almighty made it for us permissible to pray fear prayer and this is not the place to describe it but it divides people into groups and one group would protect the muslims while the other uh prays with the prophet half of his prayer and once they finish their half they conclude their prayer quickly they go to the watch and that party or that first group that did not pray go goes and prays with the prophet allah the remaining of his prayer so both parties would have prayed with the prophet allah but half of the prayer this way the muslim army the muslim group would be under protection and under the watch of the group that is not praying among the miracles that took place on this great event as mentioned before the prophet sallam had one of the dried wells poor with with water and also on their way back the companions ran out of the water and the only water that they had was in a cup for the prophet so the prophet mentioned the name of allah saying bismillah put his fingers in that cup and it started to uh uh poured water from it the all the muslims all the whole 1400 of them filled their uh water containers and they performed evolution they drank from all all of them from that one single cup they also ran out of provisions they didn't have anything to eat they had only a handful of dates after collecting it from the whole army and the prophet salallahu salaam also mentioned the name of allah and they all ate from it and took uh parts of it and and saved it individually and alhamdulillah it was as it is and these are all from the authentic hadiths of the blessing of the prophet allah over the food and over the water and again whenever you hear such stories and whenever you hear such hadiths remember that the prophet is not a magician he is a messenger of allah which means that these are all miracles and there were miracles to all the prophets and messengers of allah so he is not an innovator we have jesus christ peace be uh upon him who had lots of miracles moses had lots of miracles and so on so our prophet salallahu salaam was one among his brothers the prophets and messengers of allah we have a short break stay tuned insha allah we will be back i say that the translation has been indirectly influenced with the israelite narrative we haven't faced any problems in our preparations i can't call it the the wise uh egypt you have a huge amount of initiative going on in terms of developing uh qualifications in different parts of the system reading helps you um gain knowledge by saving them it doesn't help you at all they are all uh welcome to uh participate in the discussion and the debate about the development of qualifications what types of books our children do or should read join me for further discussion focus points light in every home and welcome back one of the greatest things that took place in this great event of the treaty of hodeidah that allah revealed to his prophet a whole chapter with the name of which means the victory and in the very beginning the first verse translated to verily we have granted you a manifest victory now people thought that give us a break we think of this treaty as an injustice and something that is not fair to the muslims so what victory is it and if you analyze the events that were accompanying this great event and the things that happened afterwards you would realize that it was indeed a victory first of all one of the most greatest benefits of this treaty was the declaration of the muslims presence and their power before this treaty the polytheist of quraysh would not admit that muslims had power and had a sovereign state of their own would not agree on treating the muslims as someone that is possible to communicate with they thought of them as insects they don't have any rights they had no right and they thought of of the muslims as people that needed to be killed and punished renegades now quraysh the people of mecca are recognizing the muslims as a sovereign state and also they are declaring to the whole world that we are unable to fight and resist the muslims that is why we have to have a truce with them otherwise they would have annihilated them is this not similar to what we see today there's many small groups trying to bring islamic states around and they are rejected for this this is almost similar but it all depends on the sincerity of these groups because we know for a fact if you are sincere and if you are following the sunnah and you want the name and the word of allah to prevail that allah will grant you victory this would not come at an easy price it would not come without putting so much effort this has to come on the shoulders of men who are willing to sacrifice their own lives and their own property in the name or for the name of allah the almighty and once quraish recognized the power of the muslims immediately the tribe of huzzah went into the alliance of the muslims because now it was crystal clear that they can declare this we know that huzzah were the allies of the prophet and the muslims but it was not declared it was kept in the secret but now because of this treaty they can do that in the open among the benefits of this treaty was to prove to the whole world that the people of quraish only thought of themselves and why is that because one item of the treaty was that whoever goes from the people of quraish to the muslims the muslims must must return him back but they didn't mention anything about other tribes this meant that the people of quraish were only thinking of themselves they could care less if the whole of arabia reverted to islam and accepted it and this shows you how arrogant they were because they were only a small minority among the different tribes of islam of of of the arabs but they only thought of them themselves among the benefits of this great event that the number accepting islam was far far greater than when they had the war going on between them how was that the scholars say that if you look at those who were with the prophet salam on the treaty or on on the agreement of her debate how many were there 1400 and less than two years later when the prophet sallam conquered makkah how many men did he have with him ten thousand so imagine the number of people accepting and reverting to islam during this period of truth which makes it a victory to islam and to the muslims and that is why the companions of the prophet sallam used to talk to their companions the followers of the companions and tell them that you think and believe that the victory in this chapter of the quran you think that this is conquering mecca and it is not we as the companions of the prophet sallam consider the treaty of hudaibiyah the victory that allah had granted to the prophet saw sallam and to the muslims and why is that because the number of muslims grew tremendously in this after this treaty no one was approached with clear mind and introduced to islam without accepting it everybody who had a single and well not a single that is who had sense who had a mind of his own and who was unbiased once they introduced islam to him he would accept it immediately it was time to meet the polytheist to debate them to introduce islam to them and inshaallah by the grace of allah they will accept islam now among the items the four items that were on the treaty one particular item the muslims were not very easy with do you know which item abdullah yes i believe it's the one where if anyone came from quraish to medina they must return him back yes if anyone accepted islam from the people of quraish and went to the muslims it was obligatory according to this agreement that the muslims returned him back to the people of quraish the muslims were not easy they were not at ease with this because they thought that it was unfair yet subhanallah the wisdom was manifested few months later and that was when one of the muslims migrated to medina his name was abu basir and two men polytheist came followed him to the prophet and told the prophet in the corner in accordance to our agreement must come back with us shouted and cried muslims do not allow them to get me back to makkah because they are going to torture me until i reject islam come on protect me accept me among you the prophet sallam looked at him and told him have patience abu basir allah the almighty will relieve you of your uh calamity soon but be patient and they took him and went back to makkah on the way they rested for a while they said camp and abu basir may allah be pleased with him pretended that okay you're taking back so what you are my family you are my tribe so he chatted with them and until they felt safe and they felt that he accepted it and while they were sitting and eating dates and resting abu basir looked at one of them one of their swords and said by god this is a genuine original sword it is it looks very good so the man was filled with pride and said yes it's it's my own i bought it for so and so it's the real mccoy so abu bakr told him can i take a look and see how strong it is at the grip of it and the man said yes sure and he gave him the sword and before he blinked his head was rolling on the on the ground abu basir chopped his head off the other man was terrified so he ran back to medina and he entered madina shouting and the prophet sallam looked at him and said this man saw something that is really scary and the man was shouting he is going to kill me i'm a dead man he is going to kill me and in came abu basir may allah be pleased with him and he addressed the prophet he told him oh prophet of allah you fulfilled your promise to the politicist and you returned me so they cannot hold anything against you as for me by allah i'm not going back to them and he went to the village of sifal bahar which was between makkah and medina but close to the coast and joined him joining him was the one who came on the signing of the treaty and he was the son of the negotiator but he would not allow him to go to the muslims so he escaped his tribe escaped quraish and joined abu bakr in the coastal village or or or place of bahar the prophet salallahu when he said that and said by allah he is a war igniter if he had somebody with him now this was taken and understood as a compliment he was what we may call a war igniter so the companions understood that the prophet sallam is encouraging those who are oppressed in mecca to flee their country but go to join him not to come to medina because if they come to medina the prophet salallahu was obliged and forced to return them back so whoever accepted islam from makkah migrated to abu basir until he gathered about 70 men and they used to intercept every single commercial caravan that passed by them so at the end of the day the polyphase did not gain anything so they sent their invoice to the prophet sallam telling him that this item of the treaty is cancelled so anyone who wants to come to madinah let him come to medina and we have no problem you don't have to return them back to the people of quraish i believe that this is all the time we have for today's program until next time if you're so foreign hmm"
