  "title": "Can we exchange Money for Wheat, Barley, Dates or must it be Simultaneous as in the Hadith?",
  "transcript": "[Questioner] from Bangladesh I know that if I want to exchange gold \nwith money it needs to be simultaneous,   but if I want to exchange money \nwith salt, barley, wheat or dates,   do they need to be simultaneous, \nor I can buy them on credit. Okay, so the question is in regards to \nthe six items of goods that the Prophet ﷺ   in terms of categories of Riba, which are \ngold, silver, wheat, barley, dates, and salt.   So the Prophet ﷺ when he mentioned these, he said \nif these categories differ, you can sell and buy   regardless. But if the same category, you have \nto have equality, gold with gold, you have to   have equality and it has to be simultaneous. Gold \nand silver, you can't have equality because there   are different categories, but it has to be \nsimultaneous. Gold and silver is one category   which depends on the value or what is known \nas [ ]. While barley, wheat, dates and salt,   they are another category which is considered to \nbe related to what to be used as food and weighed.   So these two categories, if they are   interchangeable or exchangeable, I want \nto buy with my gold a kilogram of wheat   or 10 kilograms of dates. Can I do this? Yes you \ncan. Can I do it and not have it simultaneous   meaning I buy it in instalments? Yes you can \nwithout any problem. But the categories among   themselves, gold and silver and whatever currency \nfalls underneath them because it carries the same   ruling and food items that are weighed and can \nbe stored like these other four. In between it   has to be simultaneous. Otherwise you can sell \nand buy without any problem and Allah knows best."
