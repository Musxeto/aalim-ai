  "transcript": "a shake the saying that the d the youth will never go to Jenna and the whoever has an atom weight of arrogance in his heart won't go to Jenna. So my question is is is it like guaranteed that after if they die in that state they will first go to hell and then Jenna or is it up to Allah if if he wants he can forgive them and put them in Jenna. Scholars have different opinions towards this hadith. Some of them say that keep the hadith as it is. Don't go into elaborating what it means and what it does not mean. The prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam is giving you a dire warning, a serious warning. If you have an Adam weight or an an ant weight of arrogance in your heart, you will not enter Jenna. The one who allows his wife to free mix and not wear the hijab and have uh associates of the opposite gender, he's a the youth. And that the youth will not enter Jenna. A tomboy, a woman who imitates men in her actions, in the way she talks and walks and wears, she will not enter Jenna. Someone who is continuously drunk and he drinks intoxicants regularly will not enter Jenna. Scholars like him and others say just leave it as it is. Why dilute it and make it ah no okay now I thought it was for eternity. No the prophet said it accept it as it is. Don't explain it. Other scholars said, well, explaining it is for the sake of removing any confusion that doing such sins is not kufur like the Kawarish think and would not render a person in hellfire for eternity because that would not be part of. So this hadith refers to not entering the Jenna with the first patch or without any accountability. And there are many interpretations. The main important concept to understand is that believe that those who commit such major sins are at the divine's divine will meaning that it's up to Allah's divine will to decide whether to forgive them and admit them to Jenna without accountability or to put put them in hell for a long period of But at the end of the day, due to the fact that they're Muslims and they did not nullify their Islam, they would inevitably and eventually enter Jenna. How long? Maybe a million years, maybe a thousand years. This is in Allah's knowledge."
