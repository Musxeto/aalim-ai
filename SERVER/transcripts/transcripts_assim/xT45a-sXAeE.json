  "title": "Is it permissible to use Emojis with the Opposite Gender in Islam? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem - JAL",
  "transcript": "my question is um what is the ruling on using emojis with the opposite gender like i know that smiley faces is kind of like softening the voice but what about the the smiley face with the teeth and the one that shows that you're shocked from the us says what's the um the ruling on using emojis especially with nan mahram's emojis are these yellow faces that may have an expression of someone's laughing someone's uh insane someone's weeping etc nowadays they have someone with a face mask so what's the ruling on using it the most authentic opinion inshallah that there's nothing wrong in using it first of all because we did not draw it we are cut and pasting it secondly it is not something with life in it so it doesn't have a body it doesn't have ears it's not clear of human facial features of it so using it inshallah is permissible now using it with the opposite gender is not permissible why sheikh because when i'm communicating with inun mahram so if she's asking me a question as a sheikh and i reply to her question as a sheikh this is straight uh uh business nothing no fla flirting nothing uh hanky-panky this is halal like you communicate with a nurse when you communicate with a flight hostess when you communicate with a physician but when it exceeds that level of the sister sending me a question with tears emojis with tears and if i answer a question she sends me a red heart and a rose it's no this is not permissible this is totally one of the steps of shaytaan i know in this era of instagram and snapchat you guys are saying you're a dinosaur this is nothing you should have seen what we actually do and then comment on this this is your problem islam sets rules and regulations to protect the muslims from falling into haram and these little things that you pay no attention to which you take for granted are among the things that would lead to haram therefore it is not permissible for a sister to correspond to anan mahram with such emojis because allah azza has prohibited women from speaking softly to non-mahrams so even by nature if you're out soft-spoken and you have a soft voice feminist feminine voice you must not soften it when you speak to a nun why allah says in the quran so that he who has illness in his heart would not be tempted and so many people answer the phone and the caller has a soft voice on the other end and they fall in love with the voice not knowing that she is 85 years of age and i would not say ugly though she might be ugly people this is this brings us to another topic people are so weird when you write a tweet or a post and you say that um you don't have to marry an ugly woman they are so hyped how do you dare say a woman is ugly excuse me there are ugly and they are beautiful what's what's wrong in that in men there are ugly and there are handsome so i don't see the point so feminists make an issue out of nothing sue me i have i don't have a problem with that so therefore softening the voice can have bad consequences using emojis might have the same if not definitely and allah knows best you"
