  "transcript": "and regarding you do yes and can people with long hair wipe over the head one without bringing it back forward okay okay okay any more questions Polly I'm from the UK she says if a person has a long hair is it mandatory to wipe over your head and then go back again first of all the pillar in Woodill is to wipe your head and not to wipe your hair what's the difference here well your hair may extend to your back so the Sunnah is not to wipe my head and then go and take my hair and wipe it all oh no this is not from the sooner the sooner is to wipe your hair from your head from here till just before your neck and go back that's it so if one does it one go this way and that's it the wiping is valid but he's not following the Sunnah and I'll give you a bonus this is on the house this is the Sunnah to go back and to come forth but there is another Sunnah which is to put your hands on the middle of your head and wipe downwards and four sisters are for fancy people with nice hair that they don't want to disturb this is much easier so if you just wipe from the center of your head downwards like this once this is sufficient and does the job insha Allah"
