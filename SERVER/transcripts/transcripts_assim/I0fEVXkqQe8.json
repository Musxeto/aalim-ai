  "transcript": "yes sir I have two questions yes especially as regarding you know fasting on these 13 14 and 15 the voluntary fasting correct is it necessary to fast and all the days all if a person has fasted 13 and 15 as convenient and less important is it ok or offended okay any more question and yeah I have the second question is are the same in during this fasting for example if the region is not very genuine but if he want to break the fast in between I mean after something but written is not very strong just casual can he do because it is voluntary aweso from Saudi Arabia he says the white days 13 14 15 abu huraira may allah be pleased with him said my Halil my dear close friend the Prophet as a salam instructed me to do three things I would never leave them till I die one to offer with you before I go to bed too too fast three days of every month 3 to pray to Erika's of Doha so too fast three days of every month in another hadith it was explained to be the 13th 14th and the 15th of every lunar month now this is a highly recommended sooner if someone fasts the 13th and the 14th and skips the 15th no problem he would he did not follow the Sunnah but he didn't do a sin so this is up to you this is up to your preference but if you want to have the package deal then you have to follow the Sunnah likewise if you pray 12 rak'ahs every day and night and this is referring to what the Sunan arawa tip 2 before fetcher four before the - after the - after Maghrib and Isha if someone maintains praying it Allah will build him a house in paradise but if he skips MRIB he doesn't pray the sunnah of Muharram only the ten records we see ok that's good J my sinful - no there is no sin on you will I be getting the house there answer's no because it's a package you do this and you get that and Alonzo Jane knows best now his second question is if I started a voluntary fasting can I break it for no legitimate reason the answer is yes a person whose fasting voluntary fasting he is his own boss so today I'm fasting it's noon time someone says listen we're going to have lunch would you come say no I'm fasting yeah but we're eating we're having steaks said whoa steaks is something lucrative for me and he breaks his fast and eats with them no problem it's sinful no not at all it's up to you okay you are the boss of your own self"
