  "transcript": "Sana from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu. Sheikh, my question is, I cannot stop myself from committing certain sins. I know Allah is Basir, He sent me, He can see me and everything else. Even sometimes there is, for example, Quran near me. I wrote different words on the wall to stop myself from committing, for example, backbiting, another type of sin. But still I attempt and commit those sins. I even said, like, Ya Allah, I promise with you that I will not do it again, but still I do it. It negatively affects my mental health. I think about it when I commit it, after committing it. And even when I do good deeds after it, I tell myself, like, look, you disobeyed Allah, and now you are doing good deeds, so He will not accept it. Like, He is angry with you and these stuff. I have some health issues as well, and I think after committing certain sins, like, it's further increased. I don't know what to do, although I know everything, like, I should stop myself. I know, like, I heard, like, Yusuf Alayhi Salaam tried to escape from sins while some things were happening there. I know everything, but still I cannot stop myself. I don't know what to do. First of all, Sanaa. This is something that each and everyone is struggling with. By nature, we are sinful. The Prophet said this, Alayhi Salaatu Wasalaam, Each and every son of Adam is sinful. This is nature. However, the best of those who are sinful, those who frequently repent back to Allah Azzawajal. So, this is your fate. This is your test from Allah. Now, you have two options on the table. Either you continue to sin and feel bad afterwards, feel remorseful, ask Allah for forgiveness, do good deeds, try not to do it again. Then you go back in this vicious cycle over and over again. You sin, you still feel remorseful, and you repent, and you ask Allah for forgiveness until the day you die. Hoping that you die not while making the sin, rather in the grace period. In the period of repentance, remorse, and asking Allah for forgiveness. Option one. Logical. Option two. You give up repenting, don't show remorse, just to maintain your mental health, and go strong, doing sins left, right, and center. Don't care about Allah looking at you, the Quran being played, the words that you've written on the walls to remind you of Allah, the oaths you made, nothing. All, let them go away. And just enjoy the moment. Do sins left, right, and center. The trouble is, the moment you die, you go to hell. Do you have any third solution? No. So, the first solution is the only solution you have. However, there are ways and means to strengthen your Iman, and to prolong the grace period of repentance, remorse, and asking Allah for forgiveness. What is that? To change your environment. In the Hadith, when a man came, he said, I confess, I killed a hundred people, I assassinated a hundred people. One hundred souls. So, the scholar said, nobody prevents you from repenting, but you live in the vicinity of a bad company. The town you're living in is full of corrupt and evil people. Go and migrate to another town, where there are righteous people that you can worship Allah with and repent and ask Allah for forgiveness. And the man went immediately. Changed his environment, changed his life, because he's genuine in his repentance to Allah Azza wa Jal. And he died midway, and Allah Azza wa Jal accepted his repentance. So, Alhamdulillah, Allah Azza wa Jal is merciful, most compassionate, most forgiving, accepts the repentance of those who come to him. Change your environment. How, Shaykh? I don't know. This needs further investigation. Who you live with, who you hang out with, the things you do in your daily routine. If you have Netflix and Showtime and Sony and all these platforms, and you fill your time watching Bollywood movies and Hollywood movies and Nollywood movies and the likes, your heart is tarnished, is sealed. You don't have any room for asking Allah for forgiveness or for remorse. Soon you would not even care about asking Allah for forgiveness for these sins. you hang out in the masjid with girls that come to the masjid, have circles of knowledge, learn Arabic, learn Qur'an, and go out with them and come visit them. They visit you. Your whole life is going to change. And this is one of the ways of embettering yourself, Inshallah. www.mooji.org"
