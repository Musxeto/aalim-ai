  "transcript": "first caller from Nigeria brother ADI Connell concerning a device in Imran where some Scholars used to reference that if one wants to borrow someone money when should they you know get at least two witnesses so um if I want to borrow someone money and the person wants it causes it like it wasn't like want to do good in such a way maybe the right hand does a goodie than the left hand doesn't how do we balance this if we get to witness and at the same time we don't want people to know that this person is endearing it exactly so if I understood what you had said you were asking about lending people money and taking two witnesses while doing that am I right yes sir so and you are questioning the confusion where it says that when doing charity the best is to give with your right hand where your left hand does not know what you have spent correct yes sir okay and this regard there is no confusion the verse was not mentioned in Surah Imran actually it was mentioned in Surat al-baqarah at the very end of Surat al-baqarah the longest Ayah in this Surah and actually in the entire Quran and it's called the Ayah of the Dead and in this Ayah Allah tells us that the etiquette of lending people money is to have a document proving your right tomorrow he dies tomorrow he says I did not take anything from you Allah is saving your right and telling you to protect yourself and your wealth even if you don't care about your money it's your children's money later on so you should pay attention to that if you don't write a document you bring two witnesses that would testify later on when needed however this according to the vast majority of Scholars is highly recommended because if there is mutual Trust you can do without it if you wish as mentioned in the following Aya but it is best to have it documented so that in the future if someone dies your right would not be lost this has nothing to do with concealing your charity because this is not a charity this is an assistance you are giving to your brother and a charity is something that you give and hide and this can also happen here when you give him the loan and you keep it private between you and the two witnesses so you did not go around bragging about it to everyone that I have lent him this much amount of money that would defy the purpose of being kind and uh friendly to others and Allah Knows Best"
