  "title": "Can we send the girls picture to suitor’s MOTHER in a marriage proposal? Assim al hakeem JAL ￼",
  "transcript": "Nadeem says, in our society, whenever people want to look for a girl for marriage, they want to see the picture first, especially the mother or sister of the guy, because people coming to see the girl is not feasible, cost involved to feast them and psychological aspects of people coming to the house and rejecting the girl. So sending the picture based on their reply, we proceed or not. Is this allowed in such situations where only the females can see the picture? The answer is no, this is not permissible, for a number of reasons. Number one, taking a photograph of a woman for such a reason defies the purpose of hijab. We do not know if the picture would fall in the wrong hands, or it would be hacked, or someone else would see it like so many times, and this is prevalent and quite popular in the subcontinent. The father of the groom wants to get involved, and I've seen this with some people of respect and knowledge. When they insist on interviewing the woman his son is about to marry, he said, how is this possible? He said, I'm his father. He said, yes, but you're in al-mahram, you want to sit with the girl, you want to look at her, you want to check her out, might as well marry her. This is not permissible in Islam, totally. And likewise, another question that was similar, is when the mother of the girl wants to participate in the interview of the suitor, this is not permissible, this is free mixing. She said, she's my daughter, I'd like to know the man who's coming to marry her. He said, no, your husband does the job. No, my husband doesn't know how to interview people. This is not permissible. Yes, you may pause a question or two, but to sit with the boy and to communicate with him, this is unheard of. So these are all things that are not normal in societies, but unfortunately it's coming to the surface and we've seen a lot of things. So the picture can be seen by people not intended to see it, and this is exposing aura. Number two, you'd all agree that there are people who are photogenic and there are people who are not. Sometimes you look at a picture and say, whoa, what a ugly cow, or a bull. I'll wait for your hate mail, so what the heck, I'm not referring to the girl, it might be a boy. But if you see the person in real life, they're beautiful, they're handsome, they're charming. So the picture doesn't do you right, as in real life. So many people, you see the picture, oh, they're short and fat. If you see them in real life, whoa, they're tall and quite handsome, quite musculine, quite this, quite muscular or the likes, you never know. So the picture does not do you right, and there's nothing like face-to-face meeting. So how to avoid this, Sheikh? Only the mother and the sister are going to look at it. My advice, go for Skype or Zoom. Not a picture, but rather a video call where you can see the expressions on her face when she looks right and left, you get a full idea rather than a still picture that does not portray the truth, and Allah knows best."
