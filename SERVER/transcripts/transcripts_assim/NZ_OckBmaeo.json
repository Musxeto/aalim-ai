  "transcript": "she says is the milk of domesticated donkeys permissible is it recommended in the Sharia to give this to babies now the essence is that everything on earth is hala this is the Islamic concept everything on earth is holid until there is an evidence to prohibit it and Allah Azza WA JAL has made everything for us hala when we come to animals if someone asks us about the milk of horses the milk of cows the milk of sheep of camels etc all these we without any hesitation would say it's Holland because the meat of that particular animal when slaughtered in an Islamic and proper way it is halal for us therefore everything of this animals had as well when looking at domestic donkeys and why do we say domestic because in the beginning all types of donkeys were halal whether domestic or wild but later on as in the hadith of Olivia Talib may allah be pleased with him that it was announced on the year of high bar the seventh year of hijra that the prophet elisha prohibited the meat of domesticated donkeys so since that date it is prohibited for Muslims to consume the meat of domesticated donkeys and the majority of scholars say the ruling of milk is same as the ruling of the meet which means that it is neji's and it is not permissible for a Muslim to consume it or to have it as a medicine as a medicine because when allah azza prohibits something a lot for Hibbert's selling it and allah so JAL even prohibits consuming it for medication because your cure was not placed in something that is Haram the general rule in regards to wild donkeys known as zebras remains as it is and it's halal so it's a game if someone hunts it it is permissible for us to consume its meat"
