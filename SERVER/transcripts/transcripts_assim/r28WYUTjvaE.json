  "transcript": "laughed about this. And finally, there are so many, so much material with me about the Prophet's laughter but the time would not suffice. Finally, the Prophet ﷺ used to laugh and smile when he sees his companions pursuing some of the adornment of this world. Once Abu Ubaidah, may Allah be pleased with him, came from Bahrain with some money and some booty of wars and some treasures. So the Ansar heard of that. So they came and rushed to the masjid and after Fajr prayer, each one of them started standing up a little bit, trying to draw the Prophet's attention so that when the Prophet ﷺ starts to distribute some of this wealth, he would remember them. So the Prophet ﷺ smiled and laughed when he saw them do what they were doing after Fajr prayer and he said, have the glad tidings and be wishful and hopeful because by Allah, it's not poverty that I fear for you. Rather, I fear that Allah would open the doors of this dunya for you and it would be widely spread within your reach as it was opened to those nations before you and that would lead you to compete with one another like they competed with one another and that would eventually lead you to your destruction as it led them to their destruction."
