  "title": "Is it true that praying 2 Rakat when Leaving & Coming back home will protect you from evil? assim al",
  "transcript": "Alayhis salatu Wassalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuhu First of all, we have based our life practice upon following the Qur'an and Sunnah, as you all know, with the grace of Allah Azza Wa Jal. So if there is something that may get us closer to Allah, we try our level best to research it, authenticate it, and present it to the Ummah so that we can all get closer to Allah. If not, then we cannot take such a responsibility by teaching people something that is not authentic. Now having said that, praying is a good thing, but to have this as a consequence, before leaving home you have to pray two rak'ahs, and after you come from home you have to pray two rak'ahs for one, two, three, four benefits to happen for you. This has to be backed up by a real authentic hadith. And to my knowledge, there is no such hadith that backs this up. One would say, but there's no harm Shaykh, why not do it? I said, it may seem that there is no harm, but the hadith of the Prophet ﷺ shows us that there is great harm in introducing to religion what's not part of it. Mother Aisha narrates, may Allah be pleased with her, that our Prophet ﷺ said, من أحدث في أمرنا هذا ما ليس منه فهو رد. Whoever innovates in our religion what's not part of it is rejected. This is rejected, and it's not accepted by Allah. So what more harm would anyone introduce to the religion that would be rejected and thrown back to his face? And Allah knows best."
