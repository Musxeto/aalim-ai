  "title": "ðŸ†• Can a daughter bathe her elderly father if no one else can help? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mehwish from the US Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh I have two questions. First question, what is the ruling on a woman giving her elderly father a bath if there's no one to help take care of him? Okay, first of all, what is the ruling on a female bathing a male, an elderly, a patient who is unable to do this, whether mahram or non-mahram? If this person is unable to do that for himself, like an elderly father, and there is no one of the same gender to do this task, we can't hire a male nurse, there aren't any of his sons or grandsons or nephews who's willing or siblings who's willing to do this, and there's only this nurse, a female nurse, or his daughter. In this case, due to necessity, this is permissible, providing that this daughter wears gloves so that she does not touch the awrah directly, and that she does not look directly at the awrahs of her father's body, because they're still prohibited for her to look unless there is a necessity that calls for her to look and observe. Other than that, there's no problem insha'Allah, and Allah azza wa jal knows best. Have you ever taken a counseling session with me? Go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one. If you can afford it, that's good for you. If you cannot, you're entitled for one free session, and this is for everybody. If they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor, I'll give them one free session without a problem, a full half an hour. So come to me and let's speak about it insha'Allah within the following two days or three days, and bi-idhnillah azza wa jal, I will try and seek Allah's guidance to solve your problem once and for all, bi-idhnillah."
