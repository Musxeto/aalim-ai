  "transcript": "muhammad from the philippines he has an obsession and muhammad we talked about this so many times islam is a religion of simplicity the devil is in the details so when you come to make wudu i rub my hands thoroughly and my arms just to make sure that there is no barriers in my feet why don't you make a full hustle take a full bath and repeat it three times just to be safe this is how shaytan works why would you do anything based on doubt so when you rubbed your hands and arms and feet why what is the reason you just said because maybe there is a barrier maybe is one of the phrases used to cast doubt from shaytan you write this down doubts equal maybe perhaps i think i feel i guess etc if you listen to yourself you will find that you're always using these phrases and this means immediately that shaytan is taking over your mind i'll open another front for shaytan on his behalf and i say why don't you say the shahada before you make wudu ash just in case you may have said something that took you out of the fold of islam and repeat this shahadah before you pray and repeat it before you go to bed and repeat it as soon as you wake up from bed now i know that you're saying hmm this sounds logical no it's not logical i'm telling you how shaytan works he messes up with your head by default you're a muslim why doubt it or maybe i did something that took me out of the fold of islam maybe underlined perhaps i said something i feel i may have broken my islam or violated it or all of these are doubts likewise when you come to wudhu and you're obliged to wash your hands arms feet while doing this you can see if there's a barrier or not if there's not then the default that there isn't why don't you also check your back in the mirror maybe there is some najasa you did not see how is your prayer going to be valid we can open so many fronts and venues for shaytan to mess up more and more with your head it is you who's doing this you're inviting shaytan in it will never stop until you just draw the line and say that's it i'm not listening to you shaytan talk to the hand speak as much as you want i'm not listening to you anymore the moment you start dialogue with shaytan debating with him saying no no you got it wrong there might be no there is no barrier i'm telling you he opens more and more and more fronts and this is what we always tell the brothers in counseling sessions you have to understand how shaytan works in order to be able to fight it without that he will keep on messing up with your head until he destroys your life"
