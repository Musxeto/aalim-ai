  "title": "Can we make Dua from Quran in our sujood or sajda? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh we have uh tariq i i'm trying to understand the question here can i recite verse seven at chapter three i think verse seven has to do with using that verbs in her even though it's a quran no problem yeah it's there is no problem in using uh quranic dua in your sujud because the prohibition of reciting the quran in rukur and sujud is in reciting the quran but when i say rabb i am actually not reciting the quran reciting the dua itself which is totally legitimate"
