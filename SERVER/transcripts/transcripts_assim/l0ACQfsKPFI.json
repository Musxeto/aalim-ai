  "transcript": "she I have heard that it is recommended to keep future plans private and I have notied that whenever I share my goals with others I start feeling demotivated to execute them that's why I remain silent if anyone asks me anything related to my related to my goal I just diplomatically answered them for example alhamdulillah being a graduate I've been working really hard for last few months to pursue my dream career however yesterday I revealed my career plan to my father's colleague because he often brings up job offers for me and insist on joining so I thought explaining my career path would help him understand why I'm not why I'm not preparing a job but since then I have felt lost and motivated unmotivated fearing ail eyes or jealousy so how can I overcome this wasasa and regain my focus number one you have to maintain your daily AAR religiously you have to say your morning and evening AAR AAR after F prayer AAR before going to bedar uh before leaving the home and the likes this is something you have to do religiously number two those who you fear that would give you black uh an evil eye or be envious whenever they ask you about your future goals tell them to go to Jenna don't tell them about your career path or what you intend or what uh companies you have uh corresponded to because there's no need to do that but if you do your AAR inshallah you will be safe without any problem"
