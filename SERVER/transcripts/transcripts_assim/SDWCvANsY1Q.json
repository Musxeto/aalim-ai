  "title": "How does an expat pray when he travels back home? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "his second question is related to traveling and shortening prayers first of all while an expat is living here in a different country to earn a living for five 10 20 years but eventually he's going back to his hometown or home country after he finishes his contract or he retires in this case both cities are considered to be his home so while he's in Saudi Arabia in let's say Jeddah for example working for 5 10 years he never shortens the prayer he never combines a prayer when he travels to his home city let's assume it's Hyderabad or Chennai or Lahore whatever in this case he between the two cities shortens and combines because he's a traveler but once he reaches his hometown then he is a resident of that place there is no combining and no shorting what about if he wants to travel away but in his country away from his hometown again he's considered and labeled to be a traveler so if he goes to a different city to visit the in-laws or for sightseeing or for any other purpose he can combine and shorten his prayers without any problem and I hope this answers your question about Yusuf"
