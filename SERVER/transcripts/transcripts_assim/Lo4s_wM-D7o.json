  "title": "People in hanafi masjid don't say Ameen after Fatiha - do I say it quietly or loudly Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "hamza from bosnia he says if i pray in a hanafi masjid and when the imam says nobody says amin so if i'm praying in that masjid should i after he says this say i mean and stand out in a crowd where everybody looks at me through the prayer what is he doing no see our actions are judged by their conclusion what will happen after we do it this is what judges our actions so if you think that raising your voice in such a fashion would draw attention to you and would draw resentment by the people even if it's a confirmed sunnah everybody else is ignorant they think that it is not sunnah and you can't blame them for this because they are ignorant this is their ability when you hire someone from a different country and you give him the lowest salary possible and he works for you as a driver or a janitor or a a housekeeper whatever you won't expect him to solve problems on microsoft surface pro this is not within his job description so you have to look at people's intellect and ability such people their knowledge the best of the knowledge is that saying i mean is not from the sunnah if you raise your voice in a way that causes resentment this is not wise what to do okay just say i mean that's it you and the people next to you may hear it and you've done the sunnah if you don't say anything your prayer is totally valid and there's no problem in that"
