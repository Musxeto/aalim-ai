  "transcript": "Hamza from Sweden Alum I have this uh confusion that the time for f is literally one hour ahead of the all the mids because in the masjids in during the months between August and April they follow almost just a five minute difference but then in after Ramadan like a this was April they started changing the calculation now it's become 1 hour after the time so which time should I follow cuz I want to pray like just before W this is an issue that is confusing a lot of the Muslims to me I believe that calculation of f is the most authentic worldwide and this was verified by Major sh and Scholars where I come from and they s it physically so there is no point in changing by over an hour just before Ramadan and after Ramadan this doesn't make any sense if you're consistent throughout the whole year and when you come to April you change by delaying it 1 hour until it's August why why did the difference take place overnight yes if it took place over six weeks seven weeks I can understand that so to me I would say that you stick when it comes to your fasting with the earliest and when it comes to prayer with the last so if you want to fast tomorrow says f is at 4 and your local mid says f is at 5 you stop eating at 4: but when it comes to praying F you do not pray fer until it's five and this is the safest way and Allah asael Knows Best"
