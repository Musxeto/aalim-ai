  "transcript": "Sonia says is howdy or mehendi function allowed in Islam if it's not a mixed gathering and only women participate in it it seems that howdy is turmeric + oil pass water applied to both brides and to the groom and it is thought that this mixture brings sort of blessing to the couple at the wedding and this is related to other religions not to Islam so following such a tradition and custom is totally prohibited for Muslims because I've the lover may Allah be pleased with the man with his father said in a long hadith that the Prophet said that in his salat owesome at the end of the hadith women - Abraha be home in for human home whoever imitates a people he is part of them and this what gives Islam its strength when you see over the past 15 centuries the Muslims have preserved their art eda have preserved their Eman and their Islam was not diluted because it's fixed or arlynn Sunnah what the disbelievers want is that you forget everything that connects you to Islam so they force you to shave your beard they force you not to fast and Roma Bahn they forced you not to pray on time they force women to take off their hijab they force their children not to learn the Koran what is this they're drying the resources that nourishes Islam in the Muslims hearts so that they would abandon Islam and they will fail they will fail miserably as the communists failed over 70 years to suppress Islam in the Soviet states and after 70 years we've seen how Islam emerged victorious and prevailed with the grace of Allah so that in these states so no matter how hard the enemies try they will always fail miserably because Islam is protected not by its people but by the Quran and the Sunna and the Sunna tells you to preserve your heart either your dignity your culture and not to imitate the disbelievers even in pity and small things and so many times we get calls from brothers and sisters insisting why our birthdays Haram we want to celebrate the birthday of our child why is it Haram it's not part of their religion and we keep on telling them reminding them that yes it's not part of the religion but it is part of their culture and we as Muslims have our own culture and we do not imitate the disbelievers there's nothing wrong in that what's wrong in throwing a party that people are happy and the exchange gifts there are is a lot of wrong in it because it dilutes your religion it puts you in a melting pot as they want so when you see a Muslim and a nun Muslim in their countries you can't differentiate they all look alike they all act alike but this guy's name is Mohammed and this guy's name is John so it's only the name and even the name they are compromising so it's not Mohammed anymore those who have Mohammed as a name are ashamed of it so what's your names and my name is mo mo as so no no no more as Mohammed why are you doing this God I just want to blend in what's your name my name is my name is Noah what is Noah he's a prophet of Allah is no see yeah yeah but if I say no nobody would know what that means so I just want to blend in out of Allah no you have to hold your ground you have to remain steadfast and believe that your dignity is coming from your Eman not coming from imitating Tom Dick or Harry so applying these functions that resembles the culture and the religion of other religions is prohibited for Muslims"
