  "transcript": "foreign [Music] [Music] faith and if you recall the past three lessons and today is the fourth we started to take to talk about the things that nullify islam the things that take a person out of the fold of islam makes him a kafir and i urge you all especially those who suffer from whispers of kuffur and ship to watch these three previously made lessons and today's lesson as well repeatedly until you fall in love with me why do i urge you to do so because i have a lot of calls and emails and a huge percentage of these calls and emails revolve around have i exited the fold of islam what to do to embrace islam again etc and to tell you the truth this is very unpleasant because it is so obvious that shaytan is messing up with you he is making fun out of you because you don't have the knowledge a lot of the counseling sessions i give people ask about these questions i'm having two intrusive thoughts i'm not aware if i'm a kafir or not should i renew my marriage contract must my wife stay away from me because i was an apostate and a kafir until we renew our marriage contract etc all of these are a result of shaytan's messing up with you because you don't have knowledge so please watch them over and over again understand them if you find something you don't understand write to me either on my website or on facebook of the islamic flip facebook page and or on twitter whenever i'm on live on twitter or you can also book a counseling session whatever you wish to do but get this thought out of your mind so last time we stopped at what the author says about one who claims that anyone other than allah has the power to create or control the universe or cause life or death allah says do they assign to god to allah partners that have created the like of his creation so that both creations appear to them to be similar say allah is the creator of all things he is the one who has power over all things so this is quite rare because if you look throughout history people usually ask others to worship them so the shirk here is in worship not in lordship now you remember we've done this over and over again and we repeat it inshaallah tahit is divided into three types fat which is the beautiful name and attributes of allah in order of lordship it is to acknowledge and to worship allah his actions by believing that he is the creator the giver of life and the taker of it that he is the facilitator that he is the one who brings down grain that he is the provider all of allah's actions which rarely if any people came to claim that they have such things no one ever says i can bring grain down no one ever says i can facilitate things because they can't even the rare percentage the rare incidents throughout history those who claim to be similar to allah azzawajal failed miserably so when ibrahim peace be upon him went to the namrud and this is mentioned to us in surat al-baqarah chapter 2 where allah says didn't you or weren't you aware of the person who debated ibrahim in his lord when ibrahim said to him trying to convince him my lord allah the almighty gives life and death he's the one who gives life and he gives death so the tyrant who claims to be god brought two men sentenced them to death the first one he executed the second one he pardoned so he said i give life and death ibrahim did not debate with him peace be upon him though he could have easily said okay let's see you create a living creature out of clay out of sand out of thin air he didn't argue with him he said okay allah azzawajal brings the sun from the east every morning please bring it from the west if you can fabuhet he was beaten outspoken could not say a word so not everyone claims to be allah azza and those who do are a handful pharaoh said i am your lord the high okay bring something to prove your power your might your divinity they can't so this particular point is directed towards those who may believe or think that other than allah may a control may create may facilitate things may give life and death allah says in the quran do they assign to allah partners that have created the like of his creation show me because people when they think that other than allah can create they refer to a mug look i've created this from nothing i said yeah you made this from nothing but did you create the raw material did you create the furnace it was made in no so you did not create anything you simply assembled and this was also done by allah now no one controls anything in the universe without the instruction of allah so one who claims that anyone other than allah has the power to create or control the universe or cause life and death this is an act of apostasy and disbelief and this is why we emphasize greatly and hugely and put enormous weight on issues of tawheed so that you do not get out of the fold of islam what do people talk about us salafis hadith they say your guys are wahhabis why what do we say that is not normal everything for you guys is shipshape excuse me are we accusing people of something that is not in the quran sunnah are we inventing something no but those who accuse us of emphasizing and putting a lot of emphasis on tahit they themselves have fallen into knowingly or unknowingly this is why we try to protect to heed the only thing that admits you to jannah without it there is no jannah there is no paradise no way without the hate that you would enter paradise full stop this is a challenge and no one can defy this challenge this is why if people say we pray we fast we love allah we look like muslims but we believe that the prophet is at the moment is the controller of the universe that he sees the whole universe as he sees the palm of his head and he controls it as he controls the palm of his hand that is so he sees it as he sees the palm of his hand and he's have another and he knows the unseen and if we throw a maulit for him his soul is roaming the place blessing the food and the drinks and what is this they say we love the prophet well i don't think or believe for a second that the prophet loves you back because you have innovated in his religion and some of you has exited the religion altogether and the prophet said as to the people who come to drink from his pool on the day of judgment and they are prevented from that by the angels he objects and says oh prophet oh allah my um my nation why are they being pushed back and he's answered by you don't know what they've innovated after you so the prophet replies then destruction may it be upon those who have deviated and changed after me so number two in today's lesson the same applies to anyone who takes unbelievers as allies instead of believers and addresses his love and support to them allah says whoever of you allies himself with them is indeed one of them now this is a very important issue and the importance lies in how people understand it isis al qaeda al general their understanding or if you may recorrect that by saying their misunderstanding caused the whole um agreed a great deal of hardship and as usual there are always two sides and a middle path the muslims who follow the quran and the sunnah according to the understanding of the salaf are always on the middle path the two extremes are always there they're always and there are always liberals and secularists who want to change the deen altogether so let us go through what the sheikh said and try to understand it throughout through the quran the sunnah the sheikh says the same applies meaning this takes the person out of the fold of islam to anyone who takes unbelievers disbelievers as allies instead of believers and addresses them or addresses his love and support to them allah says whoever of you yet whoever of you allies himself with them is indeed one of them so what do we mean by allying yourself with them and when i marry a christian lady i have great love for her and we are so intimate and close together am i committing an act of cover or apostasy isn't this allying with her about if i have parents who are hindus when i'm a revered what would i do what should i say well first of all scholars have differentiated and segregated between two meanings or two types of and this is a big chapter in the books of what is allegiance so what are these two types in arabic they call it number one number two some scholars say they're the same and basically it is showing care love interest and underlying bold change the color into red and support to the disbelievers over the believers over the muslims so this is why scholars said no there's a thin line that we have to separate the two from one another so al-mu'alat is to love the disbelievers to be kind for them or to them due to a worldly reason due to materialistic things without compromising your islam and wanting them to win over islam this is called what i can't hear you of course i can't hear i'm not with you this is called al mualat and i'd like you to write it down and to memorize it give examples sheikh i'll do that a person who's married to a christian he loves her he cares for her but he doesn't love her religion he presents her kuffur and disbelief likewise with his parents this is not even muwanat this is something that is permissible because mualat is sinful it's a major sin and it can be something that takes you out of the fold of islam so the example i'm giving is not there's nothing wrong in that it's totally legit while that if i'm a muslim ruler and i love the disbelievers the christians i ask them to give me assistance i ask them to give me advice i do them favors why because they help me stay in power because they provide for me cash they bought me they give me a lot of dollars because they provide me with women and liquor and all the sins and desires i wish and hope for okay this is it's a major sin that can be an act of apostasy but generally speaking it's a major sin like that is how some scholars qualify uh describe the action of heartache with him when the prophet haslam had the intention to conquest mecca wrote them a letter harper is not any normal person he is one of the members who attended badr the battle of badr which gives him a very high ranking in islam so he wrote a letter and he sent it with a woman to makkah warning them the prophet salaam received revelation and he sent zubair and he told them to go and at a specific area they will find this woman retrieve from her the letter so they went and they found the woman where the prophet assad described and they took the letter from her when the prophet isam saw the letter and summoned hatha the prophet did not jump the gun which shows you how patient and tolerant he is he asked for clarification he could have beheaded him on the spot this is treason capital treason said oh prophet of allah wallahi i love islam and the muslims and this is important i love islam the muslims and i know that the religion of allah will prevail but i am not from quraish tribe i came and migrated to quraish and i have family there and i have friends and associates so i wanted them to hold a favor for me when i give them a heads up yet i know definitely that this would not help them at the least but at least they would say later on years later oh halter gave us a heads up he's a good ally he's a good friend allow me to chop his head off this guy is a hypocrite now if that was an act of kufr or shirk the prophet would have immediately allowed him but the prophet said to umar let him be omar didn't you know that allah addressed the people of badr and said to them do whatever you want for i have forgiven you scholars all say that do what you want for i have forgiven you is related to major sins not sheikh kharkov because this would not be forgiven if they die on it so this shows you al-mu'alat he didn't do it because he loved kufar or sheikh or the disbelievers no he did it for something that's worldly may allah be pleased with him as for al-mu'allah allah says in the quran [Music] in many places that being kind to them is okay to the disbelievers as long as they don't show any hostility or enmity there's nothing wrong in that allah says o believers do not take my enemies and yours as trusted allies showing them affection even though they deny what has come to you of the truth some scholars looked at this ayah and said this is mawlana some said this is because allah addressed them in the beginning o believers oh you who believe so he addressed them as believers though they were taking the disbelievers as allies and showing them trust and affection so this is and it does not take you out of the fold of islam except if it's in high levels then it turns into from allah into tawa as for tawali says in the quran all believers take neither jews nor christians as guardians or allies they are guardians of each other whoever does so will be counted as one of them whoever does so he will be or counted as one of them surely allah does not guide the wrongdoers the wrongdoing people so this is tawelli and allah says also you will never find a people who truly believe in allah and the last day loyal to those who defy allah and his messenger they you will not find them loyal this is taking them as allies as guardians as protectors so what is actually tawali tawali is a manifestation of major hypocrisy where the individual claims to be a muslim but loves to see this belief or shirk and the disbelievers or the mushrikeen overcome the muslims and this is a decisive criteria in understanding how severe and bad this is among the muslims when you find that someone who claims to be a muslim putting his hand with the disbelievers armies and governments against the muslims at large and i'm not talking about a faction of the muslims because you can find someone putting hand in hand with the disbelievers against a terrorist group for example among the muslims yes this is an issue of dispute whether the muslims can hire or can join forces with the disbelievers against the faction of a muslim and the most authentic opinion is that this is permissible if there is a need for that and that would not be tawelli because it's like using dogs in hunting though dogs are nudges it's permissible for us to use them as hunting game likewise such armies and disbelievers are like hired dogs and hounds that we use them for a purpose not against all muslims not against islam rather against someone who's a terrorist or someone who's a culprit or a an evil person group or organization so a tawali is something that is a feeling where you love to see islam and the muslims lose to the disbelievers not only that you support the disbelievers with advice with military power with wealth with landscape and facilities and this is obvious to be something that takes a person out of the fold of islam then another type of the types of kofo which we mentioned in the early stages when we said that ibm and other scholars have divided kufur into five categories the sheikh says whoever is able to know and understand islam but chooses to disregard it and turn away from it is an unbeliever even though he's really unaware of it the fact is that his ignorance of islam is easy for him to remove therefore allah says in the description of the disbelievers but nay most of them do not know the truth and so they stubbornly turn away the verse clearly mentions that they are ignorant even though by choice allah says yet the the disbelievers ignore the warnings they have been given if a person remains ignorant of the details of the truth because he turned away when it was pre when it was presented this cannot be an excuse in fact it is the reason that most people go astray that is turning away from the truth not being interested in listening they learn some of it then turn away unwilling to learn it details most disbelievers pay little heed to proofs that are in the universe around them and in religious sources allah says yet many are the signs in the heavens and the earth which they pass by paying no heat to them says nay we have given them all that brings them glory yet from this their glory they turn away turning away from learning the whole when one knows a part does not remove the people's rights in their dealings with one another how can it remove allah's rights and this is a example if there is a core court case between us and you file a court case against me and the judge tells me why didn't you do this and that so i said yeah i well i didn't read the contract such ignorance would not exempt me from the punishment that the judge is going to place upon me says this is your mistake you should have gone through the contract so if in worldly matters you cannot run away with such an excuse what do you think that this or how can it remove allah's rights finally the sheikh says if we do not contemplate allah's signs when we see them we are bound to miss their purpose the quicker we turn away the more we miss thus we do not benefit by them even though the proof they provide is clear and powerful and observed every day allah says we have set up the sky as a well-secured canopy yet they stubbornly turn away from all its signs disbelievers don't look around them to see the signs that allah has created for them when man thinks that his turning away from the details of the truth and putting them behind him exempts him from what they entail he is grossly mistaken turning away from the truth is motivated either by arrogance or by one's preference for play and pleasure hence when he faces catastrophes and his pleasure is lost he may realize the truth and revert to it this is all talking about el er is to neglect ignore i'm not i don't want to see things and this is one of the five types as stated earlier by many scholars among them immunitamia nuclear etc where you have kofro attack vb falsifying saying this is not true then you have kofro and rejection though you know it deeply down inside but you claim it's not then you have kofro this juhud can also be divided into neglect when you give you back to it you don't want to listen you come to muslims you argue with them they say allah says is it let aside the quran let's use logic this is part of erupt of neglect when you speak to an atheist and he doesn't want to hear anything from the quran when you speak to secularists who claim to be muslims by birth or liberalist liberalists i don't know what's adjective um these liberals they claim that the french laws the english laws the ways of america democracy this is what governs the world not quran and sunnah so they neglect they turn their back to islam this is kufur and the verses of the quran that speaks about this are many and it's crystal clear if you have the ability to reach the truth and you don't do that and you don't put the effort you've fallen into this unfortunately the vast majority of people are like this everywhere in europe in the far east in americas they hear about islam they hear about terrorism they hear about the quran they hear about the fuzz people do about protecting the prophet's name as someone depicting him in cartoons etc but they are neglectful negligent they wouldn't care why don't you google it no no i don't need to they have a tip of an iceberg that is the knowledge about islam they have this much they have to go down deep and learn more they refuse this refusal is known as [Music] muslims have this a lot of the muslims i know maybe they don't have the full cover they have it partially some of it have it fully unfortunately so grave worshipers innovators those who believe in things that takes people out of the fold of islam if you give them advice if you try to speak to them say no no no no i find my forefathers worshiping allah like this i'm not willing to listen to anything allah says in the quran he says don't talk to me some of them even say talk to the hand what is this this is and this is what cause causes a lot of the deviation in the muslim world when a particular muslim refuses to adhere to put the effort as for the disbelievers the hadith is crystal clear the prophet says by allah who's my soul is in his hands no jew or christian hears of me and does not believe in me except he will be thrown into hell for eternity so what makes a jew or a christian a disbeliever is one hearing about the prophet two refusing to follow him which means that if a person did not hear about the prophet someone in siberia someone in alaska someone i know people from alaska who alhamdulillah have internet have everything but assuming that uh their people a tribe living in their i don't know what they call these egalos maybe and they have no communication without outer world never heard of quran muhammad sallam or islam someone living in the tribes of amazon or in the jungles of africa or in the sahara in the deserts and never heard of the prophet sasan these people when they die they'll be tested on the day of judgment when they see hell in heaven when they see people are thrown in hell and people admitted to paradise allah will test them if they pass the test this means that they're believers and they'll go to paradise if not it will take them straight to hell for eternity so this type of kuffer is what we will conclude our lesson with insha allah i reiterate i urge you to watch this episode again and the last three episodes so this is 11 so you have 8 9 10 and 11. watch them again and learn the different types of kufur that takes a person out of the fold of islam and i guarantee you that you would not have to book a counselling session with me and pay a hundred dollars for it because now you know you got the information for free and this would help you inshallah in future um problems may allah accept from us all so we have like uh 20 minutes for questions afiya um says my question is in our town our our families i've never seen people dividing the inheritance according to the sharia law as they are ignorant will they be accountable for depriving someone rights even though the person who is depriving from his rights does not ask for his share why if this question seems to be repeated i don't know if i got it through my emails or anyhow yes of course allah azzawajal said about the inheritance that he only knows who's closer to you in benefit from your parents and from your offspring and from your siblings so the division of inheritance was done by allah himself therefore no one has the right to cheat or alter or change such a division and allah said in the beginning of chapter 4 surah nisa that those who consume the wealth of the orphans because they've inherited money from their parents but as a guardian you have the right to control it and then they reach the age of puberty yet you're abusing it and using it for your own interest allah said those who consume the wealth of orphans they verily consume hellfire in their bellies this is what will happen on the day of judgment so even if they wrong me or transgress by not giving me my god-given right and i don't claim it if i don't claim it this does not exempt them from the sin they will be punished for that on the day of judgment however i have to take them to court even if they are my mother or my siblings or anyone because i am entitled to get what allah has given me and no one can prevent me from that ashik says is it must for legs to touch the ground while praying sitting on a chair so a person who is ill cannot pray standing up or cannot at least prostrate and bow standing up he needs to sit down is it a must that his feet touch the ground answers no maybe he's praying on a stool which is a little bit high and his feet are dangling there's no need to have your feet touching the ground um the name is in tamil i can't read tamil uh i am sadjia my question is if a girl is not allowed to spend the night or stay in a place other than is it permissible for girls to stay away from her family in the residential halls of various educational institutions and universities first of all no one said that it is not permissible for a girl to stay in a place without the company of her male maha this is baseless my daughter can go and spend the night in her cousin's house her female cousin's house in the presence of her aunt maternal aunt and her husband and maybe their sons as long as it's segregated and she doesn't mix with them and they don't see her not mahrez don't see her there's no problem that girls can get together and spend the night in a friend's house no problem with that staying in campuses or dorms in universities again if this is totally segregated there's no possibility of males coming in and it is safe for her there is nothing wrong in that insha allah mahmood says can a mother forgive her deceased son because in the hadith as i remember the prophet alaih said to a woman to forgive her son if she doesn't want to see him in hell the son asked his mother for forgiveness for whatever wrong he may have done to her before he passed away first of all the hadith is referring to is not authentic it's spaceless where one of the companions was on his dying bed and his friends were telling and he could not say it so they went to the prophet islam the prophet went to his mother and he asked her if she was mad at him she said yes i am mad at him so the prophet islam they claim to say okay gather a wood so that we would light a big fire and throw him in it so that he is burnt to the ground instead of being burnt in hell fire so the mother was so frightened said no no i forgive him and that then the man said this is totally baseless it's worth more worthy of being a bollywood film rather than hadith the prophet wouldn't do anything like this as hassan and any hadith of this sort would have been circulated widely by the scholars not by laymen so yes if a person dies and his mother forgives him before death or after his death this is a valid forgiveness and accepted be it says is it permissible to pray juma twice in one masjid this is a frequently asked question especially for people in europe and in uk i've seen so many people not only ask this but do this and jumoa is a weekly sermon that cannot be repeated unlike the five daily prayers if you missed the congregation you can make a second congregation but in jumu'ah the masjid itself the essence of friday speech and prayer is that it's to be done only once okay what about if the message is small even if the masjid is small the people must pray outside and if it is not possible for them to pray outside they should gather in a park or in a school and perform another juma for themselves not to perform a second juma and this is the fatwa of the major scholars of saudi arabia and the permanent committee of ifta and other uh supreme councils michelle says which one is correct praying is tehara with the intention of getting married even without anyone in specific or praying stihara when there is already a specific individual first of all istikhara is to be made when you're about to attempt something so if there's no potential suitors you do not offer stihara you do not praise tihara wishing that someone might come like a knight on his shining armor in his shining armor no this is not valid this is not istikhara that is permissible the stihara that is permissible is when a shooter is there or more and you decide to go with one of them before the actual approval or commencement of the procedures you pray to raka's and ask allah if there's any good in it for you that allah facilitates it and makes it happen and allah knows best kunsan tariq says we supposed to offer for sunnah before the her prayer so how should we do that well the hanafi school of thought say that you pray for raka's continuous like the prayer and you conclude that with salam while the majority of scholars say that you pray them two by two so you pray two individual ragas offered to shahada and salam then you stand up and offer two separate rakaas the same procedure and this is the closest to authenticity yes the hanafi madhabs have a hadith which was authenticated by sheikh al-bani but some scholars differed in his authenticity however i have two scenarios one to pray for raqqa as a single prayer where the hannafi school of thought would say thumbs up you've done well while the other scholars and schools of thought would say no that's wrong or to pray two by 2 where all the other scholars and schools of thought would say thumbs up and the hanafi school would would say the prayer is valid but you should have prayed it for so what's the safest definitely the latter because in the first everybody else is condemning condemning what i have done while in the second even the half said yeah this is okay but it could have been better um shazia says i want to know about surat al-qaeda eighty and eighty-one why has a lot of killed the boy allah knows everything so allah changed the heart of that boy why it's necessary to kill him um please explain first of all had three incidents with prophet musa peace be upon them one was with the ship that he made a hole in it two was with the child that he killed three was with the wall that was about to fall and he fixed it in the three incidents when he explained why he did what he had done to moosa peace be upon him if you read the quran in the incident of the boat or the ship he said i wanted to defect it so this was of his own ishti had probably he thought of doing it on his own and that was a good thing because otherwise the soldiers would have confiscated the ship and taken the whole thing by damaging it a little bit they thought it was defected they let it go and the people the poor people got to keep their ship in the incident of the child he used the plural pronoun including himself for aradina we want it that is allah azza and myself so this was a revelation from allah azzawajal and he may have chosen the way on his own but it was revealed to him from allah when it came to the wall he said he said this is i have nothing to do with this it's allah who wanted them to reach puberty and to extract the treasure by themselves so whatever was done was clarified to us now in the case of the child allah created him and allah azzawajal with his infinite knowledge knew what he were capable of doing in the future if he were to live so you would say why didn't allah change it why would allah change it did what his knowledge and his inten intention and will dictated best it is allah who owns everything and knows everything so allah simply got rid of that boy to substitute his parents with someone who is way better weighed you more dutiful and obedient and coolness to their hearts and eyes now if you begin to explore the chapter of what if you will never believe in the predestiny good or evil because everything that happens you would object and say why didn't allah do so and so what if so and so happened and this shows that the sixth pillar of iman has not been fulfilled and this takes you out of the fold of islam six pillars of iman if you don't fulfill them you are not a muslim even if we see you as a muslim we treat you as a muslim on the day of judgement you'll be taken straight to hell to believe in allah azzawajal in his angels in his books in his messengers in the day of judgment and in the pre-destiny good or bad so be careful um is it permissible to pray when you are a traveler and you travel back to your home even though you are not going to stop by or going to hotel from coming back home i don't understand your question muhammad fulham if you're talking about traveling home so i am in saudi and i'm traveling to kuwait city i go to kuwait city i spend a couple of days there i'm a traveler i combine and shorten prayers on my way back can i combine and shorten yes i can okay if i don't combine and shorten can i delay the present prayer which i am on my way back home to pray it combined with the following prayer when i reach home so if i'm traveling just before maharam and as aircraft took off it is magic time i can't pray maghrib on the plane but can i delay it until i reach jeddah my hometown saudi arabia and then pray it in addition to isha prayer combined three raka's plus four raka's the answer is yes there is no problem in that inshallah and as nima how about when you don't know that believing zodiac sign will make you a kafir will you become a kafir no it is essential to know that allah does not hold us accountable if we do not know allah says in the quran and we would not torment a people or a tribe until we send them a messenger because before sending them a messenger they would say we don't have any knowledge why would you put us in hell for something we have no knowledge of so if a person like so many muslims who's not they're not neglectful huh be careful we just spoke about neglect no normal muslims in europe who try their level best to learn about islam and they buy a dog not knowing that buying and petting a dog reduces your good deeds by one carrot every day and each carrot is equivalent to mountain of good deeds i don't even do five kilograms of good deeds a day let alone mount or so the guy comes to me frightened what what do i have left of my good deeds well good news is because you did not know allah would not hold you accountable but those who know or can know but neglect they will be held accountable [Music] afrin where am i yeah a friend sultana says i want to ask a question if i buy my grave and caffeine caffeine is the shrouds the three pieces of cloth or five in the case of women that they're shrouded in um do i have to give zakat on my grave and kevin please answer my question brother i love you for the sake of allah okay so the question is clear in some countries you're not buried in a public cemetery you have to buy a piece of land so that you and your family members can be buried in and this is reserved for you and for your family so she says if i buy this piece of land and i buy my caffeine my shrouds do i have to pay zakat well i would highly recommend that you revisit our islamic series because zakat is a pillar of islam and your question shows me that you don't know this quite well do i have to pay zakat on my headgear or my thumb or my devices or my watch or my mobile or my car or my furniture the answer is no because these are not sellable i'm not selling it i'm not auctioning it so things that you use or will use they're not part of the things that you have to pay zakat for is it advisable that i buy my cafe and my shrouds the answer is no it's very cheap yeah you're talking about like five dollars maybe ten dollars max so it's nothing for you to buy and keep it for so long allah knows when you will die and maybe it would be [Music] worn off due to time and insects and pets pests etc so instead give it to someone who may use it give it to some relative or friend who has someone in his family that had died to use it rather than it being uh in your cupboard or on the shelf as for the grave yes there's no zakat in it because this is not something that you're going to sell and make money out of and allah azza knows best so this is all the time we have until we meet next thursday i leave you from allah"
