  "title": "Is it an innovation to pray 2 rakahs of Repentance Prayer everyday (Salatul Tawbah)? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "so whenever you commit a sin go ahead perform ablution pray 2 rakaats ask allah for forgiveness sure I do this every night what do you mean every single night after Isha I pray 2 rakaats of repentance over what over any sinner I have committed previously presently maybe in the future it's my normal routine no this is wrong what you're doing now is becoming an innovation Buddha why simply because the Prophet made a conditional his salat WA Salam that whenever used sin so this has to be a particular sin that you're praying and offering these two rakahs for repentance not generally speaking and this is why so many of us make the common mistake of innovating in Islam you think that this concept is good you implement it without looking and researching whether it was done by the Prophet Allah so semanas companions or not so many people after Fajr prayer after the kid is over before they leave the Masjid they fall and prostrate a long prostration and when you ask them they say this is prostration of expressing our gratitude to Allah this was never done by the Prophet s of or his companions and continuing to do it every single fetcher or after every single prayer this is a clear innovation that Allah is not pleased with so be careful and insha'Allah Allah will forgive your sins and ours"
