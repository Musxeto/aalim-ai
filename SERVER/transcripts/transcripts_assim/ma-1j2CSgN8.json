  "title": "How should a muslim make long & short term plans according to sunnah? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "My ultimate question is that there's a like short and and long-term planning same as people do today like uh for their life or is it uh directly given by Allah to the prophet Muhammad he doesn't have to make plannings journal and you know and Etc so that uh how excuse me uh no so how actually like uh as a Muslim we have to lead our life and aim for and how is actually a step by step we should follow according to the Quran and the Sunnah okay first of all the issue of long-term and short-term planning is a modern concept of strategy and planning the companions they lived naturally so their intellect planned things long term short-term but without them sitting down and writing mission and vision statement and putting a strategy putting deliverables and this and that they did not have this but they had the concept in their mind what is the concept this is the short and long term uh Investments if you wish so if you ask anyone actually what is your purpose in life to get married do you have children to buy a house some of the brothers what's your purpose in life to buy a Ninja Honda I think it's called ninja Honda I don't know I'm not going to this Ducati only you know so but every single one of us objective should be to fill my grave with good deeds I'm going to die I'm 61 62 63 depending how you look at it hijri or Gregorian so I'm 63 in history the prophet Allah died when he was 63. died when he was 63. rumor died when he was 63. so what am I waiting for to go to Medan so I'm waiting to die so should I sit home and cry no live my life when death comes I had a counseling session a few months ago with a brother and he said Sheikh I have this fear of death my wife divorced me I lost half of my weight and I got fired from my job I said how long you had this fear of death is it three years I said did you die he said what kind of question is this of course not so I said to him are you stupid three years wasted of your life because of your fear of death and look what happened to you what happens if you did not if you don't die for another 15 years wouldn't be stupid is your death predestined is it decreed that you will die on this date this hour you said yes can you change it one minute early one minute late no so why are you afraid live your life when death comes it will come if it doesn't come I'm enjoying life so the issue of long-term short-term strategy or planning we have to do this but it's not something we write like the Americans say we have the the I think the New Year resolution and maybe this is why you're asking because this is the hijri new year so they have this in America every new year they say what's your resolution for the new year I said what do you mean that you have to have a bucket list I'm going to do this I'm going to do that so this is crazy I'm going to live like my life like a Muslim whenever I'm able to benefit the Muslims I do it whenever I can do something for that I do it but I'm not a guy I'm not a scholar I'm a free Lancer I have time sure can you come yeah I don't have time sure can you come no why I don't want to I'm free I'm not a real scholar who gives his time his health his energy for that no no I go to the gym I go sit my with my grandchildren I go do things that I love but at the same time I do that one so live your life according to Quran 100 and implement the Sunnah in every single thing you do 100 and you will have the best strategy and planning in your life and Allah"
