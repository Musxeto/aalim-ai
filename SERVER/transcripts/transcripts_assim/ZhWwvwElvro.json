  "title": "Does Jinn Possession REALLY exist in Islam?",
  "transcript": "Sufyan from India Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Wa'alaykumussalam Wa Rahmatullah Sheikh I have a doubt that in his jinn possession is real or fake because in my country some sect of people saying jinn possession is fake but is any incident happened at the jinn possession incident happened at the time of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ? Jinn possession is by the majority of Ahlus Sunnah something that is valid and something that exists and it is mentioned in Surat Al Baqarah chapter 2 at the very end when Allah speaks about the consumption of riba or usury. Allah says that their punishment on the day of judgment that they shall be resurrected like a possessed person with the jinn which means that Allah is giving us an example of how people will be resurrected due to this major sin on the day of judgment with something that we see which is the possession of jinn and there is a hadith where the Prophet ﷺ saw a young girl or a boy with some change in their tone and color and said that they have something of jinn and ordered them to do ruqya for that individual. Some say this is an authentic hadith, some say it's weak but the vast majority of scholars of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jamaah including Ibn Taymiyyah and Ibn al Qayyim and these great scholars of Islam confirm that jinn possession exists, exorcism also exists doing ruqya and the speaking of the jinn at the time of possession with different tongues and different voices also exist and no one should deny this and Allah knows best."
