  "transcript": "ald [Music] [Music] m for [Laughter] [Music] [Music] [Applause] s everyone living on this planet seeks happiness happiness is sought after by both Muslims and non-muslims alike however they have different routes in attaining such happiness some succeeded in finding the the right trout and many have failed miserably either due to their ignorance or their lack of certainty in Allah Asel even if they are Muslims on the surface and by identity it is a well-known fact to us Muslims who believe only in the Quran it is a well-known fact that happiness cannot be attained except when you're straight on the Shar on what Allah has ordained Allah says in the Quran whoever follows my guidance there will be no fear concerning them nor will they grieve this is a promise from Allah Asel which tells us that in order to attain happiness you have to abide by the Shar you have to implement it in every aspect of your life and we as Muslims believe that there is no happiness without the peace and Tranquility of the heart and the expansion of your chest even if you have wagons of gold and silver you will not be able to attain happiness without such such peace and tranquility and without having your chest expand Allah asael says in the Quran so whoever Allah wants to guide he expands his breast to Islam and whoever he wants to send astray he makes his breast tight and constricted as though he were climbing into the sky this expansion of your breast or your chest was sought after even by the prophets and The Messengers of Allah MO peace be upon Him says he said my Lord expand for me my breast our messenger Muhammad s wasam Allah Asel shows him his favor upon Him by saying did we not expand for you oh Muhammad your breast and if you look at the Muslims today you will see that they are in big trouble they seek this expansion of the breast they seek happiness from other than its original sources as risk provision Al health and guidance can only come from Allah and through his sh likewise the expansions of your chest but what do we mean when we say expansion of the chest or of the the breast is it something physical of course it's not it's metaphorical it's sentimental it is something that is felt and it has two types and two divisions if you attain them you're the happiest man on Earth number one the expansion of the test to accept Allah's legislation a Muslim who is a true person submitting his will to Allah will find no hesitation in his chest to whatever Allah mentions in the Quran and the Sunnah he would say he will adhere he will Embrace he would have the full conviction of whatever Allah legislated this is type one type two is when you accept the pre-ordained and the Divine decree of Allah and this is one of the six pillars of Iman to believe in the predestiny the Divine decree whether good or bad and this is manifested in content no matter what Cal Calamity Falls upon you losing a child losing your wealth losing your health no matter what happens yes we're saddened we may be depressed for a short while but deep down in our hearts we're content because we know this is from Allah asael here you will find that your chest has expanded and that you're happy that you're content even if your stone broke someone asks you how are you alhamdulillah Allah has given me everything a man from the salaf once passed by another person who was blind leopard and paralyzed in the arms and the feet and he was under the sun nobody to assist him and he is saying praising Allah and thanking Allah the man stood and said Uncle with all due respect what are you saying alhamdulillah was shuk for you're blind and you have these diseases in your paralyzed neck down what are you praising Allah over and that man said are you crazy my son isn't it sufficient that Allah has gr granted me a Heart full of content a tongue that Praises him and thank him and I am in what you see isn't this enough that I'm guided where everyone else is lost and by Allah this is the expansion of the chest now how do we attain such happiness and content number one by fulfilling the conditions of and your sincerity in worshiping Allah this is is the most greatest cause of expansion of your chest and the Tranquility of your heart the prophet saidat wasam shall I not tell you of something which if some of the misery and distress of this World falls upon a man and he recites it he will be relieved of his stress any type of misery stress depression that falls upon you the prophet says if you say this Allah will relieve you from it it is the Dua of Theon Theon is Prophet eunus who was swallowed by the whale for for three days and night what is his Dua there is no God worthy of being wor worshiped except you glory be to you I admit I was among the transgress I was among the wrongdoers you say this Allah will relieve whatever depression you're in and you will be granted the expansion of the chest among the reasons for expanding your chest and breasts is prayer the beautiful raas that we offer to energize our hearts the prophet whenever he was worried or depressed or was thinking of something that was occupying his mind he would say oh bil give the call to prayer give the call to and let us find rest in it he would find his peace of mind while praying because when you stand in prayer you are actually asking begging worshiping expressing your poverty and humility to the one who has everything in his hand subhah your health your wealth your safe being your well-being everything is in his hand so when you stand in prayer you are energizing your heart and he also used to sayat my satisfaction was placed in Salat if this prayer became a burden on our backs and shoulders and we felt that we're lazy to offer it this is a huge sign of our hypocrisy and the contraction of our chests among the reasons for expanding our chests is Charity to give to donate our brothers and sisters worldwide are in need of our s what are we doing we're hoarding the money in our bank accounts and the conventional banks are using it to lend others in riba we're doing this and we don't know when we will die so if we die what will happen to the money it will come with us to our grave but our family and the wealth will go back and only our Deeds remain in our Graves Allah asael says in the Quran oh Muhammad take from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase this purification is for your chest and Allah says in indeed he succeeds who purifies his own self so the more you abide by your religion and give in the cause of Allah the more purification of your soul but whenever you turn your back to Allah's remembrance whenever you neglect sh whenever you indulge in Haram the only logical and rational consequence is the contraction of your chest your life is going to be miserable sad and depressed Allah promised and said in the Quran and whoever turns away from my remembrance indeed he will have a depressed life a difficult life what is this life IB abas may Allah be pleased with him the cousin of the Prophet Alat wasam and The Interpreter of the Quran says some folks turned their back to Allah's remembrance and to the truth though they had a lot of wealth and money nevertheless they thought that whatever they have is little so they had this depressed and difficult life because they think can believe negatively of Allah that he will not give them more or give them better this is when you think negatively of Allah may Allah have mercy on his soul said the difficult or miserable or depressed life is when Allah takes away from you content and you'll never be happy and you'll never be having enough no matter how much Allah gives you you always think that you're deprived no matter how many cars how much money you have in bank account how much much or how many plots you have you always look at yourself that Allah did not give you enough ald dear brothers and sisters in Islam the vast majority of Muslims today to they are Muslims by identity by ID card and not Muslims in reality because Islam does not have a place or a say in their lives it is not what controls and runs their lives their lives are a continuation of pain and sadness and depression no matter how hard they try to hide it and to show that they're happy and jubilant individuals Among Us don't pray on time they're preoccupied with work from morning till evening spends his day reading his newspaper or working on his reports and meetings at work or playing with his mobile phone if he rides in his car all what he hears is music and the news and he doesn't contemplate about anything he doesn't have the time to think where he's coming from and where he's going and what has he filled his grave with well as soon as he reaches his home he sits on his sofa with three or four remote control controlls in front of him flipping from one channel to the other listening watching doing what displeases Allah asael and pleases Satan and once he's fed up he leaves the house goes to a a Dian to hang out with his friends where his heart is hardened more and more by sitting with such people or he just drives around the streets or sits at cafes or restaurants wasting time until it's late at night he goes back to home crashes on his bed sleeps like a corpse doesn't offer night prayer doesn't read the Quran doesn't wake for fer and his life is a continuation of this style they love these so-called Muslims to imitate and follow and admire and like the celebrities the social media influencers the actors and actresses and singers and the athletes thinking that these guys are living the dream that they are living a happy life when when these Muslims will have a moment where they Ponder and contemplate about what they have prepared for the day of judgment when they will stand alone in front of Allah to hold them accountable for what they had done if you look inside deep down in their chests that are not expanded you will see that they are bored to death they have enough of these temporary means of Happiness it's not permanent the moment it's over they're looking for another sin to fill its place so that they do not think or contemplate whenever they come from a holiday or a trip where they spent a lot of money enjoyed themselves indulged in sins they are bored to death they want to go back again and do it over and over over and this is the depressed tight life and that is why the vast majority of such celebrities and influencers when they don't find any escape from these worries and depression they go to drugs intoxicants and a life of profanity and sin and some of them can't even get enough of such a filthy life so they run away from it to Suicide thinking that by killing themselves that they will find an escape of the depression that is Contra Contracting their chest and making them feel really tight I ask you what escape from your trouble and what troubles do you have in this life that you run to Hell Fire where the least person to be tormented in hell is a person who has a stone of fire placed in his shoes and sandals his brain boils from its heat what trouble do you have in this world that running to such punishment as minimum would be sufficient the prophet saysat wasam whoever kills himself by stabbing himself s with a knife his knife is in his hand stabbing himself in the stomach in Hell Fire for eternity he will be doing this and whoever drinks poison to kill himself he is drinking it in Hellfire for eternity and whoever throws himself from a mountain or from a high place place he will be throwing himself from a high place in Hellfire for eternity suicide is a heinous crime so this is an advice for myself and for you my brothers and sisters come back to your senses repent to Allah what remains of your life is very minimal and very little compared to what has already passed W he happiness can only be attained in worshiping Allah not in worshiping your whims and desires not in collecting money and hoarding it Allah the almighty says in the [Music] Quran those who have believed and whose hearts are assured by the remembrance of Allah unquestionably by the remembrance of Allah hearts are assured so dear brothers and sisters this is the time for you to return to Allah to seek true happiness to seek Allah to make your chest expand and to feel the content of whatever Allah Asel decrees upon you only then you will find the true meaning of happiness and how to have this is to ask ask Allah like Prophet M used to say ask Allah and beg him and Allah will answer those who ask him [Music] Allah for"
