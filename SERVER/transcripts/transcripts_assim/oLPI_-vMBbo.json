lot sometimes I sit for half an hour and may move a lot so may Allah help you and help us all in this place and if I stay here the sisters will not be able to see me unless they go to the right and I stay here then this will become fitna for me so I don't know what to do may Allah guide us out of this problem - Daisy Shalom marriage is a dilemma we joke about it a lot we cannot live with it those who are married like me for over 27 years well that's a long time masha'Allah and we can not live without it it is one of Allah blessing regardless of all what you hear about it its blessing and beautiful thing about Islam which shows you that this religion is from Allah Azza WA JAL is that whenever people need something most Allah makes it the easiest for example we all need to breathe isn't that true and ham Vilna all what you have to do is inhale air is everywhere no one says please you have a limited space and time for you to breathe you need to breathe otherwise you're going to die so Allah makes it easy we all need to drink but our need to water is less than our need to hell so water is available for you to drink but it is not as easy likewise in Islam marriage and death there is no comparison but there is seriously there is in Saudia Arabia I don't know about here whenever they mention someone who is dead what did what do they do Al Fatiha whenever they mention someone who died let's read Fatiha for his soul this is Meera everywhere in Egypt in Syria in Jordan whenever you mentioned someone who has died or you're about to bury him they all raised their hands al-fatihah exactly the same thing when marriage contract takes place in Saudi Arabia when the father says I give you my daughter and the man says I accept everybody says al-fatihah and it's also another bidder there is similarity ironic but there is some sort of similarity that is very easy in Islam if someone dies it's a catastrophe it's a calamity what to do very easy bring the body wash it pure perfume it shroud it and then take it to the Masjid offer to offer for takbir for the janazah prayer no bowing no prostration take him to the graveyard throw him in the hole put the sand over him alhamdulillah how long does this take 2 hours 3 hours max in Saudi Arabia it's very easy no music no caravans no processions nothing that is easy why because everyone among us is going to die marriage is a little bit not as easy but it technically it is very easy what is marriage marriage is what is marriage marriage is a contract one meaning in Arabic nakai and what are the words used in quran Nika and so watch these are the two only words on in the Quran and the Sunnah referring to marriage and that is why a lot of the schools of thought and I'm not going to go into details of click because this may take a long a short time but it is not why we're here in the majority of schools of rep when you want to get married you have to use and kakuka or the wedge to cut which are derived from the car and the watch why they say it's this is what is used in the Quran so if I say in Arabic and English I give you my daughter in marriage and he says I accept they say this is not accepted Danika is not valid why if I say it in order if I say it in Hindi the same thing you have to use the two words and catoca or the worse to come but this is not the authentic opinion of scholar anything in transactions because this is not a form of worship this is transaction like selling like buying like leasing like all of these are transactions are contract so anything that the population agree upon it is considered to be accepted whether it is an car to Casa worse toka apply you took our hub toka all of these terminologies that you understand that you can have this marriage established in the Quran what does Nika mean Nika means in the Quran the actual marriage contract all the words in the Quran you go through when Nika is referred to this means the marriage contract what do you mean by marriage contract the process of getting married except in one ayah which is the ayah that referred to the divorce when it's takes place the latter last and third time then the wife or the woman she's divorced three times can she go back to her husband cos it's over to get back to him this can only happen if she marries another man not only that what's referring in the Quran in public had that hanky huh so generally the word hanky huh can refer to a contract but the Sunnah tells us no if she marries someone else by contract and he does not have intimacy and intercourse with her she cannot go back and that is why she a companion of the Prophet or some woman who was divorced three times and she went to the prophet and said o prophet of Allah I married so-and-so a second sahabi a second companion and he divorced me and I want to go back to my first husband the Prophet said no you cannot do this until intercourse takes place because this is theoretical the contract the second contract did not materialize it cannot materialize until a proper marriage takes place and then a proper divorce takes place she can go to the first husband so the word Nika throughout the Quran it means contract except in one position and this is mentioned in Surat al-baqarah when a woman is divorced three times and marries another one she has to have intercourse with him not only the contract she has to have the full thing so marriage is extremely easy it's a contract a man comes to my house and he says uncle I'd like to propose to your daughter I tell him after I accept I give you my daughter in marriage he says I accept that so this is a jab and Kabul like selling a man has a card I sell you my card for one lakh I say I accept transaction is done even if I don't receive the car even if he does not receive the money the transaction is done by the word of mouth and in Islam everything is easy you cannot say no bring your witnesses or it's done I sell you you bought from me I give you my daughter you get married to her so it is a contract what is the benefit of this contract making something that was Haram Helen what is the intention is the intention important yes the intention is very important because it gives you the right to enjoy one another but if is if your intention both of you agree on limiting it for time so yes I give you my daughter in marriage for three weeks and two days said you make it three three weeks four days Zaki hollis bismillah this is not impermissible this is known as nikka hold motor this is zina this is not a marriage this is avoid marriage so it has to be with the intention of prolonging it forever my intention when I get married is that I marry my wife forever not in this life also in Jannah if Allah so JAL admits us to eight-mile admits me and you to Jenna and the purpose of getting married is to have children so some scholars say if I put a condition in the marriage contract that I marry this woman with the condition that she does not bring any children this is not a proper marriage this is a marriage only for desire and lust and it's it's inappropriate because the Prophet instructed us to reproduce and we we'll come to this insha'Allah later on right now are there any blessings of benefits of marriage those who are married for less than 10 years would say yes those who are married for more than that to say 20 years they same Malaya he maybe those who are over 20 they say it's pointless no it is is we have a joke in Saudi Arabia I think it's global maybe but I'll say it in Saudi Arabia so that I would be safer from any attacks we say that in the beginning when I married my wife the first six months we were lovers then the first two years we were husband and wife and after five years we became cousins you know in Arabia and also Egypt a man calls his wife my cousin they've been bent on me and she calls him even ambien because usually the cousins get married they reserved to each other and after 10 years we became best friends after 20 years of marriage we became like a brother and the sister and after 25 years of marriage subhanAllah she became like part of me and people think mashallah this is good no she became as part of me if I kiss her as if I'm kissing my hand nothing happens I don't have to make although I don't have to make oh so now this is a satanic joke people who look at things in a black way in a dark way we joke about it but seriously each and every one who has a wife or who has a husband does not think like this but I usually joke about it so I can keep the evil eye away so people would not give me any assets oh yeah no no people say you have two wives yes sir masha'Allah said no if I shave my head you're gonna see the the high-heeled traces on my head so this is all joking huh yeah knee maybe it's joking but I try to think of it as joking is there any blessings and and and benefit from marriage is there I believe there is a lot among the blessings of Allah Azza WA JAL is what Allah mentions in the Quran did I have the ayah there yes so what a room I believe oh don't this is the first ayah and the monkeys science is that he created this - Tennyson this is surat the verse in Arabic he is different than what I have anyhow this is surah a room if I am not mistaken among the signs of allah azzawajal is that he created for you wives from among yourselves and we know that how wha Eve was created from Adam's rib so he cannot leave his rib away and she cannot leave her source so they match and they complete one another do not think for a second that without a spouse that your life is complete never your life is not complete without a spouse and we will get to this insha allah so allah azzawajal among his signs that he created for us wives from among ourselves that you may find repose in them in them in your spouse you will find this tranquility this calmness what did the prophet sallallaahu said let me do when he first saw gibreel peace be upon him he ran to hadiza what did Hadiya say why are you late why didn't you bring the groceries did she say this look at that wise wife your Allah if I could have a wife that seriously among the men South Louisville are Salem says a lot of them were complete and perfect among the women only four among them khadija bint khuwaylid why because she is the wisest the kindest the most loving to the extent that the prophet alayhi salatu was-salam wherever he remembered her he could not get hold of himself one day what's your name the sister of Hadiya no no the sister of Khadija her name is it will come in sha Allah Sheikh hallo her name is Hanna Beth Whelan and she asked permission to enter so the prophet hurt you no they did not have Bell what is the Islamic way of requesting to enter a Salaam alaikum may I come in so he heard the neck that the voice and he said Allah whom mahalo which reminded him of Khadijah so he mentioned the name of khadija because she was her sister she was admitted and the Prophet gave her food gave her Jerry things to honor a guest aisha it was in her night she said prophet of allah why every time you mention honey honey is dead almost ten years now yet the Prophet remembers her and aisha is jealous of a dead woman look at the jealousy of women are we will get to this inshallah and then I will show you my high heels and then the Prophet as I said what why do you remember a woman who is so old that her teeth fell and all what you can see is the the gum the red gum when she laughs look at the description it's not very beautiful description but accurate the Prophet sallallaahu seldom gets angry because she said Allah has substituted you with someone much better than her meaning her because she was a vergence you young she was extremely beautiful so she is boasting about it the profit cut outraged got really angry he said by Allah I was not substituted better than her Allah gave me children from her and he deprived them from you she took me in when people kicked me out she gave me her money when people deprived me of her money she gave me comfort when people were attacking me by Allah Allah did not substitute me better than her look at this love that the Prophet had an assassin for Khadija as I said by Allah prophet of Allah I will never mention her in a negative way again so"
