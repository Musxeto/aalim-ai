  "title": "Touching women | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "the Prophet says Alice Islam it is better or it is best for a person to be stabbed in his head with a needle made of iron rather than to touch a woman that is not permissible for him so always keep this in mind if you feel embarrassed if you feel shy not to shake hands remember what's what awaits you on the day of judgement in hell and the more you try to not get involved in mixed gatherings or meetings the better you will find it and sha Allah and easier for you to avoid such situations"
