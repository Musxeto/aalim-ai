مُّبِينًا بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم الحمد لله رب العالمين وصلى الله وسلم وبرك على المبعوث رحمة للعالمين نبينا محمد وعلى آله وصحبه أجمعين أما بعد dear brothers and sisters in islam السلام عليكم ورحمة الله وبركاته one of the ways our prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام used to deal with those who make mistakes and errors and would sin is to show compassion and lots of us fail miserably in this field how is it possible that someone is making a sin someone who is making an innovation and we're good in this we're good in showing our hatred our resentment out of our arrogance to people who make mistakes yes it is a mistake it's an error the guy is sinful but this doesn't mean you have to squash him it doesn't mean you have to step on him like a cockroach he's still a human being we fail miserably in this field and lots of us honor the sunnah but satan makes us exaggerate by going overboard and resenting hating trying to discredit trying to tarnish the reputation of anyone who doesn't follow our way so either it's my way or the highway and this was not the way of the prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام the one who was sent as a mercy to mankind صلى الله عليه وسلم his way was to be compassionate to be kind to be tolerant to be understanding yet while doing so he draws the line what is right is right and what is wrong is wrong it was reported that a man by the name of abdullah and this companion of the prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام was a practical joker if we can say this about him he used to make the prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام laugh he had a sense of humor and the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم would laugh at the things he says and does this man this companion may allah be pleased with him had a huge deficiency and his deficiency was he sort of was an alcoholic he was addicted to drinking wine and so many times he was brought up to the prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام intoxicated and the prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام would flog him the prescribed punishment for drinking or consuming intoxicants and this had repeated many times it's not a single time one day he was brought forward and the prophet صلى الله عليه وسلم convicted him and sentenced him to be flogged this is allah's law the guy makes me laugh but it doesn't mean that i should cut him some slack or that i should pardon him in some of his sins sins are sins these are prescribed punishments remember the hadith of usama ibn zaid the prophet was angered when he interceded and he said it the prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام if fatima my own daughter were to steal i would have cut off her hand as this is the prescribed punishment no one is above the law so the prophet sentenced him عليه الصلاة والسلام as he was being flogged one of the men one of the companions had enough because he saw that he was brought so many times so he started cursing him may allah curse you shame on you what you're doing is this and that so the prophet said صلى الله عليه وسلم do not curse him prophet of allah is committing a major sin he's wasted he committed a felony he committed a crime and he is one of your companions the least we could do is do this to him shame him curse him the prophet said do not curse him for i do not know other than he loves allah and his messenger عليه الصلاة والسلام what kind of fairness and justice is this look at the balance in our eyes someone who does a sin whether major or minor he's discredited should be disgraced should be looked down upon should be totally ignored and neglected as if he's not a muslim the prophet said عليه الصلاة والسلام i know nothing more than he loves allah and the prophet عليه الصلاة والسلام and in another narration the prophet said do not assist satan against your brother when you're collaborating against him satan would come and whisper in his ears what do you want with islam look at the muslims and how they're treating you they don't deserve you being part of them and this what happens when you go against the sunnah and the prophet said to them don't say this rather say oh allah forgive him oh allah have mercy upon him what do we learn from this beautiful hadith we learn that though he is a sinner though he had made a mistake the origin of islam is still in his heart he's still our brother he is still a muslim and this should always be at the back of our minds sinners people of mistakes and errors did not leave the fold of islam we must not side by satan in attacking him leaving him nowhere other than to go against islam against islam full throttle and full power sometimes on social media and this happens a lot from the ignorance those who are imbeciles have no knowledge in islam yet the social media platforms give them a stage to voice their own whims and desires and opinions though they should be silenced because they have no knowledge we see so many of these hooligans come and criticize celebrities actors actresses i do fully agree this is a public sin this is sinful this is haram sometimes it's a very major sin sometimes it's not but just because a person is a celebrity does not give you the right to speak ill about them in such a fashion that you're siding with satan against your brother oh this so and so celebrity did such and such heinous sins i agree they are heinous sins but why are you highlighting it why are you attacking this individual is he not muslim well i'm doubtful he married a hindu he said his children can choose any religion they want he did this he did that he's an ignorant imbecile like you he needs teaching not public shaming you are driving him to the hindus or to the christians or to the jews the prophet said it about a person who was a drunkard do not assist satan against your brother and these ignorant hooligans are doing the same it's every generation every time every error every era they keep on attacking those who make mistakes as if they have no sins or mistakes of their own which is definitely not true but subhanallah ignorance does this to people and especially when you give them a platform where they can voice whatever goes in their minds this is what happens this is the way of the prophet alaihissalatu wassalam dealing with people who make mistakes make mistakes not to assist shaitan against our own brothers and sisters number 12 asking the person to stop doing the wrong action so when you see someone doing something wrong you ask him to stop very simple and the ways varies the ways vary sometimes it's public sometimes it's private sometimes it's indirect sometimes you have to improvise but the main point is what's wrong what is a mistake and what's sinful has to stop it should not be tolerated and to continue we have to stop it one way or the other if this is possible so that such a mistake would not continue to exist or something worse could replace it the prophet alaihissalatu wassalam once heard a companion swearing by his father and this happens a lot in the arab world they swear by the prophet they say or they say they swear with their father's head father's life by my father's life they say all of this is shirk because we as muslims are not allowed to take an oath except by allah's names and attributes so the prophet when he heard this alaihissalatu wassalam he said mah which means stop so the prophet stopped it then the prophet explained why and he said he who swears with other than allah's name he has committed shirk he has committed shirk so that's it the prophet told us how to stop the error and the mistake why and he replaced it with what is good that is if you want to swear swear by allah's name also in the hadith we mentioned earlier in a previous episode Abdullah ibn Busr may allah be pleased with him is telling us about a man who came on friday crossing the people's necks and shoulders crossing the rows trying to get to the front row and the prophet said to him sit you have harmed and annoyed the muslims so the prophet interrupted his khutbah he could have continued but no this mistake has to stop likewise ibn umar may allah be pleased with him says a man burped in the presence of the prophet alaihissalatu wassalam and lots of the people laugh when people burp and think it is indecent but it's funny and sometimes it's even worse when someone passes wind when someone's fart and they laugh and this is totally haram and sinful in islam but in terms of burping the prophet heard this and rebuked the one who did it loudly and publicly without any shame and he said to him refrain from burping as it annoys us for the longer people are with full stomach in this dunya they will be the longest people starving on the day of judgment and this is also scary because it tells us that we shouldn't always fill our stomachs totally because that would mean that we're indulging in the permissible things halal things and exaggerating in it to the extent that we are burping we need something to digest whatever is in our stomachs and this shows that we are the people of the dunya and this is not the way of the way of the righteous people also the 13th point or strategy of how the prophet used to deal with mistakes alaihissalatu wassalam explaining to the person who's making a mistake how to put things in perspective so yes i could always say this is wrong in addition i have to explain how to make things right it's not sufficient to say no don't do this this is wrong i have to give a substitute i have to direct the person that this is wrong you should do this in order to make it right so sometimes the prophet salallahu alaihi wasalam would try to bring notice to the person making that error indirectly or to point out to him if he doesn't understand then he may say that in a way that would make him correct himself the prophet salallahu alaihi wasalam was once asked for intercession for one of the companions or one of the enemies of islam that is whom the prophet salallahu alaihi wasalam ordered the muslims to kill and in the conquest of mecca he came with authority and othman interceded that the prophet would spare him though he did heinous things against the muslims and the muslim women and said bad and awful things about the prophet he was a kafir so the prophet did not comment and othman may allah be pleased with him kept on interceding interceding until the prophet forgave him when the man left the prophet said to his companions why wouldn't you go and kill the man and the companion said well you could have winked to us you could have pointed with your eye or gave us a sign and the prophet said a prophet does not do such things it's issues of deceit this man was an enemy of islam i did not comment when othman interceded because i was expecting you to do something but when you did not do anything and othman asked me i gave him clemency and forgave the man also part of asking the person to rectify his mistake in trying to explain that to him is to ask that individual to do something again hoping that he would correct it by himself when the man came to the prophet while the prophet was in the masjid and he prayed two rakahs and the prophet was noticing him without the man being aware of that when he came to the prophet and gave salam the prophet said go and pray again because he did not pray he did not pray so the man went and prayed again in the same fashion and came back and gave salam for the second time the prophet said go and pray again for you have not prayed the prophet is hoping that the man would figure out what was wrong in his prayer not do the same mistake over and over again third time the man prays and comes back and gives salam and the prophet said to him go and pray you haven't prayed the man raised the white flag i surrender i do not know how to pray other than what you had seen me do oh prophet of allah here the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam tells him what to do that you should pray in with tranquility and give each pillar its right whether it's ruku or standing or sujood or sitting between the two sujoods so here the prophet again corrected the man so that they people would try and avoid that by asking him to do it over and over and over again so that he would fix things in another incident if the mistake has already taken place and the prophet came to know about it alayhis salatu wasalam what to do if it can be retracted and rectified let's go for it the prophet once alayhis salatu wasalam was addressing the muslims was addressing the muslims it is not permissible for a woman who believes in allah and the day of judgment to travel without the company of a male mahram a man stood up and said oh prophet of allah my name was drafted for jihad for expedition so and so and my wife had set off for hajj so now i'm in a dilemma what to do now you're telling us it's not permissible for a woman who believes in allah and the day of judgment to travel without a mahram i didn't know that but my name was drafted the prophet said alayhis salatu wasalam said to this man go and catch up with your wife go and perform hajj with your wife leave everything which indicates that it can be rectified women must not travel without a mahram either for hajj or umrah or studies or visiting relatives or going back home a woman must not travel full stop this was narrated by bukhari and muslim this is the teachings of the prophet alayhis salatu wasalam now you dare and come and say well scholar so and so said otherwise that's your problem let's hope that you are with that scholar in the day of judgment i personally prefer to be with the prophet alayhis salatu wasalam and if you can rectify the error or the mistake you must do this as in the situation where a man came to the prophet alayhis salatu wasalam and said oh prophet of allah i have come to pledge allegiance to you and to do hijrah but i left my parents crying behind and another narration he came for jihad to fight alongside the prophet alayhis salatu wasalam but he left his parents crying the prophet said to him go back to them and make them laugh as you had made them cry the parents have a huge status in our lives yet many muslims neglect this and have a narrow sight to what they see we also alhamdulillah we have expiations offering kaffarah for the mistakes so sometimes we may fall into a mistake on an error or do a sin but allah does not block our way for redemption rather allah gives us expiations to offer in order to wipe off such mistakes or sins such as expiation when i break my oath expiation when i do zihar to my wife or when i kill someone by mistake or when someone has intimacy with his wife during the daytime of ramadan and so on all of these expiations in sharia to show and illustrate that allah azawajal is most forgiving most merciful most compassionate in that there is a way out in islam to every mistake we make but we must not block the way in front of sinners and those who fall in such errors and mistakes we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we'll be right back you"
