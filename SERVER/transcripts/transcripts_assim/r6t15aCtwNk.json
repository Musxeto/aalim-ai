  "transcript": "foreign and he said to the muslims he came out to a suffer what is a sofa a suffer is a place at the back of the masjid of medina where it is made and prepared for the poor people of musl of the muslims who don't have accommodation don't have family so they live and stay and eat and sleep at the back of the masjid and they're entirely stone broke so the prophet came to them salatu and gave them a question as usual to raise their attention and he said to them who was among you would like to go to the valley of bhutan or to al-aqir these are two adjacent valleys to medina where they used to sell camels and buy two camels or acquire or get or possess two camels without doing any type of burden or sin nor severing any kinship so there's no liability on you so how you how about getting two of these beautiful camels with big humps and and meat and they're very presentable so all the companions said oh prophets of allah we definitely love to get this it's like someone coming to you and saying how about if i give you uh um two german luxury cars or sports cars everybody says whoa sure so the prophet said allah corrected their ways and means of weighing things he said that for you to go to the masjid and learn or recite two verses of the quran that would be better for you than acquiring two beautiful healthy expensive camels and three verses better than three camels and four better than four and so on and this is an eye opener to how cheap this life is what draws our attent attention most a beautiful mansion beautiful cars toys for boys a charming decent beautiful woman a big hefty fat bank account power authority all of this the prophet alaihi salatusam tells us to ignore and opens our eyes to the real valuable things which the vast majority of muslims have neglected and that is learning the book of allah it's so miraculous it's so beautiful it is so educating it fills your heart with compassion with love with mercy with trust yet the muslims have neglected it big time and they have looked for guidance elsewhere and this is why the prophet sallallahu salaam is showing us what to do so again the beauty of remembering allah the beauty of memorizing and studying the book of allah which is the greatest book that muslims can ever abide by and hold on to and this is the word of allah the almighty azzawajal now the following three hadiths are within the same context so the first one he was whoever sits in a gathering and does not remember allah azzawajal and whoever lies down and he does not remember allah azzawajal this would be a form of a reduction upon him and he would be losing something as the prophet alaihis allah said that it's a loss the second hadith allah that no people would sit and gather and fail to remember allah azzawajal then this and and they also failed to offer salutation upon the prophet hassan which is also part of remembering allah so not remembering allah and not being able to offer salutation upon the prophet salam which means that they did not talk about anything beneficial rather only worthy things this would be a loss upon them if allah wills it then he would punish them and if he wills it he would forgive them it's in allah's hand the almighty and the third hadith what allah saw to assalam says that uh whoever a people rise from a gathering in which they fail to remember allah they rise as if they had risen from the corpse of a mule a donkey and incurring upon themselves grief whoa all of this shows you that remembering allah azza is not limited to a particular thing rather it's 24 7 when you sit on your own when you lie of course on your own when you are in a gathering when you are among the people with you and you don't remember allah this is loss and this is as if you were gathering on a dead corpse of a mule stinking no one's going to eat it flies and insects and bacteria and viruses this is all because you forgot or you intentionally neglected to remember allah how do then we remember allah it's very simple you're sitting in a gathering you say the weather is cold subhanallah i remember an incident in in the battle of the trench when it was so cold and the prophet called hudei family a man this story by itself is remembering allah when you mention a hadith guys the prophet said islam deeds are by intention the prophet said sallallahu alaihi it's very easy but we do not succeed in incorporating it in our lives because we are distant we are far away from allah from the quran from the sunnah and for from wanting to gather people and call them closer to this beautiful religion until we meet next time i leave foreign [Music]"
