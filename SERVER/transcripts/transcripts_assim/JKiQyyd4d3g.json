  "transcript": "Umm Amina from the Emirates. Assalamu Alaikum. Salamu Rahmatullah. So I used to work for a company and part of the team activity is we would go out to a restaurant once a month. And most of the restaurant I would go to, my teammates would be eating pork and stuff like that. So I became very uncomfortable with it and I told my manager that I wouldn't be able to go with them anymore. So they compromised and said, okay, we'll go to a live restaurant sometime and go to a mainstream restaurant. But every time we go to a live restaurant, some of my team members, they don't like the food, they wouldn't go. And when they go to a mainstream restaurant, I wouldn't go. So my manager thought I'm not a team member, so they were very uncomfortable with it. But anyway, when the COVID started, I was one of the team that was hired. But before that, I spoke to one of the Imams in the country that I was in. And he said that, you know, sometimes we need to compromise a little bit that it's not alcohol. Because it's pork, you can sit at the same table and things like that. But anyway, they fired me at the time. So I'm looking back now, was I extreme with my decision? Did I do the right thing for not joining them? Or I should have? First of all, you must not ask people who are not knowledgeable. This Imam who told you that you can share the table with people who are eating pork is definitely ignorant. You cannot share the table with someone who is doing haram. And you're watching it and noticing it and still being there with them. This is totally prohibited. Secondly, you cannot share the table with the opposite gender. A business lunch or a business dinner with men and you're a woman. This is not permissible for you to attend. If they are your cousins, male cousins, it's haram for you to attend. Let alone a business lunch or dinner. Or a celebration once a month. So, no, you're not extremist. You have to segregate yourself from being with the opposite gender because this defies the purpose of hijab. And it goes against Islam."
