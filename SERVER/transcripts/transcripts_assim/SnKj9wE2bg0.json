  "title": "When Muslim men don't look at women, is this degrading them or respecting them | Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "why don't you have free mixing why do you degrade women and not look at them well I'm not degrading them I'm respecting them when I do not look at someone who has a high status in Islam when I do not look at a ruler or a CEO out of respect when I do not look eye to eye with my father because I respect him I'm not degrading him and this is what we're supposed to do in Islam to respect unlike what's happening with those who do not abide by the Islamic rulings so you really have to be proud of a religion and remain steadfast and not care about what people say if it's going to affect the way I practice my Islam and I hope this answers your question you"
