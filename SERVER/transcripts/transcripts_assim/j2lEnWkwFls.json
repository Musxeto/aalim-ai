me Dean a man dear brothers and sisters in Islam assalamu alaikum warahmatullahi wa barakato and welcome to this new episode of women around the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam today we will talk about two of the prophet's daughters may allah be pleased with them they are the second and the third in order in terms of age as we know zeyneb was the eldest and we talked about her in a previous episode she was the wife of a bellossom the revere then there was Roy I followed by Uncle Tom and the last of the prophets daughters salallahu alayhi wa sallam was fatima so today we are to speak be in la sol about Roja and uncle soon Rokia the daughter of Muhammad sallallaahu are you seldom her mother was Khadija been to hue lit so she had the best lineage ever she's the daughter of the messenger and the Frog prophet of Allah Azza WA JAL she was born about when the Prophet was 33 years of age so when he became a prophet I didn't saw some she was 7 years of age that's a young age however she accepted Islam at that young age with the rest of her sisters alongside their mother and she was a girl a young girl and a woman who was sought after because her father was Muhammad bin Abdullah he was the trustworthy the honest and the truthful everybody knew him and acknowledged this her mother was Hadiya the rich an honorable woman of Quraysh so at an early age rakia and her younger sister uncle Tim who was a year younger than her we're both married to the cousins of their father rota and Rutina and they were the sons of Abu Lahab the uncle of the prophet alayhi salat wa salam their mother was Jamila the daughter of her the sister of Abu Sufian even her and aunt of the halifa amirul mumineen now we even abyss of Yemen so the whole community was interlinked these two boys married these two sisters but when the prophet alayhi salatu salam became a messenger and announced it as we know the Prophet took the first three years of the Berthe in calling people in secrecy he did not announce it after three years allah azzawajal revealed to him to announce the devil to everybody so he announced it he called the people of Mecca the dignitaries everybody and gave them the announcement to worship allah azzawajal and to abandon their idols the first one to reject and stand in his way was his own uncle Abu Lahab he was so furious so against Islam and Dawa after being one of the biggest supporters and people who loved Muhammad as an individual once the Prophet as salaam declared islam and called them to it he became a fierce enemy of Islam he tried everything in his possession to tarnish his reputation and to deter people from following or even listening to him until allah azza wajal revealed a surah condemning him cursing him sentencing him to hellfire allah says in the quran what translates to may the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined and ruined is he his wealth will not avail him or that which he gained he will enter to burn in a fire of blazing flame and his wife as well the carrier of firewood around her neck is a rope of twisted fiber this surah is known as Surat we'll method it's a full chapter dedicated to Abu Lahab and his wife condemning them to hellfire some scholars said that this surah was a clear evidence of the truth of Islam of the Quran of Muhammad sallallahu alaihi wasallam this surah was revealed and it could have been easy for Abu Lahab to play a game and say ok this surah says that I will be I'll burn in hell well I embrace Islam and to pretend that he embraces embraced Islam and everybody would know that Quran is not true because it stated something and it was false but he didn't which indicates that was that was a prophecy and it was a challenge so when this surah was revealed Abu Lahab went to his sons along with his wife and said to them I will not speak to you I will not have anything to do with you unless you divorce Muhammad's daughters so the two boys immediately divorced the daughters of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam which was something that Allah wanted to honor our prophet ELISA saram by detaching from such people and Allah wanted to increase the humiliation of Abu Lahab and his children because of their cover and their disbelief by the way Ramaiah was 10 years of age when she was married to her cousin which again not one not two so many women of Quraysh we're given in marriage at a very early age Amina the mother of the Prophet Allah so Sam was married when she was 13 so this was the norm that girls got married at a very early age because they blossomed physically and they were capable of catering for the needs of their husbands when she was divorced there was earth man ignore an earth man was a young man a rich man a man who came from a very powerful tribe he had kinship to defend him and this is what mattered at the times your kinship your family your tribe they can defend you they can stand with you they can support you and if you had money alongside that you've got it made and if you were young and handsome then every woman would look to have an opportunity to marry you earth man was among the very first to accept Islam and these are one of the blessings and favours of Abu Bakr may Allah be pleased with him who managed to call so many people youngsters and influencers in a very short period of time the moment the words of truth touched his heart and his hearing he accepted Islam being who he was he proposed to the prophet alayhi salat wa sallam so that he would strengthen the bond with the messenger of allah azza wa jal and the profit today's awesome could not refuse such an honorable man a man who came among the first to accept Islam so he went and discussed it with his daughter aya who felt happy and joyful that allah azza wajal replaced her with such an honorable man instead of that thing that was married to her and divorced her without any wrongdoing from her side so she accepted and they got married and all historians say islam did not see a true love story similar to the story of earth man and his wife rupiah though he was rich and powerful his people did not like him reverting to Islam nor that he got married to their enemy enemy's daughter so they started causing trouble to him and this is when the prophet alayhi salatu salam ordered him among a handful of men to migrate to Abyssinia and the Prophet told him to take his wife with him either his salat or sinner so they set off on the journey which was to the unknown a land they don't speak the language of and they have to cross the sea which they have never sailed on before and she was pregnant so they set off and traveled migrated she gave birth to his first born son Abdullah and earth man was known to be nicknamed as Abu Abdullah and they stayed in Abyssinia until Allah willed that they travel back again and they migrated again to Medina so they had two migrations on their CV and that was a great honor at the time to migrate to Abyssinia and to Medina at the same time when they went to Medina subhanAllah a lot of people died in Medina and unfortunately R'lyeh was one of them she felt sick and in the second year of hijra which means a year in few months after they reached Medina she got really sick and it was the time for the Battle of better when the Prophet Isis I'm told the Companions to go along with him to try to attack and seize a caravan filled with wealth and money that belonged to the people of Quraysh so earth man asked the prophet alayhi salatu salam if he could join him but he told him about his wife wrote a so the Prophet Isis I told him that you have to stay with rupiah try to nurse her try to take care of her and I will save your share from the battle as if you were participating and this shows you how great Roja was in the heart of her father that he prevented this man from joining the army in order to take care of her and it's also a lesson for us to learn to learn the importance of our spouses of taking care of them of showing them affection and love especially at times of need so many men yes I know it's their nature not to express their feelings but they have no excuse not to give their spouses their wives they needed care especially when they are in need for that she serves you and your children and takes care of the house and cooks every single meal for you and when she is in need for help or assistance you simply look the other way this is not how men real men behave so he stayed behind and he tried his level best but fate was quicker than his attempts only for her to die before the coming back of the Prophet Isis and from better and she died at the age of 22 on the second year of hijra and she was buried in Alberta era now raw pea had a second sister who was one year younger than her and this sister was uncle - uncle Foom at the time was about 21 or 20 years of age after being divorced from her cousin she did not get married now she also faced the calamity of divorce at an early age and this by itself was a trauma for any woman she migrated with her siblings to Medina lived her life in Medina of course after all the years she spent in the house of the Prophet as Salam in Mecca and also in Medina on the third year of hijra the Prophet I saw some noticed that earth man had sadness in his face and when he asked him and this narration is mentioned in the books of serie the chain of narrators may not be authentic but it is a famous story that when it comes to serie we're not that specific in authenticating all the narrations so he asked him what is it so earth man says this calamity that had struck me the daughter of the messenger of allah died while being married to me and with me and my back is broken the chain the link between me and you our prophet of allah of being an in-law was severed and cut so the prophet said to him erase all of some or earth man this is gibreel telling me that Allah is ordering me to give you an marriage uncle tomb on the same dowry you gave to Roja on the condition that you treat her as well as you had treated Rokia and oh my gosh says the Prophet said RA salat wa salam I did not give birth man uncle tomb except through a revelation from the heavens meaning from allah azza wajal so he married her and he lived with Uncle Tom for six years and they did not have any children she died in the ninth year of hijra this is why some historians give earth man the nickname of the no Rohini meaning the one with the two lights as no one had ever married two daughters of a prophet or of a messenger and he was the only one who managed to do that so those who praised Adi may Allah be pleased with him for marrying the daughter of the prophet of islam which is fatima should praise at man double that because he married two daughters of the Prophet Elisha she died on the ninth year of hijra and the Prophet was reported to say had I had a third daughter I would given her to him and it shows the amount of love and respect the Prophet ideas of some had turf man in Nora fan may Allah be pleased with him may Allah be pleased with rakia may Allah be pleased with him and all the companions of the prophet alayhi salaatu wa salaam had Allahu Alem when is between me didn't he Aslam o sallallahu sallim wa barik ala nabina muhammad why he was I be here to me"
