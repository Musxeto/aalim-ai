  "transcript": "i said you know teenagers usually they're not interested in these kind of things how come you people are they said uh well when i was uh growing up the uh domesticated islamic center double they had a basketball court as part of the activity the the center and uh and we just go down there and uh shoot ball and then when it's time for prayer you know they call us and so their hearts became accommodated to the masjid and they associated them with good times this is the way to treat the youth i know masjid's where people come where i come from in saudi arabia with coming you get guys you know young traps coming on coming into the message with ponytail and with trousers you know low waist and you know what's happening and they come into prayer to pray and you find people from inside the mosque saying what are you doing here why are you dressed like this get out there's probably come old people this is so frustrating because the guy is coming to pray to allah it's not your house it's not my house so let him pray let him feel at home and three four months down the road tell him it's proper to have a dress code like the muslims in a nice way but to turn him off in this manner and this this dublin mosque is a clear example of how you can put the seed of the love of islam in the hearts of the youth"
