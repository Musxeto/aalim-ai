  "transcript": "hear from brother solo he's asking about Salah teeth missed in the past says due to him not been very good in regard to coming into Islam and understanding some of the prerequisites of being a Muslim he says after learning and I'm finding out that he actually should have been praying all his life he says what I do about this prayer shake do I have to make them all up and if I do have to make up how do I go about doing the business well that's very good of him to ask because this shows that he's interested in seriously repenting to Allah so John and I give him the glad tiding that Alonzo JAL had accepted inshallah and we'll accept his repentance first of all the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us that if one of you over sleeps or forgets a prayer he should pray it the minute he remembers it there is no compensation for that except praying it the minute he remembers it or he wakes up having said that scholars took the verdict from this hadith and gave the ruling that anyone who misses a prayer deliberately until the following prayer comes then he cannot and he may may not and he must not make a vow for it or pray it after the time was over why because the Prophet stated two reasons if you oversleep or if you forget which means that on both of them are not within your intention it's not something that you can do intentionally you overslept not my mistake or you forgot analogical doesn't burden us for forgetting it means that if someone skips prayer intentionally that he has no excuse there is no expiration for it therefore those who missed prayers in the past and now they've repented you cannot and you must not and you should not we pray these prayers that you've missed because you did not that intentionally what you can do is ask Allah Allah for forgiveness and you can offer voluntary prayer night prayer Baha prayer maintain observing the Sunnah narrative which are the twelve records throughout the day and night that are preferred highly preferred and recommended sunnah prayers attached to the five obligatory prayers once you do this inshallah this would compensate to the flesh okay"
