  "title": "Giving charity in front of a camera without their permission? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "uh safat from the us so the question is um so i've seen many people you know um take a shoot the video of people who um sit on the side of the road right in any countries let's say bangladesh and pakistan right and um like to the poor people so sometimes they take a full video shoot of them well like without um letting them know so is that a permissible in islam like um to take a video of them like let's say on the um put a bag of food or anything okay i will answer i will answer inshallah so sifat's question is crystal clear there are many video clips circulating about acts of charity people feeding the poor on the streets homeless or the hungry or some orphans or some refugees without taking their prior permission and sometimes without their knowledge so is this permissible the answer is no this is a form of backbiting if i were homeless or poor and someone took such a footage of me and circulated it i wouldn't be happy i would object because this is degrading and humiliating and adding insult to injury but if such people are doing it to encourage others so they go to the poor and they request their permission to take such a footage so that they would encourage others to be kind and charitable to other poor people or homeless people and they do agree to that then this is permissible providing there are no women being filmed yet i personally don't like this it may open a door for showing off i'd be more than happy to have my picture all over the world showing me to be the kind person feeding the orphans and giving money to the poor and giving a shelter to the homeless etc it makes me proud and this is one of the ways of showing off and boasting about your good deeds and at the same time if even if the poor give you their permission now in two three years if they're better financially they wouldn't like people seeing that of them and allah azza knows best you"
