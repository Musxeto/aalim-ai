  "transcript": "Khadija from Morocco Khadija Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Sheikh So my question is, in one of your videos you said that in order to know if going from point A to point B is traveling, we should ask the common people So I asked the common people in my small city and most of them said they don't consider it as traveling because it's just a half an hour ride But two of my friends actually said it may be considered traveling so I'm really confused now and I don't know if I should go to that city or not No need to be confused Half an hour is not a traveling distance if it's by car I live in Jeddah and Mecca is about an hour and ten minutes drive And we tell women that they can travel from Jeddah to Mecca without a problem because it's almost a suburb nowadays of Mecca So they go and pray in the Haram, Maghreb and Isha and come back By train it's like 25 minutes So it's very close and there is no need for Mahram So in your case, half an hour ride is not a traveling distance inshallah You"
