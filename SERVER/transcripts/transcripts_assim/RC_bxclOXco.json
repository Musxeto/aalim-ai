  "transcript": "his second question was about the issue of the period between adhan and Parma of MRIB we know that the time of Maghreb is very short and this is why in the Shafi manner for example it says that you have to only leave time to pray 2 rakaats which means that it's a couple of minutes max 5 minutes some messages give 10 minutes here in Saudi Arabia sometimes they give 10 minutes 12 minutes and maybe longer so is there anything from the Sunnah no the only thing from the Sunnah is that the Prophet said alehissalaam three times between the two events meaning of motherland there then and their Karma Obama is called also a tan so between the two advanced prayer there is two rakahs voluntary between every two advanced prayer and then in the third time he said between every to advance a prayer to whomever wishes so it's not mandatory it is highly recommended and this is general not emphatic but general voluntary prayers so the scholars looked at this hadith and said hmm then this is the buffer zone between the Adhan and their comma of mothering you should leave the sufficient time to offer two rakahs now I can offer two Rakas in two minutes others may require half an hour so one takes the average and this is depending on the custom and the country and there is no reason to fight over it so if I go to a Hanafy dominated country and they give the advance and immediately after a minute or a half they give the Akama there's no problem the prayer is legit correct correct and if I go to another country and they give like ten minutes there is no problem this is how they are accustomed to and inshallah this is permissible"
