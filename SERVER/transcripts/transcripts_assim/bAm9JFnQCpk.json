  "transcript": "Emma from the UK she I realized that I should not study abroad in a mixed University or travel without a mam as I am now so upon telling my Muslim parents they're not letting me return home to their Muslim country without a diploma abroad nor accepting to study in their residing Muslim country so if my efforts fail of convincing them what should I do um should I trust on Allah book a plane ticket and maybe show it their door I'm a mine in the sight of Allah subh T and all praises to Him and those he grants knowledge too unfortunately a lot of our daughters are stuck between a rock and a hard place especially when their parents are ignorant and not practicing Islam and a lot of our parents unfortunately fit this description they know of Islam only what is cultural so Simon Says do this do that what is the evidence from the Quran or from the Sunnah they don't care and they don't comply and they force their children to do things that go against Islam so Emma's question is a typical example now she traveled to a foreign cafir country unattended without a Maham and attending school in a mixed environment and she is feeling the Heat and the pressure of doing these Haram things now she wants to go back her parents refuse and the refusal is in many cases due to our hesitation and being reluctant and weak when we as children approach our parents in regards of issues of religion we do this usually in a soft voice in the sense that in a weak fashion showing hesitation this is when the parents put their foot down and insist without any room for discussion no you cannot marry this woman no you cannot work in that uh a job and the boy comes and says sh what should I do I said it's your mistake if you're financially independent and you have a separate house and you have your own income don't say Mom I think I may want I love to do this no no no tell them I'm Maring this woman full stop if you ask them for their opinion they will find hundred of faults in her she's short she's dark her family is this she's uneducated she doesn't have a job and you'll never ever marry someone you want likewise if you ask them about what you want to study or what want to work but if you put your foot down without any hesitation and tell them that this is what I want they'll not be happy but they'll swallow it and accept it so when you go go and talk to your parents say Dad Mom I am working I am uh struggling so many men I'm being uh uh flirted upon I am finding it difficult there's so much FNA I fear for falling for Haram I have to travel I have to do this they would say no no no it's okay so be be strong two more years and you'll you'll manage they don't think of the consequences if you go back to them pregnant it would would be a catastrophe but they come to me and say she got pregnant what should we do she did not get married said who sent her in the first place she we didn't think it's going to reach that stage well now you know so you have to put your foot down and be firm and confirm to them that I'm not going to do this this is one option second option is to apply or or to to study wearing your full and segregate yourself from mixing with the opposite gender and if it's safe for you to stay there and you keep your distance and you don't allow anyone from the opposite gender to speak to you or you don't approach them inshallah yeah this is a better and not a better it's an acceptable solution with your circumstances third option is to change from working offline into online so do your studies online if you can and do it without going and mixing and staying home this would be inshallah an acceptable solution and if nothing works you simply book a ticket fail your exams and go back home"
