  "transcript": "foreign now from Nordic we know that gold pure gold is impermissible for men correct correct so so now I want to ask are we allowed to use what about rose gold it's a form of gold it's pure gold but it's mixed with copper so it's an alloy now we know wearing gold is impermissible but can we use the rose gold in using it buying in pens using um certain pieces certain accessories for example buying in pens for example because they sell rose gold pens so am I allowed to use the rose gold stuff knowing it's mixed with pure gold or copper I wanted to ask because would it change the state of the pure gold to a different form and not actually pure gold since it's mixed with something else to my knowledge pure gold is not available except in bars or in like 99.99 grams of blocks of gold that cannot be molded into a key chain or a pen or the likes because it's too pure it has to be mixed with copper so that it can be molded and used in other cases therefore the answer is no rose gold is Haram because it's gold mixed with other ingredients and it is widely used in all aspects cufflings and pens and key holders and watches and all of this is Haram"
