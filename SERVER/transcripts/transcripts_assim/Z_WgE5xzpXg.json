  "transcript": "the first question I have uh in an email from Muhammad M he says that an aist only Muslim by name posted on Facebook which can be translated to the following what this  did or has done to Muhammad sallahu alaihi wasallam I do not have a headache with it I'm just worried about the possibility that uh uh YouTube might be turned off because of the film that this did so he's asking what should we respond to this Muslim or so-called Muslim will we be uh uh obligated to cut off the relationships with him or not first of all anyone who says such a thing this act of his and these words are words of kufur are words of blasphemy yet we do not render and label that person as a cfir until we are sure that the conditions are fulfilled and that there are no oblig no uh uh uh obstacles present to prevent us from labeling him as such and this is a very critical uh issue first of all those who have this concept and conviction that a film goes and and comes it's okay to say whatever you want about the prophet Alam these people are not Muslim because part of the Islam is to honor and to love and respect the prophet sallallahu alaih wasallam however we do not label people as individuals so when I say that the general concept that whoever has this conviction is a cafir we don't say that Ali or Ahmed or John or whatever is cfir until we fulfill the conditions that he knows it he did it intentionally Etc and that there are no obstacles present"
