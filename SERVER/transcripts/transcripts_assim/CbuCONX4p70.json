  "transcript": "T from the UK. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullah. Sheikh I'm aware that if a person helps another so another Muslim commit a sin part of their tawbah is to go to that person and say brother I helped you sin make tawbah fear Allah that's haram. When it comes to a non-Muslim a lot of non-Muslims if you advise them if you if a Muslim's helped a non-Muslim sin and you advise them a lot of the times they don't they they they look and say well that's your religion that's you I don't believe it's a sin um so I wanted to know what to do for Muslims helped non-Muslims sin because um I live here in the UK and a lot of people that I know personally even the non-Muslims I find it very hard to believe that they've not come across the message of Islam in some way whether it be at work being on the airplane next to someone but yeah a lot of them uh they um they if you give if you tell them you know don't do that that's a sin in my religion if they haven't taken the shahada then a lot of them ain't gonna care so what to do in this situation um because yeah first of all which is that first of all as a Muslim it is totally prohibited to assist others on sin what you're saying is different to assisting what you're saying is if you see someone doing a sin you want to forbid them from such evil advice and this is different than assisting someone on sin such as someone smoking a fag and you give him a light this is assisting him so if this is the case no this is haram and you will share the same sin with him if he asks you where is the closest um pub I fancy a pint of lager if you tell him well it's just right the corner this is assisting but if you see someone coming out from the pub you're not obliged to go and say to them or a john this is bad it's haram this is nonsense he's a kafir so enjoining what is righteous and virtuous and forbidden what's evil and vice is an obligation upon each Muslim according to their knowledge and their ability and the circumstances and situation so first is to use your hand and force as in the case with your subordinates and your children you have the ability to change it by hand if not possible like the vast majority of people then with rhetoric give them advice diplomatically providing that the advice would pay off if not possible then you have to enjoy it and forbid it with your heart by resenting the bad things they're doing and hoping that they do good things and Allah knows best"
