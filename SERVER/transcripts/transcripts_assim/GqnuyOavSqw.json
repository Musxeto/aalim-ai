  "transcript": "she says can we bike Quran with illustrations for kids first of all we have facts among these facts is that the Quran must be respected must be honored it is the speech of Allah the Almighty and hence it has to be totally cared for and looked after in a respectful way this is why a lot of scholar says you do not write on the pages of the Quran you do not highlight the wordings of the Quran you can do that in an external paper without a problem but with the Quran itself it has to be respected also we have to understand that teaching children is different than teaching adults because you are setting the foundation in whatever they learn in this early age this will be heavily rooted in their sub-conscience and their hearts and their way of thinking and analyzing and having said that there are no specific means of teaching the children of having them learn what is important in their lives so it depends on the technique used and each technique has to be looked into cross examined and then come out with a verdict so to illustrate some verses of the Quran so that the children would understand them we have to understand that we cannot draw or illustrate to our children things that are related to a labor to the unseen so things that we ourselves don't know the nature or reality of it is prohibited for us to illustrate and draw such things in order for the children or others to understand such as when it talks about rivers that flow underneath their mansions in Jena and which when when we put picture of rivers gardens of Eden and we put jungles and gardens and flowers and hell and we put fire and and the likes all of these things are part of the labor which we ourselves cannot imagine have not seen and hence drawing them would not be permissible when we talk about angels and devils and you write what so many people do depicting angels with wings and a halo like the Christians thinks of the Angels to be like this or the Devils with a spear with three heads and horns and a small beard and he's red this is not permissible to put such images in the minds of children or anyone else because this is not true depicting the messengers and prophets of Allah even if they don't show their faces because this is something that all Muslim scholars have agreed upon not to depict messengers and prophets in any shape or form and other things like that but if we're talking about a normal tree and you draw a tree this is okay there's no problem that we all know what the tree looks like but we don't know the trees of Jena how they look like so that we do not write we do not illustrate them and we do not draw them so if this is in a done in a permissible way there's no problem in that insha'Allah"
