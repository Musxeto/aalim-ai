  "transcript": "The last caller, Halima from France. Yes sir, Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wassalamu Alaikum. Yes, I have one question. Like if I should, can I make the duha that we normally say every morning, part of every morning supplication? Like I don't want to harm myself or harm other Muslims. Can I say it with zamzam water please? Yes, you can make this du'a and recite it on zamzam water and drink it. Part of your ruqya, part of asking Allah Azza Wa Jal. There is no problem in doing so and Allah Azza Wa Jal knows best."
