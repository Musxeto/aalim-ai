  "transcript": "foreign [Music] do you have someone in the room hello you have to speak louder I can't hear your Whispers Alam yes so is if I am free but my tools are not directly towards the couple other like about 20 degrees away is my favorite when I'm standing up there are things that are part of the Sunnah and if you don't do them this has no impact on your Salat so Scholars say that you have to stand ideally with your feet towards the Qibla however the normal posture is like this some people can't stay like this straight ahead but a lot of people would find pain in their knee joints when they stand like this so if you stand like this okay that's proper if you stand normally like this this is proper if you're like Donald Duck and you go a little bit too extreme to the right and left there's the prayer is valid but this is not the right posture and the right way to stand especially if you are next to people in Jamara some people even go this uh extreme and this is not from the Sunnah and Allah knows best but either way your prayer is valid inshallah [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for all the illah"
