  "title": "Can I get married after only one month of father's death & mum is in Iddah? - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "Levine says the nikah of my cousin's brother was supposed to be held in the month of July but suddenly his father died can he get married within one and a half month of his father's death while his mother is still in her head or should they wait for a certain period first of all this is up to you my friend or to your cousin we are not allowed to mourn our dead for more than three days so my father dies I allowed to mourn him to feel sad to refuse to wear perfume as a man yeah I'm depressed only for three days and that's it after that everything has to go normal I feel sad yes but nothing shows except for a widow who has to wait for 4 day 4 months and 10 days now if the marriage is planned a month and a half after the death of my deceased it was planned earlier but my father died and there is a 45 days gap between his death and the scheduled marriage date should I go with the marriage generally speaking yes there is nothing in Islam that prevents it yet your mother must not attend because she has to wait for the idea so if she is kind and loving and caring like most mothers she would say my son go and have your marriage it was planned you've paid for the hole all the expenses has have been paid etc everybody's ready don't wait for me I will inshallah have a party later on with you there is no problem in having this marriage but if the mother is depressed and the family of the bride are considerate and they appreciate and they will say listen we three more months we wait and you have no problem with that there's no problem waiting so it's up to you okay"
