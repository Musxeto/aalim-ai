  "transcript": "is saying that can we talk inside the Masjid if yes then what kind of talking is forbidden inside the mosque talking inside the Masjid if it is done with in a loud voice where people would discuss something and they would annoy or confuse or disturb people who are praying reciting the Quran or making dhikr this is forbidden you are not allowed to do this but if talking is in low voice and almost silently that no one would be disturbed by it we have to look into the content so if you're talking about something that is Haram there is Haram if you're talking about the the latest movie or the latest song in the Masjid or talk about things that are forbidden prohibited then this is prohibited if you talk about or discuss selling and buying so how much did you buy your watch or your car okay how about if I buy it from you and I give you five thousand on top of what you have paid okay it's a deal this is totally prohibited and or the Prophet Isis am saw a man and heard the man in the Masjid saying that this merchandise is worth so-and-so who would like to buy it and the Prophet said may Allah does not give you profit in your merchandise because this is Haram to be done in the message but if you're talking about permissible things so two guys are talking about what happened in school about the exams about the car prices about things that we have in our normal lives a friend traveled a friend came the goods are prices has risen have risen etc all of these are permissible things to talk about"
