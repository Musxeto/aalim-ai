  "transcript": "a matelass√© question is in her investing her wealth and money in a financial establishment now I do not know what this establishment is but I heard that in India and they had branches and emirates and i think it's a lady that owned it that there was a big scheme of collecting money from people in buying gold and giving them revenue and so many people were circulating this it's not rayon I forgot the name I'm getting old and a lot of people used to ask me five six years ago and I would tell them okay don't give your money just because someone tells you I deal in an Islamic way I could have been I could have been rich if I use this methodology but don't be so naive and greedy at the same time because I as I stated before we lose our wealth due to our greed so people used to give this institution a lot of money and they get returns now I ask them did you see any shops do you see any financial statement do you know where they're investing their money they said no but they are Muslims and and their trust world you know they're trustworthy these kind of schemes the pyramid schemes and and the networking schemes Ponzi schemes where they tend to collect a lot of money from the masses so they have a big base for the pyramid and they give among or from this money a little bit to those who participated in the beginning until they reach the top of the pyramid so those on top they get the most of the little they had invested and those who below will are below them and so on so on but the masses who feed this they don't get accept peanuts for the from the beginning and there's no investment actually it's a Ponzi scheme it's a pyramid networking scheme that is collecting money and returning it to those who invested in it without having anything to do and after a while they disappear and leave so my advice to you sister amatulla is take your money as soon as possible before you lose everything and if you don't know where they're building if you don't see that they have built so much schools clinics pharmacies and you can see that your money that you had spent is legitimately working because if I'm an person who is honest and I invest people's money who believed in me I have no problem in showing them listen this is my financial statement you gave me a million I took fifty thousand as my salary I invested nine hundred and fifty thousand and so on so these are my travel expenses and this is the school that I build this is a hospital this is the payroll of the pharmacies and etc everything you can see but when someone says I have a lot of investments where wow all over the world in what in everything and he doesn't show you anything that is tangible concrete you can look into and discover whether he is truthful or saying lies I advise you to leave as soon as possible"
