  "title": "Are phrases Ma sha Allah, In sha Allah, JazakAllah khair, Barak Allah feek authentic Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "my question is that people use these phrases in different actions like mashallah inshallah and the barakalafi all these phrases are authentic or not do you have to say things that are authentic in order to say them and for example Muhammad always give us a call and he never starts his call with assalamu alaikum warahmatullah is this authentic of course not the prophet said in an authentic Hadith whoever begins his talk by asking you before giving you Salam do not reply to him so by this logic I should not answer your question but due to the fact that this is a public platform I will answer your question next time hopefully Muhammad you will give Salam before you start your question some is definitely from the Sunnah for example whenever someone does you a favor and you want to reward them say to them because this is the highest form of reward so this is an authentic Hadith in the Quran it says do not say anything that I'll do it tomorrow without putting insha Allah so saying insha Allah is also barakallah when you see something you like the prophet said Allah to block evil eye you say also when two are engaged you say about all of these things have a root in the authentic Sunnah nevertheless even if it doesn't have a root this is Dua and there's nothing wrong in making Dua every time I conclude my Talks by saying I leave you fee I leave you in the safety of Allah azzawajal to keep you safe and sound oh this is Dua Allah why didn't you say may Allah forgive you is because you're saying it to me so we have to have some sort of leniency it's not all black and white everything you do it has to be authenticated by the Sunnah so you're always answering your questions with your pen in your hand is this better when you listen to the question of the colors you drink some sips of green tea is this green tea itself move on don't let trivial things stop you from progressing and Allah Knows Best"
