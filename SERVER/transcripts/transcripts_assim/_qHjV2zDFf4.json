  "transcript": "oh [Music] my name is sometimes during the day we have an urgent need to make Dura so what's the best time to make Dua in Hadith 251 the prophet Islam answers this question he says here is the nearest the Lord comes to his servant is in the middle of the night so if you are able to be of those who remember Allah at that time then do so the middle of the night which indicates that the last third of the night is the closest you are to Allah when you have an urgent need for Dua or generally just to make thicker this is the most preferred time to Allah the Almighty and also the prophet said Allah about not the timing rather the the position so the first one talks about timing now here he comes and tells us about the position in Hadith 252 he says the nearest a servant is to his Lord is when he is prostrating so supplicate much therein as much as you can so imagine if we combine the two and we prostrate at the last third of the night and we make Dua both time and position have firmly combined and going side by side this would have a double impact to the grace of Allah azzawajal Hadith 253 highlights the beauty of seeking forgiveness the prophet said verily my heart becomes preoccupied in Arabic it's almost like being covered being fogged and verily I seek Allah's forgiveness a hundred times a day this goes in line with the previous hadiths that we've talked about before the Excellence of remembrance and glorification of Allah again another Hadith Hadith 254. foreign 100 times which translates to glory be to Allah and I praise him all all praise do to him or how perfect Allah is and I Praise Him many translations if you say this a hundred times during the day the prophet says his sins are wiped away even if they are like the foam of the sea and this is of course part of the Dua of the morning and the evening as we've mentioned before and likewise the following Hadith Hadith number 255 said that the prophet Islam said except Allah alone without any partner to him belongs all sovereignty and praise and he is over all things and he is over all things omnipotent how many times we've mentioned earlier in the day an evening at car to say it a hundred times here the prophet says say it 10 times this is like one who has freed four servants four slaves from among the children of Ismael wow the lineage which gives more value for slaves just by saying this 10 times yet there is another Hadith saying it a hundred times it's like freeing ten slaves not from the children of Ismael peace be upon him and the following Hadith Hadith number 256 foreign foreign there are two words which are light on the tongue heavy on the scale and beloved to the most gracious and merciful two words in Arabic a word refers to a sentence or a phrase this is why the best word is Allah this is not a single word but in Arabic word means a statement or a phrase so what are these two words subhanallah how perfect Allah is and I praise him how perfect Allah is the Supreme glory be to Allah this is part of the vicar that we frequently say and repeat over and over again Hadith number 257 be pleased with him said that the prophet is Allah about these four beautiful words we've been through translating them so many times so there's no need to do that again what happens when someone says these beautiful words this is more beloved to me than everything the sun has risen over these four words anyone can say them they are so beloved to the prophet Allah that if he were to be given the choice between whatever is Under the Sun and saying them he would choose saying them Hadith 258 sad may Allah be pleased with him said we were sitting with the prophet that is and he asked us are any of you unable to gain a thousand Good Deeds each day some of the companions said how does one achieve a thousand Good Deeds or prophet of Allah how so the prophet said Aslam he should say subhanallah 100 times for a thousand Good Deeds are recorded for him or a thousand bad Deeds are wiped away so again subhanallah 100 times it eases your sins as if even if they were as many as the form of the oceans here just saying subhanallah 100 times grants you a thousand Good Deeds or wipe away a thousand sins or bad Deeds and all of this is something you do like in less than a minute even if it takes two or three minutes which is recommended instead of saying no you should say subhanallah subhanallah subhanallah contemplating on what you say saying it with conviction with concentration rather than just saying it like this and throwing it it's much much better than all of that and Allah knows best and this is all the time we have until we meet next time I leave you here [Music]"
