  "title": "Can kids that are about 8-14 years old of opposite gender play together?",
  "transcript": "Reyes says can kids opposite-gender of age 8 to 14 play together I mean should their parents stop them from mixing and ask them to separate if so what is the age limit there isn't any specific age limit we know that a child is held accountable once he or she reaches the age of puberty however it is not logical to allow them to mix and play though they did not reach the age of puberty at a critical age so yes if the children are like seven six maybe eight years of age this is acceptable more than that they will try to investigate and this is something that we don't have to beat around the bush we see this playing doctor and nurse is a very common game worldwide because this is the easiest way of investigating of you have what I don't have and Allah knows what happens afterwards so it is highly advisable even when children are of the same gender that they are supervised by the parents it's common mistake that takes place in so many countries and I have so many problems out of that of the same gender spending so much time together and even sleeping together and this is why the Prophet alehissalaam instructed us to order our children to pray when they're 7 to spank them if they don't pray at the age of 10 and to segregate and to separate them from sleeping together in the same bed whether boys and boys or boys and girls and girls and girls or girls and boys to segregate them why because Shaitaan is always there even at this young age so I would definitely say that a parent knows his child and knows the other child and they can see whether they're naughty whether they are the type that would investigate or whether would they would do catastrophes when they're alone and they should segregate them or they allow them but definitely I would think that 9 and 10 years of age is a little bit dangerous yes 8 and below ins insha'Allah okay and Allah knows and knows best"
