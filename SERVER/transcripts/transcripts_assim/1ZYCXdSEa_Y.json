  "title": "When to make out NIGHT Athkaar during the last 10 nights of Ramadan since we donâ€™t sleep at night ?",
  "transcript": "A man from India. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh. Walaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Sheikh I want to ask that In Sha Allah we will be in the last 10 days of Ramadan. So when should we do our bedtime as well? Because from Maghreb until Fajr we won't sleep. Then after Fajr we will go to sleep. Then when should we do it? You should do it before you go to bed. So if you're awake the whole night and you go to bed after Fajr then definitely this is what you have to do. To do it before you go to sleep. These are called bedtime adhkar. Not evening adhkar or night adhkar. This is the adhkar you say before you go for your main sleep of the day. And Allah knows best."
