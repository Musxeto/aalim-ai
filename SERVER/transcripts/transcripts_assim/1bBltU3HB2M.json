  "transcript": "Khalilullah from Nigeria. Khalilullah. Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh. Now actually my question is, it looks like two but I promise Sheikh is one. So I want to ask if I can get a driver for my mom. She's afraid of driving and obviously I can only get a male driver. So I don't know if it's going to be being in seclusion with the non-mahram and also can a female, can a male driver who a profession is to drive people who have a female passenger and yeah basically that's it Sheikh. Jazakum Allah Khair. Wa Jazakum. It is not permissible for you to facilitate your mother to travel or to be in seclusion with a non-mahram driver, a male driver. Definitely this is out of the question and it's prohibited. If your mom has another person to always accompany her, this is permissible. So the male driver is there, your mom and a mate or one of your sisters or another person is with her, this is okay because there's no seclusion, there's no haram here. And definitely the best win-win situation is to hire a female professional driver where she can be alone with your mom, drives her safely to wherever she wants to go and Allah knows best."
