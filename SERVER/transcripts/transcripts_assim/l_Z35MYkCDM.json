  "transcript": "from the us um so i have a question about um somebody that um is at the master um so this brother he's um from he's i guess he used to be the imam here at this master here but he lives in um arizona um he comes he comes during ramadan for um the time of ramadan to spend his time here and um he's normally i think he uh he travels with the jamaat of tablique okay and then okay i said um it just doesn't seem like we get along and um so what's the questions ahead um so when after every single time uh for fajr uh when it comes to make vikrant and everything he's always rushing to like talk or um give a hadith of a book called fazel okay and uh it's just very difficult to get uh along with him so i want to know how to deal with you know him i'll answer inshaallah zahat's questioned about an imam who comes in ramadan and lots of the messages in the states in europe they recruit imams to lead the prayers during this blessed month of ramadan tarawih and also to give lectures and remind people of allah azzawajal unfortunately this imam is part of the tabliri jamaa and the tabliri we talked about them so many times and we said that they have clean hearts kind people generous people but they have zero knowledge and they have lots of innovations and they base their practice on a lot of weak and unauthentic hadiths on top of that is their book which has lots of fabrications and in some incidents shirk in a story or two so we tell people don't go out with these guys they're kind they're they're good people they are a pure of heart and they love the sunnah but unfortunately their way is not according to the sunnah itself they don't follow they don't pursue knowledge and they sometimes would uh resist being taught thinking that this would deviate the ummah don't talk about things that would uh separate the ummah don't talk about putting your hand under your belly or on your chest don't talk about jihad don't talk about this about that which is totally bogus so if you can find a masjid where there is an imam who follows the sunnah brothers ahead that would be a win-win uh situation to talk to him without knowledge would be a lost battle you don't even know what they believe in you don't know what the origin what the mistakes so you don't have the altera artillery to fight not literally of course but to have a a beneficial dialogue so i would advise you to stay out of it"
