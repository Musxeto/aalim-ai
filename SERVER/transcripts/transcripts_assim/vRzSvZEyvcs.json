  "title": "Free Mixing Cousins / sleeping in the same room saying he’s like my BROTHER or she’s like my SISTER",
  "transcript": "Ayman from the U.S. Assalamu Alaikum. Assalamu Alaikum. So, I'm originally from Morocco, and free mixing there is widespread. And cousins from opposite gender, they mix a lot, to the point where they sleep in the same apartment, or even the same room. And they make the excuse and say, oh, he's like my brother, or oh, she's like my sister. And so, my question is, how do I advise my cousins on this? Jazak Allahu Khair. Wajazak. Akhi, it is like any other sin. We, as Muslims, have to do our level best in advising people, showing them the proof from Qur'an and Sunnah. These people who say, we have no problem in free mixing, they're like my brothers, they're like my sister. We end up showing them facts, from people they know, that fell into Zina and Haram relationships, when they were prior to that, thinking like you were thinking. No way, on earth, that Allah prohibits something, and you come up with something that goes against it, thinking that it's fine, and it turns to be fine. Whenever Allah prohibits something, or the Prophet, Alayhi Salatu Salam, this is for your own good. And only Allah knows what's best for us, because He created us. Ala ya'lamu man khalaq? Doesn't He know what or whom He created? So, He knows exactly what is best for us, and what is not. Therefore, when the Prophet says, Alayhi Salatu Salam, Iyyakum waddukhula alannisa. Do not enter upon women folk, non-mahrams meaning. One of the companions stood up and said, O Prophet of Allah, what about my, what about Alhamu? What about my brother, my uncle, my nephew? I trust these people. What about if they were to enter upon my wife, and mix with her? The Prophet, Alayhi Salatu Salam, replied, Alhamu almot. Two words, your brother, your uncle, your nephew, are death. Meaning, if you allow them to mix with your wife, this is like allowing death to come and encounter your wife. Disaster is going to happen inevitably. Man versus woman in one location in seclusion, fire would ignite. Fuel next to fire. So, you advise them to the best of your ability. It works, Alhamdulillah, it doesn't. It's not for you to guide people, it's for Allah, the Almighty."
