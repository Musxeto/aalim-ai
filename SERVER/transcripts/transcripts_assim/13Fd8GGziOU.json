  "title": "Should a woman accept a marriage proposal from a man who smokes? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "says please advice as smoking Haram in Islam but not clear whether a woman should marry a guy who is a smoker first of all smoking is a sin without any doubt it is harmful it is waste of money it is repulsive to smell someone who smokes his breath is awful his fingers are also smelly so many bad things but is this a legitimate excuse to reject a proposal this depends on a number of factors number one whether that person is adamant in smoking he's not shy of doing it in public he doesn't care what people say this guy is an open open sinner he's just an openly sinner he doesn't care about what people say and definitely this attitude is not a positive attitude with an inner man yes we're all sinful we all have our shortcomings I have my own sins but I don't I do not go around and brag about them it's something that I'm ashamed of I tried to conceal to the best of my ability but to go openly and commit this sin even if it's a minor sin and not be shameful for doing it this is not a very positive thing if you are a practicing woman definitely this is not a person that suits you but remember that this is not the only sin shaving is a sin so if a good thing to reject him or not this depends on how religious you are this depends how old you are this depends on the other good characteristics in him which may help him to change if he's kind loving caring financially stable offers prayers in the Masjid loves the Dean loves the Quran the Sunnah is enthusiastic but he has this one particular shortcoming then you can evaluate and say yeah there's so many good things in him and hopefully with some diplomatic attempts he will Allah be more cooperative in leaving it etc maybe it would be a good thing to consider"
