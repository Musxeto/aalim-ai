  "transcript": "Anis from Canada so when I'm praying for example like in a and uh while I was uh you know maybe from second S I doubt whether I'm in uh I'm in fourth or third ra and someone is praying behind me so I decided to you know I'm not really certain or have any U major majority that uh certain anyway so I decided decide to stand up for a four thinking it's a four but then there someone uh who's uh praying beside me and of say Subhan Allah trying to uh maybe correct me but I'm not sure as uh I kind of assume that when I'm I should the way I should deal with it as a as as if when I'm praying alone I should uh you know uh just stand up and uh and uh finish up maybe pray uh stand up for and then uh and then pray and then make sud and sometimes I usually after making Salam I ask the person and maybe we uh maybe we kind of discuss whether uh and sometimes argue whether I did actually pray an extra or not uh uh and he sometimes tells me that he's sure that I did pray an extra so if I when I didn't listen to him is my Salah valid what should I have done should I have listened to him first of all if you in doubt and you determined after reconsidering that yes this is the third raak for certain you must not listen to others when they say Subhan Allah you should continue but if you're still doubtful and someone says Subhan Allah you should adhere to their notification because you yourself are in doubt so now you have two people confirming that this doubt is real and you have to uh uh continue because what you're doing is wrong for him when you stand up for a fifth ra and he says Subhan Allah and you don't listen and go go back he should continue his Salat and finish it without you because he cannot follow the Imam in an additional fifth raak this is not permissible it is like following the Imam when he's praying three rakas thinking that it's four and he wants to conclude the prayer no we say Subhan Allah but he still insists on sitting down we just stand up for our for and continue our prayer without him so what you had done was wrong you should have have adhered and listened to what they told you because you were in doubt"
