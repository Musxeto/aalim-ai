  "transcript": "foreign it is a pleasure for me alhamdulillah to be here in perilous for the first time I hope not the last time but we will happen and see insha Allah depending on the results no clapping please no takbeer everything will be fine inshaallah so the topic is not a topic of um let's say entertainment it's a topic related to Akida which is the most important thing in life which most of us may not realize that what makes it or breaks it is this is what the messengers of Allah azzawajal fought their people for not for wealth not for property not for piece of land only for Akida and this is what people are fighting us for for our beliefs for our Akida and a huge part of our Akida is the fear of Allah azzawajal and the Hope in Allah and this is mentioned in the Quran in black and white clearly Anyone who reads the Quran or claims to be a Muslim and contemplates about Quran finds this clearly mentioned in the Quran let alone the Sunnah but the Quran is the thing that nobody disputes upon even the people of Bida so what does Allah azzawajal say about this topic Allah describes The Messengers and prophets of Allah by saying [Music] so Allah says indeed these Messengers and prophets of Allah they used to hasten to good deeds and supplicate us in Hope and fear so this is how the messengers of Allah used to supplicate to Allah azzawajal in Hope but also in fear so in order to know how to balance between these two we have to understand what is meant by them so what is fear fear of Allah is to expect something bad to happen in general fear is when you expect something bad or to miss something that you love and want because there is speculation about it there is a sign that may direct to that intuition and it is the trampling trembling of the heart and being unable to Be steady and this is what fear usually means it's the opposite of to be secure so when you are secure you're safe you're not afraid when you're afraid you're not safe and the fear of Allah azzawajal is the sign of believers it is the way those of knowledge have towards Allah as Allah mentioned huh verily only those among Allah's servants that fear Him most are the scholars so Allah limited the actual knowledge in those who fear Him the most and the fear of Allah is an indication of the purity of the heart and the sincerity of the Soul it has an importance great importance in Islam because it pushes people to doing good deeds and protecting them from sins it is one of the most important obligations in our religion because it has consequences when you have fear from Allah says the stage or manzilla of fear is the highest and most important in Islam and it's the most beneficial to your heart it is a fault upon every single individual and it was ordained and instructed in the Quran Allah says do not fear them and fear me if you are believers which means that a sign of you being a movement is that you fear Allah if you don't fear Allah you're not and described The Messengers of Allah as Warners they warn you and when you are warned you're afraid they warn you from Allah so you fear Allah they warn you from the torment of hell so you feared hell they warn you from the day of judgment where you are accountable so you must be afraid and Allah azzawajal complemented and praised the people of fear in the Quran Allah says indeed they who are apprehensive from fear of their lord and they who believe in the signs of their lord and they who do not associate anything with their lord and they who give what they give while their hearts are fearful because they will be returning to their Lord it is those who hasten to good deeds and they outstrip others therein all these beautiful signs and descriptions of this Ayah came to the prophet Allah prophet of Allah these people who are afraid and they do this and are they those who fornicate and steal and do sins the prophet said no o daughter of Assad dick they are those who fast pray and give charity but they are afraid that Allah would not accept from them foreign it is those who haste into good deeds and they outstrip others therein these ayas describe those who are fearful yet they do a lot of good deeds are we like that seriously do we do what they do and we're afraid one of us may finish the Quran once every three four years and feel feel boastful about it and tell everybody about it maybe do a party and invite people yet when we make sins we are not afraid people go to and come back they should be on the straight path no they keep on doing sins they go for umra and come back and they indulge in sins what are you doing he said I have credit what do you mean I have credit this is not a mobile phone you top up this is between you and Allah azzawajal you have to be fearful you pray to before fetcher 5-10 minutes before Fajr yes what do the righteous do they pray two three hours the hajjud just before Fajr then by 10-15 minutes they asked Allah for forgiveness for what for our shortcomings you just prayed three hours the hajjud yes you don't know if Allah is going to accept it we do what we do and we boast I'm a renowned scholar I'm an international speaker I'm I have credit I can do whatever I want this is wrong you should feel very small of yourself you should feel that Allah will not accept your Deeds this would make you reach safety but the moment you do something good well I gave 100 drinks to a poor person I feel good about it of course it's accepted I did it for Allah Allah will accept it no yeah now you have to be fearful that Allah may not accept it and this is the difference between righteous people and hypocritesri says they that is the righteous people did Good Deeds and did their best in these Good Deeds while being afraid that Allah would reject it the believer combines between Good Deeds and the fear of Allah while the hypocrite combines between sins and being safe and secure from Allah's torment and Punishment this is how we are Unfortunately today fear that is genuine and praised is what prevents you from doing sin this is what is Allah wanting from you to have this fear that stops you why don't you pray Fajr and Masjid the Masjid is next door the bed is cozy the air condition is cold and I feel good sleeping you don't have fear then you are you have problems your fear takes you out of your bed to go and pray in the Masjid your fear makes you turn off the music when it's playing in the car nobody's with me in the car why that dance and and your fear makes you cancel your Netflix and show time subscription and all the Haram because I fear Allah I don't want to go to hell this is the true genuine fear and when you say genuine fear does this mean that there are types of fears yes there are types of fears there is the mandatory fear what is that this is the fear that obligates you to do mandatory things and prevent you from falling in Haram you have this fear you go to Jannah that's cool yeah this is the minimum the bare minimum fear minimum it prevents me from going to hell yes but it is bare minimum because a better form of fear is the recommended fear and what is that it is the fear that makes you do more yes you did the obligations did you pray the Sunnah no Allah made five prayers mandatory per day yeah but the Sunnah is a higher level I never know that it builds your house in China that's easy I'll do it do fast Mondays and Thursdays why would I do that I fast every Ramadan yeah but if you fast Mondays and Thursdays Allah azzawajal would look at your Deeds every Monday and Thursday and approve it and the prophet Allah said about Monday it's a day I was born in and it's a day I was revealed to in so I love to fast it huh okay so this fear gives you an edge okay this is number two number three the fear of the incompetent the fear of the lazy ones this is your fear in mind what you fear is that this is the fear we get when we listen to reminders reminders are like a whip when someone flogs you you feel the pain and you're hurting after a day or two the pain is gone and you forget so you need another Whip and a third and a tenth these reminders these gatherings we come to attend to soften our hearts and to know our religion more these are whips in them we have this incompetent fear where we fear Allah we feel remorseful and we may cry and we try our level best and as soon as we go light the cigarette and enjoy life it's good because it's temporary and it might work it might extend a little bit maybe sometimes it extends for a whole week is a beautiful occasion to attend every week some of us benefit the whole week so it's like recharging so you are fully charged the full week and once the battery goes down before the red you attend the following Juma and you recharge again the fourth type of fear is the prohibited fear there is a prohibited fear yes when you go overboard this is the fear of when you feel that Allah is not going to forgive me will you feel no matter what I do Allah will put me in hell this causes and I do this in my counseling sessions I have counseling sessions every day with people of course paid not free let's things be clear I don't waste half an hour of my time for free except sometimes but you want to sit with me for half an hour you have to pay so they come to me Sheikh I have this fear of Allah and they speak and they vent but I don't let them vent for more than four minutes because time has value and I don't want to waste your time I could listen for you for half an hour get another session and pay me more what is the problem look how shaytan works shaytan comes to you from a very good door the door of the fear of Allah who hates fearing Allah it's a good door but then he opens it to an extent you cannot close it and what happens he says to you there is no hope for you but I'm afraid of Allah I say shahada 50 times a day why I I someone said something I smiled so I committed shirk someone says something and I thought of the prophet in a negative way so I committed kufur so he says shahada 50 times a day he takes a shower five times ten times a day they'll Embrace Islam after two three weeks he gets despaired of Allah's mercies Allah is not going to forgive me shaytan says yes Allah is not going to forgive you what to do leave Salah wallahi they come to me in the hundreds they don't pray they don't fast they don't believe in Islam but they cry like babies in in the session I don't want to go to her but don't cry you are in hell this is called shock therapy you smash them on the face and they smash them again in the face they wake up they need this by the way so I said you don't pray he said yes I'm afraid of them no no you're not afraid of Allah you're afraid of Allah you pray today some of them are afraid of death this is another negative fear I had a brother from the Gulf he came to me in a session and we have timer before lunch no problem so he came to me and he was terrified he looked like a pale chicken I don't know how a pale chicken looks but yeah you understand so what's the problem he said I have this fear of death three years I've been Restless my wife divorced me because of it I lost my job I lost half of my weight check and for the past four weeks I cannot take a shower Russell I do not pray and I said how long you've had this is it three years and I said did you die again of course not he said you stupid because why said if you did not die in three years what would happen 15 years and you don't die like I said you're gonna live like this for 15 years is and this is a sign of weak akeda come on what does Akita have to do with this if you know the six pillars of Iman which the vast majority of Muslims you meet on the street you talk to them and you say to them what is the six pillars of their man so no you stupid it's five I'm talking about the six oh new version 2.1 said no no this is Iman and this is Islam so you say to them until you come to the khadar do you believe in predestination yes do you believe that you will die on a specific day he said yes can you be one minute early or one minute late he said no said why are you afraid look at you three years you've lost everything if you had Iman would go and work so this kind of Iman the fourth type sorry this type of fear the fourth type of fear is the prohibited fear some people are so scared of things that move a tree that moves I can't go there why there is gin there is this fear is very negative it shows that you don't have Iman Sheikh I don't want to get married why I don't want to become pregnant not you of course yeah some of them are the men are pregnant mashallah four months pregnant anyhow let's go back to the topic excuse me so they say I get sisters like this I don't want to get married why because if I'm afraid of what of becoming pregnant so everybody's been becoming pregnant since Hawa peace be upon her said yeah yeah but I'm afraid that my child will grow in this environment and he cannot live and then there are lgbtq and there are car accidents this is subhanallah if they had Iman and trust and Allah all of these would not be around them so these are types of the fears that people have you can divide fear into another division which is also part of those who have OCD people come to me Sheikh I have committed shirk why I'm afraid of this I'm afraid of my boss I'm afraid of the dark I am afraid of the Jinn I'm afraid of my wife aren't we all so this is happening everywhere why this is natural fear some people ask me and ask is that I was praying and a lion came to attack me should I continue prayer foreign this is natural fear this has nothing to do with shirk people do not differentiate between the fear of Allah and the fear of the creatures even Musa in the Quran Allah described described him in two or three places that he feared them I fear pharaoh and he feared when they threw their staffs on the ground and it became snakes he feared this is a natural fear but the fear we're talking about is the fear of Allah if you fear someone like you fear Allah while exonerating them while praising them if you feel the Jinn if you fear mawlana if you feel the this fear that the deceased at that person I say to you swear that you did not steal this by Allah I did not steal it okay swear by mawlana that you did not citizen no I'm afraid because if I swear by al-badawi or tijani or shadowy oral jilani he may you know strike me with lightning or yesterday trained I can't do this this is fear of shirk this is the type of of shirk so we have to understand what fear is and to see which one or which stage we are in how did the companions deal with fear of Allah of course the prophet is fear it will take us hours to mention how he spent nights weeping tears wetting his beard and wetting the floor come on this is the prophet of Allah the best of Allah's creation someone who has a carte blanche whatever you did in the past whatever you were doing in the future is Forgiven yet he feels Allah like this and we we have nothing yet we're so happy and joyful we never shed a tear except when we watched the Titanic maybe or I don't know way there are no tears no fear of Allah except over issues of Dunya oh I remembered my uncle I remembered this I remembered that and I but from the fear of Allah this is a problem may Allah be pleased with him and he is who he is he used to hold his tongue and says this is what will take me to bad places feeding the the the consequences of what he says Roman says by Allah if a camel or a mule where to trip in Iraq thousands of miles away from Medina I would be afraid that Allah would ask me about it and this is frightening for everyone who has responsibility whether you are a king you're a president you're a manager you are if you have responsibility Allah would ask you about every single thing under your responsibility and Roma used to also say if someone were to call and say all of you are in Jannah except one I would have feared that I would be that one subhanallah he fears that everyone will go to Jannah except himself what kind of fear do we have in our hearts and if you look at Abu hurairah may Allah be pleased with him he was narrating a Hadith and this Hadith was Muslim where the Prophet said that Islam the first three to be thrown in Hell or one to he reaches this stage the the first three to be thrown into hell he weeps and faints and he wakes up again and he said the prophet saws said the first three to be thrown in hell are he weeps he could not continue the Hadith and he faints is he making it up is he acting into three parts him and his brother and his mother one third he prays and they sleep then he sleeps one of them stands and pray the second third while the other two sleep and the third sleeps praise the third this is so look at his fear of the three to be thrown into hell and it does not apply to him but he feared that it may have applied to him so what are the things that we would benefit from fear of Allah azzawajal a number of things time does not allow us to expand on them but in a nutshell number one fear equals sincerity when you fear Allah azzawajal you don't go around people every Monday and Thursday to the office if you're a worker I used to have people like this coming to my office on Monday and sitting at 10 o'clock in the in the morning and the guy says oh I don't ask my nature is I don't interfere in people's business don't interfere in mine I wouldn't interfere yours 20 minutes 15 minutes of sitting without me asking I prayed night prayer for any some quiet time I feel tired good for you I don't talk and then after a while I say would you like something to drink said no I'm fasting this is what he wanted okay I have to go and he goes so some people like to show off I once sat with an editor in one of the biggest newspapers in in Saudi Arabia who used to put the pictures of females at the end of the page of the newspaper and this was a taboo was so I went to speak to him and give him advice he happens to know me because of so many reasons but I went and I said that hey look this is Haram he said share I know this is Haram but you know how many people accepted Islam on my hands 37. what is he saying he's justifying his sin by saying that I have credit 37 people accepted Islam on my hands therefore if he had fear in Allah he would not know that Allah will accept so he would keep it to himself therefore sincerity and fear go side by side sincere the fear of Allah pushes you to do more Good Deeds so I prayed if I thought not enough why I'm afraid I have too many sins let me pray 12 I pray 12 that's enough did you did I praise today um is very important I have to pay charity for 360 joints in my body every day the prophet said does this so if you don't pray don't have every day start doing it I started doing it 25 years ago I was a big chair then but I did not pray to her in my school I found a teacher who barely had a beard every day in his spare class at 11 o'clock without saying anything it goes Maxwell puts his prayer mat in the teacher's room one day two day one week two but then I said to myself Allah and you teach people and you do it since then he's getting credit every time I pray and he did not even open his mouth and this is the beauty of dawah I'm telling you now I'll be in my grave getting insha Allah credit whenever you pray to her beautiful prayer so it fear of Allah pushes you to do good deeds fear of Allah makes you hastened to Jannah the prophet said whoever is afraid he travels in the beginning of the night you know when they traveled they did not travel in the morning because of the heat of the Sun so they used to travel at night because it's quicker for your travel and at the same time it's safer so the prophet says whoever is afraid travels at the beginning of the night this is a metaphor if you're afraid of Hellfire then you will travel at the end the beginning of the night meaning do a lot of good deeds and whoever travels at the beginning of the night will reach quickly meaning to Jannah the merchandise of Allah is expensive the merchandise is Jannah and also one of the benefits of fearing Allah you will be under the shade of Allah as in the Hadith seven are in the shade of Allah on the day of judgment where there is no shade except his shade one of them is a man seduced by a woman who's beautiful and influential and he says I fear Allah subhanallah the vast majority of the youth today says where is this woman I'm here I'm available Unfortunately they look for it no this man was lured and seduced but he said and proclaimed I fear Allah azzawajal and those who fear Allah azzawajal in this Dunya they will not fear Allah on the day of judgment and those who are safe from Allah's torment in this Dunya Allah will torment them as per the Hadith where is by my grace and my honor I shall not combine two fears and to security upon my servant if he fears me in this Dunya I will give him Security on the day of judgment but if he feels secure in this Dunya I will torment him and made him Afraid on the day of judgment this is fear what about Hope Sheikh give us some hope and this is why I did not begin with hope I thought of scaring you a little bit now inshallah I will give you hope what is Hope in Islam is when your heart is connected to Allah azzawajal feeling happy and optimistic of Allah's favors and blessings coming over you feeling the peace and Tranquility filling your heart because you know who Allah is this is totally the opposite of the fear here you are safe you feel safe and I always give an example and Allah has the highest of all examples when you hold your one-year-old child and you toss him in the air what does a child do put me down put me down does he do this no he laughs and he enjoys it the more you do it the if I were to throw you in the air what would you do you will hang to the chandeliers you're crazy calm down I'm gonna pick you up he said you man you're out of your mind because you don't trust me so those who have hope in Allah feel like a child being tossed in the air they know Allah will catch them they know Allah will forgive them they know Allah will give them Jannah made the Jannah to whom to you and me Allah made the Jannah to whom to you and me all what you have to do is think positively of Allah azzawajal so what is the difference between hope Raja and being Wishful Wishful is when you sit on your backside and you don't do anything and you say I'll open the door for the prophet Islam of the Jannah from the inside meaning I will enter first and open the door for him this is stupid this is wishful while being hopeful is when you pray a night prayer for two three hours and you do good deeds and you read the Quran once every month at least and you give charity and you are hopeful that Allah will accept this is so how can we attain this level of hopefulness in Allah azzawajal by looking at Allah's previous favors and blessings upon you did Allah send you favors and blessings in the past of course I I'm standing I can see I can speak I can eat I can move around these are all favors from Allah so this makes me hopeful in Allah's continuous gift and blessing in Allah does not let us down Allah continues to give us blessings to Allah he from means you do not anticipate also you remember when you read the Quran in the Sunnah what Allah has promised you whenever you pass by verses of Jannah and see what's in Jannah your heart flies and says I'll be there I am one of the inhabitants of Jannah I know that and you wish and you ask Allah and you make Dua also you remember Allah's current favors and blessings upon you that houses the children the wives the the wealth that Allah gives to you and most of what you're being given is without asking everything you have you asked Allah for no Allah all worry is a 2 2024 model new car yes I don't want anything but everything else Allah gives you without asking asking and we never appreciative of that among the things that help you in being hopeful is remembering Allah's forgiveness subhanallah Allah's forgiveness is beyond imagination and this is why the more you study Allah's beautiful names the more you love Allah and you're hopeful Allah's beautiful name al-karim he's the most generous Allah's beautiful name the most merciful Allah's beautiful name the one who forgives Allah's beautiful name as al-jawad he is the one that gives a tawab the one who repents over whomever asks him who's this Allah so if you believe in him if you have hope in him you will find him as you believe as mentioned in the Hadith and listen to this Hadith the prophet says Allah for are gotten out of Hell Fire for accountability and then Allah azzawajal orders them back to go to hell so they came out because Allah wanted to hold them accountable for some of their deeds and then they're sent back to Hell one of them looks and says o Allah I had hoped that you had gotten me out that you would not put me in back again this was my hope the hope is where on the day of judgment the hope of whom of someone was in hell and was exited and will come back again so he's saying objecting Ya Allah I was hoping that once I'm out of it you will not put me back Allah says then I will fulfill your hope don't put him back subhanallah imagine after getting out of hell just because he had hopes in Allah Allah says because of your hope you will not go back the other Hadith the prophet says when a servant makes a sin and he says o Allah forgive my sin Allah says my servant has sinned and he knows that Allah he has a lord That Forgives sins and holds accountable of the sin then he makes a sin again and Allah says the same thing and he makes a sin for the third time and Allah says the same thing and when he does it for the first fourth time Allah says let my servant do whatever he wants I have forgiven him does this mean we should go and sin of course not it means that as long as you sin because of your human nature because of your weakness and you repent and ask Allah for forgiveness and you feel remorseful in your heart Allah will forgive you regardless of how big your sin is regardless how many times you do it as long as you fulfill the conditions of repentance Allah will forgive you so how much time do we have 15 more minutes with the questions and answers okay no I will finish inshallah in 10 minutes 10 inshallah so what are the benefits of having hope in Allah number one it's the main reason for finding the sweetness of Iman and and forms of worship why when we pray we're so grumpy and thinking about worldly matters and not being able to find the sweetness of Salat because we don't have hope in Allah we're spectacle of Allah we are pessimistic so we pray and we don't know Allah will accept or not we just want to get it off our chest out of our backs no when you have great hope in Allah your rebada has a sweetness to it one of the benefits of Hope is that you express your abudia your being a slave of Allah and a servant to him when you have hope one of the benefits is that you make Dua if you hope isn't something you will not attain it without Dua so you make a lot of Dua and it would help you escape the wrath of Allah azzawajal now the one million the Kuwaiti Dinar the 1 million Kuwaiti Dinar question I wouldn't say Ringgit because Kuwaiti Dinar is about 15 16 Ringgits I don't know a lot so the one million Kuwaiti Dinar can we battle Islands it is extremely important to balance between the fear of Allah and the hope of Allah why to us We Believe that we are different than the Deviant sects the 72 that are in hell because one will be in Paradise as the prophet said and those are who follow the footsteps of the Prophet is companions so our belief is Iman is increased and decreased increases with good deeds decreases with sins they believe Iman to be a bulk either goes all of it or stays all of it said if you do a major sin the whole Iman is gone you're a kafir oof so they went to the far extreme of fear so even if you lie you're a kaffir you still you're a kaffir you make backbiting you're a kaffir immediately the morgia who are the majority of the Muslims nowadays unfortunately they say no matter what you do you have Iman you have taqwa you can party all night long you can booze you can do drugs you can lie you can cheat you Jillian riba take mortgage alhamdulillah you're in Jannah so they say your Iman can never be decreased says no no no it's not like this fear and hope are like the wings of a bird they have to be balanced if One Wing is stronger the bird will be tilted and fall and if they're old flapping well the bird will fly in a good way and this is what is mentioned all over the Quran the day the their faces will be white and some faces will turn black so fear and hope and Allah says your lord is prompt and fast in torment and in punishment and penalty as he is most forgiving most merciful and so on so how to balance let it be known that every fear of Allah must have hope and every hope in Allah must have fear oh how is that if your fear does not have any hope it will be Despair and from Allah's mercy and this will take you to hell and if your hope is one hundred percent without fear this means that you will indulge in doing sins because you have huge and great hope in Allah azzawajal and that would also take you to hell so when to have hope overwhelming my condition and when to have fear overwhelming my condition hope though they have to be balanced sometimes one must a little bit exceed the other for example at the time of death when you're dying the doctor says in five minutes seven minutes what is the best for you to do fear Allah or be hopeful huh whoever says hopeful raise your hands just make sure you're awake okay because I'm saying after breakfast everybody's asleep well okay whoever says the fear of Allah raise your hands one or only one child okay two three four five okay no the majority is it's not democracy this is not voting but yes at the time of death you have to have the Hope exceeding because the fear pushes you to do what good deeds in this state of death you can't do anything so the only thing you have is this straw that you have to hang on in this ocean you're dying so think positive of Allah and this is why people at the time of death they used to tell their students remind me of my good deeds oh Sheikh you have been living for 70 years you fasted for 60 years not break one day I feel good about this by the way I just remember yes I did not I'm the landscape any day of Ramadan wow that's good share you prayed this much you made of the Quran this much this gives you hope in Allah at the time of your bed also and the prophet said Allah no one of you should die except thinking well of Allah this is an instruction when you when it's your death bed on your deathbed think well of Allah also when someone is in despair of Allah's Mercy someone who has OCD he says no I'm going to hell I'm going to remind him of Hope and the beauty of Hope in Islam so that you get him out of this OCD and mental illness and the cases we should make the fear more prevalent for example when the people are insecurity when you go to their lavish homes and they feel fine everything is fine my job is secured my children are healthy I have a huge bank account my business is doing well this is when shaytan is preparing you watch out shaytan is marinating you like a good Chef this is what he's doing he's waiting for the right moment so you be fearful of Allah azzawajal and watch out by remembering though I have to fear Allah like the prophets and The Messengers and you should also have fear exceeding and prevailing when you're doing a sin so you don't listen to music or watch Haram movies you're making fun of Allah okay this is no but in this location turn off the Haram so that you would have fear of Allah subhanahu and finally whenever you feel safe and secure and that you are in Jannah this is when you have to make fear prevailing Imam Ahmad and with this I would conclude my talking sha Allah was asked a question when does the servant of Allah find the taste of comfort is there a comfort yes at the end of the day when you go to sleep you crush you're comfortable so a man is asking when does the servant find the real taste of comfort may Allah said when he puts his first foot in Paradise before you put your foot in Paradise you'll never be safe you'll never be comfortable it's always Agony and torment and trials from Allah the moment you put your first first foot in Jannah nobody's going to take you out you're there to stay this is when Eternal comfort and safety would be achieved I pray to Allah azzawajal that he makes me and you among the inhabitants of Jannah and that Allah puts in our hearts the fear of him and the Hope in what he has for us and to make us balance from"
