  "transcript": "Sumaiyah from France Wa'alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh My question is what is the ruling on buying one item and getting a few other but different items for free? So the price you pay for the item is the price of the item with the highest price. So is it permissible in Islam? Explain that to me again. So are you saying that there are five items on display and I buy this mug for 50 Euros but in addition I know I will get this pen, I will get this pad and I will get this table. Is that what you're saying? Exactly. If this is the case, there is no problem because there is no ambiguity. I know what is included in the package. The ambiguity which is haram is when someone comes to you and says, listen this mug is for 50 Euros, I'll put it in the bag. In the bag there are other four items. I will not tell you what these four items are or how much they cost. It can be a thousand Euros and it can be half a Euro. I don't know. No, this is haram because there is ambiguity. But if the price is known, 50 Euros, and the items included are known whether they cost more or less, but I can tell this is a pen, this is a pad, this is a table, there is no problem in that, none whatsoever."
