  "title": "Women wearing Artificial Iron and Metallic Jewelry - Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "OMPH eysan says what is the ruling on women wearing artificial metallic jewelry and hair clips because I've heard that it is not permissible to wear iron rings etc now whoever says something it has to be backed by evidence as for women women have no problem in wearing whatever they wish to wear whether it's gold silver iron whether it's real or fake whether it's diamonds or saffron's or gemstones or whatever they can wear that without any problem and it is a misconception among some of the countries and the communities where they prohibit women from wearing anything other than pure gold this is baseless you can wear any accessories that are fake even if they look real there's no problem in that wearing hair clips we're assuming of course all of this is done in front of muharram men who you are not allowed to marry for life like your father brother uncle like your father-in-law like your son-in-law like your nephews all of these are Muharram permanently so you can wear this in front of them but you cannot of course wear a hair clip or any jewelry whether genuine or fake in front of men who can marry you because this is not permissible this is exposing and showing your beauty and this is prohibited"
