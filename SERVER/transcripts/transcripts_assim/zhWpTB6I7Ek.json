  "transcript": "next question is from brother muhammad when we were kids we did not have much ill but we did have respect and love for allah and our deen but now my kids age 10 and 8 are completely completing memorization of quran learning so many things like tafsirakrida arabic grammar etc but they have no respect or emotional attachment in the heart how can i solve this problem 10 years of age 10 and 8. yeah come on these are kids they're children what you had at the time when you were their age was fear pure utter fear of your parents of the environment of your relatives and this is why you find people praying out of fear because they used to be spanked beaten intimidated nowadays we don't have this in our system we don't reprimand our children yet we stuff their heads with information that focuses on quality on quantity rather than quality remember the prophet salam stayed in mecca for 13 years what did he teach the people there was no prayer most of the time there was no fasting there was no hajj there was no umrah there was no zakat all of this was prescribed later on so what did he do over these 13 years building up akida building up knowing allah azzawajal loving allah azzawajal fearing allah azzawajal in everything they said or did nowadays we tell i'll bring this and that for you i will get you this and that we will go here and there and no one ever says allah will provide this with this and that and i'll give it get it to you inshaallah if allah wills by the grace of allah we will go to this place or to that place therefore what they're doing is actually caring mostly about technicalities how many jesus do you memorize what about the quality of your memorization of your understanding of implementing it of the allah says may i'll be pleased with him we used to learn for abdullah we used to learn 10 verses of the quran understand them memorize them implement them in our lives then we move on to the following 10 hours nowadays we all what we care about is how many do you memorize okay complete the following ayah what does this i mean i don't know but i memorize it by heart so 8 and 10 years of age is too little give them time give them positivity encourage them don't would and why all the time to them yeah when we were your age we used to do this we used to do that look at you you're useless there's no uh any any benefit of you there you'll never be something be positive the prophet says whoever believes in allah must say good things or should remain silent so if you're unable to encourage them don't discourage them try your level best to be positive and make them feel also optimistic and positive inshallah make dua and they will be better between them"
