  "transcript": "um come on foreign foreign we are at the end of the third year of Hijra the battle of has taken place the main event we've discussed that in earlier programs among the events that took place on this year was the marriage of may Allah be pleased with her and with Omar uh she was married the mother of the Believers and the prophet married her because she was widowed her husband was killed on uh in the Battle of Badr and she was the daughter of his best friend Omar so as form of consolation to her he the prophet Allah married her and also on that here the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam married another companion her name was zainab bint Jose and she was better known as the mother of the poor um and she was known with that name because she used to be so kind to the poor that she used to always give them charity and feed them and take care of them and also she was a widow the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam married her after her husband Abdullah may Allah be pleased with him died on the Battle of Badr and if you remember that the prophet Allah in the Battle of Badr Abdullah and said they all before the battle took place they started to supplicate to Allah and each one would say Amen to the other and Abdullah wish was that he dies at the cause of Allah and that his nose and his ear would be uh hung in a string after his death so that when Allah resurrects him on the day of judgment and asked him o my servant what happened to you and why did this take place to you I would answer Allah in Pride and say o Almighty Allah this happened at your side and for your cause now some Scholars say that the prophet sallam married zainability on the third year of Hijra and others say he married her on the fourth year of Hijra and this sounds much more authentic because as we know the Battle of Badr took the Battle of took place the third year in the third year of the month and the month of uh so if Abdullah and Josh died in the middle of assuming his wife should stay for four months and 10 days morning him this means that the prophet cannot marry her Allah before the end of this period of four months and ten days which means that he definitely mad at her in the beginning of the fourth year of el hijran and zainabint Jose may Allah be pleased with her died two or three months after the marriage of to the prophet Allah and she is the second wife and the last wife of the prophet salallahu die in his lifetime the first one was and the second one is zainaba they both died in the lifetime of the Prophet Allah in this year the third year al-hasan the grandson of the Prophet Allah was also born and also in this year the third year of of Hijra made drinking intoxicants drinking wine forbidden and as we know that Allah made drinking wine forbidden on three stages step by step step by step because the Muslims well generally speaking the Arabs were so attached to intoxicants that they could not think they were will ever be forbidden from drinking it you can read that in their poetry you can see that in their lifestyle every single day and every single night they would gather together and drink wine until they were drunk and they thought wine the wine was like the water for them it's maybe maybe more than water they thought that it is a cause of bravery and a cause of uh being generous and they also attached it to generosity and that is why generosity in Arabic means Karam and the tree of grapes is called so it is almost derived from the same meaning actually it was not a source of generosity because a person when he's drunk he would give anything not because he's generous but because he's drunk and Islam came on three stages forbidden uh intoxicants on Muslims where the Allah at the very beginning told us that there is great benefit and great burden and sin and the sin and burden is far greater than the benefit as mentioned in the Quran so at the very beginning some of the companions did not like this they thought that drinking wine is ungodly it's not something that righteous people would do but it was permissible so they kept on asking the prophet Allah what do you think about drinking wine so at the beginning level one Allah tells us that o prophet of Allah Muhammad they ask you about wine and gambling tell them that there is lots of sin and burden in them and some benefit but the sin is far greater than the benefit and from this level we learn that in Islam we should always weigh the balance of things before judging them so whenever you want to do something and there is nothing that is Crystal Clear in it whether it's permissible or it's forbidden you're in doubt look at the benefits and the bad things in it look at the advantages and the disadvantages look at the pros and cons if the advantages are far greater than the disadvantages then it's a green light you have a go go ahead but if the disadvantages and the harm and the sin and the burden are four are far greater than the advantages then it's forbidden so in the one would say what benefit is there in drinking wine in wine in general you've just said no about it's a cause of brevity okay that's some of the uh being brave it makes you be brave okay what else maybe it was like one of the tradition of the Arab but it's not an advantage as a tradition but there is financial advantage if you're selling it yeah you're gaining you're gaining so there is benefit in it for you some would argue and say maybe it there is some form of cure in it maybe it heals some illnesses if someone is grieving over his his loved one or is someone is depressed when he drinks wine maybe he loosens up a little bit but I read the Hadith if it's authentic who is correct that the God Allah he never put the treatment of such disease he created in something he abandoned oh he has made it forbidden for us this is true it's an authentic Hadith the prophet says o Servants of Allah seek the cure for your illnesses and do not seek the cure for your illnesses and forbidden things for Allah has not put your cure and forbidden things but this does not mean it cannot be a form of healing drinking wine can be a form of temporarily healing and it may cure some diseases but this this does not mean there aren't permissible and Halal means that can cure the same illness therefore we should not at all take anything that is forbidden and use it because it cures illnesses and this is completely unacceptable it was reported that a man came to the prophet and he sought The Prophet's permission to kill frogs so that they can be used in medicine the prophet saws forbid him from doing that and he told him that no killing frogs is not permissible in Islam and this means that eating frog meat also not permissible because whenever the prophet salallahu denies us from killing an animal this makes the animal Haram for us to eat to eat Does it show the messy side of the Prophet saws towards the animals then no of course not because it's only the frog that we cannot eat but we can't Slaughter sheep Campbell uh cows all animals are permissible for us to eat because Allah has created them for us to use so it has nothing to do with being merciful to the animals because it's a food chain that we should follow if you would like to look at the mercy of the Prophet salallahu alaihi sallam you can see that portrayed in his Hadith where he tells us that a woman from uh the Jews was once and she he tells us that she's a prostitute and she was once walking in the desert and she felt thirsty she found a well she went into the well and she drank from that well and when she went up she saw a man as she saw she saw a dog with its tongue out of thirst so she gave water to that dog because he was thirsty as she was and Allah forgave her sins because of being kind to that dog so the companions asked the prophet sallam when they were astonished and amazed o prophet of Allah even if we give dogs mercy and food Allah will forgive our sins the prophet told them that anything that has a wet liver meaning a living creature any living creature that you do well to Allah will reward you for that I believe we have a short break stay tuned and inshallah we will be right back so this is an open invitation for everybody to recognize God and enjoy his blessings in this life and his Mercy in this life and in the Hereafter as well Allah Raheem each name has a meaning each name signifies the nature of Allah Almighty which no one shares or is compared to Allah in it and welcome back so stage one that the benefits are far less than the disadvantages and the sins and the burdens in wine and gambling the second stage was when Allah instructed them that it is forbidden for you to approach to pray when you are intoxicated when you are drunk so Allah tells them stay away from prayer when you are intoxicated this meant that you have a short period an interval between prayers the longest is between the longest period between two prayers would be from Asia prayer which is the night prayer and Dawn prayer Fajr prayer so this was the only time for them to drink and then they can be sober by Fajr prayer so this was stage two so this meant that a lot of the Muslims did not have time to drink because as we know they started their day before the break of dawn imagine that they started the day before the break of dawn and By Night Time by eight o'clock P.M or seven o'clock P.M where Isha prayer was called for they prayed and went to bed immediately does it make a hint uh like you know does it give them a hint I mean that they're doing something you know wrong or they could feel guilty a little bit or at least feeling uncomfortable in the chests that they're doing something they have to be a little bit away and be careful when they deal with it of course this is natural because as I said in the beginning they didn't feel comfortable doing it but it's a habit they've been born raised on so it they feel difficult doing it because they felt it's ungodly they felt it's unislamic but at the same time they had to do it because it's their lifestyle so when this came they knew that fewer people only could stay awake after Aisha prayer and just to give you a sample of what was going on we were told in an authentic Hadith that the prophet Allah once prayed al-fajr and after praying al-fajr he looked at his companions and said who followed a funeral today meaning in in in in the hours ago Abu Bakr said I did then he asked another question who fed a poor person said I did who visited a sick person said I did who is fasting today I did all four things where with Abu Bakr in the span of the night time so the prophet said these four things whomever are collected in in the same day will enter Paradise and this is also one of the glad one of the so many Glad Tidings to Abu Bakr that he is in Paradise so stage two do not approach do not Pray when you are intoxicated and then came the final instruction from Allah azzawajal that verily gambling and drinking wine and drawing lots and uh slaughtering uh sheep or sacrifice to the Idols are all from the acts of Satan so stay away from it completely period so Allah tells us that it is forbidden for you to approach or be close to intoxicants now having said that the prophet salallahu cursed 10. who are connected to wine or intoxicants so anyone who comes even close to Preparing or getting these drinks or intoxications ready is cursed by Allah for example if someone grows fruit plants or or grapes for the sake of making wine he is cursed those who sell it who make it who carry it who buy it who it is carried for who serves it and so on 10 people are cursed in wine it is also reported that the prophet Allah said that he who believes in Allah and on the day of judgment must not sit on a table where people are drinking wine so even if you're in on a business dinner even if you are with people you would like to call them to Islam and you're dining with them and one of them drinks a beer or drinks alcohol beverages it is forbidden for you to join them you have to live immediately and and on the spot some people said we are allowed to sell the wine to the Muslims for instance if you're not in America on UK and cancel it for the Muslims the answer would be it is completely forbidden and by selling them you are exactly as if you are drinking it because regardless who you're selling it to whenever Allah makes something and this is Hadith whenever Allah makes something forbidden for us to consume it is also forbidden for us to sell so you cannot work in a hotel or in a restaurant or you cannot say a supermarket where they sell alcohol beverages because you will be part of that and you will take the sin of those who drink it the third year of Hijra was a tragic year for what took place in the battle of orhard all that reputation and strength that the Muslims manage with the grace of Allah to gain in the first second and the beginning of the third year of Hijra was Gone with the Wind with what's happened in bat in the Battle of Bader people were encouraged to go again and try to attack the Muslims and by the people we mean the the Jews the Jews the polytheists around the Medina and also the Hypocrites now they are encouraged because they thought that it is easy for us to defeat the Muslims as they are weakened now and they are not as strong and and and brave as we thought therefore if we look at the events afterwards we would see that there were the tribes of adul and Para were encouraged to go and attack the companions of the Prophet salallahu the trick they made where they accompanied 10 of the companions as to call them for Islam and then they executed them and also we find that the Bedouins enajed in beniamer also killed 70 of the best Companions of the Prophet salaam who were known to be the Quran and also the Jews of nabir tried themselves to Assassin the prophet Allah and all of these attacks came in a very short span of time and had it not been for the grace of Allah and had it not been for the wisdom of the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam if these attacks managed to succeed the prophet sallallahu sallam's effort in building This Nation of Islam would have gone in vain but alhamdulillah the prophet salallahu took certain measures to reinstall the trust and and fear in the hearts of the non-muslims and among the very first was going after the battle of Badr to hamrah because everybody thought that this was the end of Islam but when they were after well not battle Yeah at the Battle of they thought that this was the end of the Islam but when the prophet sallam went to Hamra I said the following day with only those who were injured with only those who were with him yesterday everybody started having second thoughts well maybe this is not yet the end but we will give it a shot and we will give it a try see we can say that the Muslims Army lose the pattern or we can no they have no they have not lost the battle in uhud as we've mentioned that earlier uh we said that they did not lose but it was they were not Victorious as they were and better because they've lost 70 of their best men and at the same time the polytheist Army were satisfied of these casualties and they were happy to go home with only 30 or 40 casualties of Their Own if it would have been a defeat for the Muslim Army if the policist Army managed to beat us in uhud and then move on to inter Medina but this was not a murder the prophet as well as they came for but they couldn't do it and it was one of the main points really that they started up there of course this is their main objective was to kill the prophet sallam but they didn't even uh succeed in achieving this so this meant that it was almost a draw because they just were satisfied in going back to Mecca with what they have done and that is why Abu sufyan said that clearly that we're coming next year to attack you and even in the middle of the way when they had their second thoughts and they wanted to go back once they knew that the prophet sallam is waiting for the for them in I said they were afraid and they called it a day and went back to Mecca going back to the events of the following year this is the fourth year of Hijra the prophet Allah in his current situation to all the Arabs Jews and to the Hypocrites in Medina was considered to be in a weak position so he had to change their opinion they had to he had to do something to change the idea that the people had so what he did was he heard that and his brother Salama IBN khwelid from Benny Assad we're trying to collect and gather their people to attack Medina so the prophet salallahu sent one of his companions to go and attack them and this companion of his was pleased with him and he gave him a flag and told him go and fight them and bring them to justice and he went this to leija this man was one of those at the end at the when the prophet sallam died who claimed to be a prophet himself he reverted to Islam and then after the death of the Prophet Allah he went back to disbelieving and claiming to be a prophet himself his story and what Abu Salama did with him is insha Allah what we will discuss next time we meet so until then mm-hmm foreign mm-hmm"
