  "title": "Life's Adornments - Episode 20 - Raising Children on Good Manners (Part 3) - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] uh and welcome back to another episode of life's adornments where we are discussing child rivering its virtues its benefits its many ups and downs and how do we return this magnificent endeavor back to the quran and the sunnah of prophet muhammad we are talking today about and how do we raise children that are in line with the sunnah of the prophet muhammad in terms of their mannerisms in terms of their way of being so that they may grow into adults that are healthy adults and have good manners inshallah to help us with this matter we have sheikh asim luqman and hakeem was a teacher at zad academy nkiu and an imam and teacher for over 30 years okay so we always enjoy having you on allah the pleasure is all mine so we left off talking about tarviyah uh talking about akhlaq talked about a double fallacy and adapt with the parents now the closest thing as we mentioned in a previous episode that many times children spend most of their lives in their times outside of the home a i eat in schools more than they even spend with their parents so how crucial is it for a child to have adept with their teachers and also teachers to have at that with a child in terms of their tabitha that they are giving to them as well as the terbia the way that our parents dealt with us decades ago differ to modern parents of today the concepts the ideas the methodology among other things are way different this is due to culture to the environment to the sciences etc now my in my time 40 50 years ago my father would take me to the headmaster of the school to the teachers and say which is well known to arabs worldwide old generations they would say here is my child take him as meat and return him as bone meaning that you have full free right to do whatever you want beat the heck out of him torture him discipline him i trust you as a teacher and i know that the outcome would be great nowadays it's different nowadays you can't even do or say anything that is negative you'll be incarcerated you'll be tried and convicted you'll be fired from your job which resulted in the children losing respect to their teachers now i don't say that the previous generation's way of upbringing and teaching is good by hitting and and i'm beating with a stick i don't see that this is good but i don't say it's bad there has to be some room of moderation to me allah has favored me and i taught in the beginning of my life for 15 years in a public high school and they're all teenagers you know hot blooded too much tetestrone flying all over the place and i taught in that environment with the grace of allah i had never ever laid a hand on it in on a student nor cursed or said to a student excuse me or said to a student you're stupid you are a dog you are a monkey whatever nothing alhamdulillah because this is how we were brought up and this is how our religion dictate that we deal with others so the way i was dealing with children and well with boys young men was through respect and i know a lot of teachers who always had a stick in their hands and would beat the children but i am 100 percent certain that they respected me more than them until date they called me on the phone and this was more than 25 30 years ago till they they're grown up men with children with with families and they seek my counsel they respect me and they cherish the days i spent with them why is that because a teacher is the second after the parents as a role model and whatever he says or does has a marvelous or devastating impact on the child and we mentioned last uh you know some episode ago that the comment of this and how it affected imam bukhari so many scholars when they were at a young age heard a comment from a scholar who was senior saying that this guy has a bright future this boy when he grows up he's going to be an imam this boy is something of a great personality and it all came true they didn't predict the future but rather they gave positive signs and comments because they know that it would produce excellent and beautiful uh traces so as a teacher you have to be 100 percent careful of everything that comes out of your mouth a comment that you are making a joke can devastate his life for the rest of it and a positive comment or encouragement can uplift the morals of the child to be a great scholar in the future so there is a great responsibility laid upon the teachers the scholars as well as a scholar people learn not only from your knowledge but also from the way you act it was stated that 5 000 students attended his classes and gatherings five thousand five hundred of them used to write the hadith down so they are proper scholars and students of knowledge recording everything he says four thousand and 500 of the other students would only be there to learn from the imam's moral conduct the way he speaks the way he acts the way he reacts to some of his students so they learn from his akhlaq so show me scholars of today and how they deal with others you would be shocked to find some of the scholars using abusive words looking down at others making fun of them and they say this is this is okay we're speaking about the men this is the knowledge of the but this is not the way of the prophet not the way of the companions not the way of the real people of the self it's a package deal that you have to take and these guys only select what benefits them some of those so-called students of knowledge they have websites they publish books on what on criticizing sizing this guy or this scholar or this student of knowledge and they tarnish everybody's reputation so who's left four or five allama these are the top scholars if you follow them you are with us if you're not then you're against us and this is not islam yeah subhanallah you mentioned that made to remember even abu hanifa may allah be pleased with him it was known that his top student was abu yousuf and what he did from a very young age he recognized some beautiful characteristics in abu yusuf that he would be very you know a promising young person so he took him from his mother and his mother because they said he was speaking like full sentences before the age of one you know subhanallah so they knew that he was going to be something special so when abu hanifa took him close his mother was worried like i was hoping my son was going to be a doctor or a scientist or something great now he's going to be an item you know as if this is the worst of the worst yeah so he said don't worry your son is going to be something big so to please her and to make her happy abu yusuf said that abu hanifa paid for his expenses cover his family throughout his entire life and he will clothe all of his students and he would give them spending money so people won't look down at the students and abu yousef became who he was because of the tarabiya of abu hanifa you will be hard-pressed to find you know scholarship now that gives you know people be not just give them knowledge but give them the application of it how to be and in their own characteristics teach them how to apply this knowledge that i'm teaching you so how crucial is that for our teacher it is very crucial because knowledge can be sought after any anywhere yes you can get knowledge from books from the internet from shares from diaries uh from your self reading you can get knowledge but terbia moral conduct ethics you cannot get that except from a scholar he teaches it to you he monitors you he fine-tunes you and i remember some of my old shaykhs whenever i said something they would give me a lecture i joke a lot maybe people don't know this but this is how who i am i'm not going to change my colors just because i am a sheikh no i joke okay guilty as charge but sometimes my jokes go a little bit too far there was always this shaykh who would diplomatically correct me and lectures me about the dangers of what i had said and jazah's till date i still recall his advice so what the sheikh says is very important now this is one aspect of adam there's another aspect where we teach our children how to deal with their teachers so again it's a sign of disrespect when we find a child treating the elders especially the teachers and the scholars in an inappropriate way this is a sign that we failed in upbringing him we should always teach our children from an early age how to respect the elders how to respect that whoever teaches me a letter i'm his slave forever how to teach them to respect the imams of the masjid and to greet them and to pay our respects to them if we manage to do this then we have this beautiful amount of respect in the far east we find the relationship between the younger generation and the elders filled with respect unlike in the west so in the west you could find a son talking horribly to his father let alone his grandfather or the elders in the far east this is sacred the way they deal their parents the way they deal with the elders the respect they have we in islam have this in our religion with the grace of allah yeah we're going to pause here for a short break and we'll come back with talking about having adapted with the teachers not only the allah meh but also the neighbors inshaallah ta'ala so viewers stay tuned we'll be right back with our second segment of life's adornments [Music] assalamu [Music] assalamualaikum and welcome back to our second segment of life's adornments where we're discussing adeb having good luck and so far we discussed having good luck with the teachers in ulama and i just wanted to make a crucial point about dashak assam mentioned about children having respect for the lama particularly the people that disseminate islamic information i see in in many situations children don't really respect the imams and is greatly in part because of how the community treats the imams as a wazif as a position i some people treat it as if is a lowly position like oh he's just the imam and one of the brothers who came from the west he said that when he was a non-muslim he would see the drug dealers and they had these big flashy cars and they had money and they had a woman or whether these things dunno we things that were pleasing and he would say don't be like me you know this is this is a bad position to be in and then they will see the imams and they were like mesquin uh you know they didn't really have anything and they were treated as a closet imam had a little closet in a masjid and people would tell them say do jummah do this don't say this in your lecture and they treated him like not so nicely so he said he would go to the masjid with his muslim friends and they would see the imam say you should be like me he would wait in between the two and say i think i'll go with the drug dealer with the ferrari with the ferrari yeah see this is problematic and we have to crush the t's and dot the eyes in the sense that it is a cultural thing you give respect you get respect in a lot of the masjids in america i've seen that the committee of the masjid who the board members they are not practicing they are cultural based and probably they are rich people who donated for the masjid and they won a seat in the board or the committee so they get this imam who is a half of the quran who's a respected person and they start to dictate do this and do that okay it's not your job your job is to ensure that i come on time that the prayers are given that the khutbah do not cross the line my teachings are okay you don't tell me how to do my job and usually there's a clash if the imam gives in they'll write him like a mule and this is not a good masjid if the imam had respect to himself he said i'd never tolerate something like that such people who do not know the basics of islam coming to tell me how to teach this is unacceptable in other masjids and i've unfortunately also personally was involved in this some of the imams are not worthy of being imams and i've seen and heinous things happening from so-called imam that would breach anyone's confidence not only in their role as an imam in the role as a muslim when they transgress when they abuse when they misuse their powers and the trust of people to steal their money or even to have illicit haram relationship with women imagine imam of a masjid and of course it's not widely spread it's a case or two but again we hear about the catholic popes and and cardinals what they do in child abuse cases and we're outraged to find something similar even on a small scale compared among the muslims is outrageous so this is found and this is what may cause people to disrespect imams in that region but if you come to arabia for example where i come from the children are taught from an early age to respect the imam and that the imam is a an authority the father the grandfather respect the imam they invite him to their homes to feast with them they seek his counseling they ask him for fatwas and usually 99.99 the imam is trustworthy in his position because the vast majority of imams in arabia they're not assuming a position paid for usually the vast majority of them are volunteers so they don't charge money they have other jobs they have businesses they have whatever but it's not an occupation that they accept people to instruct them to do or not to do so they are quite respected in other arab countries i know for certain that the media is trying to portray the imam the scholar to be a lunatic so in so many films in so many dramas or tv series the scholar is usually someone who has a long beard like mine wearing a turban and he is so hyper he's dumb he doesn't speak any languages other than the arabic and he is so greedy trying to you know milk you from for money and he would uh uh polish your shoes for a dime so when you see as a child the scholars and the imams and the judges looking ridiculous like this in some tv series it they show that the imam the judge would divorce a man from his wife so that the judge would marry her so what are you doing this is the media this is the role of media brainwashing the society in large would probably think negatively of anyone who has a beard of anyone who's a scholar or an imam or a judge or a daddy and this would negatively impact the whole community so yes what you have said is true but not always there is this idea that people are trying to propagate to the the world that scholars and judges and imams are you know scum they are uneducated they're barbaric they don't know how to talk or to act and try to get their children away from them and put them in medical schools and engineering schools as this is for the elite but the scum go to lead prayers and to become scholars out of illah allah protect us from this um moving forward i want to talk about neighbors we know the prophet sallam one thing he did not play about was mistreating and disrespecting their neighbors under any circumstances so in the neighborhoods that we grow up and how do you teach your children to be conscious of their neighbors and to have respect for them as well um here at least what i see here many you know which is strange to me because in the west everybody knew each other we all grew up in a block so if you did something down the street before you got home the news would reach to your parents and even your neighbors would beat you before you got home growing up that's how it was but now i see here that nobody really knows each other people don't really talk to each other maybe it's because the city and it's different in the village but how important is it for you to know your neighbors respect them to be at their service to check on them when they're sick and you know to live your life in this way this is true when i grew up we used to know each and every neighbor of ours i remember that one of my daily shorts was to hold a tray with food on it and mom says give this to our neighbor um fatima on zuhr on this on that and tell them this is from my mom so i every single afternoon i go and knock on the door auntie this is for my mom she says she like you to taste this so it's a generous plate of food and then she gives me in return another tray to give it to my mom with food so after my mom uses the food the plates of my neighbor has to be filled in again so she fills it up with new food and i've been doing this from all of my life what is this so i go from house to house and it shows you that we know each other nowadays with expanding metropolitans and cosmopolitans and concrete blocks that we live in high risers you rarely know who's next door if someone knocks on your door you tell your kids turn off the lights and you look from the people yeah and and so that he would not know that there is someone inside said what is he what does he want yeah and even if you open the door you're a little bit doubtful salaam alaikum yes what can i do for you you want money i don't have any just we're giving you salam yeah for what so he's too aggressive not friendly this is happening in islam it's not this way the prophet said allah three times he swears by allah he does not believe the companion said who is he he said whoever is not safe from his neighbor's atrocities or shortcomings so if i am not safe from my neighbors throwing the garbage in front of my house or blowing the music in the middle of the night he will not be a believer a full-fledged believer yes he's a muslim but with weak iman and the prophet said allah peace be upon him continued to advise me and to remind me of the rights of the neighbor until i thought okay gibril he's going to inherit me what is this he's reminding me so frequently and often that i thought okay he's gonna have a share of my wealth after i die and in islam it tells us to respect our neighbors but it also part of the islamic tradition that the neighbors take care of the children of their neighbors as if they're their own so if you see my child doing something wrong you reprimand my child and you may even hit my child and i would thank you for that because i know that if i had seen your child do something similar i would do the same and you would thank me for that so in such a community yes we have this strong bond within the neighborhood itself not only because you watch my back and i'll watch yours but because this is an islamic concept that neighbors look after one another one of the most beautiful things we had till recently whenever a woman gave birth in the community every single house in the neighborhood would dedicate a meal for that day to give to the family so that they she would not have to cook when she is tired and still not fit this shows you how close we are to one another and if our children watch us behave in such a fashion they will be insha allah good soldiers for this community yeah the famous statement says it takes a village to raise a child sure we're going to end the segment always a pleasure to sit with you and exchange these dialogues uh for the viewers we hope that you are benefiting and stay tuned for another episode of life's adornments assalamu alaikum [Music] um [Music]"
