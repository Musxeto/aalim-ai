  "title": "Woman sinful for doing a business transaction on Friday at the time of Jummah",
  "transcript": "We have Khurram from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa'alaykumussalam to Allah. How are you Sheikh today? I'm fine Alhamdulillah. Sheikh, my question for today. A woman made an online bank transfer payment to a company to buy a geyser. She transferred the amount on Thursday and the product was to be delivered on Friday after Salah time, to which she said okay. But she insisted she wanted it as early as possible during daylight so the time between 2 and 4 pm was confirmed. Please note that the Jummah time probably lasts till around 3 pm. The product was delivered just during Jummah time that is at or before 2 pm for which she left. She felt guilty because when she asked their rider if he had offered his Jummah, he said he couldn't and when she asked if it was because of a delivery, he said yes. Although he could have come between 3 to 4 pm too but he says the time wasn't communicated to him by the company personnel. Now the woman feels the product may be haram and there may be no barakah. Was she wrong in stating delivery time 2 to 4 rather than 3 to 4 pm? Upon saying that he could have offered his prayer on his way, he said something like if the product was stolen from the car, it would have taken him a lifetime to be able to compensate for it. Jazakallah Sheikh. No, there is nothing haram or no reason to feel guilty. The transaction was done a day earlier. If the transaction of selling and buying was done at the time of Jummah, that would have been invalid for the one who is doing it. Not for her. As a woman, she is not obliged to attend the Jummah so she can sell and buy. And the transaction took place a day earlier. The delivery doesn't count. What counts is the transaction of selling and buying, transferring the money, the contract writing. There is no guilt on her inshallah. The guilt is on the driver himself."
