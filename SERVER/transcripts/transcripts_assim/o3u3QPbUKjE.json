  "transcript": "what is the punishment for not praying your five Salah there is a punishment in the Hereafter yes prescribed punishment in this Dunya is not there because it is something up to the Judgment of the Muslim ruler or the Muslim judge if your case was brought in front of them and you still refus to pray see theoretically a person who doesn't pray at all is not a Muslim so can you clarify that is it at all as if they abandon all the or it one the pro this is not rapid fire this is sorry I got married forgive me the prophet between a an individual and shik or disbelief is abandonment of Salat in another narration he said whoever abandoned Salat is a cafir is a disbeliever yes now this is theoretical because in practice I could come and say okay Le doesn't pray how you know I worked with him 20 years in the office I never seen him pray and his wife comes and says doesn't pray how you know he never prays so can I label you as a cafir the answer is no because you could pray on your own in a place that's secluded nobody where he sees you it's between you how in practice would I label you as a cafir if I bring you in front a trial buer or a a judge and he say pray and you say nope I don't want to pray why so I don't believe in prayer yeah and I show you listen this is in the Quran this is in the Sunnah if you don't pray you're a cafir said no I'm not a cafir I believe in Allah but I don't want to pray okay here's the Executioner he's got that sword we're going to take you chop your head off said I believe and pray but I'm not going to pray now you're a cfir so in practice it's pretty difficult to label someone as a CER however if this is done in a Muslim country that is ruled by Shar and proven in front of a Muslim judge who authorized to take such punishment he can sentence a person to death okay but 99.99% this is not there's no prescribed punishment worldwide and it's not never been practiced because no one comes to facing death and says no I'd rather be killed ra rather than pray now in the Hereafter it's different but this is to Allah's judgment not to you and me to me I would throw them all in hell but to Allah he knows subh he has all account so he is the most merciful but who is severe in his wrath and anger and he would know whether this guy is legit or he is a phone so if you miss and it's time are you still going to does that invalidate the Salah if you miss prayer without a legitimate reason then you cannot pray it if it's time so let's assume is at 1:20 and is at 5:00 there is a good 3 hours and 40 minutes and I'm preoccupied in my meetings in my meals in my school and um yeah I know it's time I don't want to pray now well let me you delay it delay it until the time runs out there's a whoops it's time let me pray my no it's not accepted even if you pray 100 it's not going to be accepted from you why because the prophet sallallah Al wasallam said whoever oversleeps a prayer or forgets it must pray it as soon as he remembers it there is no experation for for that other than doing so now oversleeping and forgetfulness are forgiven by Allah these are legitimate reasons yet the prophet said there is no experation meaning that yes okay you're forgiven but to expiate such a thing you have to pray it immediately the moment you wake up or you remember Scholars like T may Allah have mercy on his soul and said this Hadith indicates that if you have a third reason which is not not legitimate then even if you pray it it is not going to be accepted because the prophet made two excuses overs sleeping and forgetfulness and Allah knows"
