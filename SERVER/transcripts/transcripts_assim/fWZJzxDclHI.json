warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hadith number 167 his the hadith of mother Aisha may Allah be pleased with her and who will recite or read this hadith for us yes brother i shall said that prophet salallahu alayhi wasallam said in his illness which he didn't recall from may Allah curse the Jews and the Christians who took the graves of their profits as place of worship and added Aisha if it had not been for this his grave might have been raised above ground but it was feared that it will it will be taken as a place of worship this hadith before going into it you have to remember that the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam was buried in his message correct no he was not buried in his masjid this is a misconception that a lot of the people bring up so you have to be very careful it was buried in his house in the house of mother Aisha and he had the masjid like this and his house was surrounding the message so it was not part of the message otherwise he would not be able to stay there while he was junip in the set of janaba mother I showed her not have been permitted to stay there while she was in her menses and he would not be able to have intercourse with his wife's correct or not ok so when he died the Companions differed what to do with his body how or where to bury him and they could not reach a conclusion until abu bakr king may allah be pleased with him and he said I heard the prophet of allah sallallahu re who are you i seldom say that whenever a messenger of allah o prophet dies he is buried where he dies so they buried him exactly where he died under his bed now at the last moments of his life he cursed the Jews and the Christians not because they're Jews and Christians but because of their actions and that is they used to take the graves of their profits as places of worship and look what this ended to be it's ended that they worshiped their profits and as example the clearest example is Jesus peace be upon him is worshiped as a son of allah azzawajal why because they went into extreme and some of the other also sacked ended up by worshipping their profits and the prophet alayhi salatu salam is cursing them to warn his followers to earn his Ummah do not fall in the same trap that the Jews and the Christians fell into I she says may Allah be pleased with her other than that because of his warning we would have raised his grave but because he was afraid and we were afraid that if we do this people would take it a place of worship we would have done that so the prophet alayhi salatu salam he's telling us that it is forbidden to take the grave of any person a place of worship even if that person was a prophet or a messenger of allah and this leads us to the issue of building a mosque over a grave what is the ruling on that it is completely prohibited and prayer in such a message it is invalid why because this message it was not erected was not built on taqwa it was built on evil and it was built on sin then what is the ruling on having a Masjid and bringing someone and burying him in this is a different issue this is not permissible and the grave must be dug out and taken out of the masjid but if a person prays there the prayer is valid unless the grave is in front of you so a lot of the message in the Arab world you have a grave but it's always at the back you ask which came first if they tell you the grave came first and then they built a message it it is forbidden for you to pray in that message it and the message it has to be demolished has to be removed you cannot pray in it but it's the other way around they said no the message was there and when this king or this ruler or this scholar died they brought his grave and he was buried inside the prayer is valid as long as the grave is not in the Qibla the normal question would come and say if you're saying that it is not permissible to pray in such a message how do we go to Medina and see that the grave of the Prophet narezo salam is in the Masjid first of all the grave was not in the Masjid initially not in the time of Abu Bakr earth man romo osman ali mu ha all of these did not include the grave of the prophet alayhi salatu salam in the masjid when Alou eat even abdul malik came he wanted to expand the masjid sorry didn't you say he fought bravely to stop him but you cannot fight the ruler who has the army who has the soldiers so he insisted on it and he demolished the houses of the Prophet of Islam and built a fence and included the grave into the masjid so what did the scholars do the scholars feared that the people would come in the direction of the Qibla face the grave and the Qibla as well so that they can pray to it so what they did was they surrounded the grave of the prophetess salatu salam with three walls triangle and they made the two walls pointing against the Qibla meaning if I want to face the Qibla and at the same time face the grave I cannot because the grave is like this so in order for me to face it I have to come from one side of the wall or from this side of the wall and this way I would not be facing the Qibla so they protected the grave with high tall walls that are in the shape of a triangle so that they would stop people from facing the grave so it's a all complete different story and that is why the prophet alayhi salatu salam for bait because he knew that his people the ignorant ones those who do not have knowledge would come and take it as a Masjid have any one of you been to Medina ok we have masha'Allah five or six if you go to Medina you will find that the ignorant still go to the chamber of the Prophet I some to the grave and do horrendous things they some of them bring a piece of cloth and they wipe the windows or the chrome or the gates or the tiles and they take it with them when they go back home and they wash it and they say that this is blessed the dust is blessed and all of this is nonsense this chamber was not built by the prophet alayhi salatu salam it was built by the Turks 300 years ago Oh so what are you doing you're seeking blessing from what the Turks did this is not realistic those deviant sex have exaggerated when it came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam they went into what is known as hulu extreme we all love the Prophet Ali solution but our love to him is portrayed by following him by accepting his Sunnah by following every footstep of his what led them to this Shaitaan Allah says do not follow the footsteps of Shaitan and they are following the steps of Shaitaan which led them into exaggerating into extreme and portraying their love to the prophet alayhi salatu salam the true love is by following his Sunnah every step of the way we have a short break stay tuned inshallah will be asalaam alaikum and welcome back the prophet alayhi salatu salam for bait because he knew that his people the ignorant ones those who do not have knowledge would come and take it as a mess you have any one of you been to medina ok we have masha'Allah five or six if you go to medina you will find that the ignorant still go to the chamber of the Prophet I some to the grave and do horrendous things they some of them bring a piece of cloth and they wipe the windows or the chrome or the gates or the tiles and they take it with them when they go back home and they wash it and they say that this is blessed the dust is blessed and all of this is nonsense this chamber was not built by the Prophet Ali salatu salam it was built by the Turks 300 years ago so what are you doing you're seeking blessing from what the Turks did this is not realistic those deviant sex have exaggerated when it came to the prophet alayhi salatu salam they went into what is known as hulu extreme we all love the Prophet Alex Ladouceur but our love to him is portrayed by following him by accepting his Sunnah by following every footstep of his what led them to this Shaitaan Allah says do not follow the footsteps of Shaitan and they are following the steps of Shaitaan which led them into exaggerating into extreme and portraying their love to the prophet alayhi salatu salam the true love is by following his Sunnah every step of the way we have hadith 168 so I'd appreciate it if someone reads it for us narrated abu huraira that a last prophet sallallahu alayhi salam said well attends the funeral procession till he offers the funeral prayer for it will get a reward equal to 1 Kira and whoever accompanies it till burial will get a reward equal to 2 carats it was asked what are two killers he replied like two huge mountains Muslim added the smallest of them is equivalent to mount now this hadith shows you in highlights the importance of following a funeral until it's buried and also the importance of offering funeral prayer and even Romar may Allah be pleased with him and with his father when he heard this hadith he did not believe that we know that even oma was among the righteous companions who used to spend all of his time in prayers and fasting and when he heard this hadith he wanted to confirm so he asked another companion and he told him yes the Prophet did say this and then he started to cry saying by Allah we have lost a lot of carrots not carrots that you eat carrots of gold carats of good rewards and that is why the prophet alaihi wasallam said whoever prays on a funeral will get one carat and whoever follows a funeral until it's buried he'll get two carats when asked what is carrot is it carried of gold is a carrot of land is it something we don't know he said each carrot ways as Mount Hood does it's a mountain have you ever seen mount your hood it's a big mountain I thought that it was you know this hill it was a big thing you take time to climate or at least to climb the small mountain where the archers work it takes energy and it's not that easy now the prophet alayhi salatu salam told us that who does this gets this great reward i personally know people that do this every monday and thursday they fast and they go to the hospital randomly and visit any sick person they knocked the door salam alaikum my brother how are you may Allah make it easy what are you suffering from no Masha Allah you look ok allah azzawajal will make it easier and supplicating say some drama they go out from the hospital they find some of these African ladies collecting garbage or whatever the poor we have a lot of them and they buy them half a chicken and some rice and they feed them and then they go to the cemetery where there is a message it next to it they play the  and they pre answer on the account that they will find the funeral to pray and then follow it until it's buried the Prophet said that it's all of them whoever does these four things will enter Jannah and they choose to do this every day of Monday and Thursday the prophet said I didn't say my Muslim after praying pleasure who among you fed a poor person Ibaka said I who among you is fasting abu bakr said I who among you visited a sick person Ibaka said I who among you followed the funeral I Walker said I the Prophet said whoever does these four things in a day Allah will make him among the people of general so it's a great reward to pray over a funeral and to follow it until it's buried not to follow it to the graveyard wait it takes only seven minutes maximum 10 minutes everything happens fast when you die everything happened fast everyone wants to go and that is where the prophets say that some when a person dies three go to the cemetery one stays and to go back she goes to the cemetery with you your deeds your family and your wealth your deeds stay with you your family and wealth go back so it is a great reward that we should look up for and these two carrots are easily lost as well the prophet said that is salatu salam whoever keeps a dog in his house two carrots or a carrot is taken away from his good deeds every single day imagine if you have a dog in your house so these easy come yet easy go if you do not comply with the Quran and the Sunnah and you do not follow the instruction of the prophet salallahu alayhi were early he was seldom so if you have any questions we will try to entertain them sure if you mention about the images that when you take the photos the images because it is from Allah it's just a shadow of it but is it okay if you do makeup and then somebody take the picture and is it ok when you know when you have to do like advertise or something they go on the computer and they clear the blemishes and stuff like that it is not permissible to use Photoshop when you take pictures because the end product is not a las creation when you have a photoshop or illustrator if you play with the image i remember a brother of mine who was working with me in the department we had to take photographs for IDs so he took my photo graph and after 10 minutes he came to me with a picture and said do you know this and I looked and I was like 10 years younger it felt good and I wanted to give the picture to my wife so maybe she would appreciate it a bit but I told him what did you do said no I just remove some of the spots here and your white hair I made it all black and you know gave you a brush up and I said this is haram and you're among those whom Allah will punish good stuff for law to Willie and the brothers all ahead stop doing that afterwards so yes these touch ups are not permissible it is permissible to take photos you have to keep them as they are now for advertisement purposes yes but the share we would like to advertise his photo so that it would be appealing he's not looking for another wife put it as it is and if you change it you will be under this punishment may Allah protect us all slowly come shake Salaam what is the legal ruling on 3d animation movies and games 3d animation and games I believe if you want to play with a game that is 3d there is no problem in sha Allah providing it falls under the Islamic rulings in the sense that there is no nudity if you want to do Mortal Kombat for example and you have women wearing skirts up to their waists and they do these sounds and they jump around and lots of nudity and no this is haram this is prohibited if it has excessive violence it teaches the children how to you know hold the head and separate it from the people all what you see is blood blood blood no this is Harlem if it has music and you're unable to mute it this is haram but if you want to play football and there's no music no bleeding no nudity football for men are not for I don't know if they have video games for women mainly its Brazil Argentina Spain and Germany so it's all men this is ok if you playing race cars it's okay Mario go-karting it's okay it seems to be okay no music yes there's no problem but it has to fall under the Islamic guidelines now if you have something that is an Islamic of these games of making movies then this becomes Haram watching movies how long what kind of movies are you gonna watch she's had a movie share or they had a movies i'll be more than grateful if you can show me some most movies either have women nudity violence music or the content itself is haram like sorcery and magic and stuff like this so all of this is haram you should avoid this you should not a muslim is not wasting his time watching such things now if you're asking about what's the running on making them i would say no this is not permissible you're making people in 3d you're the one who's the software programmer making these images and and live people no this is exactly what the prophet has curse those doing it and Allah knows best check today we know that there are families living in different parts of the world for example the Sun baby in Saudi the mother may be in India so if our relative dies so how long is it permissible to keep him there for example they say the Sun is coming from UK or the daughter is coming to see the deceased so can we keep the disease for maybe six seven hours or should we buddy-buddy the decision I have said this before and I said if it's for a half a day maximum a day we can tolerate this this is acceptable but if it's more than that the body would decompose and we would be postponing it for no reason now the sun or the daughter is coming from a different country but for just to have the last look this is not something that is of urgency because if the disease was a righteous person and you're keeping him this long if he were to talk would he approve of it you see come on I want to go to my paradise the deceased once is put in grave his grave is a part of paradise there's a window of paradise bringing all things unimaginable from that window so you're keeping him away from that there for any half a day is acceptable maximum a day but other than that no it's not we conclude the chapter that deals with funeral prayer and funeral rites and the prayer in general and in shallow next time we meet we begin discussing the book that deals with as the cat and until then p.m. manila assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh"
