  "transcript": "from among all the prophets muham was the last as his was a mission of the greatest task there was only moral degeneration people cl to Idol adoration for all nations alhamdulillah we're still studying the biography of one of the greatest Companions of the Prophet Alat wasam a man who has the right to be proud of being the cousin of the Prophet Alat wasam the son-in-law of the Prophet Alat wasam a man who has the right to be the nephew of hamah ABD mutalib the lion of Allah and to be the brother of the Martyr jab AB Talib who is known as ja whom Allah gave him to wings to fly in Paradise with the angels a man who has all the right to be proud of being the father of two of the Masters of the youth in Paradise and they are alassan and Al Hussein may Allah be pleased with them all we're studying the biography of Ali AB Talib may Allah be pleased with him Ali was very knowledgeable and he used to be considered among the scholars of the companions of the Prophet Alat wasam they used to go to him and seek his guidance and seek his advice in whatever problems that may occur Omar himself may Allah be pleased with him used to go and consult him and he would always say Ali is the man and he got him out of so many problems that Omar could not find a solution for Omar may Allah be pleased with him used to send to Ali Whenever there were cases so that Ali would judge these cases and he would solve the dispute among those who were disputing that was because the prophet sallallahu alaihi Al wasallam when he praised and complimented the companions of the Prophet Alam he said that Abu Bakr is the most merciful to my nation to my umah Omar is the toughest in Allah's religion is the most bad bashful and Ali is the best to judge so the best one to judge a disputed issue is aliali may Allah be pleased with him Ali and the companions of the Prophet Alam followed only the instructions of the Prophet Alam followed only the Sun and would not follow their whims and desires they would not follow what we call nowadays logic unfortunately there are lots of socalled Muslims who refuse to submit their will to Allah and decide that whatever is logical to me I would follow and if it's not logical even if it's from the Quran or from the Sunnah I'll reject it I will not accept it and these so-called Muslims call themselves to be educated ated men of intellect and on the contrary they have nothing to relate to intellect because they refuse to follow the Sunnah unless it matches their rotten minds and thoughts and this is exactly the methodology that Satan followed which resulted in him entering Hellfire for etern ET it when Allah Asel instructed everyone to prostrate to Adam when he created Adam peace be upon him the only one who refused to do this was Satan and when Allah Asel questioned him and asked him why did you not prostrate to what I have created with my own two hands Satan said I am better than him I was created from fire and he was created from clay so logically speaking I am better so how do you want me to comply with your instruction and prostrate to this and that is why he was doomed in Hell forever similarly a lot of those who claim to be Muslims reject the Quran reject the Sunnah because it is not logical to them alali may Allah be pleased with with him set the example to us as Muslims and he said by Allah if religion was by Logic then we would have wiped the bottom of our shoes and socks instead of wiping on top of it because this is where the dirt is but this is the Sunnah whenever he wants to wipe over the socks or the shoes this is in performing Evolution or performing woodo he has only to wipe over the top not every single bit of it but he just passes his hands over the socks or over the shoes this is the Sunnah and this shows us how the companions of the Prophet Alat wasam followed the Sunnah to the letter no objections no questions asked this is what the prophet Al said this what we will comply with a man comes to the prophet Alat one of his companions with a golden ring in his finger the prophet Alam angrily takes the golden ring and throws it on the ground and says why does one of you go to a fiery Stone a stone of fire and puts it in his hand and the prophet leaves Alat wasam his companions say go and take your ring give it to one of your female relatives your wife your sister or sell it and make use of the money the companion says by Allah I will not take something that the prophet Alat wasam threw on the ground this is compliance this is obedience not what we find among so-called Muslims nowadays who reject the Quran and who reject the Sunnah those as mentioned earlier there are people who love Talib and they are among the Sunnah followers they love him they respect him and they pray to Allah that he would join us with him in Paradise but on the two extremes there are people who praised him above his status and gave him attributes that could only be to Allah the almighty and some of them even went further to say that when the arch angel Gabriel peace be upon Him came with the message from Allah came with the Revelation he was misguided and instead of giving it to Ali he gave it to the prophet Alat wasam he did a mistake he made a mistake of course this is nonsense and whoever says this is not a Muslim he's a cafir because he's doubting Allah's judgment and he is accusing Allah of not knowing who to reveal to and to continue in this mistake for 23 years is this a Muslim definitely not he is one of the grandchildren of Abdullah IB SA the Jew the one who caused all these calamities and sparked all these problems to and afterwards to Ali may Allah be pleased with them both and how is that this is inshallah what we will know after the break so stay [Music] tuned those who go to Extremes in loving Ali ABI Talib they usually say and call Ali may Allah be pleased with him by the name of Al IM and instead of saying may Allah be pleased with him they say may Allah honor his face and unfortunately some of the people from fell into this mistake and trap and they themselves started calling Ali may Allah be pleased with him by Al IM what is may Allah honor his face they said that this is because he never prostrated to an idol before unlike the other Companions and this is a grave mistake either you call all those who came before him from the righteous guided rulers cffs of Islam either you call them all Imam and you would say also which is unadvisable they are all leaders yes they are all imams yes this is without any doubt but the terminology may Allah honor his face is an innovated one Allah when he mentioned the companions of the Prophet Alam he mentioned them in the Quran and said Allah was pleased with them so when we mention the name of Ali we say may Allah be pleased with him not may Allah honor him or honor his face because this is innovated so this is one of the mistakes that those who went into extreme with our beloved companion Ali they use these terminologies and they use this so that it would pave the way for them to say even more and more things Al Talib may Allah be pleased with him of course married the daughter of the Prophet alhat wasam the daughter of his cousin Fatima B Muhammad may Allah be pleased with her and it was said that it was a revelation from Allah because when the prophet Alam went to Medina lots of the companions came and proposed to fa of course through her father the prophet and the prophet would not accept any of them until Ali was instructed and advised by some of his companions you're unmarried why don't you propose to Fatima and he did and the prophet Alat wasam accepted so it was said that it was a revelation from Allah that Ali will only marry Fatima and he loved Fatima a lot but being who he is he thought of marrying another one and this is an Islamic tradition it was practiced by the prophet Alat wasam and all of the companions almost all of the companions polygamy marrying another wife a third wife up to four wives was and it still is a necessity of life because we have more women than men and if you do the math the surplus of women will only practice their nature of beautifying themselves and looking for a partner or a spouse well Ali may Allah be pleased with him thought off and it was a rumor that Ali will marry and who was he going to marry he was going to marry the daughter of am Hisham and who is amam he is is Abu jahal the number one enemy of Islam who was killed in the Battle of Badr of course his daughter was a Muslim so this was the rumor and when the prophet Alat wasam heard this rumor he gave a speech on the pulpit and he praised Allah and then said that I have given my daughters to men who have honored them such as he is from B so I gave him my daughter and he has fulfilled and he was kind and he was a gentleman and I've heard that my cousin is thinking of remarrying and by Allah this is the prophet saying this and by Allah this would not happen that the daughter of the messenger of Allah and the daughter of the enemy of Allah would come under one man and that is Al Talib some women where most of the women took this Hadith which is in theah it's extremely authentic there's no doubt about that but they took this Hadith and said to their husbands and to their relatives who were thinking of remarrying they said look at the prophet Alat wasam he objected to someone marrying a second wife over his daughter so we can't be more Roman than the Romans if we reject this if we object to this we're just following the Sunnah this is not right you have to finish the whole Hadith the prophet in his speech sallallahu alaihi wasallam said by Allah I do not make something that is permissible forbidden and I do not make something that is forbidden permissible meaning that it is lawful it is permissible for Ali to marry two three or four wives he's not making this forbidden but the prophet goes on to justify he says but FAA is part of me and whatever harms Fatima harms me and that is why if Ali wants to remarry let him set Fatima free let him divorce her and remarry again because if he remarries while he's married to Fatima by hurting Fatima with this he will be hurting me and hurting the prophet nullifies Islam and that is why the prophet wanted to protect Ali's Islam from being void and nuli and that is why he said I do not make something permissible forbidden I would not change things that are permissible into forbidden things but he wants to remarry he may do so but he knows what to do and that is to leave Fatima of course Ali may Allah be pleased with him would never do such a thing so he changed his mind and he did not marry until Fatima may Allah be pleased with her died Al Talib from Fatima we know that he had Al Hassan and Al Hussein and the prophet saidat wasam they are the top the leaders the masters of the youth in Paradise may Allah be pleased with them all Al Hussein was martyred by the people of Iraq and by the Army sent to fight him and whoever killed him is among the worst enemies of Islam because he killed the love of the Prophet Alat Al Hussein may Allah be pleased with him Ali may Allah be pleased with him had from Fatima also Zab B Ali who was married to Abdullah jab AB Talib she was married to her cousin and they also the couple Ali and Fatima may Allah be pleased with them they also had a second daughter and this was umum and um Kum was very young when may Allah be pleased with him proposed to Ali and asked her hand in marriage so Ali may Allah be pleased with him said she's your niece in the sense that I'm your brother and she's my daughter and she's very young for you and he said Omar may Allah be pleased with him I'm not looking for marriage as such I'm looking for a connection by lineage to the prophet Alat wasam so by marrying the granddaughter of the Prophet Alat wasam then I would be related to him the prophet is married to my daughter and now I'd like to marry his granddaughter and she was like 11 12 years old maybe a bit l a bit more and he agreed to that and Ali gave his daughter in marriage toar and this causes a big problem to those who talk negatively about Ali and Omar may Allah be pleased with him these deviant sects who claim to be Muslim and insult Abu Bakr Omar and insult and the majority of the Companions and accusing them of being apostates except six or seven of the companions they themselves are not Muslims when they claim to love Ali may Allah be pleased with him and say that he was a fierce Warrior he was a brave man and he was so and so and he was by Allah he definitely was but then they accuse Omar may Allah be pleased with him of cheting Ali of betraying him of assuming the instead of giving it to him they say all of these lies against Omar and all of these are Lies when they come to this fact that Omar married umum the daughter of Ali and Ali gave his daughter in marriage to this so-called enemy of Islam the traitor the one who betrayed us the one who took and deprived us from what is lawfully ours when they say that Ali did this it's either one of two either Ali may Allah be pleased with him was one of the biggest cowards in Islam because no normal Muslim would agree to this in giving his daughter in marriage to an enemy this is cowardice this is the Great signs of a coward and Ali was not a coward so it's either this or whatever they say is a big false and a big lie and this is the right thing by claiming that Ali had problems with Omar and he accused Omar of betraying and of lying on deceiving and depriving him from what was lawfully his and that is ruling the Muslims by accusing Ali with this they're accusing him of being a coward which is not Ali may Allah be pleased with him acknowledged the fact that Abu Bakr was the best among the companions of the Prophet Alam then Omar then this was reported by Muhammad that is the son of Ali may Allah be pleased with him from one of the slave women he had his name is Muhammad Muhammad Ali and they call him Muhammad because his mother was from bif so he asked his father who is the best among the companions of the Prophet Alam he said Abu Bakr Ali is saying this he said then who he said Omar and then said who he said which means that Ali may Allah be pleased with him acknowledge this fact which those deviant sex are trying to conceive are trying to hide and trying to deceive people and cheat them into considering Abu Bakr Omar and to be enemies of Al to be enemies of Ali and the descendants of the House of the Prophet Alat wasam and this is a great fabrication Ali may Allah be pleased with him would never give his daughter to a bad Muslim let alone to an Infidel as they say Omar may Allah be pleased with him he and Abu Bakr are the Masters are the leaders are the top people in Paradise of the old generation while Hassan Hussein are the same to the youth so Abu Bakr and Omar were the best of the umah and this was acknowledged by Ali may Allah be pleased with him and whoever says otherwise is not to be considered a Muslim this is all the time we have for today's program so until we meet next time"
