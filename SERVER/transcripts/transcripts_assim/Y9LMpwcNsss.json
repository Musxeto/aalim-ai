  "transcript": "so brother Faris he's a medical doctor and he work the graveyard shift or the night shift as they call it so he finishes about nine o'clock in the morning and he goes to bed because he was awake the whole night so he has an option either to wait until he prays Lahore and combines with a tosser and sleeps from 12 o'clock for example in Rio that's 12:10 the Adhan until Maghrib time which is approximately 6:45 p.m. and this way he has enough sleep and can continue or he goes to sleep but most likely he will miss the horn because he's dead tired and all the alarms in the world most likely won't be able to wake him up and if it does it would be difficult to go back to sleep and then pray us wake up for us ER and it will confuse his daily routine alhamdulillah in cases that are rare like yours there is always an exemption there's always means of making things easy so if this is the case in your case and you know yourself that you cannot wake up for the go back to sleep wake up for us or go back to sleep and then wake for Maghrib some people are easy to do this I for example hamdullah I can do this I can just switch on and off maybe it's age I don't know so with the grace of Allah I can go to sleep for 15 or 20 minutes and then wake up for salat even if I was up the whole night for for half an hour before fajar is sufficient but other people are not like this so for your case if you are of that extreme and you are unable to wake up for door or answer combining it will become permissible insha'Allah virgin"
