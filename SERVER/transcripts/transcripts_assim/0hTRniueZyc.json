  "transcript": "Faisal from Bangladesh. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh, I hope you are doing good. Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatu. I'm doing great Alhamdulillah. How can I help you Faisal? I have a question. I'll give you a small scenario regarding interest. Let's say I have four bank accounts and from each bank account I get $100 each. So I'll have $400 in the bank. So my question is, I have $1000 of Salat income cash at home. So can I make the intention that I'm taking out $400 of the interest money which I have in the bank from the cash I have at home and give it away? There is no problem in doing so Akhi, at all. Because the interest money itself is not marked or labeled to be Haram itself. This particular dollar that they had given you in one of your bank accounts is itself Haram. You cannot touch it. No. So you can take this and take another dollar or the $400 from your $1000 cash in your home and give it and cleanse your wealth from it. And the best is to terminate any interest-based account you have unless there is a real necessity or you're unable to do so. But to have four different bank accounts that generate Riba, there's something wrong. So I hope this answers your question."
