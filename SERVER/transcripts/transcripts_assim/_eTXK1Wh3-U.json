  "transcript": "can you explain me about the ruling of U something called which is actually seclusion um seclusion with Allah as some dies say about it that it's very beneficial that um we go to a Masid or we just sit in the prayer mat or in some room and do with Allah like making zik closing the eyes thinking only about Allah and uh doing the like what things like praying and then making and reciting Quran on a continuous basis so is this permissible and if so like what are the benefits we can gain from this there isn't any specific mentioning of or seclusion during the day and night that a person has to as for the Sunnah devote himself at that prescribed time except in which is on the last 10 nights of Ramadan this is the confirmed Sunnah other than that any quality time you spend whether on your prayer mat whether on your office whether while driving whether while uh hiking or walking or just sitting uh uh anywhere and contemplating upon Allah's creation Allah's might and power Allah's uh greatness whether this is accompanied by Vick or Quran or prayers all of this is positive and it cleanses your heart it refreshes your mind and gives you a boast so that it would allow you to go in this world recharg and energized but there isn't any specific time that no no this is the time you have to sit other than the times prescribed in the Shar such as after F till sunrise you stay in the Masjid making Vick or waiting from one prayer to the other waiting for the coming prayer to come or going to Friday early by 3 or 4 hours and wait for the sermon to begin all of these are blessed times mentioned in the Quran or in the Sunnah that we can uh follow but there isn't any specific timing other than that and Allah Knows Best"
