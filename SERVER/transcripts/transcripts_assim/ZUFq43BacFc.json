  "title": "Is reciting Surah Ikhlas after every Surah after Fateha in prayer, from the sunnah? Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "10 weird says um one of his friends his uncle that is his uncle when he prays he recites the fatty huh and then recites another Surah and he concludes with reciting suratulas so he asked his uncle why are you doing such a thing and his uncle said because this is the Sunnah so is my uncle correct or not well to say it is the Sunnah is incorrect why didn't the prophet Allah approve of it the answer is yes but to say it is a Sunnah when the prophet himself had never done it and none of the companions had ever done it no this indicates that it is not a Sunnah per se rather it is permissible it is like saying is eating lizard desert lizard meat what we called as a bob the the big desert lizard the prophet Allah was presented with the food and was told that this was Desert lizard meat so he refrained Khalid who was a great warrior and these Warriors usually eat such things immediately went and started eating and the prophet was watching so he was asked is it haram the prophet said no but it is something that I find distasteful I'm not used to it in my country in my region among my people we're not used to it so I don't like it now did the prophet approve Allah Khalid eating this desert lizard meat the answer is yes can anyone say that eating it is a Sunnah yes yes there's no then likewise reciting after the Surah is not a Sunnah but it is permissible and the greater of course to those who don't know the origin of the the story The Hadith goes as follows a man used to lead the congregation The Companions and he used to always recite in addition to the Surah either before it or after it so his companions complained to him and said listen either you think that it's a beautiful Surah then is sufficient read it alone or you don't think that it's not sufficient then don't read it and read the other one alone he said well whether you like it or not this is what I'm gonna do if you don't like me leading choose someone else they thought among themselves that he's the best of us knowledgeable in the Quran in his righteous and older checks all the boxes so they went to the prophet Allah and told him and the prophet is awesome ask them to ask him why is he reading it so when they told him that the prophet is asking you why are you reading it he said because it contains the description of Allah and I love it for that so they went back the prophet Islam and they told him and the prophet said Allah tell him that his love for this Surah admitted him to Jannah admitted him to Paradise so lots of the people when they read this Hadith it clicks in their mind and said whoa I want to be like him I want to be loved by Allah I want to be admitted to Jannah so I'm going to recite the Surah not knowing that the prophet himself had never done this nor his companions which means that it is a permissible thing but it is not at all part of the Sunnah so I hope this answers your uncle's confusion ah"
