  "title": "Sclavery in Islam prisoners of war",
  "transcript": "this is something that Allah made permissible something that the prophet told us that it is part of Islam as as long as there are Wars between Muslims and non-muslims and it is something of Mercy to these slaves in modern times prisoners of Wars are thrown into jails and in a lot of countries they are executed as in Shan in Bosnia heroa more than 7,000 prisoners of Wars men children and women were all executed on one day under the eyes of the DCH peacekeeping Force so-called peacekeeping they were the Protectors of these uh uh uh serbs and they helped them by protecting them so in Islam we do not execute prisoners of Wars we give them the chance to see Islam we enslave them so we make them an act active member of the society by making them slaves that work that do good to the society and not only this they can be sold they can be bought and they can be freed and if you look at Islam you would be amazed by the instructions in the Quran and the Sunnah for slave for freeing a slave so if a person by accident who was driving he runs into an accident he runs over a person and kills him or his car uh rolls over and he kills the passengers he have for each one he kills Allah though it was an accident it's a mistake it was not intended Allah tells instructs him to first of all as a form of repentance fre slave if someone makes an oath or swears by saying I will not go to that house tomorrow and then he changes his mind Allah tells him free is late if someone makes a mistake and has intercourse with his wife during the daytime of Ramadan while he was fasting first thing to do free a slave if someone makes theab and repents free a slave if someone does this if someone does that so many things Allah tells you fre slate fre slate fre slate which means that Islam encourages you to free slaves but the concept of slavery is there in Islam as long as there are Wars between the Muslims and the non-muslims and there are uh uh uh prisoners of War having said that this is the only source of slave in Islam unlike other religions so if someone for example goes to Thailand or to borma and he's approached by a man he says listen why don't you buy my daughter and she is his daughter but he's so poor so he tells you listen I buy my daughter for $200 that's a cash one would say m i could have this uh uh slave girl and and and she could be mine she could work at the house this is forbidden it's not allowed in Islam if someone hijacks another and sells it to you as a slave this is not allowed in Islam only through Wars between the Muslims and the non-muslims so even if there was a war between a Muslim and a Muslim this does not allow us to enslave our Muslim brothers and Allah Knows Best"
