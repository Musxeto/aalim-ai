  "transcript": "release from Sudan says how does Allah accept repentance allah azza wajal one of his beautiful names is at a web the one who continues to repent so often and allah tells us in the hadith that his hand is extended for those who want to repent in the morning if they sin in at night and he extends his hand for those who want to repent at night if they sin in the morning and the doors and gates of repentance are open until the sun rises from the West then this is when no sin no repentance would be accepted so Allah opens the gates of repentance until the Sun rises from the West then this is it or until a person is on his dying bed and his soul is about to exit his body this is when repentance is not accepted so how does Allah accept your repentance first of all you have to be sincere so whatever you are doing which is sinful you leave it for the sake of Allah secondly you have to have deep remorse and the Prophet said a little awesome in an authentic hadith remorse is repentance so like saying Hajj is a lafa remorse is repentance if you repent and you have this burning ache in your heart which is remorse you're remorseful of what you had done then Allah Allah would forgive you thirdly you have to quit the sin you don't continue doing the sin and say inshallah in fifth of May I will stop no you have to quit immediately fourth you have to intend firmly not to do it again so you quit and you're remorseful and you're repenting and it's for sake of Allah as usual but you intend not to go back to it some of them repent but yet called the travel agent saying the hotel you booked us in was awful he didn't have a nightclub or a bar next August in 2018 we want the same destination but pick us a better hotel what kind of repentance is this he's intending to do it again then Allah does not accept his repentance and fifthly it has to be in a time that Allah accepts it and I told you that it is not accepted when the Sun rises from the West"
