  "transcript": "jakob from china my question is i i started memorizing the quran i memorized a couple of chapters so sometimes i so sometimes even if i come back like in my room i am alone if i'm reciting in prayers i stay on my mind i used to have that feeling like maybe someone is behind you like you are trying to show so ask yourself this question direct question am i doing this to impress people or am i doing it for the sake of allah 99.9 percent you will get the answer of no i'm doing it for the sake of allah then you acknowledge that this is from shaytan this is one of shaytan's tricks to prevent you from memorizing the quran number one to prevent you from leading prayers because you're the most among your friends who recite the quran and memorize the quran most and thirdly to prevent you from pursuing good deeds because every single time you are going to attempt to do something that is beneficial that is considered to be a good deed shaytan will come and stop you and say you're doing it to show off you're not doing it for the sins for the sake of allah you're not sincere and this is where ocd comes and rises from if you listen to shaytan he's your fierce enemy how would you believe him if your fierce enemy comes to you and offers you a glass of orange juice and says drink this is good for you and you know he's your fierce enemy would you drink it definitely not most likely he had poisoned it if not definitely so how do you listen to the advice coming to you from shaytan doesn't make any sense so ignore these whispers say to yourself i am doing it for the sake of allah and i'm seeking only the pleasure of allah if people praise me for that well this is a bonus i'm not looking for it but if they do this is a gift from allah azza and allah knows best you"
