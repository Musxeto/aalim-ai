  "title": "How to give Dawah like YOU Sheikh? assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "Mustafa from the Netherlands Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh how can we give a good dawah just like you? This is not an easy question ya Mustafa. It requires that you know what you're giving dawah in. So I'm not good in comparative religion. I cannot sit with Christians and Jews and give them dawah in their books and scriptures because this is not my cup of tea. But for you, if you know Tawheed, your dawah is to speak to them and say to them, there is only one God. And they would argue, atheists would reject this, Christians would say, no there are three and one and one and three and like the three musketeers. No, we can prove to them because your knowledge of Tawheed is very easy. You can give dawah in that. So depending on the amount of knowledge, you can give dawah in what you know. What you don't know, you have to refrain and say, I don't know, I cannot give dawah. So the more you gain knowledge, Allah would put barakah in it when you spread it and share it with others. When you conceive it and conceal it for yourself and not share it with others, Allah will take the barakah away and Allah knows best."
