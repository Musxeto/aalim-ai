  "transcript": "is it okay not to talk and dislike a Muslim brother who has a beard praise but is racist and gives you no importance we have to know that it is possible for a Muslim to love and hate at the same time and this is the methodology and the CLE and the a ofah we can love a person and at the same time we can hate him it's not all black or all white I love an individual for the characteristics that are Islamic in him so I love him because he prays in the Masjid I loves him because he has a beard he does not wear his trousers below his ankles I love him because he is generous he is following the Sunnah all the time but I hate in him that he is not kind to his wife that he sometimes lie that he may be not very kind with his parents or that he is rude or that he is a little bit arrogant so we can have mixed feelings over an individual the problem with Muslims nowadays they go to extremes and they do not have this balance so you either love someone to the extent that you may Elevate him to the level of prophethood so you believe that this scholar this this student of knowledge this friend of yours is the perfect person he has no problems at all and you don't notice any of his shortcomings at all and you think that he's the perfect person or on the opposite side you discredit a person you hate a person regardless of his good attributes regardless of his goodness so just because he's Wellen and his trousers go be below his ankles you discredit him whatever someone mentions him he say this guy is a bad Muslim he's not practicing he's in hell this guy might be far better than you at the side of Allah this guy is so kind and respectful to his parents that Allah may have forgiven all of his sin this guy gives half of his money for charity this guy always helps those who need help poor ill weak this guy always always connects to his next of kin this guy does a lot of things to teach Islam and to promote Islam while all what you have to show for is a long beard and a short uh uh pair of trousers is this Islam definitely not therefore we cannot go to this extreme we have to have the balance and this is why Allah tells us in the Quran that the people of the book though are though they are cfir they are disbelievers Allah tells them In fairness and Justice that among them there are people whom if you trust them with one din one currency so one Euro he would not give it to you unless you keep on persisting to take it back and among them the Jews and the Christians if you entrust them with a whole wagon full of gold he will pay it back to you on time full and this is the way of being fair Allah did not tell us that no all Jews and Christians are stingy and they're cheating and they're Liars at all no this is not the case so we have to have this fairness and balance and look at the good side and also look at the shortcomings and balance between them and Allah Knows Best"
