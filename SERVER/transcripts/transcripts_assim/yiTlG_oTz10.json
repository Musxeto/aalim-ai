  "title": "Misconception about cutting your nails before or after Friday prayer - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "rajab says is the sunnah of cutting nails valid after salatul juma or before the friday prayer well Rajab I have to correct what you had just said that there is no such ritual neither before nor after the Friday prayer this is a misconception among a lot of the Muslims they believe that before the Friday sermon before attending the Friday prayers it is part of the Sunnah to clip your nails to cut short your mustache to remove your pubic and underarm hair but this is not found in the Sun at all yes generally speaking these mentioned acts are Sunnah not related to Friday rather they're related to not exceeding 40 days not having them too long to be offensive but doing it every Friday in thinking that this is part of the rituals of Friday is a wrong thing and a misconception so if you feel the need to clip your nails whether you do it on a Thursday whether you do it before the prayer on a Friday or after you come from prayer or you do it on a Saturday this is all the same and there is nothing more rewarding than the other and Allah knows best"
