  "transcript": "and finally a sister says I do not know how to read Arabic in Ramadan should I read the Arabic transliteration on or the English translation so that I can understand which one would give more benefit to the believer or should I do both first of all it's an issue of great importance to know that transliteration meaning that you write the Quran verses in English letters or Latin letters this is not permissible it is not permissible to write the Quran other than the earth manic script let alone to write it in a different language because this is part of preserving the Quran our Quran has been preserved for the past fifteen centuries no religious Scripture on earth can claim this and it is preserved in the same language that about 400 million Arabs speak it give or take couple of millions elsewhere so to preserve it as allah as allah ordered us to do we must not manipulate it or write it in other than the arabic script arabic language so reading the translation transliteration is writing it with and reading it is not a recommended thing to do the best thing for you to do as in an Arab is to play the cassette or the DVD or on YouTube on YouTube listen to the Quran this is reward as if you're reading it and while listening to it you can also read the tough seer or the translation into your own language"
