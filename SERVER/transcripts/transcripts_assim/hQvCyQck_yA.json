  "transcript": "shik Asim alakim internationally reputed scholar a writer and expert in contemporary F and he's a regular lecturer in television channels like peace TV and Huda television sir we request you to inaugurate the National Conference of professional students by mujahid students moment ran by Kerala n [Music] [Music] alhamd I did not understand a single word for the past 15 minutes so I don't know what the brothers had said therefore I'm going to start from scratch and I hope that you understand my English it's a little bit weak but inshallah your English is better to enable you to understand what I will say it is an honor and a privilege for me to visit Kerala for the first time I've visited India maybe 20 30 times but was never fortunate to visit this region before until I got this invitation from The Honorable organizers and seeing these faces I remember seeing similar faces in the mirror years ago and I'm quite old I was born in the last century so you may not relate to this anyhow what I see is mallah a group of enthusiastic Muslims planning to be tomorrow's professionals which is a very positive and enlightening idea and concept however if I get up in the morning at 6:00 after fer fill up my car with fuel Fu and get in my car with my coffee and say bismah and I go and drive without any objective I will reach nowhere very quickly even if I drive for a whole month because I do not have an objective you Muslims mashallah you have a clear objective alhamdulillah as professionals so if you ask anyone what is your objective he said to finish my degree with honors and maybe do my masters and to get a decent job in a reputable company inshallah with a very big salary inshallah and then I can buy my Suzuki Ninja inshallah and maybe if I get promoted I will buy a Toyota Corolla air conditioned and it will be and then I will marry a beautiful woman and have a beautiful family and my wife will take care of my kids while I stay all night with my friends and then die if you have this objective then you're not a proper Muslim because you do not know why Allah created you Allah did not create you for this Allah says in I have not created the Gin nor the humans except to worship me so are you doing this do you have this objective do you think that you will live on this Earth for more than a 100 years if you're lucky you live 150 years and then what it's your grave that would take you either to heaven or to hell have you thought of this does this mean that we have to sit in the Masjid and worship Allah till the rest of the of Our Lives no worshiping Allah Asel can be the easiest thing you do you can breathe worshiping Allah Asel if you have the good intention and that is why as potential Muslim professionals you have to work on your objective what is your objective from now from today my objective is to please Allah Asel and how can I do this if I'm studying engineering if I'm studying medicine if I'm thinking of becoming tomorrow's physicist well look back in history and you will find that what you're studying today came from the Muslims algebra chemistry physics mathematics medicine the Pioneers in all of these medicines that you're studying were the Muslims and the non-muslims admit of this because this is history and history doesn't lie so you can revive history once again and worship Allah at the same time by excelling in your profession by having the OB objective of pleasing Allah through benefiting Humanity through benefiting Islam through progressing in the thing you do if you succeed in doing that then when you go to the gym to work out with the intention of having a healthy good body you are worshiping Allah if you sit with your family and eat with them food in order to make them happy you are worshiping Allah not only that once you get married inshallah and you put the morsel in your wife's mouth or the sisters cook a decent meal to her husband intending Allah's sake she is and he is worshiping Allah Asel our religion is the most beautiful religion on Earth but the sound system is one of the worst so I hope they manage to fix it so our religion is beautiful our religion is easy our religion is peaceful and it makes you the happiest man walking on Earth if you know your creator if you know what he wants from you Allah does not tell you not to do this and that and that and that and that is it Allah Asel created everything in this earth to serve you and the only thing he wants from you is to serve him so you can succeed in doing this by excelling in your profession and by knowing the religion of Allah that would help you come closer to him the almighty once we know that he wants us to worship him then everything we do every word we say for his sake in this case we will inshallah be worshiping Allah as he wants and everything would come our way as Allah asael wants again it's an honor and a privilege for me to address these beautiful faces this believing faces the faces that has the Quran in their heart look at the others others today is Friday night where is everybody else in nightclubs in places that draw them away from Allah you come here to hear something that would draw you closer to Allah and by Allah the almighty there is nothing better on this Earth more than remembering Allah and getting to know Allah Asel we have a problem between between those who focus on D and those who focus on others than the D the real professional Muslim is the one who can strike this balance and this is a preview of my lecture tomorrow morning inshallah where I will be addressing with the grace of Allah the responsibilities of a Muslim professional with this I leave you and just for attending and may Allah reward the organizers for making this event possible and I pray to Allah the almighty as he gathered Us in this blessed place to remember Allah and to learn what would benefit us in this life and in the Hereafter I ask him that he gathers us on the day of judgment in his paradise in his Mercy where only those who are blessed and favored would be allowed to enter that"
