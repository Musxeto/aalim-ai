  "transcript": "Imran from India Assalamu Alaikum Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Wa'laykumussalam Wa Rahmatullahi Wa Barakatuh Sheikh may Allah give you an air-conditioner May Allah Azza Wa Jal make you an expert in air-conditioning What else? Jazak Allah Sheikh my question is the masjid that I pray in the imam after every namaz says calling Muhammad Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam Noor e Arshihi So can I pray in this masjid? Because I don't know if he is committing Kufr or not This depends on what he meant by the Prophet being Noor Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam If he is indicating and if he says it clearly that the Prophet is created from Allah's Noor This is blasphemous and Kufr And you must not pray behind that individual But if he is just saying an ambiguous word that he is Noor And in the sense he is Noor of guidance and the likes There is no problem in praying But it's best that you choose Ahl-e-Hadith masjid Or a masjid that follows the right aqeedah of Ahl-e-Sunnah wa-l-Jamaah And Allah knows best"
