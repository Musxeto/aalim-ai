  "transcript": "Misbah from Pakistan. Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh. Wa Alaikumussalam. Sheikh my wife saw a dream in which one of her deceased family member instructs her to do something good like giving charity or something and many times for the past year she's having this dream. She wants to know what should she do? Should she follow this dream and what to do? Such dreams can be generated by your subconscious and can be a glad tiding from Allah Azza Wa Jal if what the dream says makes you happy, makes you optimistic and it's a good thing such as doing good deeds and giving away in charity. So there's no problem Alhamdulillah as long as this was telling her to do something that Allah loves which is giving charity. Giving charity is something that is recommended and good as well."
