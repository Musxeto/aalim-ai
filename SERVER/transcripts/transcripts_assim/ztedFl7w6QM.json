  "transcript": "zaina from Pakistan Sheikh I wanted to ask things which are Halal like uh applying serums or moisturizers become Haram if a girl doesn't cover up like it will be for beautification so does it become Haram for her to use such things that's it thank you okay I will answer inshallah says would applying creams and makeups and things to beautify oneself without wearing the hijab be sinful the answer is yes but if you mean would applying these creams and makeups be sinful on its own the answer is no this is separate and not wearing the hijab is a separate issue so if a woman is adorning himself to her husband to her maharams to other women in her privacy known and mahram men can see that there's no problem in that the problem is when she goes out without hijab so even if she goes out without hijab and without applying these creams and makeups she's sinful but if she Accra she applies what beautifies her more and more she's twice as sinful and Allah Knows Best [Music] and have you ever taken a counseling session with me go to my website and you will find counseling sessions and apply for one if you can afford it that's good for you if you cannot you're entitled for one free session and this is for everybody if they can affirm by Allah that they cannot afford it because they're poor I'll give them one free session without a problem a full half an hour so come to me and let's speak about it inshallah within the following two days or three days and the evening I will uh try and seek Allah's guidance to solve the problem once and for Allah"
