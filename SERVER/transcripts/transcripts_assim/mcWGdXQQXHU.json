  "title": "The Role Model (Prophet ﷺ‎) (16) - The way he woke up - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "today we're going to talk about the way he woke up from sleep and as we've mentioned earlier that the prophet dealt with sleeping and waking up as a form of worship as a ritual that is surrounded by athkar and deeds and tasks that would draw us closer to Allah azzawajal would wake up he would say alhamdulillah a very short concise Dua praise be to Allah who has brought us back to life after causing us to die and to him is the resurrection and as we all know sleeping is a Brethren of death and a person who's asleep is almost in the state of death this is why in Paradise there is no sleeping no one sleeps in Paradise it's joyful time for eternity because death is no longer long longer existing in the Hereafter neither in Hell nor in heaven and whenever the prophet salallahu woke up from his sleep he would start by brushing his teeth so that any older would disappear so he used to use well I didn't bring my mustache today did I no I did he used to use this miswak and he used to do this sideways with his mouth so that when he recites the Quran the smell of his mouth would be pleasant we know that when you go to bed by default sleep would cause your mouth to not smell in a nice way so he used to begin with the siwak then he would perform Moodle and why would he perform mudo the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam as reported by buhari and Muslim told us that when we go to sleep Satan ties three knots at the back of our heads stating with each knot sleep there is a long night ahead of you meaning you can wake up a little bit later you can wake up half an hour an hour later until the break of dawn maybe until the day is up this is how Satan works so he ties three knots if the individual wakes up and remembers Allah like the prophets Allah alhamdulillah or the other duas we will mention shortly inshallah so if he remembers Allah one knot is untied and if he performs wudu a second not is untied and if he stands up for prayer the third knot is untied so when he wakes up in the morning he wakes up fresh feeling good or otherwise if none of these three were to take place then he would wake up lazy and feeling down now we said that the prophet would begin with it is worth noting that there is a Hadith where the Prophet said that we should not insert our hands in a bucket before washing it three times and the prophet Justified this by saying because one of you during his sleep does not know where his hands had been now remember this Hadith was stated when they did not have faucets so the only containers of water available were buckets so in order to dip your hands in or to scoop some water you had to dip your hands in and this is what the prophet salallahu told us not to do and he said you don't know where your hand spent the night some people thought that this is referring to impurities in najasa and this is not true yes it is a possibility that you may touch your private parts while asleep or someone's else private parts but this doesn't mean that your hands are soiled and there is najasa washing the hands after waking up is a form of worship because even if I were for example to wear my gloves and go to bed in the moment I wake up I take off my gloves would I be Exempted from washing my hands because I know where my hands were and they were protected with these gloves the answer is no you have to wash your hands as well because this is a form of worship now the prophet also sallallahu ordered us when we wake up to do or to blow our noses after rinsing our noses three times and he said that Satan or the devil sleeps at your nostrils so when you wake up you don't see shaytan you don't say see the devil but you comply with the instruction and you rinse your nose and you blow it three times as the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam has instructed you to do there are other narrations which stated that the prophet saw Allah please with them and with his father whenever he woke up in the middle of the night he either wiped his face with his hands trying to wipe the traces of sleep or in an authentic Hadith he would wash his hands and face recite the last 10 verses of Surat Ali Imran and then goes to bed again to wake up again afterwards recite the ten verses of Ali Imran and perform a wudu which is moderate not perfect not uh the minimum but in between and then commence or start his night prayers or to hajjud so this is also part of the confirmed Sunnah one of the duas the beautiful duas that the prophet sallallahu alaihi used to observe when he wakes up in the middle of the night is the following long Dua it's a beautiful Dua but it shows you how the prophets dealt with sleeping and waking up as a form of worship and getting close to Allah so the Hadith goes whenever he woke up for night prayer he used to say oh Allah to you praise or to you be praised you are the light of the heavens and the Earth and everyone in them to you be Praise You are the sustainer of the heavens and the Earth and everyone in them to you be praised You're The Sovereign of the heavens and the Earth and everyone in them to you be praised you are the truth your promise is true your words are true the meeting with you is true Paradise is true hell is true the hour is true the prophets are true Muhammad is true oh Allah to you I have submitted in you I have put my trust in you I have believed to you I have repented with your help and guidance I have debated and to you I turn for judgment you are our Lord unto you is our return forgive me for my past and future sins for those who have committed secretly and those have committed openly and for whatever you know more about than me or than I you are the one who brings forward and the one who puts back you are my God there is no God but you and there is no power and no strength except with you imagine if you were to wake up every single night for night prayer and say these beautiful words what would your connection be with Allah azzawaja how strong your trust and Reliance and dependence on Allah would be this is what every one of us should observe how to follow our role model also part of the first things that he used to direct us to say Allah is the following words he says whoever wakes up in the middle of the night and says immediately not asking what is the time not checking his mobile phone for messages or checking the news timeline no the first thing he says after opening his eyes in alhamdulillah then after saying this he says oh Allah forgive me or he asks Allah for Dua or Allah pay off my debt or Allah make me succeed in securing a good job oh Allah guide my children and wife any Dua the prophet says Allah whoever does this meaning saying the thicker then asking Allah Allah will answer him and if he were to pray Allah will accept his prayer some of us May encounter nightmares and they wake up terrified and frightened what is it that they're supposed to do what did a role model tell us to do sallallahu so the prophet when it comes to dreams told us that there are of three types a dream that you wake up feeling happy seeing something joyful and pleasant the prophet said this is iglat Tiding from Allah that's a good vision only tell those who love you so that they would interpret it to the best of meanings and you would be optimistic by that number two you may see something that you wake up frightened off something that is scary a nightmare the prophet says the moment you wake up what should I do seek refuge in Allah from the cursed devil Satan three times you say you say that three times then spit to your left three times dry spitting then do not tell anyone about it not a soul not a friend or Foe in another narration the prophet says and then stand up and pray to rakhasa this would eliminating annihilate any danger of such a vision and just throw it in the Dustbin forget about it it's not going to harm you the prophet says Allah it is not going to harm you the third vision or dream is what you see related to your day-to-day activities you booked a flight you go to bed all what you see is planes and airports checking in things related to your journey you're a mechanic all what you see in your dreams are engines and grease and oil and racetracks Etc and and so on this is from your subconscious this is this has no significance at all so if you see a bad dream this is what you should do seek refuge in Allah three times spit dryly to your left never tell a soul about it and pray to your guys and prayer has a profound effect and impact on our peace of mind and the Tranquility that we may find and this is why the prophet said the best of Prayer after the five fourth prayers is the prayer in the middle of the night and the prophets prayers as well as his forms of worship were the most perfect and whenever the prophet did something he fixed it in his routine and he would say the most beloved deed to Allah azzawajal is what you're consistent on even if it's little so whenever the prophet did something of good deedslam he would be consistent with it till the end of his life and that is why his habit his Sunnah was to pray night prayer so if he were to miss he's with her his night prayer due to an illness or any other legitimate reason he would make it up in the morning time when it is time after the sunrise by 15 minutes or 10 till before the adhan of Zohar by five to ten minutes this is the time of duha prayer and this is the time which the prophet salallahu used to make up for his mist night prayers bearing in mind that according to Mother Aisha he used to pray 11 rakhis sometimes 13. so when he make them up in the morning time he does not pray them in odd numbers so instead of praying 11 because there is Witcher and winter can only be done during the night time he adds araka and he prays 12. so he prays two two a set of six and these are 12 rakas to make up for the Mist prayers that he missed during night time the prophet's prayer was beautiful and we mentioned this in previous episode that it was long not like our Ferrari imams rather he would probably pray in one raka three of the longest surahs of the Quran Imran and he would not recite it quickly rather he would recite it in a slow fashion contemplating and pondering upon the verses whatever he passes by a verse of Mercy he would ask Allah for his mercy and whenever he passes by a verse of torment and hellfire he would seek refuge in Allah as a and the prophet used to pray standing up until the end of his life when he became old and tired mother Aisha says when he gained some weight he used to pray sitting down and this is for night prayers and also have Sami Allah be pleased with her reported the same that the prophet never prayed sitting down until a year before his death and he used to pray voluntary prayers sitting down and how to set when you sit down you can sit normally or you can sit crossed legs which is the most comfortable and convenient way of sitting especially if you're prolonging your recitation having said that what we see from some of the brothers from the subcontinent insisting on praying the sun after in the Masjid insisting on praying and sitting down this is not part of the Sunnah and they think that oh I've read somewhere or I've heard the Sheikh saying that it is a Sunnah to pray sitting down this is not the true the prophet did that when he got old and tired due to the problems and due to being overwhelmed by the people besides the prophet told us in an authentic Hadith that the prayer of a person standing up is best and he's relating that to voluntary prayers and whoever prays sitting down he will only get half of the reward of a person standing up so you should not pray sitting down if you have the energy and if you're young and don't have any reason to sit down because this is not part of the Sunnah except for those who have a legitimate reason I pray to Allah that we Succeed In following our Prophet Allah's role model and that we try to follow his Sunnah in all aspects of life so that we may be led to be resurrected under his Flagship on the day of judgment Islam"
