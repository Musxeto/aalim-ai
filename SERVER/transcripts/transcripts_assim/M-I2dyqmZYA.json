  "title": "If the devils are chained up in Ramadan, why do people still sin? | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem",
  "transcript": "ayesha says are all the devils chained up in ramadan if yes then why do people still commit sins and become more impatient while fasting well it goes without saying that the Devils are chained in Ramadan and this is an authentic hadith when ramadan comes the gates of paradise are open and the gates of hell are locked and closed and the jinn or the Devils or the Masters of the devil's murder that ol Jan they are chained and the hadith is correct now how is this taking place scholars differed some say that this is literal and they are chained but they went on to say not all of them are changed those who are among the Masters of the jinn the leaders of the Devils these are chained and the young ones the normal Jo are on the loose others said that it is not actual chaining but rather a figure of speech and it is meant that they are not successfully permitted to do what they used to do other than Ramadan so they cannot attain the same results as if they were chained so their productivity in the other 11 months is like their efficiency is like 90% in Ramadan it's like 25% and the most authentic opinion is that they are chained whether they're the masters or all of them we do not know but we acknowledge the hadith and we believe in it as it is because imam ahmed may allah have mercy on his soul was asked if the devils are chained why do we see people with seizures and jinn possession Imam Muhammad did not elaborate he simply stated that we believe in the hadith and we do not go beyond it and these are the type of logic that may drive a person out of religion when you start to logic things in religion that are from the world of the unseen we do not have knowledge of it it is beyond our comprehension our intellect and our imagination so why go and discuss such things the other day a person came to me and said did Shaitaan whisper to Adam to eat from the forbidden tree I said yes he did then he said how did he do so if he was expelled from paradise so Adam is in paradise and Iblees Satan is outside of paradise how did he influence Adam and his wife Eve to eat from the forbidden tree it's a vanilla how would I know was I there this is something that Allah told us about so yeah but this is not logical subhanAllah have you seen Satan with your own eyes what what do you mean by not logical nowadays we have telepathy they claim nowadays we have mobile phones about a hundred years ago or more if you told someone that I can speak to your cousin in the USA which requires a journey of a month-and-a-half maybe by sea and by land etc to reach if you tell him that I can call him and communicate with him you say you crazy now mobile phones do this with extreme ease so how would I know how Satan communicated with Adam this is not in my job description I don't have to know this what's in my job description is that I have to believe whatever Allah state in the Koran or whatever the prophets allah wa sallam told us anything extra would not be good for you or for your Eman"
