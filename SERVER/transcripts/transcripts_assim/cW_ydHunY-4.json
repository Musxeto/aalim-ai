  "title": "Should we pray the sunnah before dhuhr 4 rakahs or 2 by 2? #islam #islamic #quran assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "I could not understand what you said aman except that you were referring to the sunnah before prayer which is four raqas. So if I'm understanding it correctly should we pray it to offer salam then two or offer it for with one salam at the end um authenticated the hadith that it should be prayed four in a row. The majority of scholars say it's safer to pray it two by two because of the hadith of the prophet where he said the night prayer in an addition and day prayer are two by two. So if you do either way inshallah it's valid."
