  "transcript": "sister Asia from the case I brought up a very important matter which is how everyone nowadays you know when somebody opens a shop and it prospers and he's doing good business even if he's sitting toys you find 10 other people open next to him and they start selling the same it's not really regulated when it comes to hijama uh it's that's a professional business and it should be done under medical supervision because you gotta ask the patient first whether he's diabetic or not you cannot make incisions for a diabetic person and you gotta keep in mind many other considerations such as infectious diseases and the person has to be aware of the hygienic process of operating it's an operation whether you know um so we really see a lot of people just do it also the spots as where to do the cupping you know when somebody's saying I'm having a lower back pain so they just do it on the lower part anywhere and that's it and this this process the cupping is a science and it is thought in medical schools so is it okay for any person just to you know to be acquainted or to watch a video online you know even the incision that a person makes with the uh with the blade it's a very sharp one you know 45 angle the degree uh 45 degree and it should be superficial it shouldn't be deep incisions things like that you cannot learn it by watching a couple videos online don't don't talk to me you're the doc so you you answer this because I have no idea and I don't answer things that I have no idea in so you definitely the way you painted it man I'm not going except with someone with a certificate the problem is not in here as you've stated I get people saying we went for hijama and the person doing hijab and then he's selling me uh things to cure me from the Gin possession subhanallah this is a boom in business they plug people to a screen green and then they say okay you have three gin two Jews and one Catholic and they wouldn't like you when you say well you're perfectly okay you're not being possessed by the Gen you're probably in the brain oh no no no you're not a good one you don't know you don't know anything about this business they like the people who tell them uh specifically mention names and stories of the Unseen that no one have no clue about what Allah it's very obvious yesterday as I was leaving the Masjid somebody stopped me and he said that I was diagnosed with the disease and I was recommended by the doctor that I need to undergo a surgery and it is imminently needed so some people say that go for hijama I want for hijama and somebody did hijama for me and also branding yes and uh he's asking me is I said wouldn't it be much smarter to have asked before you go for it that's my reply second I said and how do you feel now I said worse you know because it's been one month I've been treated from The Branding the burn is so huge and it doesn't seem to heal okay so why don't you ask before you act especially with a serious decision like that subhanallah the prophet sallallahu that so the almighty Allah Afflicted and tested the people with certain diseases and he did not create a disease without a treatment only the professionals know it those who spend plenty of time learning and studying so you know consult the consultant the specialist in the field of medicine not because you are a doctor you can treat any cases you go to up a pulmonaries and you have a problem a stone kidney a kidney stone he says well this is none of my business then he refers you to an apologist everybody is specialized in a particular field he doesn't translate this because he's become his specialty likewise when when it comes to treatment with the herbs you know in my major original was I will specialize in the medicinal plants or what is known as pharmacognizy it's a vast knowledge it's like an ocean without Shore and it's very interesting and amazing you go to the guy who sells herbs he gives you a little bit of this a little bit of that as Cena leaves and says you mix them and you drink it you know some of these even Center leaves you don't think it is safe to uh you can overdose yourself and it can be purgative you know you just meant to relieve yourself it can be very dangerous a lot of herbs and pharmaceutical plants it must be uh be taken under medical Supervision in the United States there are about five medical schools called Homeopathy you graduate as an MD you prescribed medication but the herbs it's a science not everyone just gives you a pack on boiled this or even the process of boiling or mixing there's something called maceration or decoction every drug or every plant has a specific way to treat it so my advice or Our advice to the viewers yeah the prophet sallallahu alaihi said and he advised drinking honey either you dissolve it in water and you drink it especially early morning is very useful and the incision of the cupping and the prophet saws commended these two and he forbade The Branding may Allah"
