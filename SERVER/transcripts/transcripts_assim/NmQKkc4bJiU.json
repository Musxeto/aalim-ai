  "title": "Regarding Hadeeth of Umar (radiyallahu anhu) on taraweeh prayer",
  "transcript": "another question from brother burhan he says that last night a friend of his said that there is a Hadith in Abu da where Omar may Allah be pleased with him ordered the people to offer 20 while in IM Malik there is another Hadith where Omar himself ordered them to offer 11 and that is during so he wants a clarification first of all the Sunnah is compiled of hadiths and these hadiths have two main pillars the the chain of narrations or the chain of narrators and the Hadith itself and the scholars of this great science which no other religion has this science they scrutinize and they look very very carefully to both pillars of the Hadith the chain of narrators and they look at each and every one of them if not proven to be trustworthy righteous knowledgeable capable of remembering never lied at all if not having these characteristics they reject his Hadith even if the Hadith was sound and and looked good but because the chain of narrators who conveyed this Hadith to us had this one individual who was not trustworthy or he lied once or he was not righteous or he did not pray F in the Masid or he had an innovation here or there in this in this case they would reject his Hadith and the second pillar is the context of the Hadith itself and they look into the content and the context and the text itself and they analyze it and then they judge the Hadith so the chain of narrators is very crucial and essential to judge over a Hadith whether it's authentic or not and that is why those who do not have knowledge in this science would hear any Hadith coming from anywhere and they would not know whether it's authentic or not only the scholars of this science are able to say okay first of all the Hadith does it have a chain of narrators so many hadiths on the internet being sent through millions of emails to people and from people and they say the prophet said so and so and so what what's the reference nobody knows who where is where is the chain of narrators nobody knows this is an unaccepted methodology the minute you see such a Hadith ignore it and delete it like we mentioned yesterday a brother is asking about what washing the back of the neck and he quoted a piece a clip of a video and this is following a certain school of thought and they teach you how to pray and how to perform woodo and and and there is a narration at at the bottom telling you the reference so it says that this Hadith is in Abu and it's authentic and it's not authentic it is fabricated this is what the Sha said this is what the said abdah Etc and then it says that the compiler ofat which is a commentary Oni one of the greatest Scholars of Islam it says that in his book The Beautiful summarization he said that this Hadith is authentic when I referred back to it it is fabricated he is saying that it is fabricated so the problem is with people lying to convince people with what they are saying and doing therefore don't believe any Hadith until you look at the reference until you check this issue in this point Omar may Allah be pleased with him in one narration ordered them to pray 11 in another narration ordered them to pray 23 may Allah have mercy on his soul clarified this easily and he said that 11 was at the beginning when he asked may Allah please with him to lead the congregation in this is what the prophet used to doat but after a while they got really tired because you know that the prophet wasam per one ra he could pray chapter 2 three and fourah Al bak alran and and this is a lot not a lot of people can tolerate this so when he saw this he then instructed to make it into 23 so whether it's 11 or 23 or even 39 because people of Medina all of this is authentic the people of Medina some of them when the people of Mecca started to pray 23 Ras they thought that they are offering night prayer and they also have the Kaa to offer ta as many as they want they increased their portion of into 39 36 as normal shaf and three for witer all of this is acceptable and we always recommend and give preference to 11 just to be on the safe side but whoever adds to that and he says no I would like to pray 23 he has basis and we say okay you are doing the right thing om may Allah pleased with him and the companions used to do this and the majority of the schools of thought say that this is acceptable however if someone restricted himself limited his vision by saying that no you cannot recite more than you cannot read or pray less than 23 some some school of thoughts not the original schools of thought but those who followed them from the the modern uh uh Scholars of such school of thought say that if you pray less than 20 in this is not acceptable this is ignorance because the prophet himself Alam prayed 11 raas so you cannot limit it and say you do not pray more than 11 because the prophet did not limit it he used to do this but he did not say Do not exceed that and you cannot say you cannot pray less than 20 ra and the prophet himself used to pray 11 Rak"
