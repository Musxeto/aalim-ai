  "transcript": "does allah actually have to give us what we want or can he save it for us or what's the situation well allah the almighty does not have to do anything we are servants of allah we are slaves to allah azza so he does with us what he wishes what pleases him but it's a fact that allah azzawajal as in the authentic hadith of the prophet whenever one of his servants supplicates and makes dua and requests allah for something will do one of the three and this is something he told us about and the prophet relayed that to us he said he would either answer our prayer on the spot so if i say oh allah grant me a thousand reals allah will give it to me on the spot this is option one the second option is that allah would prevent harm from reaching me that is equivalent to that amount so i say oh allah grant me a thousand reals and he does not grant me the thousand reals but just round the corner i've i skipped an accident that would have damaged my car worth of a thousand reels and i and this happens to us like hundreds of times a day you were this close of doing something that would have cost you so and so so allah azza is preventing us is protecting us from harm's way that is equivalent to what we've prayed to allah azza and the third and final option would be that allah would store this to us on the day of judgment in the sense that allah azza the almighty would give it to you on the day of judgement good deeds"
