  "transcript": "the prophet was also a person who would not intervene when his wives fight and this is very important for those who have more than one wife because when you take sides you're ruining your life yes you may feel that this is fair and just but you're not a judge they did not come for you to arbitrate between them or to judge them or to tell them who's right and who's wrong so one has to be a bit neutral and be safe rather than being sorry in the authentic Hadith once z b j came and she was as AA describes the only one who I was considering to be my rivalry so she was competing with me to win the prophet's heart the prophet loved her Z J is the prophet's cousin by the way so she came to the prophet while while he was witha and she AA described deived her of being a really really good person she was among the best of women I've had ever seen listen to AA describing Zab her co-wife look at how fair and just and beautiful her description is towards someone she should be jealous of she says she was I've never seen any woman who's better than Z who's more fearful of Allah than Zab who's more truthful when she talks than Zab who is more than connecting to her kinship and helping them and giving away in charity and working with her own hands to make things and sell them and give that into charity and get closer to Allah no one is I've never seen anyone better than zanab except that she had this rage in her that would flare out once every while but she immediately comes back to her senses and everything is fine so she came into our house when I was sitting with the prophet Alam and she started saying to the prophet Alam the your wives your other eight wives are asking you to fear Allah in meaning that you it's obvious that you love her more than us and all the people know that so they give you gifts in her night when she's with you and send their gifts and food and everything else to so they felt jealous so we ask you to fear Allah and she started to say bad things about AA and AA is in front of her and she's trying to put her down and the prophet is not saying anything and AA is watching the prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam through the corner of her eyes until she sensed that the prophet Sall wasallam had no problem in her getting even so the moment she felt this she kept on defending herself and attacking Zab saying the thing same thing to her and zanab was taken back and she refrained from what she was saying because of the defense OFA and the prophet was smiling saying that she's the daughter of Abu Bakr the prophet Alat wasam also taught us not to suspect our wives without any proof or a legitimate reason jab abdah may Allah be pleased with him and with his father said that the prophet Alat wasam prohibited that a husband coming from travel to come at night trying to look for their faults and whether they're seeing someone else or not he is thinking that they're betraying him and this is an etiquette in Islam that you do not spy you do not suspect you do not think bad of your spouse unless there is something tangible and real and a proof some men I hear install cameras in their homes in their living rooms just to check on their wives are not seeing anyone they even tap their phones or their home to hear what conversations take place what kind of a marriage is this if you're this sick divorce your wife and and or or or seek psychiatric attention because you're not normal and this is not a real marriage that people normal people could live in and and consider to be uh normal"
