  "title": "Can we use laundry detergent or only water to remove impurities (najasa) assim al hakeem JAL",
  "transcript": "consider subscribing from qatar my question is uh can we not put detergent in washing clothes that have nejasa in the washing machine as the washing machine mixes the water with the detergent so the smell and taste of the water would be changed due to the fail of a file which is the person that turned on the washing machine and even the name of the water changes to like soapy water thus the clothes would be washed like uh water and not the hood so basically farooq's question is can we use detergents when removing an adjacent or should it only be removed by water why because when we mix water with detergents soap and the likes and they mix with the soiled clothes the water can't be distinguished and the nature of the water or the characteristics whether it's a smell or taste or color can't be identified whether it was due to najasa or something else so would that prevent the clothes from being purified the answer is no the issue of najasa and removing it the most authentic opinion is that if the mass of the najasa of the impurity is removed whether with water or with anything else then the clothes become pure power and clean unlike water so if i have to make wudu and i perform wado with a different liquid other than water the water is in valid someone says okay a liter of water costs this much i'm going to perform moodle with a liter of cologne that is 100 times more expensive and it smells better we say that your wudu is invalid in removing najasa and impurities the most authentic opinion that intention is not needed meaning if i have a soiled piece of cloth and i put it outside and without knowing it trains and it pours dogs and cats and i come the following day and i find it washed and cleaned and no traces of najasa i didn't intend it nevertheless it's pure now likewise if the najasa was removed with a different substance other than water whether it's soft drinks or any other detergents or dry cleaning which water was not used when i come and try to trace traces of impurity and i find that it does not exist in this case this is pure therefore using detergents when removing an adjacent is totally permissible and allah knows best you"
