  "title": "Being a moderate Muslim",
  "transcript": "has been hijacked by so many people it has been hijacked by those in Torah Bora who claim that Islam is a religion of Bloodshed and Terror and they are minority they are so few so little and they have no knowledge at all and it also has been hijacked by a number of schools of thought moderates were actually contemporary not moderate contemporary schools nowadays who claim to have the ultimate truth who say and justify everything they do and they find a justification to what they are doing or preaching the people not through the Sunnah of the prophet but through the difference in the opinions of Scholars and there are people who hijack Islam due to their political agenda so they're using their Islam political games there are people who have hijacked Islam because they have gained a lot of wealth and made a lot of power by claiming to be the ultimate speakers of Islam and if you look in the arena you find that you are in a jungle everyone claims to be saying the truth and nothing but the truth and of course this is an allegation that I'm claiming that also can can bounce back at me so someone could come and say okay aome masallah but you are also claiming to have the ultimate truth so who do we believe well the answer is very easy yet it is quite diff difficult to implement unless Allah guide you to take the right path the ultimate truth lies in the Quran an and in the Sunnah and understanding the Quran and the Sunnah through the understanding of our righteous Predators through the understanding of our Sal without this methodology of thinking you would go astray following the Quran and Sunnah nobody disputes about this a real proper Muslim would never come and say uh yes we follow the Quran and Sunnah but this Hadith is out of date or this verse of the Quran cannot be applicable this time of year and therefore we rather neglect it or ignore it or whatever now this there isn't a Muslim that claims to be a Muslim and there isn't a Muslim who is a true Muslim who would say this yet the problem lies in understanding the Quran and the through the understanding of the Prophet through the understanding of the companions of the Prophet Alam through the understanding of the righteous predecessors our Sal our old Scholars who knew Islam properly who knew the Arabic and having said that we are not stating that one should neglect his own intellect should not think and should be just a parrot saying whatever the predecessors had said no we have to not blindly follow them but follow them in what goes in line side by side with the Quran and Sunnah because even in our righteous predecessors we would find difference of opinions so anyone who would follow an opinion would be on the safe side definitely not Allah tells us and if you dispute over an issue refer back to the Quran and to the Sunnah to the to Allah and to his prophet of course Allah meaning to the Quran and to his messenger meaning to the Sunnah of the Prophet therefore this saves and rescues our religion our beautiful Islam from these hijackers and whenever I see a schol speaking I would respect him I would think highly of him but I would not follow him until I look into his deeds and I hear his rhetoric and then filter that through the Quran and the Sunnah and whatever coincides whatever goes side by side with the Quran and Sunnah with understanding of the uh righteous predecessors I would accept it and I would embrace it and I would do it inshallah and this is how you become a moderate Muslim not by following and falling under the pressure of the disbelievers not by saying well this is what time requires and I have to compromise my religion I have to give in I never to be a moderate Muslim is to follow the footsteps of the prophet so the prophet grew his beard and had it left without trimming it then this is the moderate way of being a Muslim if the prophet used to pray the five daily prayers in the Masjid regardless of whatever condition uh things were and he would not compromise these prayers due to work or to obligations then this is being moderate if being moderate tells me that I cannot extend the length of my trousers as a man below my ankles even if it doesn't look well well this is the Sunnah of the Prophet Alam and by following it I am the moderate Muslim this is the moderation we're talking about this is being on the middle path this is how you judge things if I see a woman covered up from head to toe I would not dare and say this is extremism I would say that this is being moderate nowadays in Muslim world world and in in in Muslim countries they claim these hijackers claim that a moderate woman is a woman that wears colorful clothes and exposes is her face her arms part of her legs wearing a nice dress exposing her beauty wearing makeup wearing perfume and mixing with the men they claim that this is a moderate woman this is a modern woman she might might be modern but she is definitely not a practicing true Muslim woman and Allah Knows Best"
