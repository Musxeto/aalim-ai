  "transcript": "[Music] muhammad from the us i have two daughters and i named one of them okay and the other one i named as one year tools what does that mean uh like uh sujaida means the noble one who always been processing in prostitution in front of god in front of allah the frustration okay and the first time some people say some people say the daughters names are named like because it's not a good name to you know his daughter or someone and so i was wondering if you can know okay i will answer inshallah muhammad says he has two daughters one is called sudra muntaha and this is a place up in paradise where uh uh the pro it's a it's it's a big tree where the prophet islam reached and if i'm recalling correctly gibril said this is where i stop and the prophet proceeded assam on the night miraculous journey so it's the name of a tree sidra siddha and is it appropriate name for a girl i would not recommend it because it's a compound name sidrat al-muntaha if you just call her sidra yeah that's good it's a tree again it's a name the other name is sajida or sujada i don't know which one and there was a first name to it i don't know the combination i could not understand because iran was not clear and sadjida means a woman who prostrates and this is not a recommended name to give because it praises an individual i'm my name is uh sajid or musa or i'm a man of worship and this is praising myself i could be the worst of people and sujada i don't know which one he named her so jada is a prayer mat and definitely to call your daughter sujada a prayer match is not a good name definitely so we guys have to choose a name that has a history not just randomly open the quran and say okay this is a beautiful name i've met someone in the subcontinent years ago what's your name he says a tree in hellfire so why did they name you like this no no my father when i was born just randomly opened the uh quran and uh pointed his finger at it and said zakum i met another guy in a subcontinent which you meet a lot his name is shaytan and he was the driver that takes us from one place to the other so this is ridiculous you don't have to stand out in a crowd by giving your child a name that no one shares it with you this is not appropriate in allano's best you"
