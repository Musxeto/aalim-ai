  "title": "Zakat on Forgotten Wealth, Zakat on Lost Gold Jewelry | Sheikh Assim Al Hakeem - JAL",
  "transcript": "the next question is from sister rabia i have lost a gold ring somewhere in my house should i include it in my zakat calculation no it cannot be included because one of the conditions that zakat is mandatory is to have full possession on the wealth so if i want money from the government and the government has been stalling for three four years there's no zakat on it if i were to bury my fortune somewhere in the desert somewhere in an oasis somewhere in a diwaniya so i put all of my cash in stack and bury it and a couple of months later whoa alzheimer hits me i don't know allah where it is and i forget it for 10 15 years trying to look for it there's no zakat in it and if i find it after 15 years eureka that's good i'm lucky i don't give zakat for 15 years i give zakat only for this entire period for one once and then i start on likewise and i don't i don't i'm hope i'm not answering all your questions so you come and say oh we're out of questions likewise if someone comes and this happened a couple of weeks ago a brother who is one of the elders in our community he's almost masha'allah 80 years of age or so so he came to me i have a problem so what's the problem he says like 20 30 years ago a colleague at work asked me for a loan so i gave him 40 000 and i totally forgot about it and he totally did not mention it to me so now after 20 30 years his son came to me yesterday and he says my dad says jazakallahu and he returned to him and he said what is this he said this is something he borrowed from you decades ago so he said i don't know what to do sir should i give the cat for every single year of these 20 or 30 years 2.5 percent multiplied by 10 or 20 this is 50 of the amount uh what should i do so the answer is that it has the same ruling as the buried wealth that people forget about because you don't have any recollection of and you don't have any possession of it repossession then there is no zakat on it except once you collect it back and allah"
