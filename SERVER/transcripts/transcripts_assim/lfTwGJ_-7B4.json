  "transcript": "the next question is I've had a difficult marriage in the past 10 years and now I have decided to get separated my dad agreed initially but as I'm not independent at the moment he wants me to either get independent or back to go back to my husband I used to work earlier and give every single penny to my dad and now I have no savings or Investments I'm actively looking for a job but my dad keeps on abusing me is it okay for me to leave my house and my father do what if you don't want to go to your husband and if you don't have a job and if you don't want to stay in your husband in your in Father's House excuse me what are you going to do work as a prostitute anywh be logical either you stay in your husband's house tolerate his abuse and be a decent wife or trash him and ditch him and force yourself upon your father without working and and tolerate his abuse but to go and live elsewhere where with what income and who would take you in this is not logical some women are impulsive they take decisions they shoot and then they ask questions and they say oh what should I do now you ask ask before you make such a decision so that you know what your options are and this is why it is important to consult Elders people of wisdom in your family people of experience and to make before making any decision not the opposite so you have a choice stay with your husband I can't sh in this case file for divorce without the approval and the help of your father and once you're divorced force yourself upon your father he will not kick you out of the house and if he does then you've done your due diligence because if you stay with your husband without fulfilling his rights the Angels curse you every day until F this is a lot of sins so either you stay with him try to convince yourself of fulfilling his rights and asking Allah Asel for yours or file for divorce and bear your father's abuse and Allah Knows Best"
