  "transcript": "in Demon's rubber ducky be manager hunter inaudible enemy missile ah so so so la salle American solar welcome to the young smokes podcast were here joined with sheikh osman Hakim Alavi Khan how I did find him Lena with the grace of Allah alhamdulillah I just wanted to do another podcast with you I did one last time I know it's kind of in my teeth in stage but your time that's what I'm here for yeah hamdulillah so last time we're speaking with us on the journey of faith in Uganda correct and now we're here in channel so how did he think the event one well I he with the grace of allah azzawajal after al hamdulillah al-balad I mean sallallahu shall embark on Rd also interview Mohammad with the grace of Allah Azza WA JAL the journey of faith is packing picking up momentum mashallah it's a very good platform for Dawa a lot of the people come and their attendance is not of great importance the feedback we get afterwards of people coming and saying that they've benefited and they've learned something and they express their gratitude to what they had gone through this pays off a lot to us hamdulillah and and this is the revenue that we are expecting mostly and this is how we measure whether it was a successful or unsuccessful event yes opana I think it's a big motivation but also people is a good education as well you know a lot of the times these big conferences they can get lost in motivation ok but I think especially this one I think that the speakers got a bit more time as well and having to learn and then those who sponsored the event may Allah reward them and Italy for what they had given and contributed it shows that the people even the rich people think positively of such conferences because of what they see as a return to the community yes upon allah sheikh what was your topics for the two days that is speaking about as you know that that the the theme of the conference was path to agenda hmm so i had two topics and then a third was added unscheduled because share from hamas Allah had to travel to Abuja for another conference and to fill up for someone else so alhamdulillah I was blessed to deliver three lectures one was about knowledge is the path to Jenna hmm so how would knowledge elevate your status in Jannah and which knowledge are we talking about yeah to define it and the second topic was about time and utilizing it to reach Jenna and the third topic was description of Jenna and the beauty of Jenna from the Quran from the Sun upon Allah I mean I'd like to ask you about the first topic the importance of knowledge in in actually getting to Jenna I mean what what did you speak about in this si knowledge is highly praised in the Quran and in the Sunnah and if it were only for the hadith of the prophet alayhi salatu salam where he says that whoever seeks a path to seeking knowledge whoever takes a path to seeking knowledge Allah will facilitate and ease his path to Jannah so the Quran is filled with verses praising knowledge and that only those who fear Allah among his servants are those with knowledge and that allah elevates those who believe and have knowledge over others so what is meant by knowledge knowledge is divided into two types the first knowledge is the religious knowledge which leads a person to know allah azza wajal and to know Islam more this is what is praised in the Quran the Sunnah so the knowledge of the Quran that have C the knowledge of the hadith the Sunnah the knowledge of fit and of course the knowledge of Ikeda of knowing your Lord the Almighty through his beautiful names and attributes devoting your worship to Allah Azza WA JAL through towheaded eloheem and acknowledging that Allah is the Lord of the universe the Creator the giver of life and taking taker of life and that he is the provider that he is a facilitator of our affairs and all these things this is the knowledge that people are praised when they possess it and it would elevate them in Jannah according to their knowledge and their sincerity without sincerity they will be thrown in hell even if they memorize the Quran by heart because this is a famous city that the the first people the first three to be thrown into hell one of them was a scholar or in another interpretation or hadith a re the person who memorizes and teaches the horahan so because if it was not sincere he was not sincere for the sake of Allah so this was his fate the second type of knowledge is the worldly knowledge worthy Sciences and this is divided into two types as well so one type is to have the knowledge of Medicine engineering physics chemistry mathematics and so forth and this is permissible knowledge hmm you're not sinful and you're not rewarded unless you have a good intention hmm so a person who studies medicine if his intention is to serve the community to give the hour through his profession to help humanity hamdulillah he's rewarded for that hmm but if not then is something permissible he just gains money out of it and maybe free there's no sin on him yeah the second type of worldly knowledge are the forbidden sciences so anything that leads to Haram is Haram and for an example source a black magic is a science it involves worshiping the Djinn sacrificing things to them this is total blasphemy yeah but it is a knowledge it is knowledge it is a science likewise the science of astrology when you predict what will happen to people according to the zodiac they were born in etc so they tell you your character is so-and-so and all of this is nonsense yet it is considered to be a science to some people also there is the science of art Haram art such as acting singing music making sculptures and drawing of human beings or animals or living creatures this is a science it's an art it's beautiful but it is Haram because this is what Allah prohibited upon us so in a nutshell this is all you know so this this is the certain knowledge that we need that is not only permissible please obligatory and it's needed to get to gender you know like the the knowledge of Allah of course and and and this is Elementary hmm every single individual Muslim must acquire what is considered to be the minimum acceptable level the level that he can acknowledge and has conviction of whom he is worshipping the knowledge of Allah soldier the knowledge of how to pray how to fast if he is wealthy how to give zakat if he's going for Hajj how to perform Hajj this is the minimal requirement he's not supposed to know about little technical things that only a handful of people know so you won't be a bad Muslim if you cannot answer a question about inheritance division for example because this is not something mandatory upon you to Nome at that moment but having said that engineering can also be obligatory see there are communal obligations which means that if the whole community does not fulfill it they're all sinful but if one of them fulfills the job or does the job then there's no sin upon the whole community for example a communal obligation is to prepare a deceased corpse when he dies so a brother dies no one washes him shrouds him praise janazah or buries him the whole community will be held accountable if one does the job this is sufficient if one does all of this and hamdulillah the whole community is exempted from punishment okay so these Sciences we do need engineers if everybody if everyone says no I'm just going to devote my time to study the Quran and sciences of religion but we don't have doctors yeah we don't have engineers we don't have pilots in this case the whole community would be at sin and it's like why this is so important to know what is not allowed as well because as you said in certain parts of the world things like magic see her sorcery astrology quite you know well you know common common yeah a lot of people actually take part in that and I actually spoke I actually mentioned this in my talk you know about see her and things like this and some people were shocked actually you know on certain things like not astrology what do you like the fortune-telling yes the things you see in the newspaper all on faces Oh Jack that's Australia and you know it surprising how many Muslims actually take part in these things I mean what are the repercussions of this well the Prophet said that is awesome whoever goes to a fortune-teller Allah will not accept his prayers for 40 days hmm but if he goes to a fortune-teller or a priest who predicts the future and he believes him then he has committed an act of apostasy of Cofer of disbelief so believing someone knows the future is an act of disbelief a person leaves the fold of Islam because of that doing it just for the fun a lot of the Muslims may read the newspapers and check their zodiacs just for the fun of it they know that it is bogus and it's not true but they just enjoy the time reading through it these people forty days Allah will not accept their prayers and if they don't pray they become a kafir so they have to pray but without anticipating any reward for that it's like reading your the palm of your hand hmm it's like going to end it in the circus to a woman with this bowl of all the crystal possible in Egypt and elsewhere they throw some types of oysters hmm and shells seashells on the sand and they predict in so many places in Arabia and Turkey they have this Turkish coffee hmm and after they drink it there is the residue a little left over so they turn it upside down and after five minutes they look at the traces of this residue when it came down and they predict that this will happen and all of these are lies but some people do it for fun today's their prayer is not accepted and some believe in it and this is oh yes this is what they said last night hmm it came true and this is an act of disbelief so sure I want to talk about something we actually spoke about last time because as you know the I had a few teething problems with my podcast you know some of the cameras are not working and the memory cards and so we actually lost some of the footage and and I think you know one of the exciting things that you're involved in is Islam Q&A because this obviously is one of the most visited websites correct in the world you know and especially a lot of people in the West they actually rely on Islam Q&A so what's your involvement with with this long queue today well I'm involved with the whole company which Islamic Q&A is one of their business units so the big company is called that company and they have Zaid TV which is a satellite channel that is dedicated 100% to spreading authentic knowledge from the Quran and the Sunnah that teaches a person what he requires is required to learn it also has Zaid academy which is a project that was launched approximately three and a half years ago and it is two years four semesters where a student would get seven subjects every semester with quizzes midterms finals Mohammed Ibaka's in Arabic of course and till date I think almost 85 or 90 thousand students are registered and are in the arabic language arabic from all over the world and approximately 25,000 have graduated already and they're pursuing something else the mission and vision of this Academy is to teach a Muslim individual what he is not exempted from not knowing hmm so there are things that you have no excuse for not knowing if someone says I didn't know that mother was three rocailles hmm this is not an excuse this is something you have to know so it teaches Quran it teaches Arabic it teaches a hadith it teaches it teaches Silla and among other subjects and hamdulillah and it is totally free of charge well sure not a single penny you pay for that and with the grace of Allah so many languages are interested now so many cultures are interested in developing this and this is something you can participate and learn from either by watching that TV or by logging in to their YouTube channel where you find all the lectures for free there is also Facebook interaction there's Twitter there all the time all types of social media they're involved in so Islam Q&A with the grace of Allah so John last year was visited by a hundred and one millionth visitor who it is the largest Islamic website in the world and this was confirmed with experts when I heard the figure I was doubtful but I asked experts in multimedia like dr. zakir naik and he confirmed this to me he said yes it is the largest and the biggest most visited islamic site worldwide apparently so my involvement with them was that I give them sometimes consultations where they have meetings sometimes they send me questions and I answer them they used to send me regularly for questions upon my request not more anymore so that we I could answer that and hamton that they are serving the whole Ummah and no one I think who has access to the Internet and if you tell him www.h thank you a dot info would not recognize it or know it everyone depends on it for seeking the fact where the knowledge in their life and by the way we are more than open to sponsors and this is something that is needed because it takes a lot to run such a website especially if it's not only in Arabic hmm if it's in like fourteen other languages yep so you need translators you need researchers you need people to look into and rewrite and check if insurance is it'd be interesting to know do you know which language was visited the most you know yeah this is probable but I think I would I would presume that Arabic is is the most visited because they don't give you see if you visit my website hmm this is in English hmm and I usually just say yes or no hmm they give you a detailed research when they answer you with evidences from the Quran and reference with evidences from the hadith with references authentications different opinion of scholars and then they give you the cream of their answer so it is a research paper rather than yes or no question so I think Arabic is is the most visited language because a lot of the Arabs the Muslims need someone to trust hmm see you can find so many Muftis nowadays giving you fatwa so many scholars left right and centre but you don't trust any of them it's an issue of trust you know okay it's like your name okay it's green yeah I trust them so on so website I may visit read but I'm not certain I have to go and cross-check with a slump U&E hmm so this is their strength no for those brothers and sisters out there you know maybe they're from certain communities they might even associate with certain mud hubs you know the Hanafi Maliki Shafi or the humbly might have and so they might question they might think well how does this long Q&A fit into this you know what you know does it can I can I take the opinion of this what would you say to this the people are divided into three types people that are scholars and there are those who are students of knowledge and there are those who are laymen the layman cannot differentiate between an ayah and hadith so if you recite something to them with melodious tone they would not understand so if I say in name l-dopa people say which surah it's not a sin son is a thief hmm so they don't have the ability to say that this is right or this is wrong such people they are instructed to follow a particular method better more they're instructed to follow a scholar whom they trust and would follow blindly because they know he follows foreignness or no those who are already Hanafy or humbly or Shafi or Maliki if they are unable to tell night from day right from left wrong from right in this case we tell them stick to your own school of thought and the scholars you have because all of you guys can't do better than that but if a person is an intellectual he's smart he looks around and he figures things out then we tell him trust Islam Q&A and let the website be your share because they have your answer and they can get back to you and they can explain things to you from the Quran and the Sunnah and this is what actually Allah would ask us about on the day of judgment Allah will not ask you about what is your mouth have hmm Allah would ask you what is your religion and who is that messenger who came to you and what did you respond so allah says in the quran well may when I did him fire pudo matter Egyptian Muslim and on the day of judgment Allah will call them and say what have you responded to the messengers hmm so Allah will not ask you what have you responded to the Imams or the scholars but rather to the Messenger of Allah the watcher so we have the Quran and we have the Sunnah and if you're a little bit knowledgeable we have the understanding of the Quran decision according to the favorite three generations tabi Sahaba had known and tabi tabi in those three generations are the best of all humanity as the Prophet said I saw Salam high-roller unified me the best of generation is my generation there is the generation of the Companions and so forth so this is what we're supposed to follow I am amazed by those who reject the Quran or reject the Sunna and say well it's an issue of dispute among scholars aji yeah I know a person once asked one of these deities or say they call them nowadays scholars and he said that 'what's the ruling on traveling for Hajj without mhmm hmm and a man with all audacity said the Saudi government allows it if you're over 40 so this is okay so another person asked him yes but the Prophet prohibited Hetalia salabhasana so this should be the thing that decides whether to do or not to do yeah this is the cornerstone of any argument the Prophet prohibited alehissalaam a woman from traveling with a tomahawk and the guy says yeah it's an issue of dispute you feel to take this opinion it's okay someone else feels to take another opinion is okay how would it be okay if the prophetess I'm prohibited it hmm yes answer with yes or no did the Prophet say this and definitely you said yes but a stop for about how would you say but hmm after the hadith of the Prophet a son prohibiting it therefore this is where we usually come in conflict with people we presenting you with a verse of the Quran or with the hadith of the Prophet is awesome and most of the times the hadith is agreed unanimously among scholars that it's authentic and it's applicable but there's a Tom Dick or Harry in mogadishu or in Zimbabwe saying differently so should we listen to that person go to the prophets instruction is awesome so this is the fork of the road then determines whether you are a true Muslim believer who follows or understand or something else so far yeah I mean Sevilla you know is such a quick access you know you're just typing Google Islam Q&A and ask you question and if this comes right up and and what I like about Islam Cunnane like you said it gives you the evidence and it also gives you a comparative as well you know it does discuss difference of opinion but it kind of shows you why a certain opinion is more correct or all correct correct so yes apologies o'clock here so so Paula tell us about you know for the past how long have you been involved in Dawa because you know we we know you from Hoda TV Oscoda and also Peace TV so you know when did you start actually in the field of tower in the field of the our handle I started about 33 years ago when I started 30 to 30 years ago when I started leading the prayer as an imam of a Masjid in Jeddah and since it was of course all in Arabic so I did not try to do anything in English except in 19 I think 93 or 94 when I was invited to teach a course in fit in enmity that Islam in London hmm so I went there it was a beautiful experience but it stopped until 2000 probably when the Saudi television invited me to deliver a weekly program on Balu aluminum unfit and this went on for 3 years approximately during which I was invited by Hooda TV when they first started and how the TV was not there in the beginning for a whole year that it was unmeasured English Channel for a year and then hood it took over the same staff the same management different name and I've been with them ever since of hamdullah and in 2000 like seven or eight I can't remember now I was also honored to be invited by dr. Zakir Naik to participate in Peace Conference so I participated in three or four peace conferences in Bombay and Somalia grounds and we used to also do a lot of programs on youth on tafseer on FIP and allah blessed me with completing the full book of onda to a camp which is the whole Metin unfit from Pajaro till jihad the whole thing in a workshop and hamdullah and mumbay and people until today with the grace of Allah are benefiting from it and sending me thank you emails and i praise allah azzawajal first and foremost is this filmed yes it's on high def cameras very very high they're like 4k or something like this I'm vocation oh then 8k me yes mashallah no that's good Subhan Allah you know you've traveled a lot yeah and also I see every time I meet you you know you're very keen in the gym you know I've seen you you keep him fit and working out how important is this to you so Paul I know you were well this is something that's not many people can see but under them you don't have to my fella I've been involved in sports since approximately let's say 44 years or 45 years and I originally play squash and I have tournament one tournaments in squashing so I'm a bit competitive and I'd play table tennis and I have also medals in table tennis but I go to the gym as a form of him trying to vent out my stress and it helps me keep up in shape and I remember that my wife once said got really fed up and she said you have to choose either me with the gym hmm so I told her I'm gonna miss her a lot this is a joker but seriously it's a routine you have to do I can I cannot imagine myself not going to the gym even for half an hour usually I woke up for about an hour give or take but you have to do this and make it in your system so that you can feel good about yourself and it's something had a permissible you do so Paloma and also I I wanted to ask you about your Twitter because you know there's a lot of controversy on online about Twitter see a lot of posts to I think some of them are fakes yeah I don't know but you know some of them are very funny some of them people might take the wrong way and you actually told me yesterday that you don't actually have that it's not your Twitter account right no no no Instagram is not mine Oh a stigma but my own Twitter account she has some Hakeem that has a white water ocean you are for whatever they call it and it has approximate 150,000 followers little I'm not Justin Bieber but I'm trying no tattoos hamdullah this is mine and no one handles it except me hmm and yes it's true that I answer questions ninety-nine percent point eight so 99.8% I do answer questions seriously every now and then I get a question that is either from a troll hmm someone trolling me or from a person who did not think twice before sending the question hmm so I tend to joke a little bit yeah not insult me usually nothing so borderline somewhere there and I would ask a question or replying in in an answer that might be a little bit funny hmm so the vast majority of people tend to feel that this is okay to have some humor there are those who are a little bit not fine with it hmm and I'm fine with their opinion they're entitled to have their opinion but when they say something disrespectful and I usually block them and I have like thousands that I've blocked from my Twitter account just simply because I felt that there was disrespect in their answer hmm and this some of them are genuine there was a shake this is inappropriate to rachet he should not answer in this fashion this listen I did not ask people to make me a shake hmm I do not want people to consider me as a share hmm I've been pushed by the people to do this and I looked around there is no one doing it so it becomes a communal obligation upon me to do it now you do not expect me not for a single second to change my colors for you hmm this is me when I travel I do not travel like this I put on my jeans and maybe a shirt or a t-shirt because this is how I feel comfortable share you are an imam you're the this is me when I am in a good mood I make fun of things I may crack jokes share this is not what a chef's supposed to be sue me what what are you gonna do you know this is me you know I don't care about what people say I never told anyone to consider me to be a shaker or the likes hmm so you can have me you can leave me this is up to you Savannah you know there were there were some you know I'm he was mentioning some of them last night they you know somebody asked if she could write a love letter to their wife yeah actually such a question hmm it was worded wrong wrongly the man meant to ask is it permissible and write a love letter to one's wife when he's away this is what was the question supposed to be hmm and to look at the question the question is weird hmm what prevents you from writing a love letter to your wife the person who asked it asked it in a wrong tense or wrong pronoun he said is it permissible to write a love letter to your wife when you were away so I said would you like why would you write a love letter to my wife hmm she's my wife so I just moved on because I thought that the question was not serious but even like it if you took the meaning of what he was trying to say that it didn't have any meaning it's quite obvious yes so either he was a troll when I answered him like any Tron and if he wasn't then I hope he got the message you know shakes upon a lot you know I think a lot of people don't know the work that goes into it so I know we had breakfast this morning and then afterwards you went out for an hour or even more and you just constantly answering questions online people don't know that you get hundreds and hundreds to have quit maybe thousands of questions a week actually actually it's limited to 250 a week a day and day yes yes and skipping Saturday only off because in the beginning it used to be 400 a day but then I suffocated so we've limited it to first-come first-serve we begin from 9 o'clock a.m. Saudi time till 5 o'clock p.m. so usually it is couple hours then it's blocked because we've reached the kota of 250 but to answer these 250 questions it requires me approximately average of 5 hours a day supernal and this is not my work this is the team that I have with me hmm because maybe 65 to 70 percent of the questions have been asked before and they have a youtube link or in my website a link that answers the same question so they just send it to me I check whether it is the right understanding of the question and the right answer and I okay it hmm but if I have to answer the whole 250 from scratch that would take probably eight hours hmm supernova and answer panel I'll shake you know you this is all for free people people actually sending questions and you're you know volunteering your time to help people so for me I don't see it as a volunteering it's an obligation and an obsession hmm I love with the grace of a lot to help answer people's questions or solve their problems it's something that I had in me since like 35 years ago or 40 years ago when I started teaching in high school it's just a fulfilling feeling when you solve people's problems or help them but of course we have I do this on Facebook and Twitter and I do this on my website and I do this through phone providing it's not more than five minutes hmm because I have to put a limit to phone calls but we or I have also the paid service which is consultation via Skype or FaceTime and this is quite helpful for marital problems hmm so lots of the wives call a lot of the brothers called from all over the world from Australia from India Kashmir now the the internet is down but when they go out to Mumbai or to Delhi from Pakistan from America from Norway you have the lady they call and they have this half an hour slot which is a paid service here but it's one to one so they can see me they can talk to me and I can ask them questions like when it's so this this is open to anyone so yeah it's it's it's on my website Allah so so if they want they can have half an hour so yeah but I'm a little bit expensive so most people would say I feel you knows too much I think people need to understand that you know people they presume that scholars sheiks like yourself and even people like me who are just giving dower they think that way it will rich and responsive because we travel in the world and we have lots of money and they don't know the reality that like most of the sheiks and the words that I know they're struggling chef of course you know and you know if people only knew you know how you know people were struggling and living it you know they'll think a lot differently you know and you have to make an income somewhere yeah but that people only think of themselves so I have a problem and the Sheikh wants to charge me $100 for half an hour hmm this ship is a crook hmm you want you have a problem you are more than welcome my website is free of charge send me your email one email a day and you get the answer within 24 hours mmm and she says no no no I don't want your email okay you can call me but do not exceed 5 minutes because most of the time people want to vent mmm they want to say my husband did this man and it takes half an hour and I can't afford this hmm so you can do this you can wait until I'm on Twitter you can ask me questions on Twitter it's all free no I want to meet you face-to-face okay you have five minutes so no this is not enough you have to listen to my problem okay I have millions of people who would like to have this and I cannot afford it timewise and likewise it's a service when you go and buy an iPhone for like 800 or $1000 hmm you paid without a blink yes shake there was a brother on Facebook the other day he was mentioning you know he's a Koran teacher and some of the brothers are complaining and he was charging because you know that's how he makes a living in London and the world is struggling and subhanAllah some of these people that were complaining he found them in the restaurant you know having a big spread of food you know they didn't think anything of pain 70-pound or he was you you know the issue is that the vast majority of Muslims don't know that in Islam it is legitimate to ask money for teaching Quran yeah for teaching knowledge for teaching for the Prophet himself iris also approved his companions when they refused to give Rukia to a tribesman who was bitten by a snake or stung by a scorpion they refuse to make rookie until they give them some food for it hmm so they did and when they took the food to the Prophet asked them and they refrained from eating it because they didn't know it was legit or not nonprofit Alice Aslam said to them the best money to take is over the or and teaching it or reciting it so you're not taking money for the Quran you're taking money for your time and for your effort in teaching it yeah and the vast majority of scholars say that this is totally legit it's like going to a consultant or a neurosurgeon in hospital you know paying an arm and a leg you wouldn't say that why are you doing this you should do it for free yeah this is not a charity organization I have to make a living you have to be even yesterday Sepang like he was very tired we came back from the conference it's very tiring it's upon Allah and you know a lady requested you know sometime to ask Oishi question and I said Sheree what you're doing you need to rest you know because Sao Paulo you'd been out all day and he said no no I'm too like you you know so she was going to come at six o'clock and you asked me to come and meet you downstairs they didn't turn up Sao Paulo Allah you know this type of thing you know not kind of respecting the time of this happens and you have to appreciate that there are traffic jams there are problems there are things that may delay people from attending your appointment but handle oh we all have our shortcomings I think we'll won't it appear like we've got a flight to catch I've not got what watch insha'Allah we will head to Abuja and then we'll head back there in Chamonix now demon bird or lurking be managed"
