  "title": "Ruling on someone who doesn't want to gain knowledge so that he won't be accountable assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "if a person who has knowledge about a particular thing and if he sins then he will be accountable but on the other hand if a person who doesn't have knowledge and either wants to have knowledge about a particular thing will he not be sinful okay so basically accountability is highly related to knowledge so Allah says in the Quran we Allah is talking about himself we're not going to torment a people or a nation till we send them a messenger what is the use of such a messenger so that he would educate them he would give them knowledge because if the messenger was not sent the people will say oh Allah how would we know that this is prohibited and brings your wrath upon us nobody told us so if a person knows that drinking intoxicants is Haram and he still drinks it he's sinful now what about if a person doesn't know whether it's Haram or not though he has the means to learn but he gives deaf ears to anyone who wants to educate them no no no don't tell me I don't want to listen why he said because if I listen I would know and if I know then I'm accountable so I'd rather be in my ignorance not knowing the ruling so that I won't be won't be held accountable of course you will be held accountable looking the other way when you are able to know whether it's Halal or Haram would not exempt you from accountability those who could not learn and did not have the means to learn and had they known they would have refrained these people are not accountable on Allah and knows best"
