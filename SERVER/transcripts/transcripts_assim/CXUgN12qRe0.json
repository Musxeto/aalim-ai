  "title": "Hadith: \"Give glad tidings of hellfire to the disbelievers\", is this authentic? - assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh I read in a Hadith the other day in which the prophet El Salto salaam ordered the Muslims to give the disbelievers the Glad Tidings of the Hellfire whenever a Muslim is to pass by the grave of a disbeliever some Scholars have come to the conclusion that this is a week of Hadith while other notable Scholars like Sheikh al-bani have authenticated it I don't know which opinion I should be inclined towards so what I wanted to ask you was what is your take on this personally thank you we are laymen so laymen are ordered to follow a trusted scholar in the science they are laymen in in whatever he says therefore if you're a Layman you have to ask and follow a scholar you trust his moral conduct his ethics and his religious practice and his knowledge says we follow him in fact or not either because we're laymen we don't have the tools that enables us that enable us to differentiate and distinguish what is right and what is wrong what is weak and what is strong in Hadith the same ruling applies we are all laymen and Hadith Sciences and therefore when it comes to authentication of hadiths we depend entirely on Sheikh al-bani whom we trust may Allah have mercy on his soul we know his knowledge we know his sincerity therefore we follow what he says so if the Sheikh authenticated such a Hadith where the Prophet salallahu gave an advice and ordered His companion that whenever you may pass by the grave of a disbeliever then give him the Glad Tiding of Hellfire and the companion complied and did this and said that was a bit hard for him because he used to do this all the time this is an authentic Hadith and we have no other a way out than to believe and to implement this and Allah Knows Best"
