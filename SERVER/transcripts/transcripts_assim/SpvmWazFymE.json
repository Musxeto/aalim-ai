  "title": "Ruling on men & women praying in the sane row, is the prayer valid? #assim assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "okay okay I understand your question so the the the question of sister Amina what is the ruling on men and women praying side by side in the same raw in the Masjid this is unacceptable it's prohibited and it's Haram but the prayer is valid so if we have a Masjid where the men's section is here and next to it they put the women's section but with a barrier and the women's spray in their hole this is totally wrong why because it was the prophet who saidat and taught us that the women should be behind the men as for per the Hadith of an Malik Inari and elsewhere where the Prophet came to them in their house to pray and he washed a carpet made of straw for them to pray on and the prophet led the prayer behind him was anas and a young boy and behind them was a woman so the woman according to the instruction of the Prophet was in the uh third draw behind the males and and his brother and also the Hadith of the Prophet where he clearly stated the best raw of men in the Masjid are the first and the worst raw of men in the mid are the last and the best raw or line of women in the Masjid are the last and the worst line or raw of women in the Masjid are the first to avoid any closeness or contact between men and women but the Salat is valid if if a woman and we see this sometimes in the Haram she insists on going into the men's section and praying next to them because she's too lazy to go to the back the prayer is valid but she's sinful for what she had done and Allah knows best yaser from"
