  "transcript": "foreign foreign [Music] foreign I'm about foreign it was reported in al-bukhari and Muslim once asked them to bring him water and he performed an excellent ablution as we know from the Hadith may Allah be pleased with him after performing this abolition he prayed and then the prophet said whoever performs abolition like I did wudu and praise to rakas like these without speaking to himself without having Whispers Allah will forgive all of his previous sins if we contemplate upon this Hadith we find that the prophet Allah to assalam is highlighting the importance of quality over quantity which many of us Muslims fail to understand turakas are better than thousands of rakas performed without submissiveness without without the love and fear of Allah and humility to Allah azzawajal this is what Sharia came with our beautiful religion came to adjust how we look at things how we evaluate things so that we look at everything through the eyes of sharia so that we are not amazed and fooled by whatever is sparkling foreign was once sitting with a man a companion when a man in a very nice suit very nice ride came and passed by them so the prophet asked his friend what do you think of this man and His companion said prophet of Allah this man is one of the dignitaries he is a rich and influential person if he were to propose people would give him in marriage if he were to speak people would listen and if he were to intercede people would accept his intercession the prophet did not say anything then another man passed by so the prophet asked him what do you think of this man and the man laughed Prophet this guy is a poor individual he's nothing if he were to speak nobody would listen if he were to propose to a family they would not give him a marriage and if he were to intercede nobody would accept his intercession the prophet said this man is better than the whole earth filled with that man what is the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam is trying to tell us he's trying to tell us and teach us that a righteous man who fears Allah who implements Islam in his life even if he's poor he's way better at the sight of Allah azzawajal than so many of those influentials those who are rich or powerful in the government those who succeed in spreading corruption in the Earth this poor man because he fears Allah is better than all of them nowadays as Muslims we are amazed and impressed when we see an actor when we see a government official a ruler a rich man a billionaire and this is not or a sportsman how many of us if you see someone famous in sports would run to take his autograph would run to shake hands and take a selfie but if one of the greatest Scholars of Islam comes who's he okay what do you care to take a selfie no I'd rather keep my pictures for myself nobody cares about them this is not what Islam teaches you if you read the Quran you will find this mentioned in Surat Toba Allah says similarly to ayahs similar to one another Allah says addressing our prophet wasallam and all of us so let so let not their wealth or their children impress you or Muhammad sallallahu don't be impressed by their wealth how many children they have Allah only intends to punish them through their wealth and children in worldly life and that their souls should depart at death while they are in the state of disbelief aren't we impressed by the lifestyle of celebrities they're beautiful cars they're beautiful mansions they're beautiful spouses the way they dress the way they speak we imitate them and some of them some of us even wear t-shirts with names of Ronaldo maybe Ronaldo or Messi or whatever and we love them we adore them what is Allah telling you do not if you read a real Muslim do not be impressed by these disbelievers so many things people praise and glorify at the sight of Allah is worthless is nothing and so many things people don't consider to be anything they despise and resent while it is so great at the sight of Allah in sahih the prophet sallallahu alaihi sallam ordered Abdullah the companion to go and fetch him a miswak so he went the companions were sitting as he was taking the miswak he was a very thin man as he was picking the miswak the wind blew him and he almost fell what would you do when you see a thin man being tossed like a leave in the wind the companions left asked them what are you laughing about the companion said a prophet of Allah look at his legs they are so thin it's funny the prophet said correcting how we look at things by Allah his legs are heavier at the sight of Allah than Mount a mountain this man's legs that are thinning they are more valuable and heavier than Mount uhud this is how we look at things how would I evaluate you by your car by where you live by the pen by your watch by the brand of your clothes this is not what evaluates people by we evaluate them by their Iman their taqwa their deeds their character when you want to marry not now what do you do what do you look for all of us what we want to get married we looked we look at the outer shell Beauty wealth lineage Authority this is what people usually look for and Allah azzawajal says in the Quran and a believing slave woman or man is better than a polytheist in Idol worshiper even though she or he might please you so Allah tells you don't look at the beauty of a woman or how handsome a man is or how how rich rather look at the Iman the prophet said a woman may be married for four things her wealth her lineage her beauty and her religious commitment what to do if you can get all four show me her sister if you can get all four that's excellent but if you can't the prophet says seek the one who is religiously committed may your hands be rubbed with dust if you take someone who's beautiful and not religious you will be grabbing soil because in few months time you will have a life of hell with such a person but when you marry a righteous woman who fears Allah she will make you the happiest man the happiest father and the happiest husband look at wealth money everybody wants and love money why do you come to school to learn ha ha nobody comes to school to learn we come to school because our parents forced us to come here those who are fair and just they will say we come so that we can graduate and go to UNI and then graduate and get a good job and then get money and buy a house and buy a car and get married so everybody who's looking for money look how Islam looks at money the prophet Allah asked his companions once do you know what is the definition of someone who is broke so the companion said of course someone who's broke who does not have money who does not have furniture he has nothing no property the prophet said no the definition of a broke person is a person who comes on the day of judgment with lots of Salah lots of fasting lots of zakat he has given everything but he cursed this individual he slandered this individual he beat this individual he shed the blood of this individual and he consumed unlawfully the wealth of others so he comes on the day of judgment the Day of Reckoning to pay back whatever he owes people so the prophet says so Allah takes from his good deeds and gives each one he wronged from that if his Good Deeds are finished what should we do Allah will take from their sins put it on him and throw him in Hell Fire this is the definition of someone who is broke may Allah make me and you among those who are rich in the sight of Allah I say what you hear and I seek Allah's forgiveness so ask Allah to forgive you alhamdulillah most people think that quantity is much better than quality so when we come to Wars and fighting the bigger the Army is the better and this is not the case in Islam when we have quality quality Beats the amount of Army and soldiers and ammunition they have because Iman always prevails Allah says in the Quran how many a small company has overcome a large Company by permission of Allah and Allah is with the patient in the beginning the Muslim Army was ordered to fight even if the enemy Army is 10 times as big and they never run away and Allah made them Prevail then this instruction was lowered so when the army of Muslims is faced by twice the size of the enemy they are ordered to stand firm and to fight to the death sometimes quantity is a reason for defeat the Muslims in the Battle of her name they were almost 10 to 12 000 men much more than the enemy Army but because they were not firm in obeying the prophet Islam they almost got defeated until Allah gave them Victory once again our Prophet sallallahu alaihi wasallam told us about an era at the end of time when the Muslims are a lot but they are worthless how many Muslims do we have 1.7 2 billion Muslims on Earth what power do they possess or constitute it's zero they can't do anything why there are so many but they are divided and this is why we have to know that quality is not attained by Logic quality is only attained by the Quran and the Sunnah this is what defines how we look at things so that we act according to what pleases Allah azzawajal if we were to look at things with the glasses of sharia that filters everything then we would understand that one rupee of halal is better than Millions from Haram ask the people on the street would you like one mil one rupee Halal or shall I give you a million rupees of Haram what would they ask answer the vast majority was saying give me Haram give it to me and I'll give something to sadaqah and Allah will forgive because they don't have the understanding of sharia if you ask people Muslim believe in practicing Woman as a wife or Miss Universe they would say Miss Universe does the job woman equals thousands of Nan hijabi women one man or boy who memorizes the Quran is better than a thousand of those who don't know where the Qibla is who all what they care about is their movies their music their Instagram their Tick Tock but they don't know nothing about Islam it's a shame when you ask youngsters about the pillars of Islam about the pillars of Iman is it huh they don't know but if you ask them about the members of the Brazilian football team and they list their names and their clubs and everything about them a father must look with the glasses of Islam to filter whatever his wife asks him to do whatever his children ask him to do so whatever pleases Allah he does it whatever goes against Sharia he blocks it likewise the sun has to look in what pleases his parents but with a condition that it pleases Allah so if your parents older you to do a sin you block it and refuse it this is how we should evaluate things in our work in our Ledger in our Sports in our families in our studies look at everything through the spectrum of sharia because this is what a real Muslim does Allah says in the Quran say indeed my prayer my rights of sacrifice my living and my dying are for Allah lord of the worlds no partner has he and this is I have been commanded and I am the first among you of the Muslims foreign we ask you to forgive us and to make us steadfast on Islam and to increase in our health and wealth and knowledge and to make us among the imams for the Muslims that they follow us and they come close to you because of us Allah make us among those who avoid Innovation make us among those who follow your son the Sunnah Allah so that they would be resurrected on the day of judgment under his flagship foreign"
