  "transcript": "mariam from the us question is if i fast 30 days without breaking any break i mean with that i mean if i fast 30 days without any break and there is a chance that i do might get sick since i'm underweight for my age and i'm actually sick really faster from my dad because he won't let me fast is it okay for me to do three days of fasting and one day not and then three days of passing a monday not since and make up the missed path later on why are you missing these days i did not understand are you sick no i'm not saying like i don't have invisible disease but i'm underweight so oh yeah i mean just because you're underweight you think you're gonna vanish and disappear if you fast the whole month of ramadan no they're saying that i might get sick you might yeah okay the answer is no this is totally prohibited to skip a day of ramadan based on speculations the notion that okay you are underweight and you have to fast three days and skip one day so that you gain more weight this is preposterous this is illogical even those who come to you say maybe you're going to fall sick maybe you got to develop this or that maybe is a speculation we cannot jeopardize a pillar of islam for mere speculations yes you go and fast the whole 30 days if in between you fell sick or was so weak and and vulnerable you needed to eat or drink break your fast and eat and drink no problem that but to schedule it three days yes one day off no this is totally prohibited"
