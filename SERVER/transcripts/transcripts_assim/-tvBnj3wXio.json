  "transcript": "foie says we have few mango orchards when mango buds appear or when the mangoes grow a little the whole mango orchards are sold by guessing the probable amount of mangoes before the mangoes are edible but i've heard that it's not permissible to sell mango orchards before the mangoes are suitable to be eaten and without knowing the exact amount without weighing mangoes how to garden trade properly my knowledge these are two separate things selling the crops the fruit itself and selling the whole farm or the whole garden selling the whole garden is irrelevant it's not related whether the fruit has grown up and right or it's still in its buds and not decided yet whether it's going to be good or bad because you're selling the whole thing the whole farm the whole garden with the trees with everything in it so this is irrelevant you can do that regardless whether it's grown up or not now when i would like to sell the crops only so i have a farm or a mango orchard and it's their season now and the mangoes have grown up but not right yet the prophet prohibited alaihis salat selling the crops that is the fruits until it becomes red or yellow what does that mean it means it's not permissible to sell the crops or the fruit while still on the trees until the signs of them being healthy and capable of being ripe without any disease or defect appear when they green you can't sell them because maybe after three weeks something would come and make them die but when they're yellow or reddish and about to be right within like two three weeks and the experts know that oh now this is fine nothing would harm it um disease and and and defects would not catch up to it at this stage because now it's almost grown up in this case yes you can sell it without any problem how to sell it by having experts who are known as to make hearts and hearts is to guess so they're experts they look at the orchard they look at the tree and say this has 70 kilos of mango and you take their estimate give or take few here and there to be accurate and you sell it accordingly and this is known in the field of uh trading and selling with farms and gardens and the likes you"
