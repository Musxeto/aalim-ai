  "transcript": "the greatest the prophets is the ones his own legal more hammers symbol of already he was saying I'm among all the prophets Muhammad was the last as he's was a mission of the greatest task there was only moral degeneration people come to a little adoration for Cena rahmanir rahim alhamdu lillahi rabbil aalameen sallallaho zelda mubarak-era a birdie he wore a suit amin nabina muhammad in Kuala adeje wasabi Jemaine assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh abu bakr may allah be pleased with him the gays companion of the prophet alayhi salatu salam his greatness came from a number of aspects but among the distinguished ones was the fact that he followed the prophet alayhi salatu salam to the letter and he never objected to whatever the profit alice austen I'm had to say unless the Prophet requested and asked him for an opinion of his own and this is a great difference and this is clearly illustrated in the Treaty of Hadiya or the truth of Judah bia this was done when the prophet alayhi salatu salam decided to go and perform umrah so he left with his companions a thousand or more and they had only light arms a sword a dagger nothing more and they wore the clothes of a Haram and they headed towards Mecca just add the borders of a harem of Mecca they were intercepted and they were prevented from proceeding to perform umrah which was a first because this was not accepted among Arabians in Arabia anyone would have the possibility and the ability to reach Mecca to offer his pilgrimage or to offer his umrah no one was prevented from entering these holy shrines so to prevent the Prophet alakazam and the companions with him was a first and they sent their men one after the other to look and report observe and report and finally they decided to send suhail apna who was the head of the orators at the time and he was not a Muslim so they sent him and he went and sat down with the prophet alayhi al-salam and they wrote down a treaty and this treaty was approved by allah azzawajal in the sense that the prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam would not have approved it unless it was approved by Allah but if you go through this treaty you would think that it was not fair to the Muslims because it stated that the Muslims would go back to Medina this year and not perform umrah and they have to come the following year to make umbra only to spend three days and that is it and travel back again well this was acceptable it stated in the treaty that there will be no fighting for a number of years and whoever breaks this the treaty would be void okay the third condition was that whoever comes from the pagans to the Muslims accepting Islam the Muslims will reject him and send him back and whoever rejects Islam from the Muslims and wants to go back to the pagans they will accept him and accommodate him this was shocking to some of the Muslims but the majority did not say anything because they knew that this was approved by the prophet alayhi salatu salam the only one who had doubts that he could speak them out was wrong worked me all of these with him he went to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and he said o prophet of Allah aren't we on the right path the Prophet said yes aren't they the pagans on the wrong path prophet said yes so prophet of Allah why I we being humilated in our religion and we're giving in why are we giving in to the pagans so the Prophet said Alan salatu salam I am merely the servant of allah and his messenger and Allah would not let me down I only fulfill what Allah commands me to do Alma did not swallow that well so he went to Abu Bakr and he asked up a bucket again the same questions and Abu Bakr answered surprisingly in the same words of the Prophet etisalat Oh Sam because he was his best companion he knew what to say though he did not hear the Prophet is a lobster and he said Omar be firm and believe and do not leave the path of the Prophet Alice Alice awesome so that you would not go astray the Prophet is Allah's messenger and Allah would not let him down Omar may allah be pleased with him says that after that incident I set so many slaves free I gave a lot of my wealth to charity I did so many good deeds just as a form of expiation to that word that came out of my mouth which may sound as an objection but it can be interpreted as fear and care for Islam and for the Muslims this was the stand of Abu Bakr wherever the Prophet did I race asaram complete 100 compliance 100% compliance with whatever he said or did salallahu alayhi wasallam among the cornerstones in the life of abu bakr may allah be pleased with him was when the Prophet sallallahu alehiwassallaam died he was not in town he was at the outskirts of Medina when the Prophet sallallahu slm died and they all knew that his time was approached but all the companions were in denial they did not want to believe that they did not want to see that happen in front of them and Aisha may Allah be pleased with her the Prophet died while he was lying down having his head between her neck and her chest and he passed away so she told the people that the Prophet re so Sam had died and it was chaos people could not believe that earth man may allah be pleased with him was speechless I Lee may allah be pleased with him sat on the floor weeping or Omar being the strongest and fittest one of them all said that if I hear someone claiming that the Prophet I so Sam had died I will chop his hands legs and tongue the Prophet did not die he merely went to meet his Lord and he'll come back after 40 days and nights as Musa peace be upon him as Moses did and he was in denial complete denial Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him the minute he heard of the death of our prophet elias awesome came back to medina went straight to his house and that is his daughter's house and went to the prophets body salotto sandwich was covered he uncovered his face he kissed the profit at is a son on the forehead and said by Allah you are good living as well as being dead and by Allah Allah will not have you die twice this is the death that beyond it there is no dying and now it is the eternal life that you will be having and he went to the masjid and he saw Romar shouting at the people telling them do not speak do not say that Muhammad is dead peace be upon him and he said I'm not sit down and in his state of denial and his state of rage and what could not hear so he continued shouting at people and Abu Bakr said I'm gonna sit down and he did not hear this at all so the only thing was for Abu Bakr to say was to address the people in ignored homework because this cannot go on he cannot keep on trying to shut Tamar down while he is in this case so he addressed the people and said this is inshallah what we will learn and know after the break so stay tuned salam alikum were home to LA and welcome back abu bakr tried to make armor sit down no more would not so he addressed the people he started by praising allah saying alhamdulillah and then preying on the Prophet Alison somebody saying or salatu salam ala rasulillah and when they heard this they calm down a bit but Homer still was not there and he said few words in number but it had one impact that was second to none he said o people whoever among you used to worship mohammed mohammed is dead he's gone but whoever among you used to worship Allah then Allah is all living and he does not die and then he recited the verse of the Quran muhammadun in la raza de nada Hartman cobble hill russell fa amata a patella in pallavaram allah acha become which translates to muhammad sallallahu alehiwassallaam is no more than a messenger and indeed many messengers have passed away before him if he dies or is killed will you then turn back on your heels as disbelievers and he who turns back on his heels not the least harm not the least harm will he do to allah and allah will give reward to those who are grateful now this verse everyone among the Companions knew it by heart because it was revealed on the occasion of the battle of hood so when abu bakr recited it to them they immediately were awakened from this comma they were in it was like a slap on the face of course it's forbidden in Islam to slap anyone on the face even children even anyone it is a sin to slap or hit anyone on the face but it's a figure of speech it was a slap on the face that made them wake up and they've realized that Allah told them this on the battle field in heard that if the rumor was spread that the Prophet died would you leave fighting are you worshiping Muhammad Ali salatu salam and they immediately realize this rumor says may allah be pleased with him the minute that abu bakr recited this verse it was as if it was the first time i've ever heard it and my feet gave up on me and I fell on the ground he was shocked he realized that muhammad alaihi salam the prophet of allah had died and it was not something easy on the companions but the only one who stood firm was abu bakr and this shows you how great this man was honest may Allah be pleased with him said the minute the prophet alayhi salaatu son entered medina when he migrated from mecca everything literally let and it was bright and glowing because of his presence a lala haria salem and when he passed away everything was darkened and it was as if it was pitch black because of the shore oh and grief they felt about it everyone was shocked everyone was in disbelief Fatima may Allah be pleased with her the daughter of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and one of the best for women ever to enter paradise she said to Anna's may Allah be pleased with her in him Oh Ana's did you feel good throwing the dust and dirt over the body of the Prophet Alice or someone you batted him of course she was not asking him to get an answer but she was shocked and said this out of this sharp she felt and she said in grief o prophet of allah to gibril we mourn you o prophet of allah who has answered the call of allah and she started morning the prophet salallahu elsenham with these words that break any believers heart so it was not an incident that would be taken lightly it was a calamity it was a disaster and the only one to stay firm was abu bakr may allah be pleased with him that is why the prophet salallahu alaihi wasallam said that whenever a calamity strikes and it saddens you always remember your calamity in losing me and that is a prophet of allah resource am so if someone if a believer has a calamity of losing a child of losing a loved one he's in grief and sorrow but as a believer when he remembers that he had lost the prophet alayhi salatu salam his shoulder would go to a minimum because his grief over the Prophet Ali salatu salam is far greater than his grief over his loved ones so it was over the Prophet Alice ozlem had died and now it was time to look after the living it was a problem the prophet alayhi salatu salam did not name a successor so they had to choose one and the following morning the ants are those who supported the Prophet Elisha salem and al-ansar means supporters but this name is given only to the people of Medina because those who migrated are given the name of al-muhajiroun they migrated from their countries from their towns especially the majority of them were from Mecca so there are three types there are Alma Hodge aroun who migrated and there is the ants are the people in Medina and they there are the followers who came and will come after the mahadji rune and after the answer so the mahajan heard of the unsolder during in a place called sake fat Benny side to select a successor to the prophet alayhi salatu salam and they wanted to have the successor from the people of Medina why because they are in Medina so the normal and natural thing for people to select someone from their own hometown so abu bakr umar and a burro beta emitter majora they all went to meet their brothers in this place and when they went in Oh Maud may Allah be pleased with him says that I have formatted something that was nice in myself so that I would give a beautiful and eloquent speech and the minute we went in it was Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him who spoke first so he spared me from speaking and he praised Allah and he preyed on the prophet alayhi salatu salam and then he praised the unsub the people of medina he said that you are among the best of the followers of the Prophet Alice's I mean his companions but then went on to praise the Mujahideen and he said that those who migrated with the prophet alaihi wasallam especially those from porush you know that they are the best to be succeeding the prophet alayhi salatu salam and this was something he put down the floor who bab ben monder may allah be pleased with him stood up and said well if this is the case then let it be a ruler from your part and a ruler from our part and of course this meant division among the muslims something that would not be tolerated or accepted at all and all the Companions started you know talking about this and it was a chance for Satan to do his dirty work among the believers among the Muslims to separate them to make them live in chaos but with the grace of Allah one of the answer and he is Bashir Assad may allah be pleased with him he's the father of and norman and we all know and norman eben Bashir to be one of the Companions of the Prophet a list of some young companions and at the same time one of the narrator's of the hadith the hadith for example at hallelu Bayon well Haram obeyin and so forth so al-bashir stood up and said o people of ants are you are my people you know that we had the front row in fighting the pagans and in fighting at the cause of Allah the Almighty we were the first to accept Islam and to support this great religion of Allah my recommendation is that we make this solely for Allah and we should not seek this worldly matters this raining and ruling the people otherwise we would jeopardize the cause that we have accepted Islam for and you know that we only sought the pleasure of allah azzawajal and we also wanted the pleasure of his prophet salallahu alayhi assalam and his obedience and by allah the prophet of allah was from Koresh and we would know that his people are among the best to the one to succeed him and immediately I will buck her suit up and said well this is what we believe and next to him was Roma Anibal beta and he held their hands and said choose one of these two great men this is Roman hot tub whom Allah so jeal granted dignity and honor to Islam when he embrace Islam and this is a barbadian injera he's the one who is to be trusted as called by the Prophet Alice asaram amino had the hill uma the trustworthy of this nation so I accept any one of them immediately abor obey the animal were shocked and said you crazy do you think that we would accept preceding you in coming ahead of you by Allah this is not going to happen by Allah to be beheaded rather than to accept this position while you are living Abu Bakr this is what Homer said I'd rather die then accept such a position none of them said well thank you it's me to rule I am the greatest I'm the best it's a position that came to me on a plate of gold no they knew the responsibility and they knew the position of a bucker they rejected it they said we are not the ones to assume such a position with the presence of abu bakr the prophet of allah is salatu salam he approved him to lead us in prayer and he approved him for our religion don't you think we would approve him for our dunya for our life and we immediately asked him to extend his hand so they would give him the Pledge of Allegiance and they are Omar a nabob ada gave him the Pledge of Allegiance and immediately all of the answer came to give Abu Bakr the Pledge of Allegiance so did all the companions of the prophet alayhi salatu salam and before the Sun set at that day it was over it was announced that Abu Bakr may allah be pleased with him the best companion of the prophet alayhi salatu salam is his successor and they knew him as the successor of the Prophet re-selection Khalifa to Rasool Allah the one who came after the prophet sallallahu alayhi wasallam what was the inaugural speech of Abu Bakr after assuming the position this is inshallah what we will know when we meet next time so until then fee amanillah assalamualaikum warahmatullahi wabarakatuh hey"
