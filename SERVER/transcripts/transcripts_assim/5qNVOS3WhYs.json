  "transcript": "things I broke the idols I did this and that the UNESCO even complained when I broke the idols no problem but to kill and Slaughter my own child this is what any one of us would have said and this came to him in a vision not in a revelation from jel and the vision of Messengers is a revelation and he said this is what I will do and he wanted to slaughter his son in compliance to Allah's instruction it's a test it's a trial and then you say I have calamities this is kids game what you're having compared to theirs now the 1 million pound question is why does Allah test us why Me Maybe we dare not to say it but it's always in the back of my our minds why does Allah test me my name I went once to to a a relative of mine he was over his uh 60 years of age and he was bedridden so I went to him and I said Uncle may Allah make it easy for you this Allah will expiate your sins and erase them he says my son I have no worries alhamdulillah but I have one question see I've been praying to Allah Asel five times a day in the Masjid in the first throw for the past 40 years and look at me alhamdulillah no no complaints but my question is my neighbor had never prayed a single prayer in the Masjid for the past 30 40 years we've never seen him in the Masjid and look at him he's as healthy as a horse and I said Uncle 60 years of I you're waving it away you're throwing it in the dust bin how dare you complain so when you say why me why is Allah testing me let it be known to you that no one and I repeat no one has the right to question Allah this goes without saying Allah says he is not questioned about what he does and they are each and every one of us will be questions questioned about what we do so we believe that Allah created the creation and the creation belong belongs to him so if he decided to annihilate the population of the universe can anyone ask why did you do this no one can does this and that is why the prophet said in a Hadith that if he were to admit everyone to hell he would have admitted them justly and fairly and no one has the power to question him but if he admits them all to heaven then it would be with his favor and blessing and it would be better for them than their own Good Deeds so it's all in the hands of Allah and we believe as mmin as Believers that Allah is fair and just he's never unfair or treating anyone unjustly at all so this we believe and we believe that his decree is good so one says you mean that if you walk off the podium and you're sing it for the second time third time is going to happen if I walk off this uh stage and I break my leg this is good for me yes it is good for me as long as Allah decreed it it's good now where is the good I don't know the the Dua what what was the Dua that goodness is in your hands and and evil is not attributed to your actions to you Allah does not create Pure Evil but Allah creates the actions that may lead to evil someone says what do you mean but Allah does not create evil didn't Allah create Shan is Satan evil or not huh is he he's evil but is he pure evil one thinks yeah I guess so no he's not pure evil in the sense that through Shan there will be good if you did not have night how can you value mourning if you did not have illness how can you appreciate health so with things that of contrast you value the others so you keep on looking at calamities at Trials of Allah Asel as his own decree and you have to accept this and you have to believe that Allah is fair and you have to believe that there is good into it that you may not know the prophet tells usam for those who are P undergoing illnesses and trials and tribulations the prophet says on the day of Resurrection people will wish what will you wish for on the day of judgment people will wish that their skins had been cut with scissors in this world in this dun why would anyone in his sound mind wish that on the day of judgment the prophet says when they see the reward of those who were struck with calamities now if you see someone's skin is being torn with a scissor what would you say maybe you'll vomit but would you wish that this is happening to you no on the day of judgment you would wish that because that person is being elevated and is getting lots of reward while you're saying ah I wish I did have the opportunity to gu to to get this now one of the benefits of calamities is that Allah reveals your true identity through calamities how is that well in times of prosperity and being uh uh well and healthy we're all alike we're we we are all grateful and thankful and worshiping Allah we have no problem but when Calamity strikes then things appear to have their true nature Allah says do people think that they will be left alone because they say we believe and will not be tested do you think that Allah would leave us alone saying we believe and Allah would not test us no Allah says and we indeed tested those who were before them and Allah will certainly make it known the truth of those who are true and will certainly make it known the falsehood of those who are liars Al says in times of prosperity we're all equal but when Calamity strikes then the Believers would be exposing their belief and the Hypocrites would be exposing their hypocrisy it was a 1 million pound question why does Allah test us now the two million qu uh uh uh question would be what to do when a Calamity strikes what are we supposed to do first of all in order for you to be tolerant and patient in order for you to accept Allah's testing for you you have to know first of all who is testing you is it the Headmaster is it your boss is it someone higher who's testing you who's trying you with this Calamity it's Allah and what are Allah's attributes that would would would put my heart at ease you have to know that the one who's testing you is the best of Judges he's the most merciful he did not test you to destroy you or to kill you or to eradicate you or to annihilate you from the face of the Earth he is testing you so that he would see your patience he would see your submissiveness you would display to him how sincere here in your worship you are he is testing you to hear your prayer and your supplication he's testing you to see you at his doorsteps begging for mercy he wants you to display your sincerity as a as a slave and a servant to Allah so many times people are struck financially their budget is red reduced do you think that Allah is depriving you from wealth because he's stingy Allah is the most generous look around you he's giving without any account to millions of people billions of people trillions of his creation he's giving without any account is he depriving you and preventing money from reaching you because he doesn't have any think again Allah has the wealth of the universe at his disposal and if he had given each and every one of us since time he created man till the end of time if he gave each and everyone what they requested this would not reduce his Dominion except as if you put a thread in the ocean and take it out what water is missing nothing Allah Asel prevented this from reaching you that you're wishing and hoping for because it's good for you because he wants Mercy for you because he knows that it would lead you to going astray and so many times I'm so grateful to Allah when I look at the people with the Ferraris and the Porsches and the Bentley uh and and the the big mansions and the big airplanes and the uh Bank checkbooks that are Unlimited I look at them and say ah if I had this man I would have been the best Imam I know definitely I I pay people to pray behind me come on brother this is 5,000 quid pray J for me what is this I know Allah deprived me because if I had this I would have been the worst person to walk to Earth man I would do things that I cannot even imagine in this mjid maybe outside so I know I'm grateful I'm thankful alhamdulillah have everything but if I had a little bit more I would have not been who I am so whatever Allah holds back from you you have to appreciate this now part of the means and ways to act when a Calamity strikes that you look around you and you would definitely see people who are far worse than yours than your Calamity who are far worse than your status so what's your calam I lost my job well this brother lost his job and he has hypertension uh illnesses and diabetic and he had couple of strokes and his wife ran away with his best friend and his uh daughter is doing something that is immoral and his son is a junkie selling drugs so do you have a Calamity say no alhamdulillah I'd rather not work at all so whenever you have a Calamity look at other people's calamities and you will appreciate your yours and say alhamdulillah it's not as bad as that one of the great examples is the story of his aunt was the favored wife of the Prophet the come on who was the favorite beloved wife of the Prophet who was young and he married her when she was a virgin mallah excellent knowledge Zu his mother Wasa now this is first who was the mother of Zu whose Aunt Wasa who's the sister OFA Asma and the father Abu Bakr alhamdulillah this we know so was one of the his aunt was was his mother was Asma and he was a man from quray handsome well-built beautiful he had seven children and they were all grownup men who were also handsome and Men of War and they're from quray they they have a beautiful look to them he went to visit the khif who was aldik and people say that when he was in court of this Khalifa some people gave him an evil eye wow look at this man from qur his aunt is his mother is Asma all the questions I told you and look at him how handsome he is so bang evil eye struck and it struck a bad cord in that night one of his sons went into Stables of the horses of the of the king of the Khalifa and one of the horses ran him down and killed him and the same night the doctors discovered that they had a tumor or something in his leg and they said listen we have to amputate it otherwise it's going to spread and kill you so he said okay and they gave him some intoxicants so that he would you be sedated and they can they didn't have today's modern so machines it's over no it had to do it manually until it takes took maybe half an hour so he said I will not take anything that would sedate me and take my mind away from remembering Allah but let me get in the states of Vick and tranquility and then you do whatever you wish so when they saw him come they cut his foot off while he's awake and they put it in boiling oil so that they would cut the bleeding from bleeding and it was over and then they told him about his son what did he say did he Panic did he shout did he T tear his his clothes and hit his head in the wall he said alhamdulillah he said oh Allah you gave me seven children and you took one and you gave me four Limbs and you took one oh Allah if you had taken by Allah you gave me before that and if you had tried me with this and tested me with this by Allah the previous years I've been living in prosperity and health and wealth so alhamdulillah he took his leg he kissed it and he addressed it and said by Allah Allah is my witness I never walked to any place Haram with you a can you say this to your legs to your wheels to anything nothing so this is the way that they dealt with calamities and with problems and this would make it easy for you whenever you have a Calamity try to look and analyze yourself what's your Calamity a well I lost my job okay what did Allah also test you in did he test you in in your in your health no alh I'm I'm fit as a horse did he test you in your wealth no I I still have like couple hundred thousand pounds in the bank alhamdulillah it's nothing but alhamdulillah did he test you and your children no they're fit they go to school they're happy they're practicing they're keeping the Quran so when you look at the pros and cons you find that Allah has given you so much that This calamity is so little compared to it unfortunately as human beings Allah described Us in the Quran what what is can is ungrateful only sees the shortcomings and does not see the blessings in the favors of Allah so also when you see a Calamity always be grateful to allaha that it was not greater a person with a flat tire in the middle of noon in Saudi Arabia when he goes out he says alhamdulillah why he says I can change the flat tire and then turn on the AC and as if nothing had happened when you're complaining of your car because it's a low type low class car and people are driving expensive cars look at the man on his bicycle walking by or driving through uh uh next to you say alhamdulillah I have a car he has a bicycle and if you're on a bicycle and you think that Allah did not give you look at those who don't have a bicycle and have to walk and if you're walking in the middle of the day it's hot and you're sweating and you're ungrateful look at those on their wheelchair who are unable to [Music] [Music] [Music] walk [Music] this program is sponsored by the da project"
