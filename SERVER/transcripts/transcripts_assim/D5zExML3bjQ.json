  "title": "I don't like the smell of Miswak, have I committed a sin or it is kufr? - Assim al hakeem",
  "transcript": "uh my question is uh that uh uh I started using miswa and now for the first time I used it and I smelled it so it feels different and I didn't like the smell now I am feeling like I didn't like you Sunnah or something like that did I committed any kind of scene or Comfort this is bothering me okay first of all you did not resent the siwak you resented the smell of a particular twig so maybe it had a smell maybe it changed maybe it was not the appropriate material either way you did not hate or resent the Sunnah itself what you hated was that particular twig so there's no sin in it none whatsoever and there is no kufur in it of course with the grace of Allah because you're a Believer why would you doubt your Islam for an intrusive thought and I get this a lot a lot of those who have counseling sessions insist that they've committed an act of koforoshirk and when you investigate they're suffering from anxiety attacks panic attacks and when you ask them you find that it's all nonsense you're a Muslim by default why would I get you out of the fold of Islam simply because of a doubt that that doesn't make any sense certainty is not impacted by doubt bring me solid evidence tell me that yes I hate the Sunnah of siwak I resent it I don't consider it part of the Deen I condemn it I make fun of it I said oh whoa whoa whoa whoa now you're out of the fall of Islam but simply because of you disliking the smell of it it's like someone drinking zamzam and he says that I don't like drinking zamzam why he says because the taste is a little bit salty I don't like the taste would I take him out of the field of Islam No would I say that he's sinful no Sheikh he doesn't like the taste of zamzam so this is something that is related to his own preference he did not reject a Sunnah or something from the Deen and this is why one of the scholars was asked once oh Sheikh why is zamzam not tasty seriously when you drink zamzam it's not that tasty that you would enjoy drinking it wherever you are so the scholar said it is not tasty so that Allah would know who drinks it out of the sheer love of the Sunnah nowadays we drink zamzam if you tell me if I give you puree water or Evian or whatever these fancy water sparkling or non congas or Singas as they say in Spain would I say this or that or would I choose zamzam in a blink of an eye I would choose Samsung and I nowadays find it tastier than anything else because I drink only zamzam and I'm used to it and I love it and I believe in its virtues I cannot condemn people who do not share this with me and Allah Knows Best"
