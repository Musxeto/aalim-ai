  "transcript": "persuasion to other than Allah is not considered and was permissible for the previous Nations and was even practiced by the prophets in fact the Quran cleared about Allah's order to the angels to prostrate to Adam please comment on this statement this statement is not true in what it aims at however it is true in its particular points so the introduction is completely false when you say that procession to others to other than Allah is not the citizenship this is by the consensus of all Scholars is false however it was permissible in previous religions to prostrate to that their elders and their rulers as in the case mentioned in Surat Yusuf is be upon him in the Quran where his siblings fell on the ground prostrating to him and this was the form of greeting yet not everything that was permissible in previous religions must be permissible in our religion on the contrary Scholars say what was permissible in other religions must be cross-examined with the Quran and the Sunnah to verify whether it is permissible in our religion is the Islam or not for example working for him in the usual make for him statues and we know that taking statues in Islam so this was in their religion permissible however in our religion it is not permissible as for the issue of the Angels being ordered to prostrate to Adam and this is not considered to be shirk this is true who ordered them to prostrate to Adam it is Allah do you expect an angel to say sorry Allah I'm not gonna prostrate because this is not frustrating his blasphemy and this is why when Satan was instructed to prostrate alongside with the angels when he refused to do this he was doomed in Hell forever and likewise Allah who instructed the angels to prostrate to Adam forbade us from frustrating to anyone else but him and in the authentic Hadith with him came back from one of his journeys and I believe it was to Yemen he attempted to prostrate to the prophet Allah from doing this instead what are you doing Mars said o prophets of Allah I've seen the Christians greet their rulers in this way so I wanted to greet you in this way and he said don't ever do such a thing because if I were to instruct someone to prostrate to someone else other than Allah I would have instructed the wife to prostate to her husband and this is how important and great the role of a husband is to his wife and Allah foreign"
