  "transcript": "[Questioner] from the Emirates Sheikh I want \nto know that if anybody becomes new Muslim like   me do I must have an Imam to follow because what \nI understand from your education I actually follow   you most of the time and it's more logic and \nsensible to me so so who is your Imam so maybe I   can follow so basically Heidi what we tell people \nand this is very logical if a person is a Layman   like myself in car mechanics and I \nhave a problem with the engine I do not   go to six or seven workshops asking \nthem what's wrong with my car and then   pay a cherry pick whatever I think is most likely \nand Just Go With It usually I have a trusted   Workshop that I've been working with for so many \nyears and he deals with everything likewise when   it comes to Physicians and doctors I don't go to \nsix or seven hospitals to diagnose the pain I have   in my stomach I go to one I trust one is credible \none is well known and trusted and I follow him   otherwise I would be wasting my time and putting \nmyself In Harm's Way Islam is nothing different   in Islam either you're a scholar and a person of \nknowledge who's capable of knowing the ruling by   yourself through the Quran and the Sunnah with the \nunderstanding of the favorite three generations   how you've studied it you've worked hard to \ngain knowledge that enables you to do this   this is a scholar number two a student of \nknowledge someone who did study but not as much   as a scholar and he is capable of distinguishing \nthe different opinions of Scholars and selecting   the most authentic one according to his knowledge \nso yes he's not a physician he's not a doctor but   he is a medical student that had spent seven or \neight years in college and can't tell whether this   Sheikh or that whether this physician or doctor \nis saying the truth according to science or not   the third category is the vast majority of \nMuslims like you Heidi they do not possess   the knowledge if I present you with an Arabic \nstatement you wouldn't be able to tell whether   this is a verse of a Quran or a Hadith from \nthe Sunnah or a random quote from a book   so you should Depend and rely on a \nscholar that you trust his knowledge   that you trust his moral conduct that you think \nand believe that this guy is not changing his   colors to the highest bidder he doesn't change \nhis opinions every couple of years and said whoops   okay I'm switching to this platform no I think \nthat this is better and this is and he keeps uh um   hopping from one opinion to the other and at the \nend of the day I'm confused what are you exactly   so you have to stick with someone \nthat fits the criteria we usually   tell people stick with Sheikh Bin Baz, \nSheikh Ibn Othaimeen, Sheikh Al Albani these are the trusted top three Scholars of our \ncontemporary time may Allah have mercy on their   souls they're dead so they can't be influenced \nby others and their track record is perfect   almost this is what we tell people to follow \npick one of them and stick to that if not then   choose someone that you think that these criteria \nfit them and insha Allah you'll be saved as well"
