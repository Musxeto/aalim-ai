  "transcript": "Baysan from Jordan Assalamu Alaikum Sheikh Alaikum Salam to Allah Sheikh, I want, I'm looking for a job as a teacher, English teacher for the girl students And there is a woman who will be a mediator between me and a man who is responsible for these things So I will be a reason for many callings and many attachments and she will connect too much with this man So I want to ask if the job will be haram because I will be a reason for many communication between these two persons The job, listen to me Baysan, the job is halal because you are teaching women, you are teaching girls So your job description is halal What this woman is doing is sinful for herself You did not force her, you did not put a gun to her head And with you or without you she is freely mixing with men and communicating with them So there is nothing wrong in you getting the job through her and Allah Azzawajal knows best"
